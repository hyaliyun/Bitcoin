James Harold Atherton was the sole proprieter and works manager from 1903 until 1918. The 6½ hp (5 kW) two-cylinder engine was controlled by variable-lift inlet valves. It was promoted as \\"the Mercedes of the tri-car world\\". The company also produced motorcycles in 1904-1905. The Addison touring car and tri-car were shown and well-received by The Motor at the ninth Liverpool Motor Show. The Addison tri-car won a silver medal at a hill- climbing contest held by the University of Liverpool Motor Club on July 13, 1905. In January 1912, it was reported that the company was so successful that they had to open a separate showroom at 7 Berry Street in Liverpool for their Alldays and Phoenix cars. Another car the company sold was the Speedwell. Around 1922, the company expanded to a larger garage.

(PFBC), also known as familial idiopathic basal ganglia calcification (FIBGC) and Fahr's disease, is a rare, genetically dominant, inherited neurological disorder characterized by abnormal deposits of calcium in areas of the brain that control movement. Through the use of CT scans, calcifications are seen primarily in the basal ganglia and in other areas such as the cerebral cortex. Signs and symptoms Symptoms of this disease include deterioration of motor functions and speech, seizures, and other involuntary movement. Other symptoms are headaches, dementia, and vision impairment. Characteristics of Parkinson's Disease are also similar to PFBC. The disease usually manifests itself in the third to fifth decade of life but may appear in childhood or later in life.Sobrido MJ, Hopfer S, Geschwind DH (2007) \\"Familial idiopathic basal ganglia calcification.\\" In: Pagon RA, Bird TD, Dolan CR, Stephens K, editors. SourceGeneReviews [Internet]. Seattle (WA): University of Washington, Seattle; 1993–2004 It usually presents with clumsiness, fatigability, unsteady gait, slow or slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, involuntary movements or muscle cramping. Seizures of various types are common. Neuropsychiatric symptoms, which may be the first or the most prominent manifestations, range from mild difficulty with concentration and memory to changes in personality and/or behavior, to psychosis and dementia. Causes This condition can be inherited in an autosomal dominant or recessive fashion. Several genes has been associated with this condition =Mutation= A locus at 14q has been suggested, but no gene has been identified. A second locus has been identified on chromosome 8 and a third has been reported on chromosome 2. This suggests there may be some genetic heterogeneity in this disease. A mutation in the gene encoding the type III sodium dependent phosphate transporter 2 (SLC20A2) located on chromosome 8 has been reported. Biochemical evidence suggests that phosphate transport may be involved in this disease. Two other genes have been associated with this condition: PDGFB on chromosome 22 and PDGFRB on chromosome 5.Westenberger A1, Klein C (2014) The genetics of primary familial brain calcifications. Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep 14(10):490 doi: 10.1007/s11910-014-0490-4 These genes are biochemically linked: PDGFRB encodes the platelet-derived growth factor receptor β and PDGFB encodes the ligand of PDGF-Rβ. These genes are active during angiogenesis to recruit pericytes which suggests that alterations in the blood brain barrier may be involved in the pathogenesis of this condition. A fourth gene associated with this condition is XPR1. This gene is the long arm of located on chromosome 1 (1q25.3). Another gene that has been associated with this condition is MYORG.Arkadir D, Lossos A, Rahat D, Abu Snineh M, Schueler-Furman O, Nitschke S, Minassian BA, Sadaka Y, Lerer I, Tabach Y, Meiner V (2018) MYORG is associated with recessive primary familial brain calcification.

Neuron 98(6):1116-1123 This gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 9 (9p13.3). This gene is associated with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern in this condition. Another gene junctional adhesion molecule 2 (JAM2) has been associated with an autosomal recessive form of this condition.Cen Z, Chen Y, Chen S, Wang H, Yang D, Zhang H, Wu H, Wang L, Tang S, Ye J, Shen J, Wang H, Fu F, Chen X, Xie F, Liu P, Xu X, Cao J, Cai P, Pan Q1,12, Li J, Yang W, Shan PF, Li Y, Liu JY, Zhang B, Luo W (2019) Biallelic loss-of-function mutations in JAM2 cause primary familial brain calcification. Brain Other genes that have been associated with this condition are Junctional adhesion molecule C (JAM3) and Occludin (OCLN). =Differential diagnosis= Basal ganglia calcification may occur as a consequence of several other known genetic conditions and these have to be excluded before a diagnosis can be made. Pathology The most commonly affected region of the brain is the lenticular nucleus and in particular the internal globus pallidus. Calcifications in the caudate, dentate nuclei, putamen and thalami are also common. Occasionally calcifications begin or predominate in regions outside the basal ganglia. Calcification seems to be progressive, since calcifications are generally more extensive in older individuals and an increase in calcification can sometimes be documented on follow up of affected subjects. As well as the usual sites the cerebellar gyri, brain stem, centrum semiovale and subcortical white matter may also be affected. Diffuse atrophic changes with dilatation of the subarachnoid space and/or ventricular system may coexist with the calcifications. Histologically concentric calcium deposits within the walls of small and medium-sized arteries are present. Less frequently the veins may also be affected. Droplet calcifications can be observed along capillaries. These deposits may eventually lead to closure of the lumina of vessels. The pallidal deposits stain positively for iron. Diffuse gliosis may surround the large deposits but significant loss of nerve cells is rare. On electron microscopy the mineral deposits appear as amorphous or crystalline material surrounded by a basal membrane. Calcium granules are seen within the cytoplasm of neuronal and glial cells. The calcifications seen in this condition are indistinguishable from those secondary to hypoparathyroidism or other causes. Diagnosis In addition to the usual routine haematologic and biochemical investigations, the serum calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, alkaline phosphatase, calcitonin and parathyroid hormone should also be measured. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) should be examined to exclude bacteria, viruses and parasites. The Ellsworth Howard test (a 10-20 fold increase of urinary cyclic AMP excretion following stimulation with 200 micromoles of parathyroid hormone) may be worth doing also. Serology for toxoplasmosis is also indicated. Brain CT scan is the preferred method of localizing and assessing the extent of cerebral calcifications. Elevated levels of copper, iron, magnesium and zinc but not calcium have been reported in the CSF but the significance of this finding — if any — is not known. The diagnosis requires the following criteria be met: # the presence of bilateral calcification of the basal ganglia # the presence of progressive neurologic dysfunction # the absence of an alternative metabolic, infectious, toxic or traumatic cause # a family history consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance The calcification is usually identified on CT scan but may be visible on plain films of the skull. Management There is currently no cure for PFBC nor a standard course of treatment. The available treatment is directed symptomatic control. If parkinsonian features develop, there is generally poor response to levodopa therapy. Case reports have suggested that haloperidol or lithium carbonate may help with psychotic symptoms. One case report described an improvement with the use of a bisphosphonate. Prognosis The prognosis for any individual with PFBC is variable and hard to predict. There is no reliable correlation between age, extent of calcium deposits in the brain, and neurological deficit. Since the appearance of calcification is age-dependent, a CT scan could be negative in a gene carrier who is younger than the age of 55. Progressive neurological deterioration generally results in disability and death. History The disease was first noted by German pathologist Karl Theodor Fahr in 1930. A less common name for the condition is Chavany-Brunhes syndrome and Fritsche's syndrome, the former named after Jacques Brunhes, Jean Alfred Émile Chavany, while the later named after R. Fritsche.http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/GARD/QnA.aspx?PageID=4&CaseID;=22373&DiseaseID;=8272 Fewer than 20 families had been reported in the literature up to 1997.

It debuted in 1978 with a studio recording of the songs, before premiering on stage in 1979. Several of its songs have passed into mainstream Francophone pop culture, and helped original cast members Daniel Balavoine and Diane Dufresne to rise in popularity in France; it is now considered one of the most famous rock operas in French history. An English version with lyrics by Tim Rice, titled Tycoon, premiered with the release of a studio recording in 1992, which starred Kim Carnes, Celine Dion, Nina Hagen, Peter Kingsbery, Cyndi Lauper, Willy DeVille, and Tom Jones. Genesis In 1978, its first recording was released (in French), sub-titled Starmania, ou la passion de Johnny Rockfort selon les évangiles télévisés (\\"Starmania, or the Passion of Johnny Rockfort According to the Televised Gospels\\") with the leading roles filled by Daniel Balavoine, Claude Dubois, Diane Dufresne, Nanette Workman, France Gall, Eric Esteve and Fabienne Thibeault. In 1979 the show was given its theatrical debut in Paris, starring Balavoine, Étienne Chicot, Dufresne, Gall, and Thibeault, followed by Canadian productions in 1980 and 1986 and French revivals in 1988 and throughout the 1990s. The 1980 Canadian production had a cast that included France Castel, Louise Forestier, Gilles Valiquette, and Martine St- Clair.\\"Starmania back, better than ever\\". The Globe and Mail, September 10, 1980. Céline Dion recorded several songs from the musical on her 1991 album Dion chante Plamondon. In 1992, an English version of the show was created with the release of the album Tycoon, with lyrics by Tim Rice, and starring Kim Carnes, Celine Dion, Nina Hagen, Peter Kingsbery, Cyndi Lauper, Willy Deville, and Tom Jones in the principal roles on the recording. The American premiere of Tycoon, with English lyrics, was produced at the UTEP Dinner Theatre in El Paso, Texas in 1996, with Plamondon in attendance. It was staged in Paris alternatively with the French version for a few months. In 2004, Starmania was honoured as a MasterWork by the Audio-Visual Preservation Trust of Canada. A revival is set to premiere at the La Seine Musicale in Boulogne- Billancourt, from October 6, 2020. Brief plot outline In the near future, Monopolis, the capital of the recently united Occident, is terrorized by the Black Stars, a gang headed by Johnny Rockfort, who dances to the tune of Sadia, a student-agitator, originally from the upper crust, who cross-dresses at night and descends into the underground to hand out orders. They meet at the Underground Café, under the amused gaze of Marie-Jeanne, the robotic waitress. Above this underground café stands the Golden Tower, a 121-floor building, the top of which is the office of Zéro Janvier, a billionaire getting into politics by running for the presidency of the Occident. He bases his electoral campaign on a return to order and on the construction of the new atomic world. Zéro Janvier thus becomes the sworn enemy of Johnny Rockfort and the Black Stars. It is in this framework that three parallel love affairs take shape and come undone: the impossible love of Marie-Jeanne for Ziggy, a young androgynous and mythomaniac record dealer; the sensational romance of Zéro Janvier and Stella Spotlight, a sex symbol who has just said farewell to the silver screen; and the passion of Johnny Rockfort and Cristal, a true nexus of the plot. Cristal, the host and star of a TV show called “Starmania,” gets a call from Sadia offering her a clandestine interview with Johnny Rockfort, whose face no one knows. The get-together takes place at the Underground Café. For Cristal and Johnny, it is love at first sight. They go off together; therefore, Sadia has lost her hold over Johnny. Cristal decides to become the spokeswoman for the Black Stars, transmitting pirate messages by means of a neutron camera that lets her take over television frequencies. Sadia, furious with jealousy, denounces Johnny and Cristal to Zéro Janvier on the evening that he is celebrating his engagement with Stella Spotlight at Naziland, a gigantic revolving discothèque above Monopolis. The Black Stars have chosen this very evening to set off a bomb in the Golden Tower. Zéro Janvier's men hunt the Black Stars. Cristal is hit and dies in Johnny's arms. The shadow of Johnny Rockfort will darken the victory of Zéro Janvier, elected president of the Occident.

Yellow regions are lifted above the sand and in motion at the time of the photo, while green regions are in static contact with the sand. Blue denotes tracks. Scale imprints are visible in the tracks, showing that the snake's body is static during ground contact. Tracks of a sidewinder in the sand. Sidewinding is a type of locomotion unique to caenophidian snakes, used to move across loose or slippery substrates. It is most often used by the Saharan horned viper, Cerastes cerastes, the Mojave sidewinder rattlesnake, Crotalus cerastes, and the Namib desert sidewinding adder, Bitis peringueyi, to move across loose desert sands, and it is also used by Homalopsine snakes in Southeast Asia to move across tidal mud flats. Any number of caenophidian snakes can be induced to sidewind on smooth surfaces, though their difficulty in getting them to do so and their proficiency at it vary greatly. The method of movement is derived from lateral undulation, and is very similar, in spite of appearances. A picture of a snake performing lateral undulation would show something like a sine wave, with straight segments of the body having either a positive or negative slope. Sidewinding is accomplished by undulating vertically as well as laterally, with the head tracing out an ellipse in a vertical plane nearly perpendicular to the direction of movement and with all the segments that have a significantly non-zero slope (and alternating segments that have a zero slope) lifted off the ground. In the resultant movement, the snake's body is always in static (as opposed to sliding) contact when touching the ground. The head seems to be \\"thrown\\" forward, and the body follows, being lifted from the prior position and moved forward to lie on the ground ahead of where it was originally. Meanwhile, the head is being thrown forward again. In this way, the snake slowly progresses at an angle, leaving a series of mostly straight, J-shaped tracks. Because the snake's body is in static contact with the ground, without slip, imprints of the belly scales can be seen in the tracks, and each track is almost exactly as long as the snake. Sidewinder rattlesnakes can use sidewinding to ascend sandy slopes by increasing the portion of the body in contact with the sand to match the reduced yielding force of the inclined sand, allowing them to ascend up to the maximum possible sand slope without slip. Implementing this control scheme in a snakebot capable of sidewinding allowed the robot to replicate the success of the snakes. A crude animated line-drawing showing the locomotor pattern of sidewinding. The light brown areas are the tracks left behind, and also indicate where the body of the snake touched the ground. One can determine the line of movement of the snake by drawing a line connecting either the right or left tips of the tracks.

The Ader car was built in Levallois-Perret, Seine, by his Société Industrielle des Téléphones-Voitures Système Ader between 1900 and 1907. The company first built bicycles in 1869 and tried steam powered aeroplanes between 1890 and 1897. In 1900 the first car was made with a V-twin engine of 904 cc and chain drive. In 1901 shaft drive was introduced along with a four cylinder car where the engine was essentially two of the V-twins coupled together. Two of the four-cylinder engines were joined to make a 3616 cc V-8 which was fitted to a car that ran in the 1903 Paris- Madrid race. That year Ader listed twin-cylinder cars of 904 cc and 1571 cc, as well as four-cylinder ones of 1810 cc and 3142 cc; each was available in a wide range of coachwork. A 24 hp vertical four was introduced in December 1903 at the Paris Salon. A new company was formed in 1905 to separate car building activities from the other activities and registered as Société Ader. The factory was located at 40 bis Avenue de Suffren, Paris. The V engines were dropped in favour of the vertical ones in 1907 but this was the final year cars were made though the V-4 engines were made for supplying to other car and boat makers for a few years. The Ader car was sold in the United Kingdom as the Pegasus. In 1903 the company also made a shaft-driven motorcycle sold as the Moto-Cardan.

The network's programming consists of family dramas, comedies, youth-oriented reality shows, shows on crime and television films. StarPlus became the third most watched channel across all genres with TRP of 954,864 impressions during week 39 ratings in October 2020. History When it was first launched on 21 February 1992, StarPlus was an English language entertainment television channel showing international television shows from the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, with Zee TV being the Hindi-language counterpart. On July 2000, after Star ended its relationship with Zee TV, Star Plus was transformed into a Hindi-language channel, with Star World becoming the network's English-language counterpart channel and the company's CEO Sameer Nair and programming chief Tarun Katial introduced a number of new shows, which helped to solidify the channel's position as the leader in the Hindi-language television broadcasting area. It launched in the United States in November 2004. The channel's high-definition feed was launched on 15 April 2011. It carries the same schedule as the SD feed, but with different commercials. Star Plus HD was set to launch in both the United Kingdom and Ireland by the end of 2011,Star Plus UK to launch HD Channel – http://media247.co.uk/bizasia/newsarchive/2011/02/exclusive_star_5.php but it was delayed until 5 July 2012.Star Plus HD UK date confirmed – http://www.media247.co.uk/bizasia/star-plus-hd-to-launch-in-july-in-uk On 6 October 2017, Canada's ATN Channel lost rights to Star programming, with viewers directed to the new streaming service Hotstar, which was recently introduced in the Canadian market. On 4 January 2019, Star similarly shut down its linear channels in the United States, in favour of the Hotstar service. =Rebranding= On 12 July 2010, it underwent a rebranding along with a change from the blue rectangular logo to a ruby red star with the tagline \\"Rishta Wahi, Soch Nayi\\". On 7 October 2016, it underwent a rebranding with the tagline \\"Nayi Soch\\". In May 2018, it underwent a rebranding with Alia Bhatt as the face of the campaign with the red crystal star with gold swoosh along with the tagline \\"Rishta Wahi, Baath Nayi\\" and signature song composed by A. R. Rahman. Reception In the early 2000s, StarPlus was at third position in terms of revenue and viewership after Zee TV and Sony Entertainment Television while none of the series were in top 10. With the launch of Indian Hindi version of Kaun Banega Crorepati, hosted by Amitabh Bachchan, the series became an instant hit becoming number one show followed by the launch of Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi, in the same day which became second most watched after it which soon beat the latter to number one position while Star Plus soon became the most watched channel. This followed Kahani Ghar Ghar Kii in October 2000 and later Kasautii Zindagi Kay a year after it and many more produced under Balaji Telefilms which made Star Plus to achieve the highest viewership during that time making the channel at number one position since. Most of the series (80-90%) aired in the channel during that period were produced by Balaji Telefilms. 70% of the revenue for the production house was obtained from Star then. After 2006, their top rated shows started to decline in viewership and were axed one by one by the channel. However, during 2008, differences arouse between Star India and Balaji due to termination of their serials over declining ratings, cancellation of joint venture for regional content in South India and as a result the agreement of Balaji buying Star's stake was terminated. Both suffered some downfall after it. However, after two years, they patched up and Tere Liye was the show produced after it in 2010. During the slight downfall in viewership in the end of 2000's the number one position dominated by it for nine years continuously was beaten by the rival channel Colors TV in April 2009 for the first time pushing it to second position. During last week of May 2009, it was beaten by Zee TV for the first time in nine years, pushing it to third position. Programming =Programming block= In 3 April 2017, it brought back its afternoon programming which was shut down some years ago with the launch of 4 new soap operas from 12:30 pm to 2:30 pm (IST). It was later extended up to 3:00 pm with Love Ka Hai Intezaar in May 2017 but was again made 2 hours from 1:00 pm to 3:00 pm as the soap Tu Sooraj Main Saanjh Piyaji was shifted to prime time. Due to low ratings than expected, it was cancelled by the channel in September 30 in the same year. It was during that year, Star Plus which always remained in top three was positioned at seventh place in top 10 Indian GEC channels (urban+rural) and with fourth position in Hindi GEC channels, which is the first time it had a decline this much. Star Parivaar Awards The Star Parivaar Awards is an award presented for the various characters and programs of the channel under various categories annually by the channel, held usually during mid of the year. It was produced by Anil Jha and Sol productions. The first ceremony was held on 3 July 2003 at Mumbai. The award ceremony which used to be held annually since 2003 was not held since 2019.

The series was a Canada-France co-production between Nelvana and Carrere Group for France's M6 and the Canada-based channel Teletoon. The show aired on Nickelodeon and Nicktoons Network in the U.S. The show focuses on Willy Zilla, an ordinary timid teenage boy just trying to be a normal person, despite being the son of a flamboyant, rich, lively celebrity rock star named Rock Zilla. Production Gene Simmons wanted to create a cartoon series with a loud rock star for his kids. The idea of the cartoon started off when Gene's son, Nick in his kindergarten days, brought in a picture of Gene drooling blood and spitting fire for a project of what his parents do, which may have influenced the character of Willy Zilla. Before becoming a series, it became a book called \\"My Dad the Rock Star: Rebel without a Nose Ring\\" in 2001. Because Gene loved Nelvana shows, he called them for a cartoon idea. It was originally supposed to be about the band KISS itself, but it was later changed to a family of rock-star parents, which were based on Gene's family. Rock Zilla is actually a fictionalized version of Gene Simmons himself, counting his signature \\"long-tongue\\". Gene himself chose Lawrence Bayne as the voice for the character. Willy is based on Gene's son, Nick, and Serenity was based on Gene's daughter, Sophie. Crystal was also based on Gene's wife, Shannon Tweed, who, being Canadian, helped Gene to get Nelvana to make the show. Gene served as the executive producer and creator, while the rest of the production was done in Canada. The series went on hiatus after the episode \\"Blind Date\\", until it was announced that the show ended, despite popular ratings, possibly for Gene to continue his music career. Also, there was an unaired episode that showcases Alyssa's true rapping skills, named \\"Silent Springs' Most Wanted\\" (which is a reference to the movie Malibu's Most Wanted), but it never got the chance to air. It was never revived in time to air a third season.  Cast  = Main = * Joanne Vannicola – William \\"Willy\\" Zilla – The show's protagonist – Rock and Crystal's son and Serenity's little brother. Willy never had a normal life when he was on tour with his family until he came to Silent Springs. Throughout the series, Willy gradually becomes more comfortable in who he is and accepts his new, more normal lifestyle. Willy aspires to be a musician like his father and grandfather (see below), and has inherited their musical talent. Willy's music of choice is jazz, and plays the trumpet in the school band. He realizes that he was living a normal life the whole time with his family and he doesn't have to be literally normal. * Lawrence Bayne – Rockford Amadeus \\"Rock\\" Zilla – The titular character. Rock has loved rock n roll since birth. Even though Rock is the father of the family, he is very immature and behaves like a teenager. His own father is a famous classical cellist who still does not quite understand him. Despite this, Rock cares for his family very much and goes out of his way to be a decent father. * Kathy Laskey – Crystal Zilla – Serenity and Willy's mother. Crystal is a pink-haired spiritualist. * Stephanie Anne Mills – Serenity Zilla – Willy's older sister and Rock and Crystal's daughter. Serenity is the stereotypical teenage girl: spoiled, boy-crazy, egotistical and ditzy. She picks on Willy and easily gets lost in the mansion. Despite this, she does have a kind side, one of those examples can be shown when she grew attached to the elderly residents in the senior's home in the episode \\"Rock Bottom\\". She can also be supportive of her brother at times. * Don Francks – Nigel \\"Skunk\\" Fanshawe – Ex-driver of the Zilla tour bus, friend/manager of the family. Skunk is from England and has a long two-toned ponytail, hence his name. Skunk is often the voice of reason for the Zilla's. He uses the tour bus, permanently parked on the mansion's grounds, as his apartment. * Sarah Gadon – Alyssa – Willy's sarcastic best friend, and eventually girlfriend. She is an environmental activist. * Martin Villafana – Quincy – Willy's other best friend. Prefers to be called \\"Q\\". His father is an accountant, and is often known to be narrow minded. * Rob Stefaniuk – Robert \\"Buzz\\" Sawchuck – Lloyd's son and Willy's school bully. Although brutish and violent, Buzz often speaks in the manner of a Shakespearian actor, making long-winded speeches and monologues. Buzz has a crush on Alyssa, which is not reciprocated. * Jim Millington – Principal Malfactor – A strict disciplinarian, with a particular dislike for Willy and his father. He once tried to have music class removed from school, and to have Willy expelled. Both times, he was foiled by Rock's intervention. Bears an uncanny resemblance to Ed Sullivan. * Dwight Schultz – Mr. Kant – The Zillas' next door neighbour. He utterly despises Rock for all the chaos he causes, but has a soft spot for Willy. He has a cat and dog, Helga and Henderson, who are friends with Mosh. =Supporting= * Mosh – The Zilla's lovable purple-and- green pet Komodo dragon. Meant only to be a stage gimmick for Rock's performances, the family could not bear to send him away when it didn't work out, and so adopted him as the family pet. * Ms. Zachwiss – A strict teacher at Willy's school. * Scoop – A reporter who harasses Rock Zilla, it's revealed that years ago Rock was about to be interviewed by Scoop until he accidentally ate a mint from his table. This upset Rock so much that he refused to go onstage causing an uproar. Scoop was fired for this, destroying his career because no one would hire him and now harasses and stalks Rock and the Zilla family to get back at him. * Lloyd Sawchuck – Buzz's father and the head of the school board. Also a loyal fan of Rock's music, and has all his albums. * Angela D'Angelo - The first girl Willy ever fell in love with. Her parents are extremely over-protective and disapprove of Rock Zilla so much that when they learned that Willy was Rock's son, they moved to Alaska to get away from him.

DVD releases On September 20, 2006, the series released, \\"Dad's Debut\\", which contained the first six episodes of the first season: \\"Welcome to Silent Springs\\", \\"Zilla House of Horrors\\", \\"Mr. Zilla's Opus\\", \\"High Infidelity\\", \\"Angela D'Angelo\\", and \\"The Candidate\\". On April 7, 2009, a second volume was released, \\"Off The Hook\\", which contained the next 5 episodes of the first season: \\"Willy Unplugged\\", \\"Dance Party\\", \\"Psychic Convention\\", \\"Call of the Wild\\", and \\"Mr Big\\". Reception Common Sense Media rated the show a 4 out of 5 stars, stating, \\"My Dad the Rock Star actually offers positive social messages, although they're subtle and blended in with wit and irony. Willy is perfectly happy with his slightly goofy, non- rock star self, and so are his friends, a pair of cool kids who aren't bowled over by either the Zillas' fame or fortune. These friends are loyal, and so is Willy, who may not always approve of his family but never fails to back them up. At its core, My Dad the Rock Star is a simple cartoon about the difficulties of staying yourself and still fitting in. It's fun to indulge the fantasy of the childlike parent and mature child – and the lifestyle that goes with crazy money – but the series' point is always that even though Willy could have anything in the world, what he wants most is to stay put and lead a normal life with his friends.\\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/tv-reviews/my- dad-the-rock-star References External links * Category:2003 French television series debuts Category:2004 French television series endings Category:2000s French animated television series Category:French children's animated comedy television series Category:2003 Canadian television series debuts Category:2004 Canadian television series endings Category:2000s Canadian animated television series Category:Canadian children's animated comedy television series Category:Teletoon original programming Category:Television series by Nelvana ","title":"My Dad the Rock Star"},{"id":"850838","text":"Lauan may refer to: * Lauan (tree), several varieties of tree known as Philippine mahogany * Lauan ground skink, a species of lizard found on the Lau Islands of Fiji * Lauan language, a language spoken in East Fiji * Lauan plywood, decorative plywood made with Philippine mahogany  See also  * Luan (disambiguation) ","title":"Lauan"},{"id":"850846","text":"Almon may refer to: People *Almon (surname) Places ;United States *Almon, Georgia, an unincorporated community *Almon, Wisconsin, a town **Almon (community), Wisconsin, an unincorporated community Other *Any of several species of tree of genus Shorea *Almon, Mateh Binyamin, also known as Anatot, an Israeli settlement in the West Bank *Almon (river), a river that was the mythological parent of Larunda in Roman myth ","title":"Almon"},{"id":"850850","title":"Mark Strong"},{"id":"850852","text":"Soyuz TM-9 was the ninth expedition to the Russian Space Station Mir.The mission report is available here: http://www.spacefacts.de/mission/english/soyuz-TM-9.htm Crew Mission highlights During docking, cosmonauts aboard Mir noticed that three of the eight thermal blankets (layers of foil vacuum-shield insulation) on the descent module of the approaching Soyuz-TM 9 spacecraft had come loose from their attachments near the heat shield, yet remained attached at their top ends. The main concern was that the capsule might cool down, permitting condensation to form inside and short out its electrical systems. There was also fear that the blankets might block the infrared vertical sensor, which oriented the module for reentry. Three other areas of concern emerged: that the explosive bolts binding the service module to the descent module might fail to work after direct exposure to space, that the heat shield might be compromised by direct space exposure, and that an EVA to repair the blankets might cause additional damage. Consideration was given to flying Soyuz TM-10 with one cosmonaut aboard as a rescue mission. During an EVA, the cosmonauts folded back two of the three blankets and left the third alone. During reentry, the cosmonauts ejected both the orbital module and the service module simultaneously in an effort to minimize the chances that a blanket could snag. Normally the orbital module went first. The descent module suffered no damage as a result of its prolonged exposure to space conditions. Reentry occurred as normal.

He was thought to have founded the first permanent settlement in present-day West Virginia at Cool Spring Farm.http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=12798 Morgan Cabin Marker Biography =Early life= Little direct evidence of Morgan's early life and education have survived. His birth date seems to have been November 1st, 1688 because Morgans Chapel at Bunker Hill, which he helped to found, recorded the following upon his death: \\"Colonel Morgan died November 17, 1766 aged 78 years November 1st.\\" No British records have been found of where he was born or when or how he came to America, but according to American records he seems to have been born in Glamorganshire, Wales during the reign of William III. =Emigration to America= Morgan Morgan emigrated to the America as a single man at the age of 24, probably during the last years of the reign of Queen Anne. Arriving in Delaware in about 1712 or 1713, he soon afterward got married, but no record of the date has been found. Morgan commenced business as a merchant at the place now known as Christiana. Some Quaker records record that Morgan Morgan was educated at Cambridge University and went to Delaware as Crown Council. In 1713, Morgan married Catherine Garretson in what is now New Castle County, Delaware. Their first child, James, was born in the fall of 1715, and this is recorded in the church register. Morgan evidently arrived with some money and had a very respectable social standing, for the early records list him as a merchant and tailor, and in 1717 he was appointed as executor of the will of the Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania. At that time what we now know as Delaware was a part of Pennsylvania. Since the trade guilds were very strong in England, one wonders if he learned the tailoring trade in London, from his father, or if he bypassed the law in the new country and started a combined mercantile and tailoring business. As well as working there as a merchant, he was also a magistrate. He has been claimed to have been an ordained Church of England clergyman, and one who established a church in Westminster County in 1727, but there is no evidence to support this. Morgan is often incorrectly cited as having arrived at present-day West Virginia in 1727, although he was still living in Delaware at that time, acting as the coroner of New Castle County. His first land transaction on record dates from November 20, 1723, when he bought for the price of 70 pounds. Almost the whole of this land was cultivable. In 1924, a committee appointed by the Governor of West Virginia determined that the first crude shelter erected by William G. Morgan Great Grandson of Morgan Morgan was built on the Morgan Acres property. =Claim of first settlement in West Virginia= Morgan Morgan arrived in what is now West Virginia in 1731. In January 1734, he, among others, was appointed to the 'Commission of the Peace', meaning that he was a magistrate. He probably received a Patent for '[i]n the Forks of the Rappahannock River & Westwood of Sherrando River' on December 12, 1734. The long-standing claim that he was the first permanent resident there is, however, doubtful. In fact, the area now known as Shepherdstown, West Virginia, was probably settled by German-speaking immigrants as early as 1727. Morgan died at Bunker Hill, Berkeley County, now in West Virginia, and was buried in the Morgan Chapel Graveyard. Family Morgan Morgan held military and civil positions in colonial Virginia which entitled his female descendants to membership in the Colonial Dames of America. Col.

In terms of its structure, the molecule can be described as two benzoyl (, Bz) groups connected by a peroxide (). It is a white granular solid with a faint odour of benzaldehyde, poorly soluble in water but soluble in acetone, ethanol, and many other organic solvents. Benzoyl peroxide is an oxidizer, which is principally used as in the production of polymers. As a bleach, it has been used as a medication and a water disinfectant. In specialized contexts, the name may be abbreviated as BPO. As a medication, benzoyl peroxide is mostly used to treat acne, either alone or in combination with other treatments. Some versions are sold mixed with antibiotics such as clindamycin. It is on the WHO List of Essential Medicines, and, in the US, it is available as an over-the- counter and generic medication. It is also used in dentistry for teeth whitening. Benzoyl peroxide is also used for bleaching flour, hair, and textiles It is also used in the plastics industry. History Benzoyl peroxide was first prepared and described by Liebig in 1858. It was the first organic peroxide prepared intentionally. In 1901, J. H. Kastle and his graduate student A. S. Loevenhart observed that the compound made the tincture of guaiacum tincture turn blue, a sign of oxygen being released. Around 1905, Loevenhart reported on the successful use of BPO to treat various skin conditions, including burns, chronic varicose leg tumors, and tinea sycosis. He also reported animal experiments that showed the relatively low toxicity of the compound. Treatment with benzoyl peroxide was proposed for wounds by Lyon and Reynolds in 1929, and for sycosis vulgaris and acne varioliformis by Peck and Chagrin in 1934. However, preparations were often of questionable quality. It was officially approved for the treatment of acne in the US in 1960.  Medical uses  =Acne treatment= acne Benzoyl peroxide is effective for treating acne lesions. It does not induce antibiotic resistance. It may be combined with salicylic acid, sulfur, erythromycin or clindamycin (antibiotics), or adapalene (a synthetic retinoid). Two common combination drugs include benzoyl peroxide/clindamycin and adapalene/benzoyl peroxide, an unusual formulation considering most retinoids are deactivated by peroxides. Combination products such as benzoyl peroxide/clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide/salicylic acid appear to be slightly more effective than benzoyl peroxide alone for the treatment of acne lesions. Benzoyl peroxide for acne treatment is typically applied to the affected areas in gel, cream, or liquid, in concentrations of 2.5% increasing through 5.0%, and up to 10%. No strong evidence supports the idea that higher concentrations of benzoyl peroxide are more effective than lower concentrations.  Mechanism of action  Classically, benzoyl peroxide is thought to have a three-fold activity in treating acne. It is sebostatic, comedolytic, and inhibits growth of Cutibacterium acnes the main bacterium associated with acne. In general, acne vulgaris is a hormone-mediated inflammation of sebaceous glands and hair follicles. Hormone changes cause an increase in keratin and sebum production, leading to blocked drainage. C. acnes has many lytic enzymes that break down the proteins and lipids in the sebum, leading to an inflammatory response. The free-radical reaction of benzoyl peroxide can break down the keratin, therefore unblocking the drainage of sebum (comedolytic). It can cause nonspecific peroxidation of C. acnes, making it bactericidal, and it was thought to decrease sebum production, but disagreement exists within the literature on this. Some evidence suggests that benzoyl peroxide has an anti- inflammatory effect as well. In micromolar concentrations it prevents neutrophils from releasing reactive oxygen species, part of the inflammatory response in acne. Side effects Skin irritation due to benzoyl peroxide Application of benzoyl peroxide to the skin may result in redness, burning, and irritation. This side effect is dose-dependent. Because of these possible side effects, it is recommended to start with a low concentration and build up as appropriate, as the skin gradually develops tolerance to the medication. Skin sensitivity typically resolves after a few weeks of continuous use. Irritation can also be reduced by avoiding harsh facial cleansers and wearing sunscreen prior to sun exposure. One in 500 people experience hypersensitivity to BPO and are liable to suffer burning, itching, crusting, and possibly swelling. About one-third of people experience phototoxicity under exposure to ultraviolet (UVB) light. Dosage In the U.S., the typical concentration for benzoyl peroxide is 2.5% to 10% for both prescription and over-the-counter drug preparations that are used in treatment for acne. =Other medical uses= Benzoyl peroxide is used in dentistry as a tooth whitening product.  Non-medical uses  Benzoyl peroxide is one of the most important organic peroxides in terms of applications and the scale of its production. It is often used as a convenient oxidant in organic chemistry. =Bleaching= Like most peroxides, is a powerful bleaching agent. It has been used for the bleaching of flour, fats, oils, waxes, and cheeses, as well as a stain remover. =Polymerization= Benzoyl peroxide is also used as a radical initiator to induce chain-growth polymerization reactions, such as for polyester and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) resins and dental cements and restoratives. It is the most important among the various organic peroxides used for this purpose, a relatively safe alternative to the much more hazardous methyl ethyl ketone peroxide. It is also used in rubber curing and as a finishing agent for some acetate yarns. Safety =Explosion hazard= Concentrated benzoyl peroxide is potentially explosive like other organic peroxides, and can cause fires without external ignition. The hazard is acute for the pure material, so the compound is generally used as a solution or a paste. For example, cosmetics contain only a small percentage of benzoyl peroxide and pose no explosion risk. =Toxicity= Benzoyl peroxide breaks down in contact with skin, producing benzoic acid and oxygen, neither of which is very toxic. The carcinogenic potential of benzoyl peroxide has been investigated. A 1981 study published in the journal Science found that although benzoyl peroxide is not a carcinogen, it does promote cell growth when applied to an initiated tumor. The study concluded, \\"caution should be recommended in the use of this and other free radical-generating compounds\\". A 1999 IARC review of carcinogenicity studies found no convincing evidence linking BPO acne medication to skin cancers in humans.

Thus, benzoyl peroxide readily undergoes homolysis (symmetrical fission), forming free radicals: :(C6H5CO)2O2 → 2 The symbol • indicates that the products are radicals; i.e., they contain at least one unpaired electron. Such species are highly reactive. The homolysis is usually induced by heating. The half-life of benzoyl peroxide is one hour at 92 °C. At 131 °C, the half- life is one minute.

In the charm, gods from continental Germanic mythology heal a horse. Germanic paganism refers to the religion practiced by the Germanic peoples from the Iron Age until Christianisation during the Middle Ages. It was an essential element of early Germanic culture. From both archaeological remains and literary sources, it is possible to trace a number of common or closely related beliefs amid the Germanic peoples into the Middle Ages, when the last areas in Scandinavia were Christianized. Rooted in Proto-Indo-European religion, Proto-Germanic religion expanded during the Migration Period, yielding extensions such as Old Norse religion among the North Germanic peoples, the paganism practiced amid the continental Germanic peoples, and Anglo-Saxon paganism among the Old English- speaking peoples. The Germanic religion is best documented in several texts from the 10th and 11th centuries, where they have been best preserved in Scandinavia and Iceland. Geographical dispersion Map of the Roman Empire and Magna Germania, ca. 120 AD Germania was the Roman term for the area east of the Rhine and north of the Danube and up to the islands of the Baltic Sea (its namesake originates from Julius Caesar, who used it in his treatise on the Gallic Wars, Commentarii de Bello Gallico). The Germanic core area, Magna Germania, was located in ancient Europe in the northern European lowland, which mainly includes present-day Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, and the Scandinavian peninsula. However, the boundaries of Germania were not clearly defined, as large Germanic populations lived within the borders of the Roman Empire, and the Roman influence reached far into \\"free Germania\\" across the border of Limes. In Central Europe, the Celtic culture was already dominant and early Germanic religious practices were influenced by the Celts. Later, elements from the Roman culture were mixed into the Germanic culture, which includes archaeological evidence of Roman gods, statues, and gold mining. Germanic people have never really constituted a uniform group with a common or ubiquitous culture, but some general core beliefs system are known from medieval texts, which may be the result of a fusion of various beliefs across the expanse of Germanic tribes throughout central Europe. Among the East Germanic peoples, traces of Gothic paganism may be discerned from scant artifacts and attestations. According to historian John Thor Ewing, as a religion, the Germanic version consisted of \\"individual worshippers, family traditions and regional cults within a broadly consistent framework\\". Sources The works of the 13th century Icelandic historian Snorri Sturluson are invaluable sources on Germanic paganism Few written sources for Germanic paganism exist, and few of those that do were written by participants in that religion. Traditional oral literature associated with the pre-Christian religion was most likely deliberately suppressed as Christian institutions became dominant in Germany, England, and Scandinavia during the Middle Ages. Descriptions of early Germanic religious practices are, however, found in the works of Roman writers such as Tacitus in his first-century work Germania. Only in medieval Iceland was a large amount of Germanic-language material written on the subject of pagan traditions, principally the mythological poems of the Poetic Edda, Prose Edda, and skaldic verse. These works have enormous significance for our understanding of the ancient religious traditions. However, these sources were recorded after Christianity became dominant in Iceland by writers who themselves were Christians. Some traces of Germanic religion are preserved in other works by medieval Christians like the Middle High German Nibelungenlied and the Old English Beowulf. Medieval and post- medieval folklore has also been used as a source for older beliefs. But this too was influenced by Christianity and changed in shape. However, whereas stories can travel quickly and easily change over time, making late texts unreliable evidence for early Germanic culture, language changes in somewhat more predictable ways. Through the comparative method, it is possible to compare words in related languages and rationally reconstruct what their lost, earlier forms must have been, and to some extent what those earlier forms must have meant. This in turn allows the reconstruction of the names of some gods, supernatural beings, and ritual practices. For example, all the Germanic languages use a similar neuter noun to denote pagan gods: Gothic guþ, Old English god, Old High German got, and Old Norse guð. Proto-Germanic, therefore, surely had a similar word with a similar sense. History The gilded side of the Trundholm Sun Chariot, Nordic Bronze Age = Proto-Germanic Pagan Religion = Little is known for certain about the roots of Germanic religion. =Roman Iron Age= The 5th-century Golden Horns of Gallehus Early forms of Germanic religion are known exclusively from archaeological remains and can therefore only be interpreted on the basis of comparative studies with other religions or through the evaluation of Scandinavian literature, who, as the last converts among the practitioners of Germanic religion, maintained a written account of their religion into the Middle Ages. In addition to the rich archaeological finds, like the evidence of a widespread veneration of a fire god, there is also linguistic evidence attesting to Germanic religious practices. Description of the oldest forms of the Germanic religion are based on uncertain reconstructions, which in turn are based on comparisons with other material. Archaeological findings suggest that the Germanic peoples practiced some of the same 'spiritual' rituals as the Celts, including sacrifice, divination, and the belief in a spiritual connection with the natural environment around them. Germanic priestesses were feared by the Romans, as these tall women with glaring eyes, wearing flowing white gowns often wielded a knife for sacrificial offerings. Captives might have their throats cut and be bled into giant cauldrons or have their intestines opened up and the entrails thrown to the ground for prophetic readings. Spiritual rituals frequently occurred in consecrated groves or upon islands on lakes where perpetual fires burned. Various deities found in Germanic paganism occur widely among the Germanic peoples, most notably the god known to the continental Germanic peoples as Wodan or Wotan, to the Anglo-Saxons as Woden, and to the Norse as Óðinn, as well as the god Thor—known to the continental Germanic peoples as Donar, to the Anglo-Saxons as Þunor and to the Norse as Þórr. Christianity had no relevance for the pre-Christian Germanic peoples until their contact and integration with Rome. Julius Caesar One of the oldest written sources on Germanic religion is Julius Caesar's Commentarii de Bello Gallico, where he compares the very intricate Celtic customs with the perceived very \\"primitive\\" Germanic traditions: > The German way of life is very different. They have no druids to preside > over matter related to the divine, and they do not have much enthusiasm for > sacrifices. They count as gods only those phenomenon that they can perceive > and by whose power they are plainly helped, the Sun, Fire, and Moon; others > they do not know even from hearsay. Their whole life is spent on hunting and > military pursuits. (Caesar, Gallic War 6.21.1–6.21.3) Caesar's descriptions of the religion of the Germanic tribes differ greatly from what other sources show, and so it is not given high source value by modern religious researchers. In general, he describes Germania as a barbaric wonderland, very different from the Italy from which he comes. Many of the characteristics he attributes to the population are thus in contrast to the Romans. An interesting detail, however, is his identification of the most important deity in Gaul being the same as the Roman Mercury; he likewise references other Roman gods being found in Germanic beliefs. > Among the gods, Mercury has the most important cult; his sacred images are > very frequent. The Gauls call him the inventor of every art and skill, the > guide on roadways and journeys, and they believe he has the greatest power > over trade and the pursuit of profit. After him, they venerate Apollo, Mars, > Jupiter, and Minerva. Of these, they think in much the same way as other > peoples do, holding that Apollo dispels disease, Minerva passes along the > foundations of arts and crafts, Jupiter rules the heavenly gods, and Mars > governs war. (Caesar, Gallic War 6.17.1) Tacitus Roman bronze figurine, which depicts a praying Germanic man with a characteristic Suebian knot. A later and much more detailed description of the Germanic religion was written by Tacitus around 100 AD. His ethnographic descriptions in Germania remain highly valued. According to this, the Germanic peoples sacrificed both animals and humans to their gods, which he identified with Hercules and Mars. He also tells that the largest group, the Suebi, also sacrificed Roman prisoners of war to a goddess whom he identified with Isis. Another deity, whom he calls Nerthus, is cultivated as a goddess by a number of groups in the northwestern region. According to Tacitus's account, her followers believed that Nerthus interacted directly in human affairs. Her main shrine was in the grove of Castum, located on an island. A covered wagon pulled by bulls was devoted to the goddess and only the high priest was permitted to touch it. This pastor was able to see the goddess stepping into the cart. It was carried all over the country and wherever it arrived, a party and feast in her honor was held. The priest proclaimed festivities over when the goddess was tired of contact with mortals, then the wagon and curtain were washed. The slave performing the purification ritual was subsequently thrown into the lake. During the time the goddess traveled, these tribes did not go to war and did not touch any weapons. According to Tacitus, the Germans perceived temple buildings as inappropriate homes for the gods, nor did they depict them in human form, in the same way that the Romans did. Instead, they cultivated them in sacred forests or groves. Tacitus' reliability as a source can be characterized by his rhetorical tendencies, since one of the purposes of Germania was to present his own compatriots with an example of the virtues he believed they were missing. =Germanic Iron Age= Paganism was still being practiced by the Germanic peoples when the Roman emperor Constantine the Great died in 337 AD, despite his conversion to Christianity; Constantine did not, however, ban pagan rituals at select religious temples across the Empire. Sometime between 391–392, Theodosius I made an official proclamation which outlawed pagan religious practices throughout his region of influence with various successors like Justinian I doing likewise. The Franks were converted directly from paganism to Christianity under the leadership of Clovis I in about 496 without an intervening time as Arian Christians. Eventually the Gothic tribes turned away from their Arian faith and in 589 converted to trinitarian Christianity. The Royal Mounds at Gamla Uppsala contains hundreds (originally thousands) of tumuli Pagan beliefs amid the Germanic peoples were reported by some of the earlier Roman historians and in the 6th century AD another instance of this appears when the Byzantine historian and poet, Agathias, remarked that the Alemannic religion was \\"solidly and unsophisticatedly pagan.\\" However, during the Germanic Iron Age, the Germanic culture was increasingly exposed to the influence of Christianity and Mediterranean culture; for example, the Gothic Christian convert Ulfilas translated the Bible from Greek into Gothic in the mid 4th century, creating the earliest known translation of the Bible into a Germanic language. Another aspect of this development can be seen, for example, in Jordanes, who wrote the story of the Goths, Getica, in the 6th century, since they had been Christians for more than 150 years and dominated the ancient Roman core area, Italy. Jordanes wrote that the Goths' chief god was Mars, whom they believed had been born among them. Jordanes does not bother using the god's original name, but instead employs the Latin form (Mars) and avows the Goths sacrificed captives to him. The Goths were converted to the Arian form of Christianity in the 4th century at the time when Catholicism became the dominant religion of the Roman Empire, earning them the label of heretics. Over time, the ancient religious traditions were replaced by the Christian culture, first to the south, later to the north. The early transition to Christianity and the rapid disappearance of the realms meant that the religious practices of the East Germanic tribes predating Christianity are almost unknown. =England= Germanic-speakers are well attested to have been stationed in the part of Roman Britain corresponding to England, and their religious practices, combining traditional and Roman elements, are evidenced in archaeology, particularly in the form of inscriptions. From the fifth century, Germanic-speaking Anglo-Saxon culture became established in England, and the later writings of its Christian writers an important source for pre-Christian Germanic religion. For example, the Christian monk Bede, who in the early eighth century reproduced a traditional, non-Christian calendar in his work De Temporum Ratione, noted that the Germanic Angles began their year on 24–25 December. In addition, some pieces of Old English poetry have survived, all passed on by Christian writers. Important works include Beowulf and some Anglo-Saxon metrical charms. =Middle Ages= A depiction of Saint Boniface destroying Donar's Oak from The Little Lives of the Saints (1904), illustrated by Charles Robinson. The Fraubillen cross, a menhir resculptured into a cross. When the Germanic Lombards invaded Italy in the mid-sixth century, their forces consisted of persons practicing orthodox and the Arian form of Christianity, but a significant portion of them remained wedded to their pagan religious heritage. Over time, the balance between pagan and Christian believers began to change. Eventually for many continental Germanic peoples who still clung to their ancient faith, the conversion to Christianity was achieved by armed force, successfully completed by Charlemagne, in a series of campaigns (the Saxon Wars). These wars brought Saxon lands into the Frankish Empire. Massacres, such as the Bloody Verdict of Verden, where as many as 4,500 people were beheaded according to one of Charlemagne's chroniclers, were a direct result of this policy. Several centuries later, Anglo-Saxon and Frankish missionaries and warriors undertook the conversion of their Saxon neighbors. A key event was the felling of Thor's Oak near Fritzlar by Boniface in 723 AD. According to surviving accounts, when Thor failed to strike Boniface dead after the oak hit the ground, the Franks were amazed and began their conversion to the Christian faith. During the eighth-century the Carolingian Franks sought to stamp out Germanic paganism, when for instance, Charlemagne destroyed the mighty tree trunk Irminsul that supported the heavenly vault of pagan Saxons in much the same way that Boniface had destroyed Thor's Oak before. Charlemagne then instituted a forced mass-baptism, which was never forgiven and incited the Saxons to revolt whenever Frankish forces were far away; the Saxons—under the leadership of Widukind—even wiped-out Christian mission centres in Frankish territory. Historian J.M. Wallace-Hadrill asserts that Charlemagne was \\"in deadly earnest\\" about extirpating paganism and that his \\"kingly task\\" included converting the heathen pagans \\"by fire and sword if necessary.\\" Germanic paganism's lasting power and influence is revealed to some degree by the amount of anti-pagan measures undertaken during the period of Frankish ascendancy. Transition from paganism to Christianity was nonetheless an uneven process. For example, when the formidable Harald Gormsson attempted to impose Christianity on Denmark in the mid-10th century, the inhabitants resented the change, which led to his son driving him out of the country and returning it to its pagan practices. Sometime around 1000 CE, Iceland was formally declared Christian, however, pagan religious practices were tolerated in the private sphere. The change of religion took place in some places peacefully, while in others through forced conversion. Norwegian King, Olaf II, (later canonized as St Olaf) who reigned in the early 11th century, attempted to spread Christianity throughout his kingdom, but was forced into exile by a rebellion in 1028 and killed at the Battle of Stiklestad in 1030. In 1080, Sweden's King Inge the Elder, who had converted to Christianity, was exiled from Uppsala by his own people when he refused to sacrifice to the pagan gods. Nonetheless, most of Scandinavia turned from their Nordic pagan practices and converted to Christianity by the 11th century. Adam of Bremen provided the last description of widespread paganism being practiced in the Nordic countries. =Viking era= This Thor's hammer in silver with filigree ornamentation was found in Scania. It was donated to the Swedish History Museum in 1895. The Scandinavian religion in the early Middle Ages is far better documented than the former Germanic religions, thanks especially to the texts written down in Iceland between 1150 and 1400. Bronze Age personal ornaments show images of their gods on chariots, and rock carvings all across Scandinavia south of Trondheim-Swedish Uppland reveal gods, priests, and various fauna. Sacrifice was known to be merely a part of festivals where the various gods received gifts, or whenever one tried to predict and influence the events of the coming year. The relationship between gods and humans was understood as one that resembled the connection between a great man and those submissive to him; therefore it was important to routinely confirm the relationship with the gods through gifts. Blood sacrifices were used in times of crisis and for the holidays. Ninth-century accounts of the Viking Rus' of Novgorod (perhaps the furthest East that Germanic religious practices manifest) include the sacrifice of \\"men, women, and cattle\\" to their deities. While Christian conversion happened first in Denmark and then Norway, thanks largely to Harald Bluetooth, the Swedish royal household was the last to accept Christian baptism. Pagan religion formed the core of Nordic religious identity and their bond was as much their non-Christian identity and their related tongue than it was their common worship of Odinn, Thor, or Frey. Even after conversion, there are reports that Norsemen like Helgi the Lean—who was a professed Christian—made vows to Thor during sea-voyages or when matters of utmost importance arose, demonstrating how some were slow to give up their old gods entirely. Influences =Celtic Iron Age= The Gundestrup cauldron, today in the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen. During the transition between the Bronze Age and the Iron Age (about 500 BC), there was a shift in both living and religious customs. The archaeological finds show a society that was changed, instead of burying their dead, they were now starting to burn them before ceremoniously placing them in the ground. This burial practice remained dominant right up to the transition to Christianity in the Middle Ages. In later sources, it appears that the Germanic peoples believed that the dead would continue to live in a celestial kingdom through burning, while those who were laid in the earth without being burned would remain down there. Among finds that probably had religious significance, objects of Celtic origin dominate, and the mythological motifs found in many cases have clear connections to the Mediterranean region or Celtic culture. Based on archaeological evidence alone, it is nearly impossible to distinguish early Germans from Celts according to historian Malcolm Todd. While there is limited information available on Germanic mythology in the early part of the Iron Age, the remnants that do exist indicate that there were shifts in the religious beliefs of the Germanic peoples over the centuries. =Traces of Roman religion= Until about 400 AD, the borders of the Roman Empire were only about 300 km away from Scandinavia, and even closer to other German- speaking tribes. The Roman Empire was the dominant power of that time, both politically, economically and culturally in this part of the world. As the Roman Empire grew and made contact with different cultures across a vast area of Europe, local traditions eventually began borrowing cultural elements derived from the Romans; this also applies to the Germanic peoples. A telling example is that by 300 AD, the Germanic peoples began dividing the week into seven days, each day named after a particular deity. More examples include sculptures that create an overall common tradition throughout Europe, the Near-North and North Africa. In northern Europe, smaller sculptures with clear similarities to Roman models from archaeological excavations—in particular, at Funen and Øland—dating between 200 and 400 AD, consist of figures that can stand on a table and are either made of metal or wood. Unfortunately, it is impossible to identify which gods these figures are meant to depict or much about the religious beliefs attached to them. A special feature of the Germanic figures, however, is the lack of female figures that were otherwise popular in the Roman Empire, which indicates a deliberate opt-out. In Roman context, these types of figures were mainly used in connection with the larch cult in private homes, where they were placed on small home-altars. However, whether they have been used for the same purpose in the Nordic countries is uncertain. Gradually, these figures disappear again from the finds, and from the Viking Age only very few and small figures are known. Sometime between 400 and 500 AD, there was an increase in the amount of gold, as indicated by archeological excavations across northern Europe—this is likely related to the extensive use of Germanic mercenaries by the Romans as they attempted to expand their empire. Round gold medals inspired by Roman coins appeared, adorned by images of Balder, Tyr and Odin. These gods were prominently worshipped by the upper class and the Germanic kings. In this example, Roman techniques were used to reproduce and convey Germanic ideas and religion. Ritual practices Stone slab from The King's Grave in southern Sweden, Nordic Bronze Age, 1400 BC Traces of Germanic pagan religion in the oldest periods during Celtic Iron Age, are known exclusively through archaeological finds. These include images and remnants of rituals, typically objects discovered in lakes and marshes, among which many of them trace back to the Neolithic Age through the Bronze Age, and most prominently continue into the Iron Age. The people of that time have probably perceived bogs and marshes as sacred places where contact with divine powers was possible. Tacitus described the home of the Germanic goddess, Nerthus, as being on an island in a lake. In several bogs, raw processed wood figures have been found, generally depicting people and consisting of branches with strongly emphasized sexual features. This probably suggests that the early Germanic pagan gods of fertility were associated with water, a belief that relates to later practices. The fact that sacrifice was a fundamental element of Germanic religion can be seen in the fact that it occurs in all sorts of sources, both ancient and medieval, in place names, material relics, and in Germanic pagan mythological texts, where even the gods sacrificed. Sacrifice sent objects via destruction or physical placement to places where the living no longer have access to them; most frequently this included burning them or throwing them into lakes. An important element of these rituals was the sacrificial festival, which included copious eating and drinking. Large public offerings took place in centralized locations, and in many places throughout what was once ancient Germania, the remains of such sites have been found. drinking scene on an image stone from Gotland, in the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities in Stockholm. Wooden figures were sacrificed as were people; human victims suffered a sudden and violent death from what the archaeological finds throughout bogs—in what was once Germania—indicate. In many cases, various measures were employed to ensure that the body was held down in the bog, either using branches or stones. Danish historian, Allan A. Lund, posits that the victims had been killed because they were considered witches who brought misfortune to society. He explains this by the fact that the victims had been placed in a peat bog, where they would not dissolve and thereby be transferred to the other world, but were instead, preserved forever in a border state between this and the other world. Another practice was the Germanic pagan custom of offering up weapons to their gods. In southern Scandinavia, there are about 50 sites where weapons have been thrown into a lake and sacrificed after the weapons were partially destroyed or rendered useless. At these sites, only weapons and possessions were sacrificed; no human bones are found anywhere, and only animal bones from horses can be found. Swords are bent, spears and shields are broken. The majority of this type of sacrifice comes from the period between AD 200–500 and many of them are in East Jutland in places with access to the Kattegat, a strait that is 225-km in length between Sweden and Denmark. The Germans' sacrifice of defeated enemy weapons to their deities is known from ancient accounts and constitutes part of an offering to Odin, during which the weapon sacrifice affirms the connection between the worshippers and the divine. Folklore The Germanic tribes of central Europe gradually became Christians between the 6th and 8th centuries. However, elements of the ancient mythology survived through the Middle Ages in the form of legends, adventures and epic tales and folklore. Fragments can be found, for example, in historical accounts written about the different tribes, such as Paul the Deacon's historical account of the Lombards or the tales of Saint Willibrord by Alcuin, who was likewise a theologian and advisor to Charlemagne. But in relation to especially Old Norse religion and, to a lesser extent, Anglo-Saxon religion, the written sources of early spiritual practices in central Europe are of a very fragmentary nature. For example, the Merseburg charms is the only pre-Christian text written in Old High German and contains mentions of the deities Fulla, Wodan, and Frigg. In other texts, including chronicles and historical representations, there are hints of the pagan religion, such as Charlemagne's destruction of Irminsul—reproduced in the Annales regni Francorum—or the invention of the Christmas tree by Saint Boniface. Other traces include the modern Scottish depiction of the \\"brownies\\". As paganism was marginalized by Christianity, parts of the pre- Christian religion continued in the folklore of the rural population; Germanic mythology therefore survived in fairy tales, which the Brothers Grimm collected and published in their work. Runes The Franks Casket, as displayed in the British Museum; the front and lid An important Roman contribution to Germanic culture was writing. Around 200 AD, Runic inscriptions begin to appear in southern Scandinavia and did not cease until about 1300. The origin of this particular Germanic script can be linked to the strong Roman-influenced power center at Stevns in southern Denmark. Researchers have long debated whether the runes had only religious significance or if they were also used for everyday writing. Today, most scholars believe that the script could not have survived so long if it was used exclusively in special ritual contexts It is known for certain that runes were frequently used for religious purposes. Within the rune magic system, each rune sign had a special meaning, and the cumulative writing down of the entire alphabet series—the futhark—functioned as a magic formula. Also, in other contexts, the written text of the rune was used for spells on weapons and personal effects. Further evidence of the religious context of runes and their importance shows up in the Old Saxon epic poem, Heliand, written in Old High German verse from the ninth-century, whereby the work uses secular and pagan phrases in telling the gospel narrative. One particular line reads, gerihti us that geruni (\\"reveal to us the runes\\"), demonstrating a conflation of the Christian idea \\"Lord, teach us to pray\\" with ancient pagan practices. Early proselytizers of the Christian faith had to use familiar vernacular equivalents to convey Christian concepts to their pagan brethren. An enigmatic fusion of the ancient Germanic pagan, Roman, and Christian ideas shows up on the Anglo-Saxon chest known as Franks Casket, which contains a mixture of the runic and Roman alphabets.

It premiered on November 21, 2003. Inspired by the true story of University of Virginia Cavaliers basketball star Lamont Carr, the film centers on a group of young Jewish basketball players during the Hanukkah season who search for a coach to help them out of a slump. The main character Alex Schlotsky is inspired by the true story of Chad Korpeck and Alex Barbag. Plot Alex Schlotsky (Alex D. Linz) is a 14-year old freshman at Philadelphia Hebrew Academy, where he and his friends are on the school's struggling basketball team, the Lions. Without a good coach and with a dream of winning the Liberty Tournament and defeating their school's rivals, the Warriors, Alex and his friends are determined to find their own Judah Macabee to coach their team. During one day of practice at a local park, Alex finds what he believes is their coach—Lamont Carr (Richard T. Jones), a college basketball star whose knee injury prevented him from getting to the NBA. After interrupting his practice, Alex and Lamont don't get off to a good start. The next day, however, Alex offers to pay Lamont to coach their team for a while: Lamont reluctantly agrees. During the boys' first days of practice under Lamont's coaching, they become exhausted and frustrated with his coaching style, but an intervention by Alex inspires Lamont to help the team love the game of basketball. During the days leading up to the tournament, there are many hurdles Alex and Lamont must overcome—throughout the movie, Lamont is homeless after leaving his wife and son in Virginia with the hopes of being signed by the Philadelphia 76ers: Alex must balance his mother's desire for him to become a doctor as opposed to a basketball star. Also, among the challenges they must face is the school's principal, Mrs. Klein, who tries to see if Lamont is safe to be with the players. This leads to her one-day trying to inconspicuously follow Lamont to where he goes in his van after practicing. With Alex knowing this and also knowing that Lamont is homeless, he tells him to go to a modern apartment complex where his dad is trying to get a tenant for a room he owns. While Alex opens the door for Lamont, Mrs. Klein is outside the complex. Lamont and Alex's dad compromise to an agreement where Lamont can live there for free until Alex's dad can find a tenant. Later, before the big Liberty Tournament, the players are looking forward to, Lamont tells the team that he received an offer for a 10-day contract from the Philadelphia 76ers and he was going to accept it. This means the Lions must try to win the tournament without their coach. On the day of the final game, Alex finally confronts his mother and breaks through to her about his love for the game and she ends up convincing Alex's best friend Julie to forgive him. However, the Lions have been successful, winning every game in the tournament. While the game is going on, Alex's mother drives Julie to the game, then goes to the stadium where Lamont is playing a game to try to convince Lamont to come to their game despite the fact that his van has broken down before he can leave for the airport. Once she arrives, she speaks to one of Lamont's opponents about Alex's dreams and understands him even more afterward. After she finds Lamont, his car works again and she finally seems to start to understand. The final game in the Liberty Tournament takes place on a stormy night, which eventually knocks out the power in the school's gymnasium. Resorting to the use of an emergency generator for the remainder of the game, the Lions and the Warriors play the duration of the game on the agreement that whenever the fuel in the generator runs out, the game will end and the team with the most points will win. The Warriors devise a plan to make sure it is them—when they are ahead in the game and it becomes clear that the fuel in the generator is moments away from running out, the Warriors call a timeout that lasts for the remaining time. The Lions are outraged and discouraged until Lamont appears in the gym and encourages them to not lose faith. The power then once again goes out in the gym, and the Warriors celebrate what they believe is their victory—until the power comes back on soon after with the generator restarting even though it is out of gas. The final moments of the game consist of the Lions catching up to the Warriors, and with the final seconds on the clock ticking down, Alex passes the ball (as opposed to his usual selfish ways), allowing them to score the winning basket. The entire school celebrates, and Lamont's wife and son enter the gym and plan to stay with Lamont, who reveals to the Lions that he plans to become their full-time coach. Alex's mother is finally convinced by him to let him play basketball and in fact, only showed up at the end of the game so she could go get Lamont's family for him while he went to help the team. The final scene of the movie consists of Alex's and Lamont's families (with Alex's mother proving to be a good player) along with Julie playing a game of basketball, while Rabbi Lewis' story of Hanukkah and its relation to the basketball game plays over the scene.

Zackquill Morgan founded Morgantown, West Virginia in Monongalia County, where he died at sixty years old on New Year's Day in 1795 and was buried in the cemetery at Prickett's Fort. The grave was \\"marked by rough native sandstone slab, on which was crudely chiseled the simple lettering, Z. M. Jan. 1, 1795.\\" Zackquill Morgan's unusual name is spelled many different ways in old Christian records. For example: Zacuil, Zackwell, Zackquell and Zackil, but rarely as Zackquill, which according to the old Episcopal Church record book at Bunker Hill, West Virginia, is the way Colonel Morgan Morgan spelled his son's name. Biography =Early life= According to family tradition, Zackquill and his brother David served with Virginia forces in Braddock's ill-fated expedition (1755) and in the more successful expedition by General Forbes in 1758. In 1761 Zackquill received from his father one thousand acres (4 km²) of land in Berkeley County which had been patented in November 1735. Most historians believe that David Morgan and his younger brother Zackquill Morgan were the next Europeans to attempt a permanent settlement in Monongalia County. About 1765 or '66, he migrated, with David, to Georges Creek, Pennsylvania. They left Delaware and reached present-day Morgantown in 1766 or '67. A family tradition attributes the settlement of Zackquill Morgan, in 1768, but at that time he appears to have been still living in what was later Fayette County. According to a deed on file at Uniontown, Pennsylvania, Zackquill was living at Great Meadows, Bedford [now Fayette] County, Pennsylvania, on August 28, 1771, when he sold his farm there. Zackquill may have been living near his brother David at Pleasantville until 1779 or '80. Despite the accounts of various historians, we still do not know when Zackquill Morgan settled on the site of Morgantown, nor indeed, who made the first settlement on that site. Regardless of when Zackquill moved to the site of the city to bear his name, we find a surveyor's record indicating that the land was surveyed for him on April 29, 1781. Nicholas Decker, the first settler to establish a settlement in the vicinity of what is now Morgantown, on 29 April 1781, surveyed for Zackquill Morgan, assignee of Isaac Lemasters, of land in Monongalia County, on Deckers Creek and the Monongahela River, including his settlement thereon in the year 1772, agreeable to and in part of a certificate for from the commissioners of adjusting claims to unpatented lands in the county of Monongalia—James Chew, assisted Mr. James Madison, surveyor. A courthouse record says: \\"John Madison assee of Nicholas Decker is intitled to Four Hundred acres of land in Monongalia County on the Monona River to include his settlement made thereon in the year 1766 and prior to any settlement made near the same.\\"Core. Earl L. (1976), The Monongalia Story: A Bicentennial History, Vol. I: Prelude, Parsons, W.Va.: McClain Printing Co., pg 163.Nicholas Decker was an heir of Garrett Decker, who was a member of the unfortunate Decker settlement of 1758; his settlement in 1766 at the mouth of Deckers Creek was certainly one of the earliest on the site of the present city of Morgantown. During the Revolutionary War, Morgan was \\"County Lieutenant\\" of Monongalia County with the title of colonel. He commanded part of the Virginia Minute Men during that war, with about 600 men and was with General Gates at the Battle of Saratoga in October 1777. He lost nearly half of his men in that battle. =Establishment of Morgantown= In 1782, after resolution of the Pennsylvania/Virginia boundary dispute made his home a part of Pennsylvania, the Monongalia County seat was moved south, first to Colonel John Evans's home and ultimately to Zackquill Morgan's home in present-day Morgantown. The county court was held in Morgan's home while a courthouse was constructed in the public square in what was then called Morgan's Town. The wooden court house was completed sometime between 1782 and 1785 at a cost of $250. It was at about this time (1784) that George Washington visited the area. In October 1785, at Colonel Morgan's request, the Virginia General Assembly specified that of his land was to be laid out in lots of a half acre each, and a town, named Morgans-Town, established on the site. The lots were to be auctioned off and the proceeds given to Colonel Morgan. Initially, the land deeds required purchasers to build a house of at least on the lot within four years, but because of Indian hostilities the four-year time limit was extended in 1789 by the Virginia General Assembly to an additional five years. Morgantown was established by an act reading as follows: > Be it enacted by the General Assembly that of land, the property of > Zackquill Morgan, lying in the county of Monongalia shall be laid out in > lots of half an acre each, with convenient streets which shall be > established as a town by the name of \\"Morgans Town\\". =Later years= Zackquill Morgan opened the town's first tavern in 1783. Before Zackquill's death in 1795, he lived in a house on Front Street later owned by his son Zackquill. This is the house in which Drusilla, granddaughter of Zackquill I, was born in 1814 and in which she lived continuously until her death in 1904. The inventory of Zackquill Morgan's personal property, made on December 6, 1795, by James Dunn, Morgan Morgan, and Richard Merrifield, included the following: 1 mare and colt 10 pounds 15 shillings; 1 old red cow 2 pounds; 1 old red cow and bell and collar 2.7.6; 1 dark brown heifer (3 years old) 2.10.6; 1 cow and calf 2.7.6; 1 small year-old heifer .15; 1 small year-old steer .15; 2 hogs @ .15 each 1.10; 1 sow and 3 shotes, .24, 2.14; 1 pair plow irons .25; 5 sheep @ 9/6 3.12; 1 coat, wescot and pair of stocking 4; 1 bed and furniture 5; 7 pewter plates and 1 pewter salt cellar .13.3; 1 old tea kettle; 1 candle stick; 2 flat irons; 1 old iron kettle and hooks 6/3; 1 pot and 2 trimels .15, 1.13; total 47 pounds and 14 shillings.

It was positioned for most of its lifetime as one of the main Japanese contributions to the International Space Station, the other being the Japanese Experiment Module. The project was eventually cancelled in 2003, by which point test flights of a sub-scale testbed had flown successfully. History The original HOPE project called for the building of a sub-scale orbital prototype known as HOPE-X, for H-2 Orbiting Plane, Experimental. This would be used for flight testing and systems validation, before moving onto the larger HOPE, which used many of the same parts and general design in a 4-man design. As the name implies, both would be launched on Japan's new H-2 launcher, the full- scale HOPE requiring substantial upgrades in performance. At the time, Japan was an up-and-coming industrial powerhouse, and their space program was moving from success to success. There was little doubt, and a little trepidation, that HOPE would be successful. As part of the overall Japanese space program, testing for technologies that would be used on HOPE and other projects was well advanced. In February 1994 the first test flight of the new H-2 launcher was used to also launch the experimental OREX ballistic re-entry vehicle, which tested various communications systems, heating profiles and heat shielding components. Another project, HYFLEX, followed in February 1996. Hyflex was intended to test the carbon-carbon heat shielding tiles that were intended to be used on HOPE, as well as having the same body shaping in order to gather data on hypersonic lifting. HYFLEX was successful, but sank in the Pacific after splashdown before it could be recovered. Another test project, ALFLEX followed HYFLEX in 1996. In 1997, well into the study, it was decided that HOPE-X should be modified into an unmanned cargo vehicle with the addition of automated approach and docking systems, and a cargo bay with doors similar to the one on the U.S. Space Shuttle. It was believed this would result in a \\"quick and dirty\\" cargo supply system for ISS, which was suffering from continued delays due to problems with the Shuttle program. It was estimated that such a conversion could be completed for an additional US$292 million, less expensive than designing a completely new ballistic cargo vehicle for the H-2 launcher, and much less expensive that the estimated US$2.9 billion needed to complete the full-sized HOPE. Even the small HOPE-X launched on unmodified H-2A rockets would deliver a useful to ISS, about the same as the Progress spacecraft's approximate . HOPE-X was about long with a wingspan. In 1998, the H-2 suffered from a string of failures. A re-evaluation of the entire space program followed, and budget constraints later forced a reduction in overall funding by US$690 million to US$4.22 billion for the five-year spending period between 1998 and 2002. This would force a delay in the timeline for the HOPE-X, with its first flight in 2003. By this time NASDA had spent only US$305 million since the project was approved in 1988, reflecting the status as a research project. The next year the H-2 project was cancelled outright, proceeding with the simplified and lighter H-2A alone. Hughes pulled out of the H-2A project at about this time; they had initially purchased ten launches on the system and it was considered a major international success for NASDA. HOPE continued to soldier on. In 2000, an agreement was signed to land the returning vehicle at Aeon Airstrip on Christmas Island in Kiribati. The High Speed Flight Demonstration project consisted of 25% scale models of HOPE-X to test navigation technologies and flight characteristics. As the 2003 deadline approached a number of debates broke out about the launcher profile, with many arguing that the H-2 should be replaced with a jet-powered cargo aircraft for an air-start. The first flight was pushed back further to 2004. Before this milestone was reached a major re- organization of NASDA took place in order to address its obvious overcommitment in light of Japan's economic stagnation, especially now that there were demands for a crash program to develop spy satellites in order to track North Korean nuclear efforts. JAXA was formed, and HOPE was cancelled during this process.

The Lowell family currently resides in Pinecrest, Florida. Florida International University Lowell was awarded an athletic scholarship to attend Florida International University (FIU) to play college baseball for the FIU Panthers baseball team. In 1993 he played in the Valley Baseball League a collegiate summer baseball league in the Shenandoah Valley region of Virginia for the Waynesboro Generals. In the summer of 1994, he played for the Chatham A's in the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL). Lowell was a league all-star for Chatham, and was inducted into the CCBL Hall of Fame in 2011. Lowell graduated from FIU in 1997 with a Bachelor's Degree in Finance. A three-time All Conference player with the Panthers, his uniform number 15 was retired. Lowell was drafted by the New York Yankees in the 1995 Major League Baseball draft, and eventually made his MLB debut with the New York Yankees during the 1998 season. He was also converted to play as a third baseman, having been at shortstop and second base in college.

Although Lowell debuted late in the season and did not play in the 1998 postseason, he still received his first career World Series ring as the Yankees won the 1998 World Series against the San Diego Padres. =Florida Marlins= Lowell was traded to the Florida Marlins on February 1, 1999 for Mark Johnson and Ed Yarnall. While waiting for spring training, he discovered that he had testicular cancer and underwent surgery on February 21 returning to the lineup on May 29. He finished his season with a .253 BA, 12 home runs, and 47 RBI. Lowell had successful years in Florida and established himself as one of the elite third baseman in the league. In , he finished with 18 home runs and 100 RBI. Lowell was on pace to have a great season in , but in late August, he suffered a broken hand when he was hit by a pitch by the Montreal Expos' Héctor Almonte, forcing him to miss 32 games, but managed to finish the season with 32 home runs and 105 RBI. He was replaced by Miguel Cabrera. In , he hit a career high at the time .293 with 27 home runs and 85 RBI. Despite a disappointing 2005 season in which he hit .236 with only 8 homers and a .298 on-base percentage, Lowell earned his first Gold Glove Award. Lowell also finished third in doubles in the league, totaling 47 doubles in the 2005 season. The Marlins traded him to Boston in a deal that was officially completed on November 21, 2005, in which the Red Sox received Lowell, Josh Beckett and Guillermo Mota in exchange for Hanley Ramírez, Aníbal Sánchez, Jesús Delgado and Harvey García. =Boston Red Sox= Lowell in spring 2007 Although the Boston Red Sox took on Lowell and his contract largely because the Marlins would not trade pitcher Josh Beckett without relieving themselves of Lowell's salary, Lowell fared better than expected as a member of the 2006 Red Sox, for a time leading the league in doubles and providing solid defense at third base. Lowell finished with 20 HR and 80 RBI, and he was tied with Eric Chavez for the best fielding percentage at his position. The season turned out to be one of Lowell's best, in which he set career bests in hits, RBI, batting average, OPS, and played a key role in helping the Red Sox win their second World Series in four years. One of the early highlights of the season came on April 22 when Lowell was one of the four Red Sox players to hit consecutive home runs against the Yankees. During the first half, Lowell hit .300 and led the team with 14 home runs (tied with David Ortiz) and 63 RBI. This performance helped earn him a spot on the 2007 American League All-Star Team as a reserve player voted in on the player's ballot. As the Red Sox held onto its lead in the American League East division, Lowell continued to carry the team by hitting .350 during the second half. His season total of 120 RBI was not only a personal best but a franchise record for a Red Sox third baseman, beating Butch Hobson's total of 112 in . Lowell also finished with a .324 batting average, 21 home runs and 191 hits, another career high. During the 2007 World Series, Lowell hit .400 with 1 HR, 4 RBI, 6 runs scored and a stolen base in the four-game sweep against the Colorado Rockies. Lowell got his third World Series ring and was named the World Series MVP. He also became the second Puerto Rican player to be named the MVP of a World Series (the first one being Roberto Clemente). Lowell along with fellow ex-Marlin Josh Beckett became the first duo to each get a World Series MVP by winning a World Series with one team in the American League and the other in the National League. Following the season, Lowell placed fifth in the American League Most Valuable Player voting. Although he filed for free agency, Lowell returned to the Red Sox after signing a three-year contract worth $37.5M. Lowell had trouble with a torn hip labrum that required surgery between the 2008 and 2009 seasons. As a result, he spent several stints on the disabled list. The injury caused him to miss most of the 2008 playoffs, including the ALCS when the Red Sox lost to the Tampa Bay Rays.

Sabina in 1967 and named for Canadian geologist Sir William Edmond Logan (1798–1875). It was first discovered in Francon Quarry, Montreal, Quebec, Canada and has only been reported from a few localities worldwide. Properties It is usually white, lemon yellow, or amber in color, and can be translucent. It crystallizes in the triclinic system and shows pseudo-hexagonal crystal forms due to twinning. The width of the crystals typically undulates down the length, forming crystals that widen in the middle or flare out at the end. Crystals are affected by light and can develop a white alteration coating over time. Weloganite is triboluminescent, producing blue light.

The mission notably carried a Japanese television reporter from Tokyo Broadcasting System.The mission report is available here: http://www.spacefacts.de/english/flights.htm Crew Mission highlights Soyuz TM-11 was the 11th expedition to Mir, which spent 175 days docked to the space station. Coincidentally it was launched on the same day as STS-35. As the mission carried Toyohiro Akiyama, a reporter for the Japanese television network Tokyo Broadcasting System, the spacecraft's launch shroud and its Soyuz booster were painted with the Japanese flag and advertisements for Sony, Unicharm, and Otsuka Pharmaceutical. A camera inside the descent module filmed the cosmonauts during ascent for Akiyama's network. Viktor Afanaseyev, Musa Manarov (on his second Mir visit), and Toyohiro Akiyama were welcomed aboard Mir by Soviet cosmonauts. Akiyama's network paid for the flight. The Soviets called this their first commercial spaceflight and claimed to have earned $14 million. The journalist was scheduled to make one 10-min TV broadcast and two 20-min radio broadcasts each day. Electrical power and video and TV system incompatibilities forced the Japanese to make extensive use of converters. His equipment, which weighed about 170 kg, was delivered by Progress-M spacecraft and set up in advance by Manakov and Strekalov. On December 5 Akiyama's couch was transferred to Soyuz-TM 10. On December 8 Manakov and Strekalov commenced loading Soyuz-TM 10's descent module with film and experiment results. TBS broadcast Akiyama's landing live from Kazakhstan.

These signs are laxity (sagging), rhytids (wrinkles), and photoaging, which includes erythema (redness), dyspigmentation (brown discolorations), solar elastosis (yellowing), keratoses (abnormal growths), and poor texture.Alexiades-Armenakas MR, et al .J Am Acad Dermatol. 2008 May;58(5):719-37; quiz 738-40. Despite great demand, many anti-aging products and treatments have not been proven to give lasting or major positive effects. One study found that the best performing creams reduced wrinkles by less than 10% over 12 weeks, which is not noticeable to the human eye. Another study found that cheap moisturisers were as effective as high-priced anti-wrinkle creams. A 2009 study at Manchester University, funded by the manufacturer of the cream, showed that a proprietary blend of ingredients had a positive effect after six months of daily application when extrapolated to a twelve month basis of comparison. The statistical methods used to show this have been criticized. Traditionally, anti-aging creams have been marketed towards women, but products specifically targeting men are increasingly common.  Ingredients  Anti-aging creams may include conventional moisturising ingredients. They also usually contain specific ingredients claimed to have anti-aging properties, such as: * Retinoids (for instance, in the form of retinyl palmitate). In various formulations it has been shown to reduce fine lines and pores. * Epidermal growth factor, to stimulate cell renewal and collagen production in the skin, and strengthen elasticity and structure. In various research epidermal growth factor has been shown to reduce fine lines, wrinkles and sagging.Journal of Controlled Release, April 2007, pages 169–176; Journal of Burn Care and Rehabilitation, March–April 2002, pages 116–125; and Journal of Dermatologic Surgery and Oncology, July 1992, pages 604–606 It also has healing (wounds and burns) and anti-inflammatory properties when applied to skin.Skin Pharmacology and Applied Skin Physiology, January–April 1999, pages 79–84 *EquolEquol – a Topically Applied Phyto-Oestrogen Improves Skin Characteristics Urbanek C, Haslberger A, Hippe B, Gessner D, Fiala H, Equol – a Topically Applied Phyto-Oestrogen Improves Skin Characteristics.

These help to dissolve the intracellular \\"glue\\" that holds dead cells together on the skin. The use of this type of product on a daily basis gradually enhances the exfoliation of the epidermis. This exposes newer skin cells and can help improve appearance. AHAs may irritate some skin, causing redness and flaking. * Peptides, such as acetyl hexapeptide-3 (Argireline), Matryxil, and copper peptides. * Coenzyme Q10 * Anti-oxidants are substances that may protect cells from the damage caused by unstable molecules known as free radicals.

Crew Mission Details The Mir crew welcomed aboard Anatoli Artsebarski, Sergei Krikalev (on his second visit to the station), and British cosmonaut- researcher Helen Sharman, who was aboard as part of Project Juno, a cooperative venture partly sponsored by British private enterprise. Sharman's experimental program, which was designed by the Soviets, leaned heavily toward life sciences, her speciality being chemistry. A bag of 250,000 pansy seeds was placed in the Kvant-2 EVA airlock, a compartment not as protected from cosmic radiation as other Mir compartments. Sharman also contacted nine British schools by radio and conducted high-temperature superconductor experiments with the Elektropograph-7K device. Sharman commented that she had difficulty finding equipment on Mir as there was a great deal more equipment than in the trainer in the cosmonaut city of Zvezdny Gorodok. Krikalev commented that, while Mir had more modules than it had had the first time he lived on board, it did not seem less crowded, as it contained more equipment. Krikalev also noted that some of the materials making up the station's exterior had faded and lost color, but that this had had no impact on the station's operation. The spacecraft spent 144 days docked to Mir. While it was in orbit, the failed coup d'état against Mikhail Gorbachev in August 1991 rocked the Soviet Union, setting in motion events which led to the end of the Soviet Union on 26 December.

He discovered an important, previously unknown, class of compounds called metal carbonyls. Education and career Ludwig Mond was born into a Jewish family in Kassel, Germany. His parents were Meyer Bär (Moritz) Mond and Henrietta Levinsohn. After attending schools in his home town, he studied chemistry at the University of Marburg under Hermann Kolbe and at the University of Heidelberg under Robert Bunsen but he never gained a degree. He then worked in factories in Germany and the Netherlands before coming to England to work at the factory of John Hutchinson & Co in Widnes in 1862. He worked in Utrecht for the firm of P. Smits & de Wolf from 1864 to 1867 and then returned to Widnes. Here he formed a partnership with John Hutchinson and developed a method to recover sulphur from the by-products of the Leblanc process, which was used to manufacture soda. In 1872 Mond got in touch with the Belgian industrialist Ernest Solvay who was developing a better process to manufacture soda, the ammonia-soda or Solvay process. The following year he went into partnership with the industrialist John Brunner to work on bringing the process to commercial viability. They established the business of Brunner Mond & Company, building a factory at Winnington, Northwich. Mond solved some of the problems in the process that had made mass production difficult, and by 1880 he had turned it into a commercially sound process. Within 20 years the business had become the largest producer of soda in the world. Mond continued to research new chemical processes. He discovered nickel carbonyl, a previously unknown compound and the first-discovered in the class of metal carbonyls, which could be easily decomposed to produce pure nickel from its ores through the Mond process. He founded the Mond Nickel Company to exploit this. Ores from nickel mines in Canada were given preliminary enrichment there and then shipped to Mond's works at Clydach, near Swansea, Wales for final purification. Honours and benefactions Mond supported scientific societies and, with Henry Roscoe, helped to expand the small Lancashire Chemical Society into the nationwide Society of Chemical Industry of which he was elected president in 1888. He was elected to the Royal Society in 1891. Abroad, he was elected to membership of the German Chemical Society, the Società Reale of Naples, and the . He received honorary doctorates from the universities of Padua, Heidelberg, Manchester and Oxford and was awarded the grand cordon of the Order of the Crown of Italy. He was a benefactor to a number of scientific organisations including the Royal Society, the Italian Accademia dei Lincei and the Royal Institution of Great Britain. In his will he left bequests to the town of Kassel and to a number of Jewish charities. In his later years he had built up a collection of old master paintings and he left the greater proportion of these to the National Gallery, London. His wife left a large collection of materials relating to German literature to King's College, London. The Royal Society of Chemistry awards the Ludwig Mond Award in his honour. A statue of him, designed by Édouard Lantéri (1912), stands in front of the former Brunner Mond offices in Winnington, flanked by a statue of Brunner. Family and personal Ludwig Mond (right) as a member of the Corps Rhenania Heidelberg, ca. 1856 In October 1866 Mond married his cousin Frida Löwenthal (1847–1923) in her native town of Cologne. They soon moved to England and had two sons, Robert and Alfred. In 1880 he took British nationality. While he was establishing his business the family lived at Winnington and in 1884 they moved to London. From the early 1890s on, he spent most of his winters in Rome at his home there. This home, the Palazzo Zuccari, was first leased and then (1904) bought in the name of his wife's friend Henriette Hertz, who developed it into a study centre for the history of art now called Bibliotheca Hertziana. He died in his London home, 'The Poplars', Avenue Road, near Regent's Park. Although he had never practised any religion he was buried with Jewish rites at St Pancras cemetery where his sons erected a mausoleum. His estate was valued at £1 million.

Retrieved on February 22, 2013. was an American comic book artist best known for his work for Marvel Comics, where his signature titles include the superhero series Daredevil, the cult-hit satiric series Howard the Duck, and The Tomb of Dracula, considered one of comics' classic horror series. He co-created the Falcon, the first African-American superhero in mainstream comics, portrayed by Anthony Mackie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU); Carol Danvers, who would become Ms. Marvel and Captain Marvel, and is portrayed by Brie Larson in the MCU; and the non-costumed, supernatural vampire hunter Blade, who went on to appear in a series of films starring Wesley Snipes. Colan was inducted into the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 2005. Early life Eugene Jules Colan was born September 1, 1926 to Harold Colan, an insurance salesman, and Winifred Levy Colan, an antique dealer, in The Bronx, New York City. His parents ran an antiques business on the Upper East Side. His family was Jewish, and the family's surname had originally been \\"Cohen\\". Colan began drawing at age three. \\"The first thing I ever drew was a lion. I must've absolutely copied it or something. But that's what my folks tell me. And from then on, I just drew everything in sight. My grandfather was my favorite subject\\". Among his earliest influences, he said in 2001, were the Coulton Waugh adventure comic strip Dickie Dare \\"in The New York Sun. I was influenced by the style, or the story. Mostly the story. I took it very seriously.\\" He moved with his family \\"at about age 4\\" to Long Beach, New York, on Long Island. Later, he would try to copy artist Norman Rockwell's covers to The Saturday Evening Post. Other major art influences were comics artists Syd Shores and Milton Caniff. Colan attended George Washington High School in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan, and went on to study at the Art Students League of New York.

After attempting to enlist in the U.S. Marine Corps during World War II but being pulled out by his father \\"because I was underage\\", Colan at \\"18 or 19\\" enlisted in the Army Air Corps. Originally scheduled for gunnery school in Boulder, Colorado, plans changed with the war's sudden end. \\"I was going to be an aerial gunner. A bomber. But it never materialized\\", he recalled in 2001. After training at an Army camp near Biloxi, Mississippi, he joined the U.S. forces in the Philippines. There Colan rose to the rank of corporal, drew for the Manila Times, and won an art contest. Upon his return to civilian life in 1946, Colan went to work for Marvel Comics' 1940s precursor, Timely Comics.Sanders, et al. (2008), p 33. He recalled in 2000, Comics historian Michael J. Vassallo identifies that first story as \\"Adam and Eve — Crime Incorporated\\" in Lawbreakers Always Lose #1 (cover date Spring 1948), on which is written the internal job number 2401. He notes another story, \\"The Cop They Couldn't Stop\\" in All-True Crime #27 (April 1948), job number 2505, may have been published first, citing the differing cover-date nomenclature (\\"Spring\\" v. \\"April\\") for the uncertainty.Vassallo, Michael J.

Hired as \\"a staff penciler\\", Colan \\"started out at about $60 a week. ... Syd Shores was the art director\\".Gene Colan interview, Alter Ego #52 (March 2006), p. 66 Due to Colan's work going uncredited, in the manner of the times, comprehensive credits for this era are difficult if not impossible to ascertain. In 2010, he recalled his first cover art being for an issue of Captain America Comics; Colan drew the 12-page lead story in issue #72, the cover-artist of which is undetermined.Captain America Comics #72 at the Grand Comics Database He definitively drew the cover of the final issue, the horror comic Captain America's Weird Tales #75 (Feb. 1950),Brevoort, Tom \\"1950s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 46 which did not include the titular superhero on either the cover or inside.Captain America Comics #75 at the Grand Comics Database After virtually all the Timely staff was let go in 1948 during an industry downturn, Colan began freelancing for National Comics, the future DC Comics. A stickler for accuracy, he meticulously researched his countless war stories for DC's All- American Men at War, Captain Storm, and Our Army at War, as well as for Marvel's 1950s forerunner Atlas Comics, on the series Battle, Battle Action, Battle Ground, Battlefront, G.I. Tales, Marines in Battle, Navy Combat and Navy Tales. Colan's earliest confirmed credit during this time is penciling and inking the six-page crime fiction story \\"Dream Of Doom\\", by an uncredited writer, in Atlas' Lawbreakers Always Lose #6 (Feb. 1949).Lawbreakers Always Lose #6 (Feb. 1949) at the Grand Comics Database By the early 1950s, he was living in New Rochelle, New York.Colan interview, The Comics Journal, p. 2. . Around this time he did his first work for DC Comics, then the industry leader, on the licensed series Hopalong Cassidy, based on the film and TV Western hero, drawing it from 1954 to 1957. In the 1960s, he lived in New Jersey, where his and Adrienne's children, Erik and Nanci, were raised. Tom Palmer, utilizing photomontage. =Silver Age= While freelancing for DC romance comics in the 1960s, Colan did his first superhero work for Marvel under the pseudonym Adam Austin. Taking to the form immediately, he introduced the \\"Sub-Mariner\\" feature in Tales to Astonish,DeFalco, Tom \\"1960s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 109: \\"Prince Namor replaced Giant-Man as the lead feature in Tales to Astonish #70. The Sub-Mariner series was written by Stan Lee and drawn by Gene Colan, who was using the pen name Adam Austin at the time.\\" and succeeded Don Heck on \\"Iron Man\\" in Tales of Suspense. Sometime after Colan began this pseudonymous stint, Marvel editor Stan Lee made overtures to lure him from DC. Colan recalled, Under his own name, Colan became one of the premier Silver Age Marvel artists, illustrating a host of such major characters as Captain America, Doctor Strange (both in the late-1960s and the mid-1970s series), and his signature character, Daredevil. Operating, like other company artists, on the \\"Marvel Method\\" — in which editor-in-chief and primary writer Stan Lee \\"would just speak to me for a few minutes on the phone, tell me the beginning, the middle and the end [of a story] and not much else, maybe four or five paragraphs, and then he'd tell me to make [a 20-page] story out of it,\\" providing artwork to which Lee would then script dialogue and captions — Colan forged his own style, different from that of artists Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, whom Lee would point to as examples of the Marvel style. Lee and Colan introduced the Emissaries of Evil in Daredevil Annual #1 (1967)DeFalco \\"1960s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 124 and the Jester in Daredevil #42 (July 1968).DeFalco \\"1960s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 130: \\"[Stan Lee] and artist Gene Colan introduced Jonathan Powers aka the Jester.\\" Colan's long run on the Daredevil series encompassed all but three issues in an otherwise unbroken, 81-issue string from #20-100 (Sept. 1966 - June 1973), plus the initial Daredevil Annual (1967). He returned to draw ten issues sprinkled from 1974 to 1979, and an eight-issue run in 1997. Colan admitted relying upon amphetamines in order to make deadlines for illustrating the series Doctor Strange, for which he would personally visit the character's real-life Manhattan neighborhood, Greenwich Village, and shoot Polaroid photographs to use as location reference.Colan interview, The Comics Journal, p. 3. . Captain Marvel, a character created to secure the trademark on the name, debuted in Marvel Super-Heroes #12 (Dec. 1967) by Lee and Colan.DeFalco \\"1960s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 125: Captain Mar-Vell was a Kree warrior sent to spy on Earth, by Stan Lee and artist Gene Colan.

The character came about, Colan recalled in 2008, Concurrent with his move to Marvel, Colan also contributed several stories to Warren Publishing's line of black-and-white horror comics magazines, beginning with the six-page tale \\"To Pay the Piper\\", by writer Larry Ivie, in Eerie #2 (March 1966). There and in subsequent stories for that magazine and its sister publication, Creepy, Colan would ink his own pencil work. His final original Warren story, \\"First Blood\\", appeared in Eerie #11 (Sept. 1967). The vast majority of these were written by Warren editor Archie Goodwin, with whom Colan would later collaborate on Marvel's Iron Man. =Dracula and Batman= Colan in the 1970s illustrated the complete 70-issue run of the acclaimedAs discussed in Wolk, Douglas.

Colan, already one of Marvel's most well-established and prominent artists, said he had lobbied for the Tomb of Dracula assignment.

So it made sense for Strange writer Steve Englehart and Tomb author Marv Wolfman to devise a crossover story.\\" In 2010, Comics Bulletin ranked Colan's run on The Tomb of Dracula fifth on its list of the \\"Top 10 1970s Marvels\\". His work on Doctor Strange was ranked ninth on the same list. Colan's collaboration with Steve Gerber on the Howard the Duck series saw the title character nominated by the All-Night Party, a fictional political party, as their nominee in the Presidential campaign of 1976,Sanderson \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 177: \\"Howard the Duck ended up being nominated as [a] presidential candidate!\\" and led to Howard the Duck receiving thousands of write-in votes in the actual election.

I would see something in my mind, and that is what you would draw! I've never had that experience with another artist before or since.\\" Colan returned to DC in 1981, following a professional falling out with Marvel editor-in-chief Jim Shooter . Colan recalled two decades later that Shooter He brought his shadowy, moody textures to Batman, serving as the character's primary artist from 1981 to 1986, penciling most issues of Detective Comics and Batman during this time.

The \\"WW\\" emblem, unlike the eagle, could be protected as a trademark and therefore had greater merchandising potential. Wonder Woman #288 (February 1982) premiered the new costume and an altered cover banner incorporating the \\"WW\\" emblem.Wonder Woman #288 (February 1982) at the Grand Comics Database Colan was one of several artists on Wonder Woman #300 (Feb. 1983)Manning \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 200: \\"The Amazing Amazon was joined by a host of DC's greatest heroes to celebrate her 300th issue in a seventy-two- page blockbuster ...

Inked by Tom Palmer. Colan's style, characterized by fluid figure drawing and extensive use of shadow, was unusual among Silver Age comic artists,Daniels, p. 132 and became more pronounced as his career progressed. He usually worked as a penciller, with Frank Giacoia and Tom Palmer as his most frequent inkers. Colan broke from the mass-market comic book penciller/inker/colorist assembly- line system by creating finished drawings in graphite and watercolor on such projects as the DC Comics miniseries Nathaniel Dusk (1984) and Nathaniel Dusk II (1985–86), and the feature \\"Ragamuffins\\" in the Eclipse Comics umbrella series Eclipse #3, 5, and 8 (1981–83), with frequent collaborator Don McGregor.

Unrealized projects around this time included the Marvel Music comic Elvis: Mystery Train, which went on hold, he said in 1996, \\"when Marvel ran into problems, so everything came to a halt. Right now it's in limbo. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan's son is writing it ...\\" In 1998, Colan and his Tomb of Dracula writing collaborator, Marv Wolfman, reteamed on Dark Horse Comics three-issue miniseries The Curse of Dracula (July-Sept. 1998). Saying the book required \\"a much younger and better-looking Dracula\\" than in their previous series, Colan used \\"my lawn-boy [as] my model. ... I asked him to do the posing and he did.\\"Colan interview, The Comics Journal, p. 4. . For the same company early the next decade, Colan returned to vampires with the 2001 one-shot Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Tales of the Slayers, an omnibus that included writer Doug Petrie's 16-page \\"Nikki Goes Down\\", starring a 1970s vampire slayer seen in one episode of the namesake TV series. Colan penciled the final pages of Blade vol. 3, #12 (Oct. 2007), the final issue of that series, drawing a flashback scene in which the character dresses in his original outfit from the 1970s series The Tomb of Dracula.

It is the fourth-largest library in the world. LAC reports to Parliament through Steven Guilbeault, the Minister of Canadian Heritage since November 20, 2019. History and mandate The Dominion Archives was founded in 1872 as a division within the Department of Agriculture and was transformed into the autonomous Public Archives of Canada in 1912 and renamed the National Archives of Canada in 1987. The National Library of Canada was founded in 1953. Freda Farrell Waldon contributed to the writing of the brief which led to the founding of the National Library of Canada. In 2004, Library and Archives Canada (LAC) combined the functions of the National Archives of Canada and the National Library of Canada. It was established by the Library and Archives of Canada Act (Bill C-8), proclaimed on April 22, 2004. A subsequent Order in Council dated May 21, 2004 united the collections, services and personnel of the National Archives of Canada and the National Library of Canada. Since inception LAC has reported to Parliament through the Minister of Canadian Heritage. LAC's stated mandate is: *to preserve the documentary heritage of Canada for the benefit of present and future generations; *to be a source of enduring knowledge accessible to all, contributing to the cultural, social and economic advancement of Canada as a free and democratic society; *to facilitate in Canada co-operation among communities involved in the acquisition, preservation and diffusion of knowledge; *to serve as the continuing memory of the Government of Canada and its institutions. LAC is expected to maintain \\"effective recordkeeping practices that ensure transparency and accountability\\". Collection LAC's holdings include the archival records of the Government of Canada, representative private archives, 20 million books acquired largely through legal deposit, 24 million photographs, and more than a petabyte of digital content. Some of this content, primarily the book collection, university theses and census material, is available online. Many items have not been digitized and are only available in physical form. As of May 2013 only about 1% of the collection had been digitized, representing \\"about 25 million of the more popular and most fragile items\\". The collection includes: *the proclamation of the Canadian Constitution Act, which bears marks left by raindrops during a ceremony on Parliament Hill in April 1982 when Queen Elizabeth II signed it; *the British North America Act, which features editing changes made by the first Prime Minister of Canada, Sir John A. Macdonald; *the oldest book in the collection, De antiquitate Judaica: De bello Judaico (Antiquities of the Jews and the Judean War), written by first-century historian Flavius Josephus and printed in 1470; *the chair used by world-renowned pianist Glenn Gould while he played and recorded. User profile Genealogists account for 70% of LAC's clients. Facilities The Secret Bench of Knowledge sculpture by Lea Vivot, 395 Wellington Street, Ottawa Preservation Centre, 625 du Carrefour Boulevard, Gatineau The building at 395 Wellington Street in downtown Ottawa is the main physical location where the public may access the collection in person. The building was officially opened on June 20, 1967. With the de-emphasis on physical visits, in-person services have been curtailed, for example since April 2012 reference services are by appointment only, and the role of this building is decreasing. There are also administrative offices in Gatineau and preservation and storage facilities throughout Canada for federal government records. The Preservation Centre in the city centre of Gatineau, about 10 kilometres away from the Ottawa headquarters, was designed to provide a safe environment for the long-term storage and preservation of Canada's valuable collections. It was built at a cost of CDN$107 million, and the official opening took place on June 4, 1997. It is a unique building containing 48 climate-controlled preservation vaults and state-of-the-art preservation laboratories. In 2000, the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada named it one of the top 500 buildings constructed in Canada during the last millennium. A Nitrate Film Preservation Facility on the Communications Research Centre campus in Shirleys Bay, on the outskirts of Ottawa, houses Canada's cellulose nitrate film collection. The collection contains 5,575 film reels dating back to 1912, including some of the first Canadian motion pictures and photographic negatives. The film material is highly sensitive and requires precise temperatures for its preservation. The state-of-the-art facility, which was officially opened on June 21, 2011, is an eco-designed building featuring an environmentally friendly roof that provides better insulation and minimizes energy expenditures. A planned key activity for 2013–14 was to rehouse analogue (non- digital) information resources in a new state-of-the-art high-density storage facility in Gatineau, where the national newspaper collection and records of Second World War veterans will be stored. The facility will feature a high bay metal shelving system with a suitable environment to better protect Canada's published heritage. In January 2019, Library and Archives Canada announced that negotiations for a new facility to be built next to the existing one in Gatineau were starting, with an opening date in 2022. LAC's online collection is accessible via its website and LAC provides ongoing information online via its blog, podcasts, the Twitter and Facebook social networking services, the Flickr image-sharing site, and the YouTube video-sharing site. RSS feeds provide links to new content on the LAC website and news about LAC services and resources. A new modernized website is being developed and is scheduled for completion in 2013, with both new and old websites accessible during the transition period. Modernization and budget cuts In June 2004 LAC issued a discussion paper Creating a New Kind of Knowledge Institution, and after consultation in June 2006 it issued LAC Directions for Change, a document setting out five key directions to define the new institution: *A new kind of knowledge institution *A truly national institution *Working with others to strengthen the whole of Canada's documentary heritage *A prime learning destination *A lead institution in government information management. LAC's modernization policy provides for transformation from an institution focused on the acquisition and preservation of analogue (non-digital) materials to one that excels in digital access and digital preservation. A Documentary Heritage Management Framework developed in 2009 seeks the right balance between resources dedicated to analogue and digital materials and is based on: *three main business pillars: acquisition, preservation and resource discovery (resource discovery includes description, discovery, access and services to the public) *four guiding principles for fulfilling its documentary heritage mandate, i.e. significance, sufficiency, sustainability and society (broad social context) *four key roles, i.e. foundation building (relationship building), collaboration, program (integrated collection management processes) and transfer (formal agreements with third parties to fulfill its legislated mandate). Eight pilot research projects were initiated to validate the framework, including projects on military documentary heritage, aboriginal documentary heritage, and stewardship of newspapers in a digital age. In March 2010 LAC issued its final report on Canadian Digital Information Strategy stakeholder consultations initiated in accordance with its mandate to facilitate co-operation among Canadian knowledge communities. In the same month it issued Shaping Our Continuing Memory Collectively: A Representative Documentary Heritage, a document which outlines how it plans to achieve its modernization objectives. Despite LAC's stated objectives of continuing to fulfill its mandate by adapting to changes in the information environment and collaboration with others, the actual experience since 2004 has been a reduction in both services and collaboration. Federal funding cuts since 2004 have also impacted on LAC services and acquisitions. A detailed timeline of relevant developments and the decline in LAC services since 2004 has been compiled by the Ex Libris Association. =Impact on employees= Following the announcement in the 2012 federal budget of a CDN$9.6 million funding cut over the three years commencing in 2012–13, more than 400 LAC employees received notices which indicated their jobs may be affected and the department announced a 20% reduction of its workforce of about 1,100 over the following three years. The \\"harsh\\" wording of a 23-page code of conduct for employees effective January 2013, which \\"spells out values, potential conflicts of interest and expected behaviours\\", has been criticized by the Association of Canadian Archivists and the Canadian Association of University Teachers among others. The code describes personal activities including teaching and speaking at or attending conferences as \\"high risk\\" activities \\"with regard to conflict of interest, conflict of duties and duty of loyalty\\" and participation in such activities is subject to strict conditions. In a section on duty of loyalty, it also cautions employees about expressing personal opinions in social media forums. Only authorized LAC spokespersons may issue statements or make public comments about LAC's mandate and activities, which includes controversial changes related to modernization and budget cuts. =Public criticism= Changes introduced under the management of Ian E. Wilson and Daniel J. Caron have been the subject of controversy and public criticism. Caron asserted that radical change is needed to cope with the influx and demand for digital material and they are subject to federal budget constraints. * In 2011 the Canadian Association of University Teachers launched the Save Library & Archives Canada campaign. * On May 2, 2012 the Canadian Library Association expressed concern about budget cuts to libraries, both in federal departments and at LAC. * On May 31, 2012 the Association of Canadian Archivists announced its withdrawal from forums of LAC's Pan-Canadian Documentary Heritage Network, stating that it does not believe the network can meet the needs and interests of archives across Canada previously met by the National Archival Development Program abruptly terminated by LAC following the 2012 federal funding cut. * In August 2012 the Bibliographical Society of Canada wrote to every Member of Parliament urging them to ensure budget cuts do not compromise LAC's legislated mandate. In a follow-up letter to Heritage Minister James Moore in November 2012 the Society singled out the termination of interlibrary loans as a particularly harmful decision. * Bibliophile blogger Nigel Beale characterizes LAC as \\"Canada's national disgrace\\" in his blog Literary Tourist. * Academic Ian Milligan describes LAC's \\"rhetoric of modernization\\" as a \\"smokescreen\\" for cutting services in light of the insignificance of and limited accessibility to LAC's online collections on the ActiveHistory.ca website. * Historian Valerie Knowles outlines the impact of government cutbacks at LAC and federal government libraries in her article Closing doors on Canada's history on the iPolitics website. Following Caron's resignation in May 2013, a stakeholder coalition issued a joint statement on the qualities of a successful Librarian and Archivist of Canada for official consideration in what they consider a \\"matter of great national significance\\": In June 2013 the Heritage Minister said speeding up the digitization of records will be a priority for the new Librarian and Archivist of Canada. Moore also said he will ask the person appointed to revisit the termination of the National Archival Development Program.  Truth and Reconciliation Commission  During the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, Library and Archives Canada initially failed to produce records requested by the commission in a timely and comprehensive manner and was ordered by an Ontario Superior Court judge to do so. Ultimately, LAC did provide the records, but many were not in digitized and searchable formats as required by the commission. The Calls to Action of the final report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission explicitly referenced Library and Archives Canada as follows: > \\"We call upon Library and Archives Canada to: fully adopt and implement the > United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the > United Nations Joinet-Orentlicher principles, as related to Aboriginal > peoples' inalienable right to know the truth about what happened and why, > with regard to human rights violations committed against them in the > residential schools; ensure that its record holding related to residential > schools are accessible to the public; [and] commit more resources to its > public education materials and programming on residential schools.\\" Library and Archives Canada has begun to address these concerns by dedicating funding to hire Indigenous archivists, build relationships with Indigenous communities, and support digitization efforts. However, Indigenous-led organizations have drawn attention to the fact that Indigenous communities have been conducting this type of work for decades. LAC also holds and provides access to archival copies of the websites of organizations related to the TRC, in collaboration with the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation, the University of Winnipeg Library, and University of Manitoba Libraries.

It often is easily recognized by the presence of a pair of supraocular \\"horns\\", although hornless individuals do occur. Three subspecies have been described.  Description  The average total length (body and tail) is , with a maximum total length of . Females are larger than males. One of the most distinctive characteristics of this species is the presence of supraorbital \\"horns\\", one over each eye. However, these may be reduced in size or absent (see genus Cerastes). The eyes are prominent and set on the sides of the head. There is significant sexual dimorphism, with males having larger heads and larger eyes than females. Compared to C. gasperettii, the relative head size of C. cerastes is larger and there is a greater frequency of horned individuals (13% versus 48%, respectively).Werner YL, Verdier A, Rosenman D, Sivan N. 1991.

The colour pattern consists of a yellowish, pale grey, pinkish, reddish or pale brown ground colour, which almost always matches the substrate colour where the animal is found. Dorsally, a series of dark, semi-rectangular blotches runs the length of the body. These blotches may or may not be fused into crossbars. The belly is white.

Distribution and habitat  It is found in arid North Africa (Morocco, Mauritania and Mali, eastward through Algeria, Tunisia, Niger, Libya and Chad to Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia and Somalia) through Sinai to the northern Negev. In the Arabian Peninsula, it occurs in Yemen, Kuwait, extreme southwestern Saudi Arabia and parts of the country in Qatar where it is sympatric with C. gasperettii. A report of this species being found in Lebanon is unlikely, according to Joger (1984). A member of this species was reportedly found and killed by locals in urmar graveyard situated on border of Peshawar and Nowshera districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. The incident was reported along with a photo of the dead reptile in 'Aaj' Urdu language newspaper published from the provincial capital Peshawar on September 10, 2019. Originally, the type locality was listed only as \\"Oriente.\\" However, Flower (1933) proposed \\"Egypt\\" by way of clarification. These snakes favor dry, sandy areas with sparse rock outcroppings, and tend not to prefer coarse sand. Occasionally, they are found around oases, and up to an altitude of . Cooler temperatures, with annual averages of 20 °C or less, are preferred.  Behavior  They typically move about by sidewinding, during which they press their weight into the sand or soil, leaving whole-body impressions. Often, it is even possible to use these impressions to make ventral scale counts. They have a reasonably placid temperament, but if threatened, they may assume a C-shaped posture and rapidly rub their coils together. Because they have strongly keeled scales, this rubbing produces a rasping noise, similar to the sound produced by snakes of the genus Echis. In the wild they are typically ambush predators, lying submerged in sand adjacent to rocks or under vegetation. When approached, they strike very rapidly, holding on to the captured prey (small birds and rodents) until the venom takes effect.Photo sequence of Cerastes cerastes feeding in the wild (Gilf Kebir, Egypt, 27 October 2004) at FJ Expeditions accessed 19 October 2013  Reproduction  In captivity, mating was observed in April and always occurred while the animals were buried in the sand. This species is oviparous, laying 8–23 eggs that hatch after 50 to 80 days of incubation. The eggs are laid under rocks and in abandoned rodent burrows. The hatchlings measure 12–15 cm (about 5–6 inches) in total length.  Venom  C. cerastes, with \\"horns\\". Arabian-horned viper without horns from desert of United Arab Emirates. Cerastes cerastes venom is reported to be similar in action to Echis venom. Envenomation usually causes swelling, haemorrhage, necrosis, nausea, vomiting, and haematuria. A high phospholipase A2 content may cause cardiotoxicity and myotoxicity. Studies of venom from both C. cerastes and C. vipera list a total of eight venom fractions, the most powerful of which has haemorrhagic activity. Venom yields vary, with ranges of 19–27 mg to 100 mg of dried venom being reported. For venom toxicity, Brown (1973) gives values of 0.4 mg/kg IV and 3.0 mg/kg SC. An estimated lethal dose for humans is 40–50 mg.  Taxonomy  A number of subspecies have been described: * Cerastes ceraste hoofieni Werner & Sivan, 1999 – Saudi Arabia. * Cerastes ceraste karlhartli Sochurek, 1974 – Egyptian horned viper – southeast Egypt and Sinai Peninsula. * Cerastes ceraste mutila Domergue, 1901 – Algerian horned viper – southwest Algeria, Morocco. Previously, C. gasperettii was also regarded as a subspecies of C. cerastes.  References   Further reading  * Boulenger GA. 1896. Catalogue of the Snakes in the British Museum (Natural History).

It was originally established to maintain London Bridge and, subsequently, other bridges. Funded by bridge tolls and charitable donations, the trust acquired an extensive property portfolio which made it more than self-sufficient. As well as maintaining the bridges, the estates also makes other charitable grants through the City Bridge Trust, their grant-making arm. It is one of three funds managed by the City of London, the other two being the City Fund and the City's Cash. Since it was established, the trust has maintained, and on several occasions replaced, London Bridge. The trust also built Blackfriars Bridge and Tower Bridge, and purchased Southwark Bridge from the toll-exacting private company that built it. Most recently it took over ownership and maintenance of the pedestrian-only Millennium Bridge, having provided a large amount of the funding for its construction. Until 1995, the trust was permitted to use its income only for expenditure on its bridges. However, with a surplus of income over expenditure, a cy-près scheme was adopted in that year to allow any surplus income to be used for other charitable purposes benefiting Greater London. These grants are made though the City Bridge Trust. Bridge House The Trust took its name from Bridge House, which was the administrative and maintenance centre of Old London Bridge located on the south bank of the River Thames, near the site of St Olave's Church (since replaced by St Olaf House in Tooley Street). The site, now covered by the London Bridge Hospital and the Cotton's Centre, was constituted of at least two properties in Southwark. The first was that of Peter of Colechurch the warden of the bridge from 1163, and probably a monastic dwelling. The second property was the house left by will of Henry Fitz Ailwyn, first named Mayor of London, in 1215. The bridge became part of the City's jurisdiction from 1282, and this led to the City attempting to extend control over Southwark, succeeding in acquiring the 'vill of Southwark' alias the Guildable Manor in 1327. Logo The bridge mark of Bridge House Estates City sword rest, formerly in the church of St Olave Southwark, and now in Southwark Cathedral, showing the Bridge Mark Known as the Bridge Mark, the logo of Bridge House Estates is one of the oldest logos in continuous use and can be found carved into stonework in many places along the riverfront. It has been the identifying emblem of the Bridge House Estates for many centuries, but the latter now uses the City of London arms as an emblem. The City Bridge Trust uses the mark as a logo. It was thought likely that the mark as we know it today was designed by a famous 17th-century surveyor, William Leybourn. It appears drawn on a plan of 1680 which it is thought he adapted from a similar mark drawn against plots owned by Bridge House Estates on an earlier plan of St George's Fields in Southwark. The City sword rest from the church of St Olave, Southwark (now in the north transept of Southwark Cathedral) has the Bridge Mark carved onto it to balance the City's shield, and shows a date of 1674.Sharp T: The Origins and Development of the Bridge House Mark: Guildable Manor pubs 2007 independent.academia.edu/TonySharp Governance The trust was established by the grant of a royal charter on 24 May 1282, and the sole trustee is the City of London Corporation. The trustee does not own the property of the trust—it may only be used for the legitimate purposes for which the fund was created. The funding arm of Bridge House Estates is called the City Bridge Trust, which is run by a committee of the City of London Corporation (the City Bridge Trust Committee), the chairmanship of which is held by a Common Councilman on a three-year rotation. The current Chair is Dhruv Patel. In addition to its royal charter of 1282, the Bridge House Estates operates with respect to various legislative powers e.g. the Blackfriars Bridge Act 1863, the Blackfriars and Southwark Bridge Act 1867, the Corporation of London (Tower Bridge) Act 1885 for its maintenance role and for its general charitable role under the Charities (The Bridge House Estates) Order 1995 (Statutory Instrument 1047), and the Charities (The Bridge House Estates) Order 2001 (Statutory Instrument 4017). Finances Originally funded by tolls on London Bridge, the rents and leases of the buildings that were on it and also by charitable donations, the Bridge House Estates acquired an extensive property portfolio which made it self-sufficient. The fund administered by the Bridge House Estates is solely responsible for the five City Bridges. There is no financial support from the government or any other fund. If one of the bridges happened to collapse, the charity would have to rebuild it out of the endowment. The good stewardship of the property and investments of the estates by the City has led to the accumulation of surplus funds over any such demand on its resources. Therefore, the City sought from the Charity Commission to implement a cy-près scheme to extend its objects (purposes) since September 1995 to make charitable grants within the Greater London area. In 2019, total income of the Bridge House Estates was £43.1 million (£ as of ), and total expenditure and reinvestment was £53.1 million (£ as of ). The total funds held by the estates are in excess of £1.5 billion.

Considered an anti-hero of the series, he takes on a variety of roles: a major nemesis to Solid Snake, a friendly rival to Naked Snake, the right-hand man of Liquid Snake and Solidus Snake, and a close ally to Venom Snake. The character has been well received by video game publications for his role as a central villain and antihero in the franchise and has often been considered one of its most important characters for his connections with various characters. Appearances =Metal Gear Solid= is introduced in the video game Metal Gear Solid as a gunslinger-themed member of the FOXHOUND terrorists involved with the hostile revolt on Shadow Moses Island which housed Metal Gear REX, serving as the team's interrogation expert and their leader Liquid Snake's right-hand man. He challenges Solid Snake to a gunfight in the game's first boss encounter, but their fight ends with Ocelot losing his right hand from an encounter with the Cyborg Ninja. Despite his loss, Ocelot later appears to torture Snake after Snake is captured. During Snake's torture, Ocelot reveals he was originally from the former Soviet Union and a former member of Spetsnaz, secretly wishing for Liquid's and Big Boss's dream world as well. Ocelot is the sole surviving member of FOXHOUND by the game's end. After the ending credits, it's revealed that he's in league with the U.S. President George Sears. =Metal Gear Solid 2= Revolver Ocelot, now known as , returns in the sequel Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty after gaining a new surgically attached right arm that originally belonged to Liquid Snake, resulting in a dormant personality which takes over Ocelot's mind whenever Solid Snake is nearby. During the game's introductory Tanker Chapter, he is seemingly under Sergei Gurlukovich's employ, but ends up betraying his old friend when Ocelot hijacks Metal Gear RAY, framing Snake and Otacon for the deed. During the game's main Plant Chapter, Ocelot then forms part of the terrorist group \\"Sons of Liberty\\" with Solidus Snake but ends up betraying the former President as well after revealing his true allegiance to the Patriots, a group that controls the United States. Shortly afterwards, Ocelot is taken over by Liquid and escapes from Snake, Solidus and Raiden to kill the Patriots' leaders. =Metal Gear Solid 3= A young version of the character, known as , is featured in the prequel Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater (set four decades before the original Metal Gear Solid) as a GRU Major under Colonel Volgin's command and the leader of his own \\"Ocelot Unit\\" within GRU. His encounters with Naked Snake are where he acquires preferences for revolvers, due to his tendency to absorb the gun's recoil with his elbow being more suited to shooting revolvers. Throughout the game, Ocelot's constant challenges with Snake eventually turn into a friendly rivalry. He is revealed to be , The Boss's illegitimate child. After the deaths of Volgin and The Boss, Ocelot is revealed to be a triple agent for the Philosophers, working for the KGB while also under the Director of Central Intelligence's direct orders as well and was supposed to intercept and assist Snake, a mission that he failed after another agent of the Philosophers posed as EVA got there first. =Portable Ops= The young version of Ocelot, also known as , plays a minor (yet significant) role in the direct sequel Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops. Initially in league with FOX's insurgency leader Gene, Ocelot assassinates the DCI in order to \\"end\\" the Philosophers and reports to someone that invites him to join the Philosophers' reorganized American branch. =Metal Gear Solid 4= Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots (set directly after Metal Gear Solid and Metal Gear Solid 2) features the character as as a primary antagonist. He deliberately uses self-hypnosis and nanomachines to act as Liquid's mental doppelgänger to trick the Patriots' AIs. As \\"Liquid\\", Ocelot establishes a parent company that runs the four largest PMCs, fighting for the Patriots' control over the world. After hijacking the Patriots' systems, Ocelot's PMCs engage Old Snake. After Snake and Otacon use Naomi Hunter's FOXALIVE virus to delete the Patriots' AIs, Ocelot challenges Snake to a fistfight and appears to die from exhaustion after the final fight; however, Ocelot's death was actually caused by the new FOXDIE strain that Drebin injected into Snake. =Metal Gear Solid V= Revolver Ocelot makes a non-canonical appearance in Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes during the \\"Deja vu\\" sequence. The character canonically appears in Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain to assist Venom Snake and the Diamond Dogs. He plays a key role in facilitating Big Boss's deception, subjecting both himself and Snake to hypnosis to convince themselves Snake is Big Boss, and aiding Big Boss's and Snake's escape from a hospital in Cyprus. Ocelot acts as the Diamond Dogs' interrogator, but frequently clashes with Kazuhira Miller over proving the guilt of the people he interrogates. At the game's end, Ocelot declares his support for Big Boss's plan to wage covert war, foreshadowing his involvement in later Metal Gear Solid games. Character design Introduced in Metal Gear Solid, Ocelot is normally clothed in a duster, spurs and gunbelts, the traditional garb of gunslingers in spaghetti westerns, as well as a black armband on his left arm, and wields the Colt Single Action Army revolver, which he refers to as \\"the greatest handgun ever made\\". Designing the character, Hideo Kojima wanted to add Western tones to a character resulting in Ocelot's appearance, which is based on that of veteran Western film actor Lee Van Cleef.Gamerz-Edge interview with Ryan Payton For Metal Gear Solid 2, Yoji Shinkawa originally intended to give Ocelot a cybernetic arm in place of the one Gray Fox took from him, but this idea was not used as the staff intended to have Ocelot use the arm of Liquid Snake. While Kojima acknowledged fans finding ridiculous the idea of Liquid's arm possessing Ocelot's mind, Kojima promised to answer the reason behind it in Metal Gear Solid 4. Reception The character of Revolver Ocelot has received a positive response by video game publications based on his role as an antagonist. He is one of the only characters to appear in almost every Metal Gear Solid game and is thus considered \\"one of the only characters to have a major role in all five Metal Gear Solid titles\\" by Game Informer.\\"Snakes and Gears: A Metal Gear Overview,\\" Game Informer 182 (June 2008): 107. Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine called Revolver Ocelot underrated in comparison to Final Fantasy VII iconic antagonist Sephiroth, describing Ocelot as \\"just a persistent, sneaky, and cool villain. Heck, just watch the MGS3 trailer and you'll see that he was a badass even in the 60's.\\"OPM staff (September 2004). \\"Overrated/Underrated\\" (SWF transcript ). Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine G4's Filter placed him at number ten in their top list of video game villains in 2002. Ocelot ranked 28th on IGN's top list of video game villains. Ocelot has been frequently featured in the lists of best Metal Gear villains. In 2008, he placed seventh in IGN's top list of Metal Gear Solid boss battles, and second on the top list of Metal Gear villains. Including him on their 2007 list of the best Metal Gear bosses, GameSpot called him one of the most important characters from the story alongside Solid Snake and Big Boss. In 2008, the torture he makes in Metal Gear Solid was listed by GameSpy as one of the best moments from the game due to how Ocelot toys with Snake and how difficult it is to pass it besides how significant is the outcome for the rest of the game. In response to his role in Metal Gear Solid 3, GameSpy called Ocelot one of the \\"series mainstay\\", hoping he would become an entertaining opponent. According to Edge magazine, with Liquid Ocelot \\"Kojima has forged a superb villain, far more complete than in MGS2.\\"Edge staff (July 2008). \\"Review of Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots\\". Edge 190: p. 87 He was also listed by IGN as one of the fictional characters who required his own spin-off. GamesRadar too praised his role as Revolver/Liquid Ocelot, placing as seventh on their 2013 list of best villains in video game history. Ocelot's change to his Liquid Ocelot alter-ego persona of Liquid Snake was opined by GameSpy to be one of the most nonsensical events from the Metal Gear series, but they still praised his action scenes at the start of Metal Gear Solid 2. UGO.com speculated that, because of being born from the medium The Sorrow, Ocelot could communicate with dead people which ended in Liquid Snake taking possession of his body. GamePro described the final fight against Liquid Ocelot as \\"epic\\" even as he became \\"a punching bag\\" in the final phase. Furthermore, UGO.com listed this fight as the seventh best cutscene ever in 2011, owing to the fighting styles employed and the interaction between the two fighters. On the other hand, 1UP.com listed such fight in their article about the 13 \\"most dumbass\\" boss battles for its simple style in comparison to other more challenging bosses from Metal Gear Solid 3 and its excessive length for a hand-to-hand fight between two old people. 1UP.com also listed the scenes from the games in which Liquid Ocelot controls the PMC's weapons to attack the protagonists and his imitation of Liquid Snake's death from Metal Gear Solid as one of the most surprising moments in the game. Ocelot's portrayal in Metal Gear Solid V was met with a mixed response from fans; ScrewAttack criticized him as being \\"too laid-back and mellow compared to his intimidating and sadistic identity as seen in earlier titles; he has no moments in this game to shine\\". Similarly, VentureBeat wrote how he was \\"calm and the voice of reason\\" instead of being an \\"eccentric, sadistic man\\", although theorized that Ocelot was merely being himself and showing his true allegiances with Big Boss, rather than working as a triple agent or being under self-hypnosis akin to his previous appearances.

Properties  HNB has the undesirable property of being moderately sensitive to light and therefore hard to utilize safely. It is not currently used in any production explosives applications, though it is used as a precursor chemical in one method of production of TATB, another explosive. HNB was experimentally used as a gas source for explosively pumped gas dynamic laser.Condensed explosive gas dynamic laser, United States Patent 4099142 In this application, HNB and tetranitromethane are preferred to more conventional explosives because the explosion products CO2 and N2 are a simple enough mixture to simulate gas dynamic processes and quite similar to conventional gas dynamic laser medium. The water and hydrogen products of many other explosives could interfere with vibrational states of CO2 in this type of laser.  Preparation  During World War II a method of synthesis of hexanitrobenzene was suggested in Germany, and the product was supposed to be manufactured on a semi-industrial scale according to the following scheme: :C6H3(NO2)3 → C6H3(NHOH)3 (partial reduction) :C6H3(NHOH)3 → C6(NO2)3(NHOH)3 (nitration) :C6(NO2)3(NHOH)3 → C6(NO2)6 (oxidation) Complete nitration of benzene is practically impossible, because the nitro groups are deactivating groups for further nitration.

The show also ran in 1998 on Fox Family Channel. It is loosely based on the French / Belgian clay animation series of shorts simply titled, Bogus. Each episode is separated into two distinct parts, one using mostly traditional cel-based animation and another using what the show is based on, which are 42 localized versions of the 300 original clay animation shorts (either 8 claymation shorts per episode, 336 in total). Characters often walked around on a kitchen counter having various adventures with common household items. The show has also aired on Channel 4 and The Children's Channel in the UK, on Welsh language channel S4C as \\"Mr. Bogel\\" in Wales, on Rede Globo in Brazil, ANT1 in Greece, on Arutz HaYeladim in Israel as \\"Mr. Bluffer\\", on Max in Australia, on Fun Channel in the Middle East, on M-Net in South Africa, on Bahrain 55 in Bahrain, on TV2 in New Zealand, on ABS-CBN in The Philippines, on Channel 5 in Singapore, on Channel 2 in Jordan, on Dubai 33 in the UAE, on Canal J in France, on Tele 3 and TVP3 in Poland, on kabel eins in Germany, on MBC C&I; in South Korea, on TV3 in Sweden, on PTV4 in Finland, on Saudi 2 in Saudi Arabia, on TV3 in Malaysia and on TV6 in Russia. Summary =Cel-animated version= In the cel-animated version, Mr. Bogus is a yellow gremlin-like creature living in the walls of the suburban home of Tommy Anybody, alternately creating problems and/or accidentally solving them. Sometimes Bogus adventures to his own world, Bogusland, a distorted alternate dimension of curved and warped perspective and bizarre plots. He often encountered the feared dust bunnies known on the show as Dirt Dudes. =Clay animated version= The clay animated version is a series of shorts that are localized versions of several episodes of the 1987 French / Belgian series of shorts simply titled Bogus, and served as lead-ins to commercial breaks. They were originally produced by Antenne 2, Y.C. Aligator Film and Chin Chin Production, and were created by Michel Durieux and Ghislain Honoré. They were first aired on October 30, 1987, and reran from October 2, 1988 to February 1990. There were 300 episodes created, but only 42 were localized and used in the 42 episodes of the cel-animated version.Planète Jeunesse - Bogus In its original 1987 plot, the male house owner woke up by his alarm clock, drank coffee, took his keys and left from home to work. But during his absence, the house wasn't alone. Bogus, a funny little yellow character, fate because of his hiding place and saw a short and fun adventures with surrounding objects. He clumsily discovers the world around them in different rooms of the house (such as the bathroom and the attic) and always provoked laughter from the viewers. In the 1991 localized version, the original voice-acting and background music were changed to Cam Clarke's voice-acting and the instrumental version of the cel-animated version's opening theme.

It is the body's response to an infectious or noninfectious insult. Although the definition of SIRS refers to it as an \\"inflammatory\\" response, it actually has pro- and anti-inflammatory components. Presentation =Complications= SIRS is frequently complicated by failure of one or more organs or organ systems. The complications of SIRS include * Acute kidney injury * Shock * Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome Causes The causes of SIRS are broadly classified as infectious or noninfectious. Causes of SIRS include: * Bacterial infections * Severe malaria * trauma * burns * pancreatitis * ischemia * hemorrhage Other causes include: * Complications of surgery * Adrenal insufficiency * Pulmonary embolism * Complicated aortic aneurysm * Cardiac tamponade * Anaphylaxis * Drug overdose Diagnosis SIRS is a serious condition related to systemic inflammation, organ dysfunction, and organ failure. It is a subset of cytokine storm, in which there is abnormal regulation of various cytokines.Parson, Melissa, Cytokine Storm in the Pediatric Oncology Patient (section \\"Differential Diagnoses and Workup\\", Journal of Peddanana is a good idea and is not the same tric Oncology Nursing, 27(5) Aug/Sep 2010, 253–258. SIRS is also closely related to sepsis, in which patients satisfy criteria for SIRS and have a suspected or proven infection.Sharma S, Steven M. Septic Shock. eMedicine.com, URL: http://www.emedicine.com/MED/topic2101.htm Accessed on Nov 20, 2005. Many experts consider SIRS to be overly sensitive, as nearly all (>90%) of patients admitted to the ICU meet the SIRS criteria.Lord, Janet M., Mark J. Midwinter, Yen-Fu Chen, Antonio Belli, Karim Brohi, Elizabeth J. Kovacs, Leo Koenderman, Paul Kubes, and Richard J. Lilford. \\"The Systemic Immune Response to Trauma: An Overview of Pathophysiology and Treatment.\\" The Lancet 384.9952 (2014): 1455-465. Web. =Adult= Manifestations of SIRS include, but are not limited to: * Body temperature less than 36 °C (96.8 °F) or greater than 38 °C (100.4 °F) * Heart rate greater than 90 beats per minute * Tachypnea (high respiratory rate), with greater than 20 breaths per minute; or, an arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide less than 4.3 kPa (32 mmHg) * White blood cell count less than 4000 cells/mm³ (4 x 109 cells/L) or greater than 12,000 cells/mm³ (12 x 109 cells/L); or the presence of greater than 10% immature neutrophils (band forms). Band forms greater than 3% is called bandemia or a \\"left-shift.\\" When two or more of these criteria are met with or without evidence of infection, patients may be diagnosed with \\"SIRS.\\" Patients with SIRS and acute organ dysfunction may be termed \\"severe SIRS.\\" Note: Fever and an increased white blood cell count are features of the acute-phase reaction, while an increased heart rate is often the initial sign of hemodynamic compromise. An increased rate of breathing may be related to the increased metabolic stress due to infection and inflammation, but may also be an ominous sign of inadequate perfusion resulting in the onset of anaerobic cellular metabolism. =Children= The International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus has proposed some changes to adapt these criteria to the pediatric population.Brahm Goldstein et al., International pediatric sepsis consensus, Pediatric Critical Care Medicine 2005 Vol. 6, No. 1 In children, the SIRS criteria are modified in the following fashion: * Heart rate is greater than 2 standard deviations above normal for age in the absence of stimuli such as pain and drug administration, or unexplained persistent elevation for greater than 30 minutes to 4 hours. In infants, also includes heart rate less than 10th percentile for age in the absence of vagal stimuli, beta-blockers, or congenital heart disease or unexplained persistent depression for greater than 30 minutes. * Body temperature obtained orally, rectally, from Foley catheter probe, or from central venous catheter probe less than 36 °C or greater than 38.5 °C. * Respiratory rate greater than 2 standard deviations above normal for age or the requirement for mechanical ventilation not related to neuromuscular disease or the administration of anesthesia. * White blood cell count elevated or depressed for age not related to chemotherapy, or greater than 10% bands plus other immature forms. Temperature or white blood cell count must be abnormal to qualify as SIRS in pediatric patients. Treatment Generally, the treatment for SIRS is directed towards the underlying problem or inciting cause (i.e. adequate fluid replacement for hypovolemia, IVF/NPO for pancreatitis, epinephrine/steroids/diphenhydramine for anaphylaxis). Selenium, glutamine, and eicosapentaenoic acid have shown effectiveness in improving symptoms in clinical trials. Other antioxidants such as vitamin E may be helpful as well. Septic treatment protocol and diagnostic tools have been created due to the potentially severe outcome septic shock. For example, the SIRS criteria were created as mentioned above to be extremely sensitive in suggesting which patients may have sepsis. However, these rules lack specificity, i.e. not a true diagnosis of the condition, but rather a suggestion to take necessary precautions. The SIRS criteria are guidelines set in place to ensure septic patients receive care as early as possible. In cases caused by an implanted mesh, removal (explantation) of the polypropylene surgical mesh implant may be indicated. History The concept of SIRS was first conceived of and presented by Dr. William R. Nelson, of the Department of Surgery of the University of Toronto at the Nordic Micro Circulation meeting in 1983. The presentation followed a decade of research with colleagues including; Dr. J. Vaage of the University of Oslo, Norway, Dr. D. Bigger, the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Dr. D. Sepro of Boston University, and Dr. H. Movat of the Department of Pathology at the University of Toronto. The laboratory experience was borne out in the clinical setting with Canada's first trauma unit for which Nelson was a co-founder. This allowed in the mid-1980s, the concepts of SIRS to be taught by Dr. Miles Johnson of the University of Toronto, Department of Pathology at the undergraduate dental school, as well as to residents in the Department of Surgery of the University of Toronto who rotated through the Regional Trauma Unit at Sunnybrook Medical Center. SIRS was more broadly adopted in 1991 at the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine Consensus Conference with the goal of aiding in the early detection of sepsis.http://journal.publications.chestnet.org/article.aspx?articleid=1065037 Criteria for SIRS were established in 1992 as part of the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine Consensus Conference. The conference concluded that the manifestations of SIRS include, but are not limited to the first four described above under adult SIRS criteria. In septic patients, these clinical signs can also be seen in other proinflammatory conditions, such as trauma, burns, pancreatitis, etc. A follow-up conference, therefore, decided to define the patients with a documented or highly suspicious infection that results in a systemic inflammatory response as having sepsis. Note that SIRS criteria are non-specific, and must be interpreted carefully within the clinical context. These criteria exist primarily for the purpose of more objectively classifying critically ill patients so that future clinical studies may be more rigorous and more easily reproducible.

According to Street's (1979) description of European lizards and snakes, in those that have keeled scales the keels are usually stronger in male specimens and are consistently arranged according to the species of reptiles, even though many others do not have them. With European lizards, the dorsal scales are usually well keeled, while those on the flanks are more weakly keeled and those on the belly smooth.Street, D. (1979). The Reptiles of Northern and Central Europe. London: B.T. Batsford Ltd. 268 pp. . Klauber (1997), describes how the keels on the scales of Crotalus rattlesnakes are particularly strong mid-dorsally, but gradually weaken on the lateral rows with the ventral scales being smooth. He stated that the function of the keels was uncertain, but that since they reduced shininess, and thus made it easier for the animals to conceal themselves, it afforded them an evolutionary advantage.Klauber, L. M. (1997). Rattlesnakes: Their Habitats, Life Histories, and Influence on Mankind. Second Edition. First published in 1956, 1972. Berkeley: University of California Press. . In some viperines, most notably those of the genus Echis, the lateral scales are not only keeled, but the keels have minute serrations. The snakes use this in a warning and threat display: the body is arranged into a series of parallel C-shaped (counterlooped) coils that they rub together continuously to produce a sizzling sound, rather like water on a hot plate. This method of making sound is called stridulation.Mallow, D., Ludwig, D., Nilson, G. (2003). True Vipers: Natural History and Toxinology of Old World Vipers.

PRAMs exploit the unique behaviour of chalcogenide glass. In the older generation of PCM, heat produced by the passage of an electric current through a heating element generally made of titanium nitride was used to either quickly heat and quench the glass, making it amorphous, or to hold it in its crystallization temperature range for some time, thereby switching it to a crystalline state. PCM also has the ability to achieve a number of distinct intermediary states, thereby having the ability to hold multiple bits in a single cell, but the difficulties in programming cells in this way has prevented these capabilities from being implemented in other technologies (most notably flash memory) with the same capability. Newer PCM technology has been trending in two different directions. One group has been directing a lot of research towards attempting to find viable material alternatives to Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST), with mixed success. Another group has developed the use of a GeTe–Sb2Te3 superlattice to achieve non-thermal phase changes by simply changing the co-ordination state of the Germanium atoms with a laser pulse. This new Interfacial Phase-Change Memory (IPCM) has had many successes and continues to be the site of much active research. Leon Chua has argued that all two-terminal non-volatile-memory devices, including PCM, should be considered memristors. Stan Williams of HP Labs has also argued that PCM should be considered a memristor. However, this terminology has been challenged and the potential applicability of memristor theory to any physically realizable device is open to question. Background In the 1960s, Stanford R. Ovshinsky of Energy Conversion Devices first explored the properties of chalcogenide glasses as a potential memory technology. In 1969, Charles Sie published a dissertation,\\"Memory Devices Using Bistable Resistivity in Amorphous As-Te-Ge Films\\" C. H. Sie, PhD dissertation, Iowa State University, Proquest/UMI publication #69-20670, January 1969\\"Chalcogenide Glass Bistable Resistivity Memory\\" C.H. Sie, A.V. Pohm, P. Uttecht, A. Kao and R. Agrawal, IEEE, MAG-6, 592, September 1970 at Iowa State University that both described and demonstrated the feasibility of a phase- change-memory device by integrating chalcogenide film with a diode array. A cinematographic study in 1970 established that the phase-change-memory mechanism in chalcogenide glass involves electric-field-induced crystalline filament growth.\\"Electric-Field Induced Filament Formation in As-Te-Ge Semiconductor\\" C.H. Sie, R. Uttecht, H. Stevenson, J. D. Griener and K. Raghavan , Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids, 2, 358–370,1970 In the September 1970 issue of Electronics, Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel, published an article on the technology. However, material quality and power consumption issues prevented commercialization of the technology. More recently, interest and research have resumed as flash and DRAM memory technologies are expected to encounter scaling difficulties as chip lithography shrinks. The crystalline and amorphous states of chalcogenide glass have dramatically different electrical resistivity values. The amorphous, high resistance state represents a binary 0, while the crystalline, low resistance state represents a 1. Chalcogenide is the same material used in re-writable optical media (such as CD-RW and DVD-RW). In those instances, the material's optical properties are manipulated, rather than its electrical resistivity, as chalcogenide's refractive index also changes with the state of the material. Although PRAM has not yet reached the commercialization stage for consumer electronic devices, nearly all prototype devices make use of a chalcogenide alloy of germanium, antimony and tellurium (GeSbTe) called GST. The stoichiometry or Ge:Sb:Te element ratio is 2:2:5. When GST is heated to a high temperature (over 600 °C), its chalcogenide crystallinity is lost. Once cooled, it is frozen into an amorphous glass-like state and its electrical resistance is high. By heating the chalcogenide to a temperature above its crystallization point, but below the melting point, it will transform into a crystalline state with a much lower resistance. The time to complete this phase transition is temperature-dependent. Cooler portions of the chalcogenide take longer to crystallize, and overheated portions may be remelted. A crystallization time scale on the order of 100 ns is commonly used.H. Horii et al.,2003 Symposium on VLSI Technology, 177–178 (2003). This is longer than conventional volatile memory devices like modern DRAM, which have a switching time on the order of two nanoseconds. However, a January 2006 Samsung Electronics patent application indicates PRAM may achieve switching times as fast as five nanoseconds. A more recent advance pioneered by Intel and ST Microelectronics allows the material state to be more carefully controlled, allowing it to be transformed into one of four distinct states; the previous amorphic or crystalline states, along with two new partially crystalline ones. Each of these states has different electrical properties that can be measured during reads, allowing a single cell to represent two bits, doubling memory density.A Memory Breakthrough, Kate Greene, Technology Review, 04-Feb-2008 A cross- section of two PRAM memory cells. One cell is in low resistance crystalline state, the other in high resistance amorphous state. PRAM vs. Flash PRAM's switching time and inherent scalability make it most appealing. PRAM's temperature sensitivity is perhaps its most notable drawback, one that may require changes in the production process of manufacturers incorporating the technology. Flash memory works by modulating charge (electrons) stored within the gate of a MOS transistor. The gate is constructed with a special \\"stack\\" designed to trap charges (either on a floating gate or in insulator \\"traps\\"). The presence of charge within the gate shifts the transistor's threshold voltage, \\\\,V_\\\\mathrm{th} higher or lower, corresponding to a 1 to 0, for instance. Changing the bit's state requires removing the accumulated charge, which demands a relatively large voltage to \\"suck\\" the electrons off the floating gate. This burst of voltage is provided by a charge pump, which takes some time to build up power. General write times for common Flash devices are on the order of 100 μs (for a block of data), about 10,000 times the typical 10 ns read time, for SRAM for example (for a byte). PRAM can offer much higher performance in applications where writing quickly is important, both because the memory element can be switched more quickly, and also because single bits may be changed to either 1 or 0 without needing to first erase an entire block of cells. PRAM's high performance, thousands of times faster than conventional hard drives, makes it particularly interesting in nonvolatile memory roles that are currently performance-limited by memory access timing. In addition, with Flash, each burst of voltage across the cell causes degradation. As the size of the cells decreases, damage from programming grows worse because the voltage necessary to program the device does not scale with the lithography. Most flash devices are rated for, currently, only 5,000 writes per sector, and many flash controllers perform wear leveling to spread writes across many physical sectors. PRAM devices also degrade with use, for different reasons than Flash, but degrade much more slowly. A PRAM device may endure around 100 million write cycles. PRAM lifetime is limited by mechanisms such as degradation due to GST thermal expansion during programming, metal (and other material) migration, and other mechanisms still unknown. Apart from limiting the lifetime, the limited write endurance also makes PRAM vulnerable to write attack, since an adversary can repeatedly write to a cell to make it fail.\\"A Survey of Techniques for Improving Security of Non-volatile Memories\\", Mittal et al., Journal of Hardware and Systems Security, 2018 Several researchers have proposed techniques to address this security issue. Flash parts can be programmed before being soldered on to a board, or even purchased pre- programmed. The contents of a PRAM, however, are lost because of the high temperatures needed to solder the device to a board (see reflow soldering or wave soldering). This is made worse by the recent drive to lead-free manufacturing requiring higher soldering temperatures. The manufacturer using PRAM parts must provide a mechanism to program the PRAM \\"in-system\\" after it has been soldered in place. The special gates used in Flash memory \\"leak\\" charge (electrons) over time, causing corruption and loss of data. The resistivity of the memory element in PRAM is more stable; at the normal working temperature of 85 °C, it is projected to retain data for 300 years.Pirovano, A. Redaelli, A. Pellizzer, F. Ottogalli, F. Tosi, M. Ielmini, D. Lacaita, A.L. Bez, R. Reliability study of phase-change nonvolatile memories. IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability. Sept. 2004, vol 4, issue 3, pp. 422–427. ISSN 1530-4388. By carefully modulating the amount of charge stored on the gate, Flash devices can store multiple (usually two) bits in each physical cell. In effect, this doubles the memory density, reducing cost. PRAM devices originally stored only a single bit in each cell, but Intel's recent advances have removed this problem. Because Flash devices trap electrons to store information, they are susceptible to data corruption from radiation, making them unsuitable for many space and military applications. PRAM exhibits higher resistance to radiation. PRAM cell selectors can use various devices: diodes, BJTs and MOSFETs. Using a diode or a BJT provides the greatest amount of current for a given cell size. However, the concern with using a diode stems from parasitic currents to neighboring cells, as well as a higher voltage requirement, resulting in higher power consumption. The chalcogenide resistance being a necessarily larger resistance than the diode entails that the operating voltage must exceed 1 V by a wide margin to guarantee adequate forward bias current from the diode. Perhaps the most severe consequence of using a diode-selected array, in particular for large arrays, is the total reverse bias leakage current from the unselected bit lines. In transistor-selected arrays, only the selected bit lines contribute reverse bias leakage current. The difference in leakage current is several orders of magnitude. A further concern with scaling below 40 nm is the effect of discrete dopants as the p-n junction width scales down. Thin film- based selectors allow higher densities, utilizing < 4 F2 cell area by stacking memory layers horizontally or vertically. Often the isolation capabilities are inferior to the use of transistors if the on/off ratio for the selector is not sufficient, limiting the ability to operate very large arrays in this architecture. Chalcogenide-based threshold switch has been demonstrated as a viable selector for high density PCM arrays I.V. Karpov, D. Kencke, D. Kau, S. Tang and G. Spadini, MRS Proceedings, Volume 1250, 2010 2000 and later In August 2004, Nanochip licensed PRAM technology for use in MEMS (micro- electric-mechanical-systems) probe storage devices. These devices are not solid state. Instead, a very small platter coated in chalcogenide is dragged beneath many (thousands or even millions) of electrical probes that can read and write the chalcogenide. Hewlett-Packard's micro-mover technology can accurately position the platter to 3 nm so densities of more than 1 Tbit (125 GB) per square inch will be possible if the technology can be perfected. The basic idea is to reduce the amount of wiring needed on-chip; instead of wiring every cell, the cells are placed closer together and read by current passing through the MEMS probes, acting like wires. This approach bears much resemblance to IBM's Millipede technology. =Samsung 46.7 nm cell= In September 2006, Samsung announced a prototype 512 Mb (64 MB) device using diode switches.SAMSUNG Introduces the Next Generation of Nonvolatile Memory—PRAM The announcement was something of a surprise, and it was especially notable for its fairly high density. The prototype featured a cell size of only 46.7 nm, smaller than commercial Flash devices available at the time. Although Flash devices of higher capacity were available (64 Gb, or 8 GB, was just coming to market), other technologies competing to replace Flash in general offered lower densities (larger cell sizes). The only production MRAM and FeRAM devices are only 4 Mb, for example. The high density of Samsung's prototype PRAM device suggested it could be a viable Flash competitor, and not limited to niche roles as other devices have been. PRAM appeared to be particularly attractive as a potential replacement for NOR Flash, where device capacities typically lag behind those of NAND Flash devices. (State-of-the-art capacities on NAND passed 512 Mb some time ago.) NOR Flash offers similar densities to Samsung's PRAM prototype and already offers bit addressability (unlike NAND where memory is accessed in banks of many bytes at a time). =Intel's PRAM device= Samsung's announcement was followed by one from Intel and STMicroelectronics, who demonstrated their own PRAM devices at the 2006 Intel Developer Forum in October.Intel Previews Potential Replacement for Flash They showed a 128 Mb part that began manufacture at STMicroelectronics's research lab in Agrate, Italy. Intel stated that the devices were strictly proof-of-concept. =BAE device= PRAM is also a promising technology in the military and aerospace industries where radiation effects make the use of standard non-volatile memories such as Flash impractical. PRAM memory devices have been introduced by BAE Systems, referred to as C-RAM, claiming excellent radiation tolerance (rad-hard) and latchup immunity. In addition, BAE claims a write cycle endurance of 108, which will allow it to be a contender for replacing PROMs and EEPROMs in space systems. =Multi-level cell= In February 2008, Intel and STMicroelectronics revealed the first multilevel (MLC) PRAM array prototype. The prototype stored two logical bits in each physical cell, in effect 256 Mb of memory stored in a 128 Mb physical array. This means that instead of the normal two states—fully amorphous and fully crystalline—an additional two distinct intermediate states represent different degrees of partial crystallization, allowing for twice as many bits to be stored in the same physical area. In June 2011, IBM announced that they had created stable, reliable, multi-bit phase-change memory with high performance and stability. Some tools allow modeling the area/latency/energy of MLC PCM.\\"DESTINY: A Comprehensive Tool with 3D and Multi-level Cell Memory Modeling Capability\\", Mittal et al., JLPEA, 2017 =Intel's 90 nm device= Also in February 2008, Intel and STMicroelectronics shipped prototype samples of their first PRAM product to customers. The 90 nm, 128 Mb (16 MB) product was called Alverstone. In June 2009, Samsung and Numonyx B.V. announced a collaborative effort in the development of PRAM market tailored hardware products. In April 2010, Numonyx announced the Omneo line of 128-Mbit NOR-compatible phase-change memories. Samsung announced shipment of 512 Mb phase-change RAM (PRAM) in a multi-chip package (MCP) for use in mobile handsets by Fall 2010. =Aluminum/antimony= Phase-change memory devices based on germanium, antimony and tellurium present manufacturing challenges, since etching and polishing of the material with chalcogens can change the material's composition. Materials based on Al and Sb are more thermally stable than Ge-Sb-Te. Al50Sb50 has three distinct resistance levels, offering the potential to store three bits of data in two cells as opposed to two (nine states possible for the pair of cells, using eight of those states yields log2 8 = 3 bits). Challenges The greatest challenge for phase-change memory has been the requirement of high programming current density (>107 A/cm², compared to 105...106 A/cm² for a typical transistor or diode). The contact between the hot phase-change region and the adjacent dielectric is another fundamental concern. The dielectric may begin to leak current at higher temperature, or may lose adhesion when expanding at a different rate from the phase-change material. Phase-change memory has high write latency and energy, which present challenge in its use, although recently, many techniques have been proposed to address this issue.\\" A Survey of Power Management Techniques for Phase Change Memory\\", S. Mittal, IJCAET, 2015.\\"A Survey Of Architectural Approaches for Managing Embedded DRAM and Non- volatile On-chip Caches\\", Mittal et al., TPDS, 2015. Phase-change memory is susceptible to a fundamental tradeoff of unintended vs. intended phase-change. This stems primarily from the fact that phase-change is a thermally driven process rather than an electronic process. Thermal conditions that allow for fast crystallization should not be too similar to standby conditions, e.g. room temperature. Otherwise data retention cannot be sustained. With the proper activation energy for crystallization it is possible to have fast crystallization at programming conditions while having very slow crystallization at normal conditions. Probably the biggest challenge for phase-change memory is its long-term resistance and threshold voltage drift.I.V. Karpov, M. Mitra, D. Kau, G. Spadini, Y.A. Kryukov, and V.G. Karpov, J. Appl. Phys. 102, 124503, 2007 The resistance of the amorphous state slowly increases according to a power law (~t0.1). This severely limits the ability for multilevel operation (a lower intermediate state would be confused with a higher intermediate state at a later time) and could also jeopardize standard two-state operation if the threshold voltage increases beyond the design value. In April 2010, Numonyx released its Omneo line of parallel and serial interface 128 Mb NOR flash replacement PRAM chips. Although the NOR flash chips they intended to replace operated in the −40...85 °C range, the PRAM chips operated in the 0...70 °C range, indicating a smaller operating window compared to NOR flash. This is likely due to the use of highly temperature sensitive p–n junctions to provide the high currents needed for programming.

Hydrology and geology A high gradient indicates a steep slope and rapid flow of water (i.e. more ability to erode); where as a low gradient indicates a more nearly level stream bed and sluggishly moving water, that may be able to carry only small amounts of very fine sediment. High gradient streams tend to have steep, narrow V-shaped valleys, and are referred to as young streams. Low gradient streams have wider and less rugged valleys, with a tendency for the stream to meander. Many rivers involve, to some extent, a flattening of the river gradient as approach the terminus at sea level. Fluvial erosion A stream that flows upon a uniformly erodible substrate will tend to have a steep gradient near its source, and a low gradient nearing zero as it reaches its base level. Of course, a uniform substrate would be rare in nature; hard layers of rock along the way may establish a temporary base level, followed by a high gradient, or even a waterfall, as softer materials are encountered below the hard layer. Human dams, glaciation, changes in sea level, and many other factors can also change the \\"normal\\" or natural gradient pattern. Topographic mapping On topographic maps, stream gradient can be easily approximated if the scale of the map and the contour intervals are known. Contour lines form a V-shape on the map, pointing upstream. By counting the number of lines that cross a certain segment of a stream, multiplying this by the contour interval, and dividing that quantity by the length of the stream segment, one obtains an approximation to the stream gradient. Because stream gradient is customarily given in feet per 1000 feet, one should then measure the amount a stream segment rises and the length of the stream segment in feet, then multiply feet per foot gradient by 1000. For example, if one measures a scale mile along the stream length, and counts three contour lines crossed on a map with ten-foot contours, the gradient is approximately 5.7 feet per 1000 feet, a fairly steep gradient.

Although six examples were built, the Aerocar never entered production. Design and development Taylor's design of a roadable aircraft dates back to 1946. During a trip to Delaware, he met inventor Robert E. Fulton, Jr., who had designed an earlier roadable airplane, the Airphibian. Taylor recognized that the detachable wings of Fulton’s design would be better replaced by folding wings. His prototype Aerocar utilized folding wings that allowed the road vehicle to be converted into flight mode in five minutes by one person. When the rear license plate was flipped up, the operator could connect the propeller shaft and attach a pusher propeller. The same engine drove the front wheels through a three-speed manual transmission. When operated as an aircraft, the road transmission was simply left in neutral (though backing up during taxiing was possible by the using the reverse gear.) On the road, the wings and tail unit were designed to be towed behind the vehicle. Taylor also put the propeller on the back of the car, so it would not have to be taken off when the Aerocar went on the road. Aerocars could drive up to 60 miles per hour Just years before his November 1995 death, Molt Taylor was selling plans for his latest version. and have a top airspeed of 110 miles per hour.. Testing and certification Civil certification was gained in 1956 under the auspices of the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA), and Taylor reached a deal with Ling-Temco-Vought for serial production on the proviso that he was able to attract 500 orders. When he was able to find only half that number of buyers, plans for production ended, and only six examples were built, with one still flying as of 2008 and another rebuilt by Taylor into the only Aerocar III. In 2013, the Disney film, Planes honored the design with a character based on the aerocar, Franz aka Fliegenhosen.

From there, he considerably re-built it as the Aerocar III, replacing the original cabin with a sleeker, more streamlined front wheel drive one (although it still fell far short of the sporty lines that Taylor had originally wanted to give it). The automotive unit weighed 1,100 lbs and was powered by a 140 hp Lycoming O-320. The trailer wheels for the wings in towed configuration were deployable from a compartment on the outside of each wing leading edge. The propeller driveshaft contains fine ball bearings that swing outward with centrifugal force, creating stiffness and dampening. The four wheels are fully retractable.

The black hole information paradoxThe short form \\"ínformation paradox\\" is also used for the Arrow information paradox. is a puzzle resulting from the combination of quantum mechanics and general relativity. Calculations suggest that physical information could permanently disappear in a black hole, allowing many physical states to devolve into the same state. This is controversial because it violates a core precept of modern physics--that, in principle, the value of a wave function of a physical system at one point in time should determine its value at any other time. A fundamental postulate of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics is that complete information about a system is encoded in its wave function up to when the wave function collapses. The evolution of the wave function is determined by a unitary operator, and unitarity implies that information is conserved in the quantum sense. As of November 2019, the paradox may have been resolved, at least for simplified models of gravity (see § Recent developments).  Relevant principles  There are two main principles in play: * Quantum determinism means that given a present wave function, its future changes are uniquely determined by the evolution operator. * Reversibility refers to the fact that the evolution operator has an inverse, meaning that the past wave functions are similarly unique. The combination of the two means that information must always be preserved. Starting in the mid-1970s, Stephen Hawking and Jacob Bekenstein put forward theoretical arguments based on general relativity and quantum field theory that not only appeared to be inconsistent with information conservation but which did not account for the information loss and which stated no reason for it. Specifically, Hawking's calculations indicated that black hole evaporation via Hawking radiation does not preserve information. Today, many physicists believe that the holographic principle (specifically the AdS/CFT duality) demonstrates that Hawking's conclusion was incorrect, and that information is in fact preserved. http://iopscience.iop.org/1742-6596/171/1/012009 p.1: \\"The most important departure from conventional thinking in recent years, the holographic principle...provides a definition of quantum gravity...[and] guarantees that the whole process is unitary.\\" In 2004 Hawking himself conceded a bet he had made, agreeing that black hole evaporation does in fact preserve information.  Hawking radiation  The Penrose diagram of a black hole which forms, and then completely evaporates away. Time shown on vertical axis from bottom to top; space shown on horizontal axis from left (radius zero) to right (growing radius). In 1973–75, Stephen Hawking and Jacob Bekenstein showed that black holes should slowly radiate away energy, which poses a problem. From the no- hair theorem, one would expect the Hawking radiation to be completely independent of the material entering the black hole. Nevertheless, if the material entering the black hole were a pure quantum state, the transformation of that state into the mixed state of Hawking radiation would destroy information about the original quantum state. This violates Liouville's theorem and presents a physical paradox. Hawking remained convinced that the equations of black-hole thermodynamics, together with the no-hair theorem, led to the conclusion that quantum information may be destroyed. This annoyed many physicists, notably John Preskill, who in 1997 bet Hawking and Kip Thorne that information was not lost in black holes. The implications that Hawking had opened led to a \\"battle\\" where Leonard Susskind and Gerard 't Hooft publicly 'declared war' on Hawking's solution, with Susskind publishing a popular book, The Black Hole War, about the debate in 2008. (The book carefully notes that the 'war' was purely a scientific one, and that at a personal level, the participants remained friends.) The solution to the problem that concluded the battle is the holographic principle, which was first proposed by 't Hooft but was given a precise string theory interpretation by Susskind. With this, \\"Susskind quashes Hawking in quarrel over quantum quandary\\". There are various ideas about how the paradox is solved. Since the 1997 proposal of the AdS/CFT correspondence, the predominant belief among physicists is that information is preserved and that Hawking radiation is not precisely thermal but receives quantum corrections that encode information about the black hole's interior. This viewpoint received further support in 2019 when researchers amended the computation of the entropy of the Hawking radiation in certain models, and showed that the radiation is in fact dual to the black hole interior at late times. Other possibilities include the information being contained in a Planckian remnant left over at the end of Hawking radiation or a modification of the laws of quantum mechanics to allow for non-unitary time evolution. In July 2004, Stephen Hawking published a paper presenting a theory that quantum perturbations of the event horizon could allow information to escape from a black hole, which would resolve the information paradox. His argument assumes the unitarity of the AdS/CFT correspondence which implies that an AdS black hole that is dual to a thermal conformal field theory. When announcing his result, Hawking also conceded the 1997 bet, paying Preskill with a baseball encyclopedia \\"from which information can be retrieved at will.\\" According to Roger Penrose, loss of unitarity in quantum systems is not a problem: quantum measurements are by themselves already non-unitary. Penrose claims that quantum systems will in fact no longer evolve unitarily as soon as gravitation comes into play, precisely as in black holes. The Conformal Cyclic Cosmology advocated by Penrose critically depends on the condition that information is in fact lost in black holes. This new cosmological model might in the future be tested experimentally by detailed analysis of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB): if true, the CMB should exhibit circular patterns with slightly lower or slightly higher temperatures. In November 2010, Penrose and V. G. Gurzadyan announced they had found evidence of such circular patterns, in data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) corroborated by data from the BOOMERanG experiment. The significance of the findings was subsequently debated by others.  Postulated solutions  *Information is irretrievably lost *:Advantage: Seems to be a direct consequence of relatively non-controversial calculation based on semiclassical gravity. *:Disadvantage: Violates unitarity. (Banks, Susskind and Peskin argued that it also violates energy-momentum conservation or locality, but the argument does not seem to be correct for systems with a large number of degrees of freedom.) *Information gradually leaks out during the black-hole evaporation *:Advantage: Intuitively appealing because it qualitatively resembles information recovery in a classical process of burning. *:Disadvantage: Requires a large deviation from classical and semiclassical gravity (which do not allow information to leak out from the black hole) even for macroscopic black holes for which classical and semiclassical approximations are expected to be good approximations. *Information suddenly escapes out during the final stage of black-hole evaporation *:Advantage: A significant deviation from classical and semiclassical gravity is needed only in the regime in which the effects of quantum gravity are expected to dominate. *:Disadvantage: Just before the sudden escape of information, a very small black hole must be able to store an arbitrary amount of information, which violates the Bekenstein bound. *Information is stored in a Planck-sized remnant *:Advantage: No mechanism for information escape is needed. *:Disadvantage: To contain the information from any evaporated black hole, the remnants would need to have an infinite number of internal states. It has been argued that it would be possible to produce an infinite amount of pairs of these remnants since they are small and indistinguishable from the perspective of the low-energy effective theory. *Information is stored in a large remnant *:Advantage: The size of remnant increases with the size of the initial black hole, so there is no need for an infinite number of internal states. *:Disadvantage: Hawking radiation must stop before the black hole reaches the Planck size, which requires a violation of semi-classical gravity at a macroscopic scale. *Information is stored in a baby universe that separates from our own universe. *:Advantage: This scenario is predicted by the Einstein–Cartan theory of gravity which extends general relativity to matter with intrinsic angular momentum (spin). No violation of known general principles of physics is needed. *:Disadvantage: It is difficult to test the Einstein-Cartan theory because its predictions are significantly different from general-relativistic ones only at extremely high densities. *Information is encoded in the correlations between future and past *:Advantage: Semiclassical gravity is sufficient, i.e., the solution does not depend on details of (still not well understood) quantum gravity. *:Disadvantage: Contradicts the intuitive view of nature as an entity that evolves with time.  Recent developments  In 2014, Chris Adami argued that analysis using quantum channel theory causes any apparent paradox to disappear; Adami rejects Susskind's analysis of black hole complementarity, arguing instead that no space-like surface contains duplicated quantum information. In 2015, Modak, Ortíz, Peña and Sudarsky, have argued that the paradox can be dissolved by invoking foundational issues of quantum theory often referred as the measurement problem of quantum mechanics. This work was built on an earlier proposal by Okon and Sudarsky on the benefits of objective collapse theory in a much broader context. The original motivation of these studies was the long lasting proposal of Roger Penrose where collapse of the wave-function is said to be inevitable in presence of black holes (and even under the influence of gravitational field). Experimental verification of collapse theories is an ongoing effort. In 2016, Hawking et al. proposed new theories of information moving in and out of a black hole. The 2016 work posits that the information is saved in \\"soft particles\\", low-energy versions of photons and other particles that exist in zero-energy empty space. Significant progress was made in 2019, when Penington et al. discovered a class of semiclassical spacetime geometries that had been overlooked by Hawking and subsequent researchers. Hawking's calculation appears to show that the Hawking radiation's entropy increases throughout the lifetime of the black hole. However, if the black hole formed from a known state (zero entropy), the entropy of the Hawking radiation must decrease back to zero once the black hole evaporates completely. Penington et al. compute the entropy using the replica trick, and show that for sufficiently old black holes, one must consider solutions in which the replicas are connected by wormholes. The inclusion of these wormhole geometries prevents the entropy from increasing indefinitely. This result appears to resolve the information paradox, at least in the simple gravity theories that they consider. Although the replicas do not have direct physical meaning, the appearance of wormholes carries over to a physical description of the system. In particular, for sufficiently old black holes, one can perform operations on the Hawking radiation that affect the black hole interior. This result has implications for the related firewall paradox, and resembles the proposed ER=EPR resolution.

In early 1279, as Barakah and Qalawun invaded the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, there was a revolt in Egypt that forced Barakah to abdicate upon his return home. He was succeeded by his brother Solamish, but it was Qalawun, acting as atabeg, who was the true holder of power. Because Solamish was only seven years old, Qalawun argued that Egypt needed an adult ruler, and Solamish was sent into exile in Constantinople in late 1279. As a result, Qalawun took the title al-Malik al-Manṣūr. The governor of Damascus, Sungur, did not agree with Qalawun's ascent to power and declared himself sultan. Sungur's claim of leadership, however, was repelled in 1280, when Qalawun defeated him in battle. In 1281, Qalawun and Sungur reconciled as a matter of convenience when Abaqa Khan, head of the Ilkhanate, invaded Syria. Qalawun and Sungur, working together, successfully repelled Abaqa's attack at the Second Battle of Homs. Barakah, Solamish, and their brother Khadir were exiled to al-Karak, the former Crusader castle. Barakah died there in 1280 (it was rumored that Qalawun had him poisoned), and Khadir gained control of the castle, until 1286 when Qalawun took it over directly. Mamluk diplomacy As Baibars had done previously, Qalawun entered into land control treaties with the remaining Crusader states, military orders and individual lords who wished to remain independent; he recognized Tyre and Beirut as separate from the Kingdom of Jerusalem, now centered on Acre.Crawford, p. 61. The treaties were always in Qalawun's favor, and his treaty with Tyre mandated that the city would not build new fortifications, would stay neutral in conflicts between the Mamluks and other Crusaders, and Qalawun would be allowed to collect half the city's taxes. In 1281 Qalawun also negotiated an alliance with Michael VIII Palaiologos of the Byzantine Empire to bolster resistance against Charles I of Naples, who was threatening both the Byzantine Empire and the Kingdom of Jerusalem. In 1290, he concluded trade alliances with the Republic of Genoa and the Kingdom of Sicily. Wars against the Crusader states Undeterred by the terms of these newly formed peace treaties, Qalawun sacked the \\"impregnable\\" Hospitaller fortress of Margat in 1285, and established a Mamluk garrison there. He also captured and destroyed the castle of Maraclea. He captured Latakia in 1287 and Tripoli on April 27, 1289, thus ending the Crusader County of Tripoli. The Fall of Tripoli in 1289 was spurred by the Venetians and the Pisans, who opposed rising Genoese influence in the area. In 1290, reinforcements of King Henry arrived in Acre and drunkenly slaughtered peaceable merchants and peasants, Christians and Muslims alike. Qalawun sent an embassy to ask for an explanation and above all to demand that the murderers be handed over for punishment. The Frankish response was divided between those who sought to appease him and those who sought a new war. Having received neither an explanation nor the murderers themselves, Qalawun decided that the ten-year truce he had formed with Acre in 1284 had been broken by the Franks. He subsequently besieged the city that same year. He died in Cairo on November 10, before taking the city, but Acre was captured the next year by his son Al-Ashraf Khalil. Despite Qalawun's distrust of his son, Khalil succeeded him following his death. Khalil continued his father's policy of replacing Turkish Mamluks with Circassians, which eventually led to conflict within the Mamluk ranks. Khalil was assassinated by the Turks in 1293, but Qalawun's legacy continued when his younger son, an-Nasir Muhammad, claimed power.

The population in 2011 was 206,479, in an area of 97.40 km2. Cascais is an important tourist destination. Its marina hosts events such as the America's Cup and the town of Estoril, part of the Cascais municipality, hosts conferences such as the Horasis Global Meeting. Cascais's history as a popular seaside resort originated in the 1870s, when King Luís I of Portugal and the Portuguese royal family made the seaside town their residence every September, thus also attracting members of the Portuguese nobility, who established a summer community there. Cascais is known for the many members of royalty who have lived there, including King Edward VIII of the United Kingdom, King Juan Carlos I of Spain, and King Umberto II of Italy. Exiled Cuban president Fulgencio Batista was also once a resident of the municipality. The Casino Estoril inspired Ian Fleming's first James Bond novel Casino Royale. The municipality is one of the wealthiest in both Portugal and the Iberian Peninsula.

Human settlement of the territory today known as Cascais dates to the late Paleolithic, as indicated by remnants encountered in the north of Talaíde, in Alto do Cabecinho (Tires) and south of Moinhos do Cabreiro. It was during the Neolithic that permanent settlements were established in the region, their inhabitants utilizing the natural grottoes (such as the Poço Velho in Cascais) and artificial shelters (like those in Alapraia or São Pedro) to deposit their dead. The bodies were buried along with offerings, a practice that continued to the Chalcolithic. Roman interventions in the area occurred with the settlement of the villae of Freiria (today São Domingos de Rana) and Casais Velhos (Charneca), evidence for which includes a group of ten tanks discovered along the Rua Marques Leal Pancada in Cascais, which was the location of a salting factory for fish. Roman dominion over the territory also influenced place names in the region, as was the case with the word \\"Caparide\\" (from the Latin capparis, meaning \\"caper\\"), as well as several inscriptions associated with funerary graves. Similarly, Muslim settlers in the region left their mark on local place names, including \\"Alcoitão\\" and \\"Alcabideche\\", where the romantic poet Ibn Muqana al- Qabdaqi, who wrote of the region's agriculture and windmills, was born at the beginning of the 11th century. The development of Cascais began in earnest in the 12th century, when it was administratively subordinate to the town of Sintra, located to the north. In its humble beginnings, Cascais depended on the products of the sea and land, but by the 13th century its fish production was also supplying the nearby city of Lisbon. The toponym \\"Cascais\\" appears to derive from this period, a plural derivation of cascal (monte de cascas) which signified a \\"mountain of shells\\", referring to the abundant volume of marine mollusks harvested from the coastal waters. During the 14th century, the population spread outside the walls of its fortress castle. King Peter I statue). The settlement's prosperity led to its administrative independence from Sintra in 1364. On 7 June 1364, the people of Cascais obtained from King Peter I the elevation of the village to the status of town, necessitating the appointment of local judges and administrators. The townspeople were consequently obligated to pay the Crown 200 pounds of gold annually, as well as bearing the expense of paying the local administrators' salaries. Owing to the regions' wealth, these obligations were easily satisfied. The town and the surrounding lands were owned by a succession of feudal lords, the most famous of whom was João das Regras (died 1404), a lawyer and professor of the University of Lisbon who was involved in the ascension of King John I to power as the first King of the House of Aviz. The castle of Cascais was likely constructed during this period, since by 1370, King Ferdinand had donated the castle and Cascais to Gomes Lourenço de Avelar to hold as a seigneurial fiefdom. These privileges were then passed on to his successors, among them João das Regras and the Counts of Monsanto, and later the Marquess of Cascais. Meanwhile, despite its conquest and sack by Castilian forces in 1373, and blockade of the port in 1382 and 1384, Cascais continued to grow beyond its walls. By the end of the 14th century this resulted in the creation of the parishes of Santa Maria de Cascais, São Vicente de Alcabideche and São Domingos de Rana. A 1572 sketch of the coast of Cascais. View of the Count's of Castro Guimarães Palace in Cascais, Portugal. Condes de Castro Guimarães Museum From the Middle Ages onward, Cascais depended on fishing, maritime commerce (it was a stop for ships sailing to Lisbon), and agriculture, producing wine, olive oil, cereals, and fruits. Due to its location at the mouth of the Tagus estuary, it was also seen as a strategic post in the defence of Lisbon. Around 1488, King John II built a small fortress in the town, situated by the sea. On 15 November 1514, Manuel I conceded a foral (charter) to Cascais, instituting the region's municipal authority. It was followed on 11 June 1551 by a license from King John III to institutionalise the Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Cascais. The town's medieval fortress was inadequate to repel invasions, and in 1580 Spanish troops led by the Duque of Alba took the village during the conflict that led to the union of the Portuguese and Spanish crowns. The fortress was enlarged towards the end of the 16th century by King Philip I (Philip II of Spain), turning it into a typical Renaissance citadel with the characteristic flat profile and star- shaped floorplan. Following the Portuguese restoration in 1640, a dozen bulwarks and redoubts were constructed under the direction of the Count of Cantanhede, who oversaw the defences of the Tagus estuary, the gateway to the city of Lisbon. Of these structures, the citadel of Cascais, which was constructed alongside the fortress of Our Lady of Light, considerably reinforced the strategic defences of the coast. In 1755, the great Lisbon earthquake destroyed a large portion of the city. Around 1774, the Marquis of Pombal, prime-minister of King José I, took protective measures for the commercialisation of the wine of Carcavelos and established the Royal Factory of Wool in the village, which existed until the early 19th century. During the invasion of Portugal by Napoleonic troops in 1807, the citadel of Cascais was occupied by the French, with General Junot staying some time in the village. The citadel decayed gradually until King Luís I decided to make Cascais into his summer residence. From 1870 to 1908, the Portuguese royal family from the House of Braganza-Saxe-Coburg and Gotha stayed in Cascais to enjoy the sea, turning the quiet fishing village into a cosmopolitan address. Thanks to King Luís, the citadel was equipped with the country's first electric lights in 1878. Cascais also benefited with the construction of better roads to Lisbon and Sintra, a bullfight ring, a sports club, and improvements to basic infrastructure for the population. Many noble families built impressive mansions in an eclectic style commonly referred to as summer architecture, many of which are still to be seen in the town centre and environs. The first railway arrived in 1889. Another important step in the development of the area was made in the first half of the 20th century with the building of a casino and infrastructure in neighbouring Estoril. In 1882 Cascais installed one of the first tide gauges in Europe in order to assist with navigation into the port of Lisbon. In 1896, King Carlos I, a lover of all maritime activities, installed in the citadel the first oceanographic laboratory in Portugal. The King himself led a total of 12 scientific expeditions to the coast; these ended in 1908 with his assassination in Lisbon. Due to Portugal's neutrality in World War II and the town's elegance and royal past, Cascais became home to many of the exiled royal families of Europe, including those of Spain (House of Bourbon), Italy (House of Savoy), Hungary and Bulgaria. Their stories are told at the Exiles Memorial Centre. Nowadays, Cascais and its surroundings are a popular vacation spot for the Portuguese as well as for the international jet set and regular foreign tourists, all of them drawn by its fine beaches. The town hosts many international events, including sailing and surfing. In 2018 it was the European Youth Capital. Geography Horasis Global Meeting Reception at the Hotel Palácio Estoril, 2016. Cascais is situated on the western edge of the Tagus estuary, between the Sintra mountains and the Atlantic Ocean; the territory occupied by the municipality is limited in the north by the municipality of Sintra, south and west by the ocean, and east by the municipality of Oeiras. Administratively, the municipality is divided into 4 civil parishes (freguesias), with municipal authority vested in the Câmara Municipal of Cascais: * Alcabideche * Carcavelos e Parede * Cascais e Estoril * São Domingos de Rana Cascais' coastline is home to 17 beaches. These are: Guincho Beach and Carcavelos Beach are especially well known as good surf spots. Close to Praia do Guincho is the Cresmina Dune, which is an unstable dune system due to the constant drifting of sand particles caused by strong winds. Economy Praia da Rainha (Queen's Beach), a beach in the centre of Cascais. Saint Martha's Lighthouse and the House of Saint Mary (Casa de Santa Maria) Cascais is easily reached from Lisbon by car on the A5 Lisbon-Cascais highway, or alternatively on the scenic \\"marginal\\" road, as well as by frequent inexpensive commuter trains. Taxis are also a common and inexpensive mode of transport in the area. The city has the ruins of a castle, an art museum and an ocean museum, as well as parks and the charming cobbled streets of the historic centre. The town has many hotels and tourist apartments as well as many good restaurants of varying cost. It is a fine base to use for those visiting Lisbon and its environs who prefer to stay outside of the city yet in an equally urban and sophisticated environment. Cascais ranks 9th in population density and 6th in percentage of population employed among Portuguese municipalities. Cascais is surrounded by popular beaches. Guincho Beach to the northwest is primarily a surfing, windsurfing, and kitesurfing beach because of the prevailing winds and sea swells, while the calm waters of the beaches to the east attract sunbathers. The lush Sintra mountains to the north are a further attraction. The shoreline to the west has cliffs, attracting tourists who come for the panoramic views of the sea and other natural sights such as the Boca do Inferno. It is also becoming a popular golf destination, with over 10 golf courses nearby. A large marina with 650 berths was opened in 1999 and has since held many sailing events. It was the official host of the 2007 ISAF Sailing World Championships for dinghies and racing yachts. The municipality also hosts international tennis and motorcycling events and for many years hosted the FIA F1 Portugal Grand Prix at the Estoril race track. The Estoril Casino is one of the largest in Europe. Near the casino is the \\"Hotel Palácio\\" (Palace Hotel), where scenes of the James Bond movie On Her Majesty's Secret Service were shot. In 2017 the municipality started charging a small tourist tax, as the city had become one of the most visited destinations in Portugal. It is estimated that around 1.2 million tourists stay in the city's hotels each year (2016). The Cascais Aerodrome in Tires (São Domingos de Rana) serves general aviation and also offers domestic scheduled flights by Aero VIP.

The Cascais Experimental Theatre was established in 1965 and has presented more than a hundred shows since then. Over the years Cascais has developed several art galleries and museums. These are concentrated in a relatively small area of the town, mainly in parkland. Combined, they are known as The Museum Quarter. Several occupy large buildings that were formerly private residences and were subsequently taken over and restored by the Municipality. Entrance is either free or for a small fee (usually not more than €4). The galleries and museums are: Art galleries *Casa das Histórias Paula Rego.

The skin of a fully ripe Alphonso mango turns bright golden-yellow with a tinge of red which spreads across the top of the fruit. The flesh of the fruit is saffron- colored. These characteristics make Alphonso a favored cultivar. =Culinary= Mango sorbet, ice cream, lassi, soufflé, mousse, and puree are some culinary preparations using Alphonso mangoes. Trade The Alphonso is prized in domestic and international markets for its taste, fragrance and vibrant color. It is exported to various countries, including Japan, Korea and Europe. = Import bans = An import ban imposed in 1989 by the United States on Indian mangoes, including the Alphonso, was lifted only in April 2007. However, the mangoes needed to be treated before entering the country in order to stop the introduction of non-native fruit flies, destructive fungi, and other pests that could harm American agriculture. The European Union imposed a ban beginning in April 2014 on import of mangoes after finding \\"non-European fruit flies\\" in some consignments, creating a significant threat to UK salad crops. The Indian government had described this decision as arbitrary and businesses claimed they would suffer financial losses due to the ban. In January 2015, the European Commission lifted the ban following significant improvements in the Indian mango export system.

The company was founded as Autogen-Gas-Akkumulator-AG in Berlin in 1909 as the German subsidiary of the Swedish company Aktiebolaget Gasaccumulator, since 2000 a part of the German Linde group. During World War I the company produced parts for machine-guns, and had a new factory constructed on Herzbergstraße in the suburb of Lichtenberg. The company was rebranded as Aktiengesellschaft für Automobilbau in 1920, but AGA was refounded at the same time, so that both gas and automotive versions of the company existed simultaneously. In 1922 AGA became part of Stinnes-trust. AGA continued to be active after 1945 in West Berlin. Those data are based on the commercial register in the Berlin Landesarchiv.Merz, Automobil des Nobelpreisträgers The first car, the Typ A of 1919, had a 1418 cc four-cylinder engine driving the rear wheels through a three-speed manual transmission. The later Typ C followed in 1921 with the same configuration, and its engine gave a maximum of as did the Typ A. The Typ C extended the wheelbase from to , increased the engine's power output to , and even added brakes to all four wheels.Oswald, pp 38 & 39 Only very few cars of that kind were built.

This type had in the very beginning .Oswald, p 39 The car was without much obvious technical ambition, but it was robust and inexpensive for its size, becoming popular especially with small business owners despite its dire brakes.Oswald, p 38 In several cities, including Berlin and Breslau, it was for some time a popular car for use as a taxi.Oswald, p 38 After the death of Hugo Stinnes in 1924, AGA ran into cashflow difficulties, which ended in the company's bankruptcy at the end of 1925. Stinnes' son Edmund had been trying to implement a very expensive assembly line production at AGA, but never finished the project. There were also plans for a small 850cc car to be built under licence from Singer Motors, and a six-cylinder model, but these never reached the production stage. However, production from 1926 was severely curtailed, and ended in 1929. By that time between 8,000 and 12,000 AGA cars were produced.Merz, AGA-Wagen, p 176 AGA cars featured in a number of races, with notable Willy Loge as one of the drivers. For the 1924 Targa Florio AGA produced a small number of the TF 6/30 PS sports cars featuring a 1490cc engine. AGA won many races and was entered in the 1926 German Grand Prix. Other racers also drove AGA cars. The Swedish company Thulin made around a hundred AGA cars under licence between 1920 and 1924. References * Kai-Uwe Merz: Der AGA-Wagen.

Typically made of linen, silk, or cotton, and appropriate for hot or humid weather, guayaberas are popular in Cuba, the Caribbean (especially the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico), Mexico, Central America, South America, Southeast Asia, the south of Spain and Portugal. Design alforzas The design of a typical guayabera is distinguished by several details: * Long or short sleeves, the more common being the short-sleeved version, having a cuffed sleeve with a single decorative button. * Either two or four patch pockets and two vertical rows of alforzas (fine, tiny pleats, usually ten, sewn closely together) run down the front and three down the back of the shirt. The pockets are detailed with alforzas that are identical to, and aligned with, the alforzas on the body of the shirt. * The top of each pocket is usually adorned with a matching shirt button, as are the bottoms of the alforza pleats. Vertical rows of adjusting buttons are often used at the bottom hem. While most versions of the design have no placket covering the buttons, a few newer designs do. * Some shirt designs include slits on either side, and these include two or three buttons. The bottom has a straight hem, and is never tucked into the trousers. Though traditionally worn in white and pastels, guayaberas are now available in many solid colors. Black guayaberas, embroidered with colorful flowers and with French cuffs, have for many decades been extremely popular in Mexico and are considered formalwear in some situations. Mexican guayaberas often use complicated embroidery as a supplement to the traditional alforzas. This style originated in Mérida, Mexico. History Cuban man wearing a guayabera c. 1956. The exact origin of the garment is unknown, although some sources attribute the shirt to the people of the Philippines who introduced the design to Mexico. Specifically, the design is believed to be from the lace-like white Philippine barong Tagalog, which has documented origins in the Philippines prior to the arrival of the Spanish. It made its way to Cuba through Mexico via the Manila-Acapulco galleon trade (AD 1565 to 1815). Men wearing white filipina shirts in the traditional jarana Yucateca dance of Yucatán, Mexico Some scholars dispute the Philippine origin based on perceived design differences. The barong traditionally does not have pockets and has an intricate U-shaped embroidery around the chest (the pechera) which is mostly absent in Cuban guayaberas. Guayaberas are also made from linen or cotton, and not the expensive piña or abacá sheer fabrics used in formal barong (although informal barong worn by the lower classes in the Philippines use common opaque fabrics like linen). However, guayaberas in Mexico also have chest designs like pleats and embroidery similar to the barong (and in contrast to Cuban guayaberas); and they can range from having no pockets, to having one, two, or four. This is the reason why Mexicans also claim that it originated from either the state of Veracruz or the Yucatán Peninsula. In Mexico, the same basic style is also known as the \\"camisa de Yucatán\\" (Yucatán shirt) or \\"wedding shirt\\". Regardless, a clearer line of evidence is that guayaberas are actually also referred to as \\"filipinas\\" in Yucatán, Mexico, with the former regarded as a variant of the latter. The only difference between the two is the type of collar used. Filipinas have a collar similar to the Nehru or mandarin-style (a style known as the baro cerrada in the 19th-century Philippines), while guayaberas have a more typical spread collar. Both filipinas and the derivative guayaberas were the traditional everyday men's shirts in Yucatán since the mid-19th century, before they were replaced by western shirts in the early 20th century. The white filipina shirt is still regarded as the traditional formal dress for men in Yucatán, along with the terno for women (cf. traje de Mestiza of the Philippines). In particular, white filipinas are the traditional shirts worn for the jarana Yucateca dance, paired with white trousers. This suggests an origin from the Philippines that entered Mexico early during the colonial period through Yucatán then to Cuba, where it was later adapted to local fashion and materials. Cubans also claim the guayabera originated from Cuba. Cuban literature refers to the shirt from 1893, and documentary evidence mentions the shirt in Cuba as early as 1880. The Cuban origin story tells of a poor countryside seamstress sewing large patch-pockets onto her husband's shirts for carrying guava (guayabas) from the field. In another version of the story, in 1709 Spanish immigrants from Granada, José Pérez Rodríguez and his wife Encarnación Núñez García arrived in Sancti Spiritus, located along the Yayabo River. José asked his wife to make him a shirt with long sleeves and four large pockets to store his cigars and belongings while he worked. Because it was easy to make and useful, it soon became a popular garment in use in that region. Another belief is that the name guayabera is said to have originated from the word yayabero, the nickname for those who lived near the Yayabo River in Cuba.  Wear and use  Former United States Secretary of State John Kerry and Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos wear guayaberas while discussing an upcoming peace treaty. The guayabera is often worn in formal contexts, such as offices and weddings. In Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, and Puerto Rico, guayaberas are part of the traditional wear for men and may be considered formalwear. In 2010, Cuba reinstated the guayabera as the \\"official formal dress garment\\". Political symbolism Tsai in guayabera gifted by Panama's first lady. Guayaberas have been worn extensively by a number of Latin American political leaders, including Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, Cesar Chavez, Carlos Prío Socarrás, and Fidel Castro. This is often interpreted as a sign of the wearer's affiliation with populist political positions. Michael Manley, populist Jamaican prime minister, specifically advocated for the guayabera as an anti-colonialist mode of dress, and conversely the shirt was later banned in Parliament by the conservative Jamaica Labour Party. Similarly, Mexican left-wing populist Luis Echeverría advocated for its use in Mexico in part to symbolize rejection of European and American-style business suits. U.S. presidents, including Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Barack Obama, have worn the shirts as a sign of solidarity when visiting the Cuban community in Miami and when attending Latin American summits. Visiting politicians are sometimes given the shirts by Cuban American or Latin American political leaders. Similar shirts and alternative names A variety of similar, lightweight dress shirts exist in other tropical countries. These include: * In the Dominican Republic: guayaberas are referred to as \\"chacabana\\". * In Guyana: a similar or identical shirt is called a \\"shirt-jac\\". * In Trinidad and Tobago, physicians often wear them because of their practicality; one pocket for pens, one for a prescription pad, another for a stethoscope, etc. * In Jamaica: the guayabera is called a \\"bush jacket\\". * In the Philippines: the barong Tagalog shirt has some features which are similar to the guayabera: it is long-sleeved, light, traditionally white, and worn without being tucked in. However, the most traditional styles are decorated with \\"U\\" shaped embroidery (called the pechera), rather than the guayabera's straight pleats, and lack pockets. It is also traditionally made of hand-woven, fine, translucent piña or jusi fiber, rather than linen. * In America: the Western shirts with pointed yokes and elaborate embroidery were directly copied from the guayaberas of 19th century Mexican vaqueros.The Western shirt\\"The Cowboys\\", part of Time and Life: The Old West (1973) These serve as the national costume of the Southwestern United States.The evolution of Western wearCowboy clothing See also * Mantón de Manila  References   External links  Category:Caribbean clothing Category:Latin American clothing Category:Folk costumes Category:Tops (clothing) ","title":"Guayabera"},{"id":"851040","text":"Soyuz TM-14 was the 14th expedition to the Mir space station.The full mission report is available here: http://www.spacefacts.de/mission/english/soyuz- TM-14.htm It included an astronaut from Germany, and was the first Russian Soyuz mission after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

At its western end it joins the larger Queen Charlotte Sound, which it meets halfway along the latter's length. Its eastern end meets Cook Strait close to the strait's narrowest point. Tory Channel / Kura Te Au forms a substantial part of the ferry route between Wellington and Picton.

Plot summary Dilvish is the descendant of both elves and humans, a scion of a prominent Elven house and \\"the Human House that hath been stricken\\" which lost its peerage for mixing Elven and Human blood. Hundreds of years before the main story, he comes across a dark ritual being performed by the sorcerer Jelerak who is sacrificing a human girl. He attempts to stop the ritual but is turned into stone, with his soul banished to Hell. His body became a statue, and for many decades it resided within the square of a nearby town that he had formerly saved from enemy conquerors. When this town is again in need of a hero, their citizens' plight allows Dilvish the passage he needed to escape from Hell. He returns to the world of the living with his steed, the metal demon horse Black, and a burning desire for revenge against Jelerak, but must first repulse the assault against the endangered town. Dilvish then goes to call upon the Shoredan - a cursed people bound to his family. He searches for Jelerak in the Tower of Ice and finds the sorcerer's apprentice and his sister trapped there.

It was the successor to the Tiny made by Nanson, Barker & Co in the same town from 1911 until the outbreak of war in 1914. History After the war in 1919 a larger car was developed and the company name changed to Airedale. This new model was rated at 12 hp and had a 1795 cc four-cylinder overhead-valve Dorman KNO engine with Zenith carburettor producing at 1500 rpm. Drive to the rear wheels was through a four-speed gearbox and plate clutch. The car had a wheelbase of and overall length of with conventional half elliptic leaf springs all round. It seems to have also been known as the 12/24 and 11.9 hp. In 1922 they had sufficient confidence to take a stand at the London Motor Show and the name of the company was changed from Nanson, Barker and Company to Airedale Cars. The cars at the show were priced at £575 for a special coupé, £435 for a 4-seat tourer, £425 for a 2-seater with dickey and £375 for a bare chassis. A larger Meadows engine of 2120 cc was offered in the similar 14hp model from 1922. This car was slightly larger with a wheelbase and total length. A bare chassis was £360, an open two-seater cost £425 and a limousine £625. Apart from the engines nearly all parts including gearboxes were made on site by Airedale themselves. The cars were very well finished and equipped, which made them expensive. Approximately 90 cars were made, about 55 of the 12 hp and 35 of the 14 hp models. The company went into liquidation in September 1924, a revival was attempted in 1927 but also failed. No cars are known to survive.

Beached whales often die due to dehydration, collapsing under their own weight, or drowning when high tide covers the blowhole. Cetacean stranding has occurred since before recorded history. Several explanations for why cetaceans strand themselves have been proposed, including changes in water temperatures, peculiarities of whales' echolocation in certain surroundings, and geomagnetic disturbances, but none have so far been universally accepted as a definitive reason for the behavior. However, a link between the mass beaching of beaked whales and use of mid- frequency active sonar has been found. Species Beached false killer whales at Flinders Bay, Western Australia, 1986 Every year, up to 2,000 animals beach themselves. Although the majority of strandings result in death, they pose no threat to any species as a whole. Only about ten cetacean species frequently display mass beachings, with ten more rarely doing so. All frequently involved species are toothed whales (Odontoceti), rather than baleen whales (Mysticeti). These species share some characteristics which may explain why they beach. Body size does not normally affect the frequency, but both the animals' normal habitat and social organization do appear to influence their chances of coming ashore in large numbers. Odontocetes that normally inhabit deep waters and live in large, tightly knit groups are the most susceptible. This includes the sperm whale, oceanic dolphins, usually pilot and killer whales, and a few beaked whale species. The most common species to strand in the United Kingdom is the harbour porpoise; the common dolphin ( Delphinus delphis) is second-most common, and after that pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus). Solitary species naturally do not strand en masse. Cetaceans that spend most of their time in shallow, coastal waters almost never mass strand. Causes Strandings can be grouped into several types. The most obvious distinctions are between single and multiple strandings. Many theories, some of them controversial, have been proposed to explain beaching, but the question remains unresolved. ;Natural deaths at sea: The carcasses of deceased cetaceans are likely to float to the surface at some point; during this time, currents or winds may carry them to a coastline. Since thousands of cetaceans die every year, many become stranded posthumously. Most carcasses never reach the coast, and are scavenged, or decompose enough to sink to the ocean bottom, where the carcass forms the basis of a unique local ecosystem called a whale fall. ;Individual strandings: Single live strandings are often the result of individual illness or injury; in the absence of human intervention these almost inevitably end in death. ;Multiple strandings: Multiple strandings in one place are rare, and often attract media coverage as well as rescue efforts. The strong social cohesion of toothed whale pods appears to be a key factor in many cases of multiple stranding: If one gets into trouble, its distress calls may prompt the rest of the pod to follow and beach themselves alongside. Even multiple offshore deaths are unlikely to lead to multiple strandings, since winds and currents are variable, and will scatter a group of corpses. =Environmental= Three Beached Whales, a 1577 engraving by the Flemish artist Jan Wierix, depicts stranded sperm whales. Note the incorrectly recorded \\"nostril\\" and plausible extruded penis. \\"The Whale beached between Scheveningen and Katwijk, with elegant sightseers\\", by Esaias van de Velde, Whales have beached throughout human history, with evidence of humans salvaging from stranded sperm whales in southern Spain during the Upper Magdalenian era some 14,000 years before the present. Some strandings can be attributed to natural and environmental factors, such as rough weather, weakness due to old age or infection, difficulty giving birth, hunting too close to shore, or navigation errors. In 2004, scientists at the University of Tasmania linked whale strandings and weather, hypothesizing that when cool Antarctic waters rich in squid and fish flow north, whales follow their prey closer towards land. In some cases predators (such as killer whales) have been known to panic other whales, herding them towards the shoreline. Their echolocation system can have difficulty picking up very gently-sloping coastlines. This theory accounts for mass beaching hot spots such as Ocean Beach, Tasmania and Geographe Bay, Western Australia where the slope is about half a degree (approximately deep out to sea). The University of Western Australia Bioacoustics group proposes that repeated reflections between the surface and ocean bottom in gently sloping shallow water may attenuate sound so much that the echo is inaudible to the whales. Stirred up sand as well as long-lived microbubbles formed by rain may further exacerbate the effect. A 2017 study by scientists from Germany's University of Kiel suggests that large geomagnetic disruptions of the Earth's magnetic field, brought on through solar storms, could be another cause for whale beachings. The authors hypothesize that whales navigate using the Earth's magnetic field by detecting differences in the field's strength to find their way. The solar storms cause anomalies in the field, which may disturb the whales' ability to navigate, sending them into shallow waters where they get trapped. The study is based on the mass beachings of 29 sperm whales along the coasts of Germany, the Netherlands, the UK and France in 2016. = \\"Follow-me\\" strandings = Mass stranding of dolphins, Nova Scotia (1918) Some strandings may be caused by larger cetaceans following dolphins and porpoises into shallow coastal waters. The larger animals may habituate to following faster-moving dolphins. If they encounter an adverse combination of tidal flow and seabed topography, the larger species may become trapped. Sometimes following a dolphin can help lead a whale out of danger: In 2008, a local dolphin was followed out to open water by two pygmy sperm whales that had become lost behind a sandbar at Mahia Beach, New Zealand. It may be possible to train dolphins to lead trapped whales out to sea. =Orcas' intentional, temporary strandings= Pods of killer whales – predators of dolphins and porpoises – very rarely strand. It might be that killer whales have learned to stay away from shallow waters, and that heading to the shallows offers the smaller animals some protection from predators. However, killer whales in Península Valdés, Argentina, and the Crozet Islands in the Indian Ocean have learned how to operate in shallow waters, particularly in their pursuit of seals. The killer whales regularly demonstrate their competence by chasing seals up shelving gravel beaches, up to the edge of the water. The pursuing whales are occasionally partially thrust out of the sea by a combination of their own impetus and retreating water, and have to wait for the next wave to re-float them and carry them back to sea. A killer whale hunting sea lions at Valdes Peninsula, Argentina, by deliberately stranding itself In Argentina, killer whales are known to hunt on the shore by intentionally beaching themselves and then lunging at nearby seals before riding the next wave safely back into deeper waters. This was first observed in the early 1970s, then hundreds times more since within this pod. This behavior seems to be taught from one generation to the next, evidenced by older individuals nudging juveniles towards the shore, and can sometimes also be a play activity. =Sonar= Volunteers attempt to keep body temperatures of beached pilot whales from rising at Farewell Spit, New Zealand. There is evidence that active sonar leads to beaching. On some occasions cetaceans have stranded shortly after military sonar was active in the area, suggesting a link. Theories describing how sonar may cause whale deaths have also been advanced after necropsies found internal injuries in stranded cetaceans. In contrast, some who strand themselves due to seemingly natural causes are usually healthy prior to beaching: Direct injury The large and rapid pressure changes made by loud sonar can cause hemorrhaging. Evidence emerged after 17 cetaceans hauled out in the Bahamas in March 2000 following a United States Navy sonar exercise. The Navy accepted blame agreeing that the dead whales experienced acoustically-induced hemorrhages around the ears. The resulting disorientation probably led to the stranding. Ken Balcomb, a cetologist, specializes in the killer whale populations that inhabit the Strait of Juan de Fuca between Washington and Vancouver Island. He investigated these beachings and argues that the powerful sonar pulses resonated with airspaces in the dolphins, tearing tissue around the ears and brain. Apparently not all species are affected by sonar. Injury at a vulnerable moment Another means by which sonar could be hurting cetaceans is a form of decompression sickness. This was first raised by necrological examinations of 14 beaked whales stranded in the Canary Islands. The stranding happened on 24 September 2002, close to the operating area of Neo Tapon (an international naval exercise) about four hours after the activation of mid-frequency sonar. The team of scientists found acute tissue damage from gas-bubble lesions, which are indicative of decompression sickness. The precise mechanism of how sonar causes bubble formation is not known. It could be due to cetaceans panicking and surfacing too rapidly in an attempt to escape the sonar pulses. There is also a theoretical basis by which sonar vibrations can cause supersaturated gas to nucleate, forming bubbles (cavitation). Diving patterns of Cuvier's beaked whales The overwhelming majority of the cetaceans involved in sonar-associated beachings are Cuvier's beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostrus). Individuals of this species strands frequently, but mass strandings are rare. Cuvier's beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostrus) are an open-ocean species that rarely approach the shore, making them difficult to study in the wild. Prior to the interest raised by the sonar controversy, most of the information about them came from stranded animals. The first to publish research linking beachings with naval activity were Simmonds and Lopez-Jurado in 1991. They noted that over the past decade there had been a number of mass strandings of beaked whales in the Canary Islands, and each time the Spanish Navy was conducting exercises. Conversely, there were no mass strandings at other times. They did not propose a theory for the strandings. Fernández et al. in a 2013 letter to Nature, reported that there had been no further mass strandings in that area, following a 2004 ban by the Spanish government on military exercises in that region. In May 1996, there was another mass stranding in West Peloponnese, Greece. At the time, it was noted as \\"atypical\\" both because mass strandings of beaked whales are rare, and also because the stranded whales were spread over such a long stretch of coast, with each individual whale spatially separated from the next stranding. At the time of the incident, there was no connection made with active sonar; A. Frantzis, the marine biologist investigating the incident, made the connection to sonar because he discovered a notice to mariners concerning the test. His report was published in March 1998. Peter Tyack, of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, has been researching noise's effects on marine mammals since the 1970s. He has led much of the recent research on beaked whales (Cuvier's beaked whales in particular). Data tags have shown that Cuvier's dive considerably deeper than previously thought, and are in fact the deepest-diving species of marine mammal yet known. At shallow depths Cuvier's stop vocalizing, either because of fear of predators, or because they don't need vocalization to track each other at shallow depths, where they have light adequate to see each other. Their surfacing behavior is highly unusual, because they exert considerable physical effort to surface by a controlled ascent, rather than passively floating to the surface as sperm whales do. Every deep dive is followed by three or four shallow dives. The elaborate dive patterns are assumed to be necessary to control the diffusion of gases in the bloodstream. No data show a beaked whale making an uncontrolled ascent, or failing to do successive shallow dives. This behavior suggests that the Cuvier's are in a vulnerable state after a deep dive – presumably on the verge of decompression sickness – and require time and perhaps the shallower dives to recover. Summary review De Quirós et al. (2019) published a review of evidence on the mass strandings of beaked whale linked to naval exercises where sonar was used. It concluded that the effects of mid-frequency active sonar are strongest on Cuvier's beaked whales but vary among individuals or populations. The review suggested the strength of response of individual animals may depend on whether they had prior exposure to sonar, and that symptoms of decompression sickness have been found in stranded whales that may be a result of such response to sonar. It noted that no more mass strandings had occurred in the Canary Islands once naval exercises where sonar was used were banned, and recommended that the ban be extended to other areas where mass strandings continue to occur. Disposal A beachcomber inspects the carcass of a whale. The bite marks on the whale were made by a great white shark. Memorial to beached whales outside Florence, Oregon If a whale is beached near an inhabited locality, the rotting carcass can pose a nuisance as well as a health risk. Such very large carcasses are difficult to move. The whales are often towed back out to sea away from shipping lanes, allowing them to decompose naturally, or they are towed out to sea and blown up with explosives. Government-sanctioned explosions have occurred in South Africa, Iceland, Australia and United States. If the carcass is older, it is buried. In New Zealand, which is the site of many whale strandings, treaties with the indigenous Māori people allow the tribal gathering and customary (that is, traditional) use of whalebone from any animal which has died as a result of stranding. Whales are regarded as taonga (spiritual treasure), descendants of the ocean god, Tangaroa, and are as such held in very high respect. Sites of whale strandings and any whale carcasses from strandings are treated as tapu sites, that is, they are regarded as sacred ground.Te Karaka, \\"The science of strandings', Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu, 21 December 2014. Retrieved 12 February 2017.  Health risks  A beached whale carcass should not be consumed. In 2002, fourteen Alaskans ate muktuk (whale blubber) from a beached whale, resulting in eight of them developing botulism, with two of the affected requiring mechanical ventilation. This is a possibility for any meat taken from an unpreserved carcass. Large strandings In 1918, approximately 1,000 pilot whales were stranded on the Chatham Islands, New Zealand the largest whale stranding ever recorded. In October 1935, about 300 pilot whales (Globicephalus Melas) were stranded at Stanley, Tasmania; the remains were subsequently buried on VDL Company land. In 1985 about 450 pilot whales were stranded in Auckland, New Zealand. On June 23, 2015, 337 dead whales were discovered in a remote fjord in Patagonia, southern Chile, the largest stranding of baleen whales to date. Three hundred and five bodies and 32 skeletons were identified by aerial and satellite photography between the Gulf of Penas and Puerto Natales, near the southern tip of South America. They may have been sei whales. This is one of only two or three such baleen mass stranding events in the last hundred years. It is highly unusual for baleens to strand other than singly, and the Patagonia baleen strandings are tentatively attributed to an unusual cause such as ingestion of poisonous algae. On the morning of February 10, 2017, more than 416 pilot whales were discovered on a crescent of land on New Zealand's South Island called Farewell Spit in Golden Bay at the top of the South Island, with more than 70% dead by dawn. An additional 240 whales stranded themselves late on February 11. This brought the total number of stranded pilot whales to 656, making this the second-largest whale-stranding event ever recorded. About 335 of the whales were declared dead out of which 20 had to be euthanized, 200 re- floated themselves at high tide and a few were brought back to sea through human effort. In November 2018, over 140 whales were witnessed stranded on a remote beach in New Zealand and had to be euthanised because of their declining health condition. In July 2019, nearly 50 long-finned pilot whales were found stranded on Snaefellsnes Peninsula in Iceland. However, they were already dead when spotted. In September 2020, approximately 470 pilot whales were stranded in Macquarie Harbour in Tasmania. As of 24 September, at least 380 had died, and only 20 remained well enough to rescue.

She has lamented that for medical reasons she has been unable to have children.https://www.newstatesman.com/node/194946 Early British career After a backpacking tour of the world with her then fiancé John Chenery, she arrived in London in 1985. Aiming to earn enough money to return home she worked as a freelancer for publications including The Observer and the Sunday Express. After being part of the start-up team of Today, she then joined Robert Maxwell's short-lived London Daily News, before returning under Today editor David Montgomery in 1987 as deputy editor. In 1993 she was appointed managing editor of the Mirror Group, and then moved in the same year to The Independent, initially as marketing director and then managing director. In 1996 she joined the Sunday Mirror as acting editor, where she was the superior of Labour party's later director of communications, Alastair Campbell. In 1998 she was appointed acting editor of the Sunday Express, a position she was sacked from by Rosie Boycott following the publication of details of Peter Mandelson's gay relationship with his Brazilian partner. In 1999, Platell published a novel Scandal, about women in the newspaper industry. \\"Two editors, one paper, may the best woman win\\" was how the cover summarised the plot. It was from 1999 to 2001 that Platell moved into politics to become the Conservative Party's head of media, during which she supported William Hague, advising him to just \\"be yourself\\" as it was at these times he was his strongest. In her role, Platell made an important contribution to Hague's reversion from a modernising agenda to a 'core vote' strategy pursued during the 1999 European Elections, in which the Conservatives gained the most votes, as well as the 2001 General Election campaign. Hague, however, only managed to make a net gain of 1 seat in 2001, forcing his resignation shortly after the General Election.

Early life Born of working-class parents in Hoxton, London, in 1930, within a few hundred yards of where his paternal grandparents were born, Magee was brought up in a flat above the family clothes shop, where he shared a bed with his elder sister, Joan. He was close to his father but had a difficult relationship with his abusive and overbearing mother. He was evacuated to Market Harborough in Leicestershire, during World War II, but when he returned to London, much of Hoxton had been bombed flat. Magee was educated at Christ's Hospital school on a London County Council scholarship. During this formative period, he developed a keen interest in socialist politics, while during the school holidays he enjoyed listening to political orators at Speakers' Corner, Hyde Park, London, as well as regular visits to the theatre and concerts. During his National Service he served in the British Army and in the Intelligence Corps seeking possible spies among the refugees crossing the border between Yugoslavia and Austria. After demobilisation he won a scholarship to Keble College, Oxford, where he studied History as an undergraduate and then Philosophy, Politics and Economics in one year. His friends at Oxford included Robin Day, William Rees-Mogg, Jeremy Thorpe and Michael Heseltine. While at university, Magee was elected president of the Oxford Union. He later became an honorary fellow at Keble College. At Oxford, Magee had mixed with poets as well as politicians and in 1951 published a volume of verse through the Fortune Press. The publisher did not pay its writers and expected them to buy a certain number of copies themselves – a similar deal had been struck with such writers as Dylan Thomas and Philip Larkin for their first anthologies. The slim volume was dedicated to the memory of Richard Wagner, with a quote from Rilke's Duino Elegies: ... das Schöne ist nichts als des Schrecklichen Anfang, den wir noch grade ertragen (\\"... beauty is nothing but the beginning of terror, that we are still able to bear\\").Magee, B. (1951), Crucifixion and Other Poems, London, Fortune Press Magee said later: \\"I'm rather ashamed of the poems now, although I have written poems since which I haven't published, which I secretly think are rather good. It has always been a dimension of what I do.\\" (Later he would also publish fiction, including a spy novel To Live in Danger in 1960 and then a long work Facing Death. The latter, initially composed in the 1960s but not published until 1977, would be shortlisted for an award by The Yorkshire Post). In 1955 he began a year studying philosophy at Yale University on a postgraduate fellowship. He had expected to hate America but found that he loved it. His deep admiration of the country's equality of opportunity was expressed in a swift series of books, Go West, Young Man (1958), The New Radicalism (1963) and The Democratic Revolution (1964).  Politician  Magee returned to Britain with hopes of becoming a Labour Member of Parliament (MP). He twice stood unsuccessfully for Mid Bedfordshire, at the 1959 general election and the 1960 by-election, and instead took a job presenting the ITV current affairs television programme This Week. He made documentary programmes about subjects of social concern such as prostitution, sexually transmitted diseases, abortion and homosexuality (illegal in Britain at the time). Interviewed in 2003, Magee said: > British society was illiberal in a number of areas that are now taken for > granted... Roy Jenkins changed them and he was bitterly opposed by the > Tories. But if you were liberal with a small L there was a menu of social > change and I believed very strongly in that whole liberal agenda. He was eventually elected MP for Leyton at the February 1974 general election, but found himself out of tune with the Labour Party's direction under Michael Foot. On 22 January 1982 he resigned the Labour whip and in March joined the defection of centrist Labour MPs to the newly founded Social Democratic Party. He lost his seat at the 1983 general election. Magee returned to writing and broadcasting which, indeed, he had continued during his parliamentary career and would also serve on various boards and committees. He notably resigned as chairman of the Arts Council music panel in 1994 in protest at funding cuts. He also returned to scholarship at Oxford, first as a fellow at Wolfson, then at New College. He also found more time to write classical music reviews and worked on his own compositions. He admitted that, while his own work was \\"whistleable\\", it was also \\"inherently sentimental\\". Interviewed in 2003, Oxford contemporary William Rees-Mogg recalled \\"we never knew which way Bryan would jump. And as his life later demonstrated, there was always a question of whether he was basically at heart an intellectual or someone interested in public life. So it wasn't a surprise that he went into public life, but the intellectual was really the predominant element in his personality and the books seemed to represent the real Bryan more than the political activity did.\\"  Broadcaster and writer  A caricature of Magee = Interviews with philosophers = Magee's most important influence in popular culture were his efforts to make philosophy accessible to the layman. In 1970–71 he presented a series for BBC Radio 3 entitled Conversations with Philosophers. The series took the form of Magee in conversation with a number of contemporary British philosophers, discussing both their own work, and the work of earlier 20th- century British philosophers. The series began with an introductory conversation between Magee and Anthony Quinton. Other programmes included discussions on Bertrand Russell, G. E. Moore and J. L. Austin, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and the relationship between philosophy and religion, among others. Extracts of each of the conversations were printed in The Listener shortly after broadcast.Modes of philosophizing - A round table debate (with Jonathan Barnes, Myles Burnyeat, Raymond Geuss and Barry Stroud).9 May 2008 Eurozine And extensively revised versions of all the discussions would be made available in the 1971 book Modern British Philosophy. Karl Popper would appear in the series twice and Magee would soon after write an introductory book on his philosophy that was first published in 1973.Bibliography Karl R. Popper 2.1 Writings on Karl Popper and His Work (Current state: June 2019) University of Klagenfurt (AAU) In 1978 Magee presented 15 dialogues with noted philosophers for BBC Television in a series called Men of Ideas. This was a series that, as noted in The Daily Telegraph, \\"achieved the near-impossible feat of presenting to a mass audience recondite issues of philosophy without compromising intellectual integrity or losing ratings\\" and \\"attracted a steady one million viewers per show.\\" Following an \\"Introduction to Philosophy\\", presented by Magee in discussion with Isaiah Berlin, Magee discussed topics like Marxist philosophy, the Frankfurt School, the ideas of Noam Chomsky and modern Existentialism in subsequent episodes. During the broadcast run, edited shorter versions of the discussions were published weekly in The Listener magazine. Extensively revised versions of the dialogues within the Men of Ideas series (which featured Iris Murdoch) were originally published in a book of the same name that is now sold under the title of Talking Philosophy. DVDs of the series are sold to academic institutions with the title Contemporary Philosophy. Neither this series nor its 1987 'sequel' are available for purchase by home users but most of the episodes are freely available on Youtube. Another BBC television series, The Great Philosophers, followed in 1987. In this series, Magee discussed the major historical figures of Western philosophy with fifteen contemporary philosophers. The series covered the philosophies of Plato, Aristotle, and Descartes, among others, including a discussion with Peter Singer on the philosophy of Marx and Hegel, and ending with a discussion with John Searle on the philosophy of Wittgenstein. Extensively revised versions of the dialogues were published in a book of the same name that was published that same year. Magee's 1998 book The Story of Thought (also published as The Story of Philosophy) would also cover the history of Western philosophy. Between the two series, Magee released the first edition of the work he regarded as closest to his \\"academic magnum opus\\": The Philosophy of Schopenhauer (first published in 1983, substantially revised and extended, 1997). This remains one of the most substantial and wide-ranging treatments of the thinker and assesses in-depth Schopenhauer's influence on Wittgenstein, Wagner and other creative writers. Magee also addresses Schopenhauer's thoughts on homosexuality and the influence of Buddhism on his thought.  Later work and interest in Wagner  In 1997 Magee's Confessions of a Philosopher was published. This essentially offered an introduction to philosophy in autobiographical form. The book was involved in a libel lawsuit as a result of Magee repeating the rumour that Ralph Schoenman, a controversial associate of Bertrand Russell during the philosopher's final decade, had been planted by the CIA in an effort to discredit Russell. Schoenman successfully sued Magee for libel in the UK, with the result that the first printing of the British edition of the book was pulped. A second defamation suit, filed in California against Random House, was settled in 2001. The allegations were expunged by settlement, and a new edition was issued and provided to more than 700 academic and public libraries. In Confessions of a Philosopher, Magee charts his own philosophical development in an autobiographical context. He also emphasizes the importance of Schopenhauer's philosophy as a serious attempt to solve philosophical problems. In addition to this, he launches a critique of analytic philosophy, particularly in its linguistic form over three chapters, contesting its fundamental principles and lamenting its influence. Magee had a particular interest in the life, thought and music of Richard Wagner and wrote two notable books on the composer and his world, Aspects of Wagner (1968; rev. 1988), and The Tristan Chord: Wagner and Philosophy (2001). In Aspects of Wagner Magee \\"outlines the range and depth of Wagner's achievement, and shows how his sensational and erotic music expresses the repressed and highly charged contents of the psyche. He also examines Wagner's detailed stage directions, and the prose works in which he formulated his ideas, and sheds interesting new light on his anti-semitism.\\" The revised edition includes a fresh chapter on \\"Wagner as Music\\". In 2016, approaching his 86th birthday, Magee had his book Ultimate Questions published by Princeton University. Writing in The Independent, Julian Baggini said \\"Magee doesn't always match his clarity of expression with rigour of argument, sometimes ignoring his own principle that the feeling 'Yes, surely this must be right' is 'not a validation, not even a credential'. But this can be excused. Plato and Aristotle claimed that philosophy begins with wonder. Magee is proof that for some, the wonder never dies, it only deepens.\\" In 2018 Magee, who was then living in one room in a nursing hospital in Oxford, was interviewed by Jason Cowley of New Statesman and discussed his life and his 2016 book Ultimate Questions. Magee said that he believed he lacked originality and, until Ultimate Questions, had struggled to make an original contribution to philosophy, saying: > Popper had this originality, Russell had it, and Einstein had it in spades. > Einstein created a way of seeing things which transformed the way we see the > world and the way we even understand such fundamental things as time and > space. And I fundamentally understand that I could never do that, never. I > wish I was in that class – not because I want to be a clever chap but > because I want to do things that are at a much better level than I've done > them. He explained that he followed the news and politics closely and that he considered the vote for Brexit to have been a \\"historic mistake\\".  Personal life  In 1953, Magee was appointed to a teaching job in Sweden and while there met Ingrid Söderlund, a pharmacist in the university laboratory. They married and had one daughter, Gunnela and, in time, three grandchildren. Magee later said: > The marriage broke up pretty quickly and it was a fairly disastrous period > of my life. I came back to Oxford as a postgraduate. But since then Sweden > has been a part of my life. I go there every year and my daughter visits me. > I always assumed that sooner or later I'd get married again but it never > quite happened, although I had some very long relationships. And now I don't > want to get married again. I like the freedom. His memoir, Clouds of Glory: A Hoxton Childhood, won the J. R. Ackerley Prize for Autobiography in 2004.  Death  Magee died on 26 July 2019, at the age of 89, at St Luke's Hospital in Headington, Oxford. He is survived by his Swedish daughter Gunnela and her children and grandchildren. His funeral took place on 15 August.Bryan Edgar Magee 12 April 1930 – 26 July 2019 (funeral service sheet) The last of Magee's books to be published during his lifetime – Making the Most of It (2018) – closes: A celebration of his life was held in the chapel of Keble College, Oxford, on 29 October 2019. The event was opened by Sir Jonathan Phillips, Warden of Keble College, and was introduced by Magee's executor, the academic, author and editor Henry Hardy. It included audio and video clips of Magee, music chosen by him and played by the Amherst Sextet, and addresses by David Owen and Simon Callow. The music choices were the sextet from Strauss's Capriccio, the largo from Elgar's Serenade for Strings and the prelude to Wagner's Tristan und Isolde. The addresses by Owen and Callow were published together with a notice of Magee's life by Hardy in the Oldie.

The bar is a crumbly honeycomb toffee centre coated in compound chocolate. It is similar to the Crunchie made by British firm Cadbury. Its advertising slogan is \\"It's the way it shatters that matters\\", and previously was \\"Nothing else matters\\". Aside from Australia, it is common in Hawaii and a selection of other places, such as Hong Kong and Mollie Stone's Markets in California. They can also be found in some import speciality stores such as Cost Plus World Market in the United States. History A Violet Crumble shown shattered after hitting a hard surface. Abel Hoadley opened a jam factory in South Melbourne, Victoria, in 1889, trading as A. Hoadley & Company. By 1895, business had expanded rapidly and Hoadley built a five-storey premises, the Rising Sun Preserving Works. He produced jams, jellies, fruit preserves, candied peels, sauces, and confectionery and employed a workforce as large as 200. By 1901, there were four preserving factories and a large confectionery works. Hoadley had acquired the firm of Dillon, Burrows & Co. and extended his products to vinegar, cocoa, and chocolate. In 1910, the jam business was sold to Henry Jones Co-operative Ltd. and in 1913, Hoadley's Chocolates Ltd was formed. The same year, Hoadley produced his first chocolate assortment and packed them in a purple box decorated with violets. The packaging was in tribute to his wife's favorite colour (purple) and favorite flower (violets). Within the box, assortment was a piece of honeycomb that became so popular that Hoadley decided to produce an individual honeycomb bar. This proved trickier than first thought because as the pieces of honeycomb cooled, they absorbed moisture and started sticking together. This hygroscopic nature of honeycomb led Hoadley to eventually dip his bars in chocolate, to keep the honeycomb dry and crunchy. Thus, in 1913, the Violet Crumble bar was created. Hoadley wanted to call his new bar just Crumble but learned that it was not possible to protect the name with a trademark. He thought of his wife (Susannah Ann née Barrett) and her favourite flower, the violet, and registered the name Violet Crumble, using a purple wrapper with a small flower logo. It was an instant success. Violet Crumbles are crispier in texture than Crunchie bars, with a slightly more marshmallow taste. Hoadley's Chocolates Ltd was acquired by English company Rowntree's in 1970, who produced Violet Crumble in Adelaide until 1985. Rowntree's was itself acquired in 1988 by Nestlé, who moved production to Campbellfield near Melbourne. On 11 January 2018, Robern Menz purchased the Violet Crumble brand and its associated intellectual property, plant and equipment for an undisclosed sum, and production began on 10 October 2018. =Timeline= *1913, Hoadley's Chocolates made the first Violet Crumble bar in Melbourne. *1972, Hoadley's Chocolates was acquired by Rowntree Company and became known as Rowntree Hoadley Ltd. *1989, Nestlé acquired Rowntree's. The Rowntree chocolate brands were initially branded as Nestlé-Rowntree until Nestlé dropped the Rowntree altogether. *2009, Nestlé changed the shape of the Violet Crumble to a wider, flatter bar. The honeycomb formulation was also changed to make it shatter into small pieces when bitten into. *2010, Nestlé included Violet Crumble bags on their list of deleted products *2012, an attempt at regaining name and recipe rights for the Violet Crumble was made by young entrepreneur Bryan Hoadley, a descendant of Abel Hoadley. *2018, in January Robern Menz announced their plans to acquire the rights and equipment to take over production and commenced production in October. *2019, in March bags of Violet Crumble went on sale, for the first time in 9 years, in independent grocery stores such as IGA. =Packaging= The hygroscopic nature of the honeycomb centre was problematic. Competitors tried to prove the bars were not fresh by squeezing them. Hoadley responded by instituting a strict coding system to keep track of the shelf life (12 months) and ensure that only the freshest bars were sold. In addition, he searched worldwide for a new type of airtight wrapper that would keep the bar fresh. Eventually, a French company, La Cellophane, invented a moisture-resistant metallised cellophane especially for Violet Crumble. Production The honeycomb is produced and conveyed into an air-conditioned area where it is cut into bars. Then it goes through chocolate coating machines. The bars are double-coated to seal the honeycomb from the air. Cooling tunnels take the bars to the automatic wrapping machines.

It lasted 196 days and 17 hours, making more than 3,000 orbits of the planet Earth. The Soyuz-TM crew transports (T – транспортный – Transportnyi – meaning transport, M – модифицированный – Modifitsirovannyi – meaning modified) were fourth generation (1986–2002) Soyuz spacecraft used for ferry flights to the Mir and ISS space stations. It added to the Soyuz-T new docking and rendezvous, radio communications, emergency and integrated parachute/landing engine systems. The new Kurs rendezvous and docking system permitted the Soyuz-TM to maneuver independently of the station, without the station making \\"mirror image\\" maneuvers to match unwanted translations introduced by earlier models' aft-mounted attitude control. Crew Mission highlights Soyuz TM-17 was the 17th expedition to the Russian Space Station Mir. At 7:37:11 a.m. Moscow time (MT), on 1994 January 14, Soyuz-TM 17 separated from the forward port of the Mir station. At 7:43:59 a.m., the Mission Control Center in Korolev (TsUP) ordered Tsibliyev to steer Soyuz-TM 17 to within 15 metres of the Kristall module to begin photography of the APAS-89 docking system. At 7:46:20 a.m., Tsibliyev complained that Soyuz-TM 17 was handling sluggishly. Serebrov, standing by for photography in the orbital module, then asked Tsibliyev to move the spacecraft out of the station plane because it was coming close to one of the solar arrays. In Mir, Viktor Afanasyev ordered Valeri Polyakov and Yuri Usachyov to evacuate to the Soyuz TM-18 spacecraft. At 7:47:30 a.m., controllers in the TsUP saw the image from Soyuz-TM 17's external camera shake violently, and Serebrov reported that Soyuz-TM 17 had hit Mir. The TsUP then lost communications with Mir and Soyuz- TM 17. Intermittent communications were restored with Soyuz-TM 17 at 7:52 a.m. Voice communications with Mir were not restored until 8:02 a.m. Inspection of Soyuz-TM 17 indicated no serious damage. In this connection, the Russians revealed that they had studied contingency reentries by depressurized spacecraft in the wake of the Soyuz 11 accident. The Mir cosmonauts did not feel the impact, though the station's guidance system registered angular velocity and switched to free flying mode. Later analysis indicated that the right side of the orbital module had struck Mir two glancing blows 2 seconds apart. The impact point was on Kristall, near its connection to the Mir base block. The cause of the impact was traced to a switch error: the hand controller in the orbital module which governed braking and acceleration was switched on, disabling the equivalent hand controller (the left motion control lever) in the descent module. Tsibliyev was able to use the right lever to steer the Soyuz past Mir's solar arrays, antennas, and docking ports after it became clear impact was inevitable.

The Royal Navy battleship and battlecruiser were sunk by land-based bombers and torpedo bombers of the Imperial Japanese Navy. In Japanese, the engagement was referred to as the . The objective of Force Z, which consisted of one battleship, one battlecruiser and four destroyers, was to intercept the Japanese invasion fleet in the South China Sea north of Malaya. The task force sailed without air support. Although the British had a close encounter with Japanese heavy surface units, the force failed to find and destroy the main convoy. On their return to Singapore they were attacked in open waters and sunk by long-range torpedo bombers. The commander of Force Z, Admiral Sir Tom Phillips, elected to maintain radio silence and an alert was only sent (by the Repulse) one hour after the first Japanese attack. With the attack on Pearl Harbor only three days earlier, the Malayan engagement illustrated the effectiveness of aerial attacks against even the heaviest of naval assets if they were without air cover. This added to the importance for the Allies of the three USN aircraft carriers in the Pacific: , , and . The sinking of the two ships severely weakened the British Eastern Fleet in Singapore, and the Japanese fleet was only engaged by submarines until the Battle off Endau on 27 January 1942. Background In meetings on 17 and 20 October, the British Defence Committee formally discussed Far East naval reinforcement in response to the fall of the moderate Konoe government on 16 October. In agreement with August-September assessment of Japanese intentions, Churchill and his cabinet favoured the deployment of a modern battleship for deterrent effect.Boyd: page 294-295 The Royal Navy, as part of its offensive strategy, planned to send the Nelson and Revenge-class battleships to Singapore, but the Nelsons could not deploy. was damaged in the Mediterranean Sea in late-September.Boyd: page 281 Crew leave prevented from deploying until mid-December, and a gun refit scheduled from February to May 1942 was required before she could conduct further operations. With working up, the earliest either could reach the Far East was August 1942. The King George V-class was, aside from the Revenges, the only worked-up battleship that could sail east before Spring 1942.Boyd: page 295 On 20 October, the Committee decided to send Prince of Wales to Cape Town, South Africa.Boyd: page 297 Once at Cape Town, a review would decide whether to send the ship onward to SingaporeMahoney and Middlebrook: chapter 3; this would keep Prince of Wales available to respond to an emergency in home waters.Boyd: page 311 In December 1941, as a deterrent to Japanese territorial expansion which was recently demonstrated by the invasion of French Indochina, it was proposed that a force of Royal Navy warships be dispatched to the Far East with a view to providing reinforcement for Britain's possessions there, most notably Singapore. First Sea Lord Sir Dudley Pound represented that Singapore could only be adequately defended if the Royal Navy sent the majority of its capital ships there, to achieve parity with an estimated force of nine Japanese battleships. However, dispatching such a large British force was impractical as the British were at war with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. Nevertheless, Prime Minister Winston Churchill appeared optimistic about the improving situation in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean; he advocated sending two capital ships along with an aircraft carrier to defend Malaya, Borneo and the Straits Settlements. Churchill has been criticised for showing \\"considerable ignorance\\" and holding an \\"exaggerated belief in the power of the battleship,\\" along with \\"a tendency to interfere in naval matters.\\"Stephen, p. 102. This may have led him to propose a squadron of three modern ships: one battleship, one battlecruiser, and one carrier.Stephen, p. 104. His view was that using the Ultra decrypts that would give Japanese ship locations to the British, they could then use their own ships to form a \\"fleet in being\\" to deter Japanese action, as the German battleship Tirpitz, sister to the lost Bismarck, was in the North Sea. However, there was no firm plan for such a task.Alan Matthews, \\"The Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse\\", Force 'Z' Survivors Website. The revised British proposal allocated the new King George V-class battleship , the veteran , and the for air cover, though the plan had to be revised when Indomitable ran aground in the Caribbean Sea.Stephen, p. 107. The dispatch of capital ships to Singapore had been part of the Admiralty's strategic planning since the naval base had been expanded and fortified beginning in the early 1920s. The scale of this planned deployment had been reduced during the 1930s, since Germany and Italy presented new threats to British interests in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. Nevertheless, it was still assumed that a significant force of capital ships would deter Japanese expansion. Churchill's plan presumedWillmott, H. P. Barrier and the Javelin (Annapolis: U.S. Naval Institute Press, 1983). that the United States would agree to send its Pacific Fleet, including eight battleships, to Singapore in the event of hostilities with Japan, or that the British force would add to the deterrent value of the US fleet, should it stay at Pearl Harbor.Alan Matthews, 2006, \\"The sinking of HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Repulse\\" (Force Z Survivors Association). Access date: 13 October 2007. Admiral of the Home Fleet Sir John Tovey was opposed to sending any of the new King George V battleships as he believed that they were not suited to operating in tropical waters. Indeed the humid climate of Malaya would negatively affect the capabilities of the Prince of Wales, such as the breakdown of her surface search radars, deterioration of her anti-aircraft ammunition, and increased crew fatigue due to the lack of air conditioning. =Deployment= Admiral Sir Tom Phillips (right), commander of Force Z, and his deputy, Rear Admiral Arthur Palliser, on the quayside at Singapore naval base, 2 December 1941. Force G, consisting of the modern battleship Prince of Wales, the First World War era battlecruiser Repulse, and the four destroyers HMS , , and , arrived at Singapore on 2 December 1941. They were then re- designated Force Z. The new aircraft carrier HMS Indomitable was allocated to Force G, but whilst working up off Jamaica, she had run aground in the entrance to Kingston harbour on 3 November 1941.Martin Middlebrook & Patrick Mahoney, Battleship; The Loss of the Prince of Wales and the Repulse, Penguin History, 1979, . Indomitable required 12 days of dry dock repairs in Norfolk, Virginia, and was not able to take part in the action. Indomitable carried one squadron each of Fairey Fulmars and Hawker Sea Hurricanes. Another aircraft carrier, (which was with Prince of Wales at Cape Town), was on passage to Singapore to join Force Z, but was not deployed due to lack of speed. On 1 December, it was announced that Sir Tom Phillips had been promoted to full admiral and appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Fleet. A few days later, Repulse left for Australia with and , but the force was recalled to Singapore to assemble for possible operations against the Japanese. Also at Singapore were the light cruisers HMS , , and , and the destroyers HMS , Encounter and Jupiter. The heavy cruiser , Dutch light cruiser , two more British destroyers ( and ), and four United States Navy destroyers (, , and ) would be there within three days. Though Durban and Stronghold were available, Admiral Phillips decided to leave them at Singapore because they were not as fast as the other units. Additionally, Danae, Dragon, Mauritius, Encounter and Jupiter were also at Singapore, but were under repair and not ready to sail. =Japanese preparations= Churchill publicly announced Prince of Wales and Repulse were being sent to Singapore to deter the Japanese. In response, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto sent 36 Mitsubishi G4M bombers to reinforce the existing Mitsubishi G3M-equipped Kanoya Air Group and Genzan Air Group, whose pilots began training for an attack on the two capital ships. The bomber crews, of the Kanoya Air Group of Kanoya Kōkūtai (751 Ku), Genzan Air Group of Genzan Kōkūtai (753 Ku), and the Mihoro Air Group of Mihoro Kōkūtai (701 Ku), trained in torpedo attacks at an altitude of less than 10 metres (30 ft), and in long-range over-ocean navigation, so they could attack naval targets moving quickly at sea.The sinking of HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Repulse – page 1 Genzan Air Group was commanded by Lt Cdr Niichi Nakanishi, Kanoya Air Group by Lt Cdr Shichizo Miyauchi and Mihoro Air Group by Lt Hachiro Shoji. This was the first time in the war that a force of bombers was especially trained and equipped for “ship killing”, an unprecedented capacity, as around that time ordinary land-based bombers (particularly the Mediterranean theatre) had attacked ships at sea with limited success. Hostilities commence On 8 December 1941,7 December in Britain and the US early in the morning, bombers of Mihoro Air Group attacked Singapore. Prince of Wales and Repulse responded with anti-aircraft fire; no planes were shot down, and the ships sustained no damage. The Japanese made landings on Kota Bharu, Malaya, on 8 December (local time), starting the Japanese invasion of Malaya. News arrived that Pearl Harbor had been attacked and eight US battleships had been sunk or disabled. Pre-war planning had explored the possibility of the United States Pacific Fleet sending major units to Singapore to reinforce the British when war broke out. That was now impossible. Philips had concluded in an earlier discussion with US General Douglas MacArthur and Admiral Thomas C. Hart that his two capital ships were insufficient to confront the Japanese. However, with the Japanese threatening to overrun Malaya, Philips was pressed to use his ships in an offensive role; he assembled his flotilla to try to intercept and destroy Japanese invasion convoys in the South China Sea. Admiral Philips believed the Royal Air Force could not guarantee air cover for his ships, as they were equipped with limited numbers of aging fighters. One squadron, No. 453 Squadron RAAF with ten Brewster F2A Buffalos standing by at RAF Sembawang, was available to provide close cover.Stephen, p. 108. They were designated the Fleet Defence Squadron for this task, with Flight Lieutenant Tim Vigors given the radio procedures used by Force Z. Regardless, Phillips elected to proceed. It is believed that four factors entered into his decision: He thought that Japanese planes could not operate so far from land, he believed that his ships were relatively immune from fatal damage via air attack, he was unaware of the quality of Japanese aircraft and torpedoes, and like many Royal Navy officers, Phillips underestimated the fighting abilities of the Japanese. Up to that point, no capital ship at sea had been sunk by air attack. The Italian heavy cruiser Pola had been disabled by a torpedo from a Fleet Air Arm Fairey Swordfish at the Battle of Cape Matapan on 29 March 1941, and was later sunk by a torpedo from the destroyer HMS Jervis.O'Hara, Vincent P.: Struggle for the Middle Sea, Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, Maryland, 2009. . These and other Royal Navy operations in the Mediterranean theater (September 1939 - December 1941) showed that it was risky but possible to operate in waters covered by enemy land-based air, as German and Italian aircraft damaged but could not stop Malta convoys, while no British battleships had been lost. Phillips grossly underestimated the scale of attack, and believed that the majority of enemy attack aircraft would be level bombers rather than land- based naval torpedo bombers.Boyd: page 320-323 However the Japanese bombers that would be deployed against his ships were specially trained and equipped for “ship killing”, which the British did not realize due to intelligence failures. His flagship, Prince of Wales, had one of the most advanced naval anti-aircraft systems of the time, the High Angle Control System (HACS), which demonstrated accurate long-range radar-directed anti-aircraft fire during Operation Halberd in August and September 1941.The Royal Navy and the Mediterranean Convoys. A Naval Staff History, p. 26. However, the extreme heat and humidity in Malayan waters rendered her anti-aircraft fire control radars unserviceable and her 2 pounder ammunition had deteriorated as well.Battleship: The Loss of the Prince of Wales and the Repulse, Middlebrook. Royal Air Force technicians were called in to examine the Prince's radars but needed a week to effect repairs, and Force Z would be underway in a few days. No. 453 Squadron RAAF, which was to provide air cover for Force Z, was not kept informed of the ships' position. No radio request for air cover was sent until one was sent by the commander of Repulse an hour after the Japanese attack began. Flight Lieutenant Vigors proposed a plan to keep six aircraft over Force Z during daylight, but this was declined by Phillips. After the war, Vigors remained bitter towards him for his failure to call for air support on time. He later commented, \\"I reckon this must have been the last battle in which the Navy reckoned they could get along without the RAF. A pretty damned costly way of learning. Phillips had known that he was being shadowed the night before, and also at dawn that day. He did not call for air support. He was attacked and still did not call for help.\\"Bloody Shambles Volume One, page 125; by Christopher Shores & Brian Cull with Yasuho Izawa (Grub Street, London, 1992) . Daytime air cover off the coast was also offered by Wing Commander Wilfred Clouston of No. 488 Squadron RNZAF, but his plan, \\"Operation Mobile\\", was also rejected.Clayton, Graham. Last Stand in Singapore (Auckland: Random House, 2008). Regarding Phillips' decision to proceed without air cover, naval historian Samuel Eliot Morison wrote: > Those who make the decisions in war are constantly weighing certain risks > against possible gains.

Phillips hoped to attack off Singora on 10 December; had he departed one day sooner, he might have achieved his objective without coming under air attack at all, for the Japanese squadrons had not yet arrived. At 0713 on 9 December, Force Z passed the Anambas Islands to the east, and turned to a new course of 330 degrees, later changing to 345 degrees. Force Z was overflown by two Japanese reconnaissance aircraft, but not reported, before being spotted by Japanese submarine I-65 at 1400 on 9 December, which shadowed the British ships for five hours, radioing their positions. Phillips was unaware he was being tracked. After this contact report, Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa, in command of the invasion force, ordered most of his warships to escort the empty transports back to Cam Ranh Bay in southern Vietnam. I-65's amplifying report, confirming the presence of British battleships, reached 22nd Air Flotilla headquarters two hours later. At that time, their aircraft were in the process of loading bombs for an attack on Singapore Harbour, but they immediately switched to torpedoes. The bombers were not ready until 1800 hours. The report also prompted the Japanese 2nd Fleet, Southern (Malay) Force's Main Body, to sortie south from Indochina to intercept Force Z. The fleet consisted of the battleships Kongō, Haruna, three Takao-class cruisers and eight destroyers. They were joined by four Mogami-class cruisers of Cruiser Division 7 and one light cruiser, four destroyers of Destroyer Squadron 3. The cruiser Chōkai, flagship of Vice Admiral Ozawa, was also ordered south to find Force Z. About 1730, just a half-hour before sunset, Force Z was spotted by three Aichi E13A seaplanes, which had been catapulted off the Japanese cruisers Yura, Kinu and Kumano, which were escorting the transports. These aircraft continued shadowing. At about 1830, Tenedos was detached to return to Singapore, because she was running low on fuel, with instructions to contact Rear Admiral Arthur Palliser, detailed to act as liaison to RAF in Malaya,Stephen, p. 106. Phillips' intention was no longer to attack Singora, though Phillips changed course at 1900 toward Singora, to deceive the shadowing aircraft, then south toward Singapore at 2015, when darkness covered him. Tenedos dutifully reported at 2000, thereby preserving the secrecy of Phillips' position. A night air attack was attempted by the Japanese because they feared that the British would find the convoy, but bad weather prevented them from finding the ships and they returned to their airfields at Thủ Dầu Một and Saigon about midnight. =Return to Singapore= That night, one of the Japanese seaplanes dropped a flare over the Japanese heavy cruiser Chōkai, having mistaken her for Prince of Wales. After this, the Japanese force of six cruisers and several destroyers turned away to the northeast. The flare was also seen by the British force, which feared they had been identified and then turned away to the southeast. At this point, the forces were approximately 5 miles (9 km) apart but did not sight each other, and the Japanese force was not picked up on the radar of the Prince of Wales. At 2055, Admiral Philips cancelled the operation, saying that they had lost the element of surprise, and ordered the force to return to Singapore. On the way back, they were spotted and reported by the Japanese submarine I-58 at 0340. I-58 reported that she had fired five torpedoes and missed, and then lost sight of the force three hours later. The British force did not see the torpedoes, and never knew they had been attacked. The report from I-58 reached 22nd Air Flotilla Headquarters at 0315, and ten bombers of the Genzan Air Group were dispatched at 0600 to conduct a sector search for the ships. Many more planes, some armed with bombs and some with torpedoes, soon followed. The Genzan Air Group took off at 0755, the Kanoya Air Group at 0814, and the Mihoro Air Group at 0820. They were ordered to proceed to the best-estimated position of the ships. =The Japanese air attack= Japanese aerial photo of the initial attack on (top) and . A short, thick plume of black smoke can be seen emanating from Repulse, which has just been hit by a bomb and surrounded by at least six near misses. Prince of Wales can be seen to be manoeuvring. The white smoke is from the funnels as the ships attempt to increase speed. At 0050 that same morning, 10 December, Phillips had received a report from Palliser of Japanese landings at Kuantan, on the east coast of Malaya, halfway between Singapore and Kota Bharu; Phillips headed in that general direction, without however signalling Palliser his intentions (which would have revealed his position). Palliser failed to anticipate this and request air cover over Kuantan from Sembawang's Buffalo fighters. As it turned out, not until a radio message was sent by Repulse an hour after the first Japanese attack were RAF aircraft dispatched. At 0515, objects were spotted on the horizon; thinking they were the invasion force, Force Z turned towards them. It turned out to be a trawler towing barges. At 0630, Repulse reported seeing an aircraft shadowing the ships. At 0718, Prince of Wales catapulted off a Supermarine Walrus reconnaissance aircraft; it flew to Kuantan, saw nothing, reported back to Prince of Wales, and flew to Singapore. Express was sent to investigate the area, finding nothing. Phillips was unaware that a large force of Japanese land-based bombers were looking for his ships, but not having anticipated his detour to Kuantan were searching much farther south. At around 1000 Tenedos, having been detached from the main force the previous day and now about 140 miles southeast of Force Z, began signalling she was being attacked by Japanese aircraft.Nicholson. Hostage to Fortune, p. 219, and Tarrant, King George V Class Battleships, p. 114. The attack was carried out by nine Mitsubishi G3M 'Nell' twin-engine medium bombers from the Genzan Air Corps, 22nd Air Flotilla, based at Saigon, each armed with one 500 kg (1,100 lb) armour-piercing bomb. They mistook the destroyer for a battleship and wasted their ordnance without scoring a hit. At 1015, a scout plane to the north of most of the Japanese aircraft piloted by Ensign Masato Hoashi spotted Force Z and sent out a message detailing their exact position.Middlebrook and Mahoney, Battleship, p. 165–170, and Marder, Old Friends, New Enemies, pp. 462–464. The remaining Japanese planes converged upon the retreating British task force. The planes had spread out to search for the British warships, so they arrived over the target in small groups. With fuel running short, the Japanese attacked as they arrived rather than forming into a large force for a co-ordinated strike. The first wave of Japanese planes, comprising eight Nell bombers from the Mihoro Air Corps, attacked at 1113, concentrating solely on Repulse. Besides seven near misses by 250 kg (550 lb) bombs,Middlebrook and Mahoney, Battleship, p. 172, and Tarrant, King George V Class Battleships, p. 115–116. they scored just one hit, which penetrated the hangar and the upper deck and exploded in the marine mess area.Marder, Old Friends, New Enemies, p. 467, and Middlebrook and Mahoney, Battleship, p. 177. The bomb caused no serious damage and relatively few casualties, and Repulse continued on at 25 kts (46 km/h, 29 mph), still in fighting trim.Stephen, p. 109. Five of the eight bombers were damaged by anti- aircraft fire, and two were forced to return to base. At around 1140, 17 Nell torpedo bombers (two squadrons from the Genzan Air Group) approached the two capital ships. Eight concentrated on Repulse, while nine attacked Prince of Wales, sending eight torpedoes speeding towards the flagship (one plane aborted its run on Prince of Wales and peeled off and attacked Repulse).Tarrant, King George V Class Battleships, p. 117–118, and Marder, Old Friends, New Enemies. p. 468. One Nell was shot down and three more were damaged by the Prince of Wales anti-aircraft fire during this attack. This first wave of torpedo attackers made no hits on Repulse but managed one ultimately fatal hit on Prince of Wales, right where her outer port propeller shaft exited the hull (some historical accountsGarzke & Dulin, Allied Battleships, p. 196. state there were two hits in this attack, but an extensive 2007 survey of the hull of the wreck by divers proved there was only one).The Explorers Club Expedition ‘Job 74’ survey report 2007, pp. 9–10–11. Turning at maximum revolutions, the shaft twisted and ruptured the glands that prevented sea water entering the ship via the broad shaft tunnel's interior bulkheads. The flagship promptly took in 2,400 tons of water and her speed dropped to 16 kts (30 km/h, 18 mph). Testimony from Lt Wildish,Middlebrook and Mahoney, Battleship, p. 201. in command of 'B' Engine Room, indicated the shaft was stopped successfully, but upon restarting the shaft, water rushed in through the damaged shaft passage, flooding B Engine Room and forcing its evacuation. Also flooded from this hit were the long shaft passage itself, 'Y' Action Machinery Room, the port Diesel Dynamo Room, 'Y' Boiler Room, the Central Auxiliary Machinery Room, and a number of other compartments aft.Death of a Battleship: A Re-Analysis of the Tragic Loss of HMS Prince of Wales.

Moments later, the list on Prince of Wales suddenly increased and Express had to withdraw. Observe the barrels of the 5.25 in guns, which were unable to depress low enough to engage attackers due to the list. The single torpedo hit had devastating further effects. First, it caused an 11.5-degree list to port, resulting in the starboard 5.25-inch anti- aircraft turrets being unable to depress low enough to engage low-level attackers. Furthermore, power to Prince of Wales aft 5.25 inch dual-purpose turrets was cut, leaving her unable to effectively counter further attacks. Power loss to her pumps meant an inability to pump out the in-rushing flood water faster than it was entering the breached hull. The torpedo damage also denied her much of her auxiliary electrical power, vital for internal communications, ventilation, steering gear, and pumps, and for training and elevation of the 5.25-inch and 2-pounder gun mounts. All but S1 and S2 5.25 inch turrets were almost unmanageable, a factor compounded by the list, rendering their crews unable even to drag them around manually using chains. The crews also had difficulty bringing the heavy 2-pounder mountings into manual operation. The extensive internal flooding and shaft damage caused the shutting down of the inboard port propeller shaft, leaving the ship under the power of only the starboard engines and able to make just 15 knots at best. With her electric steering unresponsive, the ship was virtually unmanageable.A schematic of the torpedo damage to the stern of HMS Prince of Wales, 10 December 1941 is shown as if the ship was upright (that is, the wreck is upside down and this image is sometimes seen 'reversed'). Another torpedo attack was carried out by 26 Betty bombers of the Kanoya Air Group at approximately 1220,Middlebrook and Mahoney, Battleship, p. 216. and Prince of Wales was hit by another three torpedoes on her starboard side (some historical accounts state four hits, but the 2007 survey of the hull showed there had been only three); one at the very bow, one opposite B main gun turret, and one abaft Y turret which not only punctured the hull but bent the outer starboard propeller shaft inboard and over the inner shaft, stopping it instantly.The Explorers Club Expedition ‘Job 74’ survey report 2007, p. 9–21. At the same time as this last torpedo attack developed against Prince of Wales, planes from the Kanoya Air Group also attacked Repulse from both starboard and port. Repulse, which had dodged 19 torpedoes so far, was caught in an anvil attack and was hit on the port side by one torpedo. Within minutes, further attacks resulted in at least three more torpedoes striking Repulse.The Explorers Club Expedition ‘Job 74’ survey report 2007, p. 6–7–8. She had been hit seriously and Captain William Tennant soon ordered the crew overboard; Repulse listed heavily to port over a period of about six minutesMiddlebrook and Mahoney, Battleship, p. 234–243. and finally rolled over, settled by the head, and sank at 1233 with heavy casualties.Middlebrook and Mahoney, Battleship, p. 330. Prince of Wales was now under power by only one propeller shaft but was still able to fire at a high-level bombing attack which developed at 1241 hours, although only with S1 and S2 5.25 inch turrets. Although most of the bombs straddled her, one bomb penetrated her deck amidships. This bomb penetrated the upper deck and exploded amongst the wounded gathered in the Cinema Flat beneath, causing extensive casualties. Soon Prince of Wales started to capsize to port (even though she had taken more torpedo hits to starboard) and HMS Express came alongside to take off the wounded and non-fighting crew. The order to abandon ship was then given and soon after Prince of Wales rolled over to port, settled by the head, and sank at 1318. As she rolled over, she scraped Express, lying close alongside taking off survivors, with her bilge keel, and very nearly took the destroyer down with her.Stephen, p. 114. The rumbling sound of the attacks was heard in Singapore. Survivors from and in the water as a destroyer moves in for the rescue. The Japanese had achieved eight torpedo hits, four each on Prince of WalesThe Explorers Club Expedition ‘Job 74’ survey report 2007, pp. 9–21. and Repulse,Bloody Shambles Volume One, by Christopher Shores, Brian Cull and Yasuho Izawa; direct quote from Flt Lt Plenty on page 121.The Explorers Club Expedition ‘Job 74’ survey report 2007, pp. 6–8. out of 49 torpedoes, while losing only three aircraft during the attack itself (one Nell torpedo bomber from the Genzan Air Group and two Betty torpedo bombers from the Kanoya Air Group) and a fourth plane was so badly damaged that it crashed on landing. The 2007 survey of the two wrecks confirmed that there were only four torpedo hits on Prince of Wales; and could only confirm two hits on Repulse, as the amidships area where the other two hits were reported was buried beneath the seabed.The Explorers Club Expedition ‘Job 74’ survey report 2007, pp. 6–8. The air cover assigned to Force Z, ten Buffalo fighters of No. 453 Squadron RAAF, arrived over the battle area at 1318, just as Prince of Wales sank. They encountered a scouting aircraft piloted by Ensign Masato Hoashi, who had discovered Force Z earlier,Middlebrook and Mahoney, Battleship, p. 257, and Marder, Old Friends, New Enemies, p. 479. but it managed to escape the Buffaloes and returned to confirm the sinkings. Had it been shot down, the Japanese might have assumed that the two ships had survived the attack, and struck again. =After the action= Destroyers Electra and Vampire moved in to rescue survivors of Repulse, while Express rescued those from the Prince of Wales. 840 sailors were lost: 513 in Repulse and 327 in Prince Of Wales. After they were rescued, some survivors of the Repulse manned action stations to free Electra sailors to rescue more survivors. In particular, Repulse gunners manned 'X' and 'Y' 4.7-inch (120 mm) mounts, and Repulse's dentist assisted Electra's medical teams with the wounded. In total nearly 1,000 survivors of Repulse were rescued, 571 by Electra. Vampire picked up nine officers, 213 ratings, and one civilian war correspondent from Repulse, and two sailors from Prince of Wales. Of the high-ranking officers on Prince of Wales, Admiral Phillips and Captain John Leach chose to go down with their ship, and the senior survivor was Lt Cdr A. G. Skipwith, the ship's First Lieutenant, who was rescued by Express. Captain William Tennant of Repulse was rescued by Vampire. According to the London Gazette report by Flt Lt Vigors: On the way back to Singapore with the survivors, Express passed Stronghold and the four American destroyers heading north. Express signalled the action was over, but the ships proceeded to search the area for more survivors. None were found. While returning to Singapore from this search, Edsall boarded the fishing trawler sighted by Force Z that morning. The trawler was identified as the Japanese vessel Kofuku Maru, and was taken to Singapore, where the Japanese crew was interned. While the Japanese bombers were returning to their airfields in French Indochina, a second wave was being prepared for another attack on Force Z. They had not been given accurate information on the progress of the battle. The attack was called off as soon as they received confirmed reports of the sinkings from Ensign Hoashi. The next day, Lt Haruki Iki flew to the site of the battle, dropping two wreaths of flowers into the sea to honour combatants from both sides who had died in the battle. One was for the fellow members of his Kanoya Air Group, while the other was for the British sailors whose display of bravery in defence of the ships had gained them the utmost admiration from all pilots in his squadron. Effects of the sinking The bell raised from The morning after the battle, Prime Minister Winston Churchill received a phone call at his bedside from Sir Dudley Pound, the First Sea Lord. Churchill delivered news of the sinking to the House of Commons before noon on 11 December, which was followed by a full review of the situation in Malaya the next day. Singapore had essentially been reduced to a land base after both capital ships were lost, being turned into a land fortress, something it had never been intended to be, rather than a base from which to project naval power. The Eastern Fleet would spend the remainder of the invasion withdrawing their vessels to Ceylon and the Dutch East Indies. They were not reinforced by battleships until March 1942, with the arrival of and four s. Although all five battleships survived the Indian Ocean raid, their service in the Pacific was uneventful and they were later withdrawn to East Africa and the Mediterranean. The Prince of Wales and Repulse were the first capital ships actively defending themselves to be sunk solely by air power while steaming in the open sea. Both of them were relatively fast ships compared to the slower US battleships that were caught at anchor at Pearl Harbor. Furthermore, Prince of Wales was a new battleship with passive and active anti-aircraft defences against contemporary aircraft, being equipped with the advanced HACS, although it was largely inoperable during the battle. Combined with the earlier raid on Pearl Harbor, this left the Allies with only three operational capital ships in the Pacific Theatre: the three aircraft carriers , , and . However, these events did prompt the Allies and the US Navy in particular to realise the potency of aircraft, and their carriers would be instrumental in the counterattack. The ships today The wrecks of the two ships were found after the war, Repulse in 183 feet (56 m) of water, and Prince of Wales in 223 feet (68 m). Both are in a nearly upside-down position. Buoys were attached to the propeller shafts, and flags of the Royal Navy are attached to the lines and are regularly changed by divers. These Royal Navy wrecks are Crown property. Prince of Wales bell was removed from the wreck in 2002 by an authorised team of Royal Navy and British civilian divers in response to fears it would be stolen by unauthorised divers. The bell is now on display at the Merseyside Maritime Museum in Liverpool. It is currently traditional for every passing Royal Navy ship to perform a remembrance service over the site of the wrecks. In May 2007, a survey of the exterior hull of both Prince of Wales and Repulse, was conducted.https://explorers.org/flag_reports/Flag_118_-_Kevin_Denlay_- _Update.pdf The expedition's findings sparked considerable interest among naval architects and marine engineers around the world; as they detailed the exact nature of the damage to Prince of Wales and the exact location and number of torpedo hits for the first time. Consequently, the findings contained in the initial expedition reporthttps://explorers.org/flag_reports/Flag_118_-_Kevin_Denlay_-_Update.pdf and later supplementary reports were analysed by the SNAME (Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers) Marine Forensics Committee and a resultant paper was drawn up entitled \\"Death of a Battleship: A Reanalysis of the Tragic Loss of HMS Prince of WalesFor latest version see - https://www.pacificwrecks.com/ships/hms/prince_of_wales/death-of-a- battleship-2012-update.pdf This paper was subsequently presented at a meeting of RINA (Royal Institution of Naval Architects) and IMarEST (Institute of Marine Engineering, Science & Technology) members in London by Mr William Garzke.

At the Milwaukee Public Museum, his early work consisted of animals found in Wisconsin prairies and woodlands. One of these was a diorama of a muskrat group, which is sometimes referred to as the first museum diorama; however, such dioramas, and dioramas depicting \\"habitat groups,\\" dated back well into the early 1800s, and were quite popular with taxidermists in Victorian England. He also created historical reindeer and orangutan exhibits. \\"Fighting African Elephants\\" on display in Stanley Field Hall, The Field Museum, Chicago Akeley left the Milwaukee Public Museum in 1892 and set up a private studio from which he continued to do contract work, including three mustangs for the Smithsonian Institution for exhibition at the World's Columbian Exposition. In 1896, he joined the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, where he developed his innovative taxidermy techniques, notably the creation of lightweight, hollow, but sturdy mannequins on which to mount the animals' skins. His techniques, which involved sculpting the realistic musculature of the animals in active poses before mounting the skin, were also notable for their life-like representation. Akeley was the Field Museum's chief taxidermist from 1896-1909 and prepared more than 130 mounted specimens and dioramas. His most famous creations include the \\"Fighting African Elephants\\" in the central hall of the Field Museum, killed by Akeley and his wife Delia Akeley before being brought to Chicago for mounting and first put on display in 1909. He was also a prolific inventor, perfecting a \\"cement gun\\" to repair the crumbling facade of the Field Columbian Museum in Chicago (the old Palace of Fine Arts from the World's Columbian Exposition. He is today known as the inventor of shotcrete, or \\"gunite\\" as he termed it at the time.Allentown Equipment, History of Gunite/Shotcrete (URL accessed March 25, 2006) Akeley did not use sprayable concrete in his taxidermy work, as is sometimes suggested. Akeley also invented a highly mobile motion picture camera for capturing wildlife, started a company to manufacture it, and patented it in 1915. The Akeley \\"pancake\\" camera (so-called because it was round) was soon adopted by the War Department for use in World War I, primarily for aerial use, and later by newsreel companies, and Hollywood studios, primarily for aerial footage and action scenes. F. Trubee Davison covered these and other Akeley inventions in a special issue of Natural History magazine. Akeley also wrote several books, including stories for children, and an autobiography In Brightest Africa (1920). He was awarded more than 30 patents for his inventions. Akeley specialized in African mammals, particularly the gorilla and the elephant. As a taxidermist, he improved on techniques of fitting the skin over a carefully prepared and sculpted form of the animal's body, producing very lifelike specimens, with consideration of musculature, wrinkles, and veins. He also displayed the specimens in groups in a natural setting. Many animals that he preserved he had personally collected.  The Akeley Method  First and foremost, Akeley believed and was obsessively committed to the idea that taxidermy could produce mounted animals that look not just lifelike, but alive. Akeley was equally committed to presenting mounts in the context of their scientifically accurate environments and social interactions.Gorilla diorama is one of Akeley's dioramas, which is on display in the American Museum of Natural History. Akeley's techniques resulted in anatomically accurate, skinless manikins of an animal in lifelike actions and postures. The mannequin was extremely lightweight and hollow and made primarily of papier mache and wire mesh. Akeley based the mannequin on precise field measurements and photographs as well as his understanding of the animal's anatomy and behavior in its natural environment. After creating the mannequin, the hide and hooves were meticulously attached. The steps to the Akeley Method: # Akeley first sculpted a detailed and precise 1/12th scale clay model of his ultimate mount # He then built an armature using: skeletal bones, wood, metal rods, wire, and wire mesh # Akeley then covered the armature with plaster and then clay, which he sculpted to produce an exact model of the living animal # He then coated the clay model with plaster. When dry, the plaster mold was removed from the clay in sections and resulted in a perfect mold of the sculpted model # Papier mache pulp and supportive mesh wire was applied to the inside of the plaster mold and when dried produced a full-scale hollow mannequin in the exact form of the original sculpture #The mannequin was clothed with the original pelt and sewn up so that not a seam is discernible African expeditions Carl Akeley and the Leopard he killed barehanded. Akeley first traveled to Africa in 1896 when he was invited by Daniel Elliot, Curator of the Zoology Department in the new Columbian Field Museum, on an eight month expedition to Somaliland. It was on this trip that Akeley came face to face with a deadly 80-pound leopard which he strangled with his bare hands. Akeley collected hundreds of animal specimens including: hartebeest, gazelles, hyenas, kudus, oryx, and lions. The process of collecting specimens included: killing, measuring, photographing, skinning, de-boning, preserving, and packing them for shipment back to Chicago. In 1905, Marshall Field funded Akeley’s next trip to Africa which lasted twelve months and brought back two bull elephants which he would later mount for display. Akeley took nearly 1,000 glass plate photos and collected 17 tons of material including: 400 mammal skins, 1200 small mammal skins, 800 bird skins, and a fair number of bird and mammal skeletons. In addition to zoologic material he also collected more than 900 anthropological specimens and crates of leaves that he would use as models for his dioramas. In 1909, Akeley accompanied Theodore Roosevelt on a year-long expedition in Africa funded by the Smithsonian Institution and began working at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, where his efforts can still be seen in the Akeley Hall of African Mammals. Akeley joined the Explorers Club in 1912, having been sponsored by three of the Club's seven Charter Members: Frank Chapman, Henry Collins Walsh, and Marshall Saville. For qualifying, Akeley wrote only, \\"Explorations in Somaliland and British East Africa.\\" He became the Club's sixth president serving from 1917–1918.\\"The Old Man of Mikeno\\", bronze bust of a mountain gorilla by Carl AkeleyIn 1921, eager to learn about gorillas to determine if killing them for museum dioramas was justified, Akeley led an expedition to Mt. Mikeno in the Virunga Mountains at the edge of the then Belgian Congo. At that time, gorillas were quite exotic, with very few even in zoos, and collecting such animals for educational museum exhibitions was not uncommon. In the process of \\"collecting\\" several mountain gorillas, Akeley's attitude was fundamentally changed and for the remainder of his life he worked for the establishment of a gorilla preserve in the Virungas. In 1925, greatly influenced by Akeley, King Albert I of Belgium established the Albert National Park, (since renamed Virunga National Park). It was Africa's first national park. Opposed to hunting them for sport or trophies, he remained an advocate of collection for scientific and educational purposes.Milwaukee Public Museum Exhibit: Samson Remembered One of the members of his 1921 expedition was six- year-old Alice Hastings Bradley, who later wrote science fiction under the name James Tiptree, Jr. Akeley began his fifth journey to the Congo with the start of the dry season in late 1926. He died on November 18 of dysentery and was buried in Africa, just miles from where he encountered his first gorilla, the \\"Old Man of Mikeno\\".  Personal life  His wife, Mary Jobe Akeley, married him two years before he died. He had previously been married to Delia J. Akeley (1875–1970) for nearly 20 years. Delia Akeley accompanied him on two of his biggest and most productive safaris to Africa in 1905 and again in 1909. Delia later returned to Africa twice under the auspices of the Brooklyn Museum of Arts and Sciences. She organized and led both trips and lived for several months in the Ituri Forest with Pygmies.

Situated in a semi-arid area previously known as the Taru Desert it opened in April 1948, and is located near the town of Voi in the Taita-Taveta County of the former Coast Province. The park is divided into east and west sections by the A109 road and a railway. Named for the Tsavo River, which flows west to east through the national park, it borders the Chyulu Hills National Park, and the Mkomazi Game Reserve in Tanzania. Geography Inside Tsavo East National Park, the Athi and Tsavo rivers converge to form the Galana River. Most of the park consists of semi- arid grasslands and savanna. It is considered one of the world's biodiversity strongholds, and its popularity is mostly due to the vast amounts of diverse wildlife that can be seen, including the famous 'big five' consisting of lion, black rhino, cape buffalo, elephant and leopard. The park is also home to a great variety of bird life such as the black kite, crowned crane, lovebird and the sacred ibis. Tsavo East National Park is generally flat, with dry plains across which the Galana River flows. Other features include the Yatta Plateau and Lugard Falls. Tsavo West National Park is more mountainous and wetter, with swamps, Lake Jipe and the Mzima Springs. It is known for birdlife and for its large mammals. It is also home to a black rhino sanctuary. Archaeology and history Although a few Early Stone Age and Middle Stone Age archaeological sites are recorded from ground surface finds in Tsavo, there is much evidence for thriving Late Stone Age economy from 6,000 to 1,300 years ago. Research has shown that Late Stone Age archaeological sites are found close to the Galana River in high numbers. The inhabitants of these sites hunted wild animals, fished and kept domesticated animals. Because of the sparse availability of water away from the Galana River, human settlement in Tsavo focused on the riparian areas and in rock shelters as one moves west.Wright, David (2005) Environment, Chronology and Resource Exploitation of the Pastoral Neolithic in Tsavo, Kenya. PhD Dissertation. Department of Anthropology, University of Illinois at Chicago. Swahili merchants traded with the inhabitants of Tsavo for ivory, catskins, and probably slaves as early as 700 AD (and probably earlier). There is no evidence for direct Swahili \\"colonization\\" of Tsavo. Instead, trade was probably accomplished by moving goods to and from the Swahili Coast via extended kin-networks. Trade goods such as cowry shells and beads have been recovered from archaeological sites dating to the early Swahili period.Wright, David (2005). New perspectives on early regional interaction networks in East Africa: A view from Tsavo National Park, Kenya. African Archaeological Review 22(3): DOI: 10.1007/s10437-005-8041-7 19th century British and German explorers document people we now refer to as Orma and Watha during their travels through the \\"nyika\\" (\\"bush\\" or \\"hinterland\\") and generally viewed them as hostile toward their interests. Beginning in the late 19th/early 20th century, the British began a concerted effort to colonise the interior of Kenya and built a railway through Tsavo in 1898. Two \\"man-eating lions\\" terrorised the construction crews led by Lt. Col Patterson who eventually shot the pair not before they had killed one hundred and thirty five Indians and local workers. The railway was eventually completed through to Kisumu on Lake Victoria. Tsavo remained the homeland for Orma pastoralists and Watha hunter-gatherers until 1948, when it was gazetted a national park. At that time, the Orma with their livestock were driven off and the aboriginal population of the Watha people was forcefully relocated to Voi and Mtito Andei as well as other locations within the nearby Taita Hills. Following Kenyan independence in 1963, hunting was banned in the park and management of Tsavo was turned over to the authority that eventually became the Kenya Wildlife Service. Tsavo currently attracts photo-tourists from all over the world interested in experiencing the vastness of the wilderness and incredible terrain. Major attractions =Mudanda Rock= Viewpoint from the top of Mudanda Rock The Mudanda Rock is a 1.6 km inselberg of stratified rock that acts as a water catchment that supplies a natural dam below. It offers an excellent vantage point for the hundreds of elephants and other wildlife that come to drink during the dry season. =Yatta Plateau= The Yatta Plateau, the world's longest lava flow, runs along the western boundary of the park above the Athi River. Its 290 km length was formed by lava from Ol Doinyo Sabuk Mountain. =Lugard Falls= Lugard Falls, named after Frederick Lugard, is a series of white water rapids on the Galana River. =Aruba Dam= Aruba Dam was built in 1952 across the Voi River. The reservoir created by the dam attracts many animals and water birds. =Mammals= Tsavo East National Park is one of the world's largest game reserves, providing undeveloped wilderness homes to vast numbers of animals. Famous are the Tsavo lions, a population whose adult males often lack manes entirely. In total there are about 675 lions in the Amboseli-Tsavo ecosystem.Frank, L., Maclennan, S., Hazzah, L., Hill, T., & Bonham, R. (2006). Lion Killing in the Amboseli-Tsavo Ecosystem, 2001–2006, and its Implications for Kenya's Lion Population. PDF Living with Lions, Nairobi, Kenya, 9. A comprehensive list of the animal types found in Tsavo East Park includes the aardwolf, yellow baboon, bat, Cape buffalo, Senegal bushbaby, bushbuck, caracal, African wildcat, southeast African cheetah, African civet, Kirk's dik-dik, African wild dog, African dormouse, blue duiker, bush duiker, Harvey's red duiker, common eland, African bush elephant, bat-eared fox, northern greater galago, Grant's gazelle, rusty-spotted genet, common genet, gerenuk, giraffe, African savanna hare, springhare, Coke's hartebeest, Hunter's hartebeest, East African hedgehog, spotted hyena, striped hyena, yellow-spotted rock hyrax, southern tree hyrax, impala, black-backed jackal, side-striped jackal, klipspringer, lesser kudu, leopard, lion, banded mongoose, dwarf mongoose, Egyptian mongoose, marsh mongoose, slender mongoose, white-tailed mongoose, vervet monkey, Sykes' monkey, fringe-eared oryx, clawless otter, ground pangolin, crested porcupine, cane rat, giant rat, naked mole rat, honey badger, bohor reedbuck, black rhinoceros, serval, elephant shrew, bush squirrel, East African red squirrel, striped ground squirrel, unstriped ground squirrel, suni, common warthog, ellipsen waterbuck, plains zebra and Grevy's zebra. =Birds= Over 500 bird species have been recorded in the area, including ostriches, kestrels, buzzards, starlings, weaver birds, kingfishers, hornbills, secretary birds and herons.  Poaching  Between 2001 and 2006 more than 100 lions have been killed in the Amboseli-Tsavo ecosystem. Most of them have been speared by young men. The poachers usually do not face serious consequences. In contrast, the game scouts who arrested offenders have been punished by the community.

It is similar to feudal Japan, though it also includes aspects of other Asian cultures, as well as magic and mythical beasts. The setting was used by Wizards of the Coast as the basis for their updated Oriental Adventures Dungeons & Dragons supplement. There is no given name for the entire world which the setting describes, so \\"Rokugan\\" is used alternately to refer to the specific nation within the setting or to refer to the entire world. Strictly speaking this is incorrect, but as the Emperor lays claim to all that is as a right of being the descendant of Amaterasu (Lady Sun) and Onnotangu (Lord Moon), the courtiers of the Emerald Empire would see this as an appropriate use. The citizens and rulers of the Burning Sands and Ivory Kingdoms might disagree, however. Some say that Ningen-Do, the name of the metaphysical realm in which the world is placed, serves as a proper name for the world. History Alderac Entertainment Group (AEG) published Legend of the Five Rings (L5R) collectible card game in 1995. Rokugan surfaced as its background setting, where several clans and factions vie for domination over the empire. In 1997, Legend of the Five Rings Roleplaying Game was released. While transitioning from Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd edition to Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition, Wizards of the Coast acquired its rights. Wizards opted to let Alderac Entertainment Group continue publishing second-edition material for the Legend of the Five Rings Roleplaying Game system. They were simultaneously working on a d20 campaign setting book for the world of Rokugan; in October 2001, Wizards finally produced the setting book they had had in process for over a year: James Wyatt's Oriental Adventures (2001), which offered new d20 rules for Oriental realms, some of them specific to the world of Rokugan. After that, all of the Legend of the Five Rings rights went back to AEG, who immediately began supplementing Wizards' Oriental Adventures with the Rokugan Oriental Adventures Campaign Setting (2001), which came out just two months after Oriental Adventures, in December 2001; two more d20 books followed over the next couple of months, Creatures of Rokugan (2002) and Magic of Rokugan (2002).  The Empire of Rokugan  Rokugani society is based on a clan structure, with seven (then eight with the addition of the Mantis and later nine with the addition of the Spider) so-called \\"Great Clans\\", as well as a number of minor clans. Great Clans are made up of several family lines, each with their own general purpose within the clan. Minor clans, on the other hand, generally only have one family. Each clan also has areas of land under their control which the emperor bestowed on them as a fief. The emperor retains ownership of all lands, however, and the clans essentially rent the lands they use by paying taxes annually. = Crab Clan = The Crab Clan is considered the least cultured or courtly of all the clans. Their duty is to guard the Carpenter Wall that separates the empire of Rokugan from the foul and tainted Shadowlands. In guarding the wall, they face constant attack from undead foes, Oni (demons), and a variety of other evil minions. It has been the Crab clan's duty to guard the wall for as far back as memory goes. It is, for this reason, that they have become experts of defensive strategies. Their warriors are all battle hardened and experienced and most of them prefer to wield massive weapons such as the tetsubo (two-handed war-club) or the no- dachi (two-handed sword). The clan families are Hida, Hiruma, Kaiu, Kuni, Toritaka, and Yasuki. The clan colors are grey and dark blue. = Crane Clan = The Left Hand of the Emperor - The Crane Clan is considered the most artistic of all the clans. They are known throughout the empire for their trained courtiers, artisans and duelists. Crane samurai are arguably the finest duelists in Rokugan. They are trained heavily in Iaijutsu (fast-draw technique) where the sword is drawn and a killing blow is struck with one, very fast movement. The clan families are Asahina, Daidoji, Doji, Kakita and the Yasuki, the only family name used by two separate clans. The clan colors are white and light blue. = Dragon Clan = The Dragon Clan controls the mountains to the north of the empire. They are aloof and removed from the affairs of the other clans, preferring to reside in their mountain strongholds. Most of the land the Dragon Clan holds becomes completely cut off from the rest of the empire during the winter due to heavy snowfall. Their samurai use niten (two-strike style) in which combatants use both katana and wakizashi to execute very fast strikes in rapid succession. To many observers, the niten looks more like a dance than actual combat, however, niten is a deadly art requiring a great deal of skill and coordination. The clan families are Kitsuki, Mirumoto, Tamori, The Order of Tattooed Men (sub-divided into Togashi, Hitomi, and Hoshi families), and formerly the Agasha, who now swear allegiance to the Phoenix. The clan colors are emerald green and gold. Their founder was the Kami Togashi, who unlike his siblings remained alive in a vessal body for over 1000 years until he was killed by his brother Fu Leng on the second day of thunder. Notable Dragon clan members include Agasha Tamori and Tamori Chosai, both Oracles of Fire; Mirumoto, the original Dragon Thunder; Hitomi, the second Dragon Thunder and formerly Lady Moon after the Death of Onnatangu; Togashi Satsu, Former Dragon Champion, Grandson of Togashi and current voice of the Empress; and Iweko I, formerly Kitsuki Iweko, Daimyo of the Kitsuki and current Empress. = Lion Clan = The Lion Clan is known as a very aggressive and honor-driven clan. They are the Emperor's Right Hand, personally defending his causes above all else. Some of the finest generals of all Rokugan have come from the Lion clan. The Lion Clan also has the biggest army in the empire, and it's known for its rigid adherence to the Bushido's Code. The clan families are Akodo, Ikoma, Kitsu, and Matsu. The clan colors are brown and tan. = Phoenix Clan = The Phoenix Clan is known as the most skilled with magic in the empire, and also as the most peaceful. They have schools of magic associated with each element, including the empire's only school dealing with Void magic. The clan families are Agasha, Asako, Isawa, and Shiba. The clan colors are red and orange. = Scorpion Clan = The Scorpion Clan is known as the Underhand of the Emperor. They are known for their courtiers' abilities. Their ninja are experts in assassination and espionage. Scorpion knowledge is not shared with outsiders, but is a true thing of power. Scorpion architects have constructed many key structures throughout Rokugan, and, as a result, many of those structures have secret passages and rooms unknown to all but the Scorpion clan. It is a Scorpion tradition to always be masked, or face painted. The clan families are Bayushi, Shosuro, Soshi, and Yogo. The clan colors are crimson and black. = Unicorn Clan = The Unicorn Clan is known for their cavalry and horsemanship. They are considered barbarians by the other clans because the clan as a whole spent nearly 800 of the last thousand years outside of the empire. Before they left Rokugan, the Unicorn Clan was known as the Ki-Rin Clan, and the Unicorn Clan are their descendants. They hunt game and eat red meat and have adopted a number of other customs that are considered taboo by the rest of the Clans. However, the horses they brought back from far off lands are faster, stronger, and larger than any found in Rokugan. The clan families are Moto, Ide, Iuchi, Shinjo, and Utaku, formerly known as Otaku. The clan colors are purple and white. = Mantis Clan = The Mantis Clan was formerly a minor clan, until after the Second Day of Thunder, when they won their place as a great clan. Although they do not have a standing army, their navy is the most powerful in all of Rokugan. They are tasked to patrol the Rokugani seas and guard them against gaijin invaders. They are considered as pirates by the other clans and some of their samurai actually engage in piracy. The clan families are Kitsune, Moshi, Tsuruchi, and Yoritomo. The clan colors are silver and green. The Fox Clan has recently been absorbed into the Mantis Clan (as Kitsune family). The Centipede and the Wasp Clan have been absorbed into the Mantis Clan (as Moshi and Tsuruchi families, respectively). = Spider Clan = The Spider Clan was formed by Daigotsu, the one and true Heir to the throne of Rokugan, out of Shadowland tainted Samurai, Blood Speakers and Monks that followed his interpretation on the Tao. It was considered an outlaw clan until the end of the Destroyer War when the Empress granted them Great Clan Status in what many Samurai perceived as a \\"deal with the darkness\\". Those members of the Spider Clan that contain the Shadowland Taint are banished to the colonies in the Ivory Kingdom. The Clan consists of the Daigotsu family and the monks. The Chuda family has now split from the Spider as the clan ascent to great clan status. The Chuda are now joining forces with the Horde of the Jikogou. The Spider Clan was governed by a council until its current clan champion (Daigotsu Kanpeki) ascended to his position. = Minor Clans = There are many minor clans in Rokugan—clans that have been formed since the birth of the empire by those other than the seven Kami. New clans are not founded lightly. The founders of these clans generally performed some extraordinarily valiant deed or favor for the Empire. Among the Minor clans are: Hare Clan, Ox Clan, Sparrow Clan, Snake Clan, Monkey Clan, Tortoise Clan, Bat Clan, Firefly Clan, Badger Clan, Oriole Clan and Dragonfly Clan. The Dragonfly Clan was wiped out in a war between the Lion and the Dragon, but has been reconstructed with the help of Toturi Sezaru, brother of the former Emperor. Besides the conglomoration of minor clans that makes up the Mantis, there are other minor clans that have been absorbed by great clans. The Falcon Clan has been absorbed into the Crab (as Toritaka family).  Other Regions  = Burning Sands = The Burning Sands lie to the north and west of Rokugan. These lands consist mostly of vast stretches of desert where nomads roam the land and bitter wars are fought over the smallest reservoirs of water. It is thematically based on a fantastic version of Arabia. = Ivory Kingdoms = The Ivory Kingdoms lie far to the west and south of Rokugan, past the Shadowlands. Little is known of these islands and their inhabitants to the general populace of Rokugan, although secretly (and illegally) the Mantis Clan has been carrying on trade with this nation for some time. Most of the population was wiped out during the Destroyer war as it was sacrificed to make the army that attacked Rokugan. It is thematically based on a fantasy version of India. = Shadowlands = The Shadowlands border Rokugan to the south and south-west. While not a nation per se this is a vile land where the very air can be poisonous, and foul, unholy creatures are summoned forth by dark powers to wage a never-ending battle against all life in Rokugan. Simply entering this territory subjects an individual to the possibility of contracting The Shadowlands Taint, a mystical infection that gradually degrades the individual's morals and sanity, while granting them enhanced strength, speed, and endurance. The risk level and severity of The Taint increase as one proceeds toward the center of the Shadowlands, The Black Pit, which is a direct physical connection to Jigoku. The Crab Clan, who must regularly fight in areas of the near Shadowlands, consume a huge proportion of the empire's jade supply, as a piece of jade will absorb the corruption attempting to reach the one carrying it for a limited time before dissolving. = Northern Steppe = North of Rokugan, beyond the Dragon, Ox, Badger and Phoenix Clan territories, lies the endless steppes of the Yobanjin. These nomads are fierce raiders, known for their Wyrm riding chiefs and powerful shamans. It is thematically based on a fantasy version of Mongolia. = Rest of the World = Far in the West, beyond the Burning Sands or the Ivory Kingdoms, are other lands, most of them with no contact at all with Rokugan. The Senpet, once a powerful theocracy (a setting based on a pharaonic Egypt of fantasy), has been subjugated by the military of the Yodotai (a Roman setting). Other kingdoms, such as the Thrane or Merenae, which used to threaten Rokugan with their gun carrying vessels, are all but disappeared after a strange plague wiped them out.  Denizens  In the world of Rokugan, there are many different and extraordinary creatures roaming the lands, and humans are not the only beings to have developed a civilization. In addition to goblins, mujina, oni, dragons and a host of other beings, the following are the major species. = Humans = The great majority of the population of Rokugan are humans. Humans almost exclusively make up the population of the clans, great and minor, as well as the other groups within Rokugan. The number of non-human members of Rokugan's clans is low. = Kenku = The kenku are an ancient race resembling very large humanoid crows. Kenku are legendary swordsmen and are, at least in legend, responsible for training some of the most famous Rokugani swordsmen in history. Seeing a kenku is rare, and getting one to take on a student is nearly impossible. These creatures have removed themselves from Rokugan almost entirely. They appear as large crows standing upright, and their wings can be flexed and used as arms. =Lost= The Lost are humans who have given themselves to Fu Leng's evil will. They are often \\"blessed\\" with his dark gifts, which eventually lead to madness. Some of the Lost have formed mock societies. There have even been rumors of children born in the Shadowlands, many of whom have the benefits of the dark gifts, but with little in the way of curses due to their unfailing devotion to Fu Leng. = Naga = The naga are an ancient race of creatures who appear half-human, half-serpent. Long before the rise of Rokugan, the Naga had a vast and vibrant civilization. At some point in pre-history, however, the entire race of Naga entered a deep sleep, where they remained for nearly 100,000 years. They awakened briefly during the Second Day of Thunder, but after a few years of involvement in Rokugani affairs, they once again returned to their slumber. = Nezumi = The \\"ratlings\\" are a race of large, intelligent rats. They currently live in squalor, barely better than animals, although they have once had an extensive, advanced society. Unfortunately, this civilization was entirely within what has become the Shadowlands, and was destroyed when the dark Kami Fu Leng fell to the earth. Nothing found by any explorers has verified the claim of a previous Nezumi society until recently. Allegedly, many stories of the Naga history supposedly provided evidence the society never existed, but Ikoma Otemi found, in an island that is now under protectorate of Lion Clan, ancient scrolls proving these rumors are indeed true. The Nezumi control the Name's Magic, an ancient and very powerful form of magic. Unlike any other known race, the Nezumi are completely immune to The Taint, and as such the Crab have formed alliances with many of the families and tribes of the Nezumi living near the wall. = Zokujin = The \\"copper goblins\\" are small creatures with wiry hair and heads vaguely resembling those of frogs. They have extraordinary natural tunneling abilities—being that they eat rock for nourishment, this is little surprise. Because of this, they are often used—involuntarily more often than not—by the clans of Rokugan in their various mines. Zokujin live to be centuries old, and an experienced zokujin shaman will have more powerful abilities in the area of Earth magic than is possible for human shugenja. =Ogre= Though now little more than low-witted brutes, the ogres once had a thriving Empire, and rumors of great advancements beyond that of even the current humans. However, with the fall of Fu Leng from the Heavens, the ogres were subjugated to his will, suffering extensive physical corruption and devolution, and have since become the monsters they now are. =Kitsune= Kitsune are mostly benevolent nature spirits that often take the form of an animal, but on occasion can take human form and sometimes fall in love with humans. The Kitsune Family, formerly the Fox clan, has an affinity with Kitsune and call upon them as allies and protect them from harm. =Ashlan= An immortal race of malicious sorcerers, the Ashlan breed very rarely, with only 3 Ashlan being born in the last 1000 years. They are sworn enemies of the Naga, and are forbidden from entering Rokugan directly, but instead wield influence through lesser minions. =Oracles= Powerful beings that represent both the good and evil sides of the elemental forces. Oracles cannot attack a being unless they are attacked first, and can be killed but are extremely powerful. Oracles are former mortals who attain the Role of Oracle by being selected by the Celestial Dragons or by Jigoku.

His commercial work was featured prominently in advertising and magazines; however, Loomis is best known as author of a series of instructional art books printed throughout the 20th century. Long after his death, Loomis' realistic style has continued to influence popular artists. Early life William Andrew Loomis was born on June 15, 1892, in Syracuse, New York. Loomis grew up in Zanesville, Ohio, and spent much of his working life in Chicago, Illinois. He studied at the Art Students League of New York under George Bridgman and Frank DuMond when he was 19. Loomis then went back to Chicago to work at an art studio and study at the Art Institute of Chicago. Career 1938 painting by Andrew Loomis, representing the Dionne quintuplets. 1930s painting by Andrew Loomis, representing Frances Herdlinger at the Mars Factory After military service in World War I, Loomis worked for a couple of advertising agencies before opening his own studio in downtown Chicago in 1922. From that time until the late 1930s Loomis produced advertising paintings for many large companies such as Coca Cola, Studebaker, Palmolive, Quaker Oats, Munsingwear and Kellogg's. He was the official portrait painter of the Dionne quintuplets, and he created Jack and Bingo for the cover of the Cracker Jack box. In 1932, Loomis created paintings for the advertisements that would introduce 3 Musketeers. One of those paintings was a portrait of a Mars chemist, Frances Herdlinger. Herdlinger was one of three women chemists working regularly with Forrest Mars Sr. on the development of the new candy bar. In the 1930s, he taught at the American Academy of Art. It was during this time that his teaching techniques were compiled for his first book, Fun With a Pencil (1939). Loomis would go on to release several more books in the coming decades, including one of his most popular, Figure Drawing for All It's Worth (1943). Many of the books exhibit his own personally crafted techniques – such as the \\"ball and plane\\" method of head drawing – guided by Loomis's humorous dialogue. Many of the titles gained strong appeal for their academic value and went through several printings during the 20th century. Loomis died in 1959, but his final book, Eye of the Painter and Elements of Beauty (1961), was printed posthumously. Influence and legacy Titan Books reissued the Andrew Loomis titles in facsimile editions between 2011 and 2013. Prior to that, the books had been out of print for decades, available only as excerpts by Walter Foster Publishing. Some of Loomis' books are currently being published in Japanese via Maar Sha Co., Ltd. Early prints have become highly collectible and sought out by art enthusiasts and practitioners.

Some of the most notable occupants include Grace RemovalsPerth Grace Removals Improvid and the Super Retail Group. History Settlement of the area dates from the late 1800s. Population was minimal until the early 1900s, with growth during the interwar period. Significant development did not occur until the post-war years, with rapid growth from the 1950s into the 1970s. The population has been relatively stable since the early 1990s, a result of some new dwellings being added to the area, but a decline in the average number of persons living in each dwelling. There is authority to suggest it is named after John Forrest, Western Australia's first Premier, or his brother Alexander. However, local folklore suggests that the name comes from Charles Hale, who settled in the area in 1902 and planted crops amongst the native forest bushland, hence Forrestfield. In 1921 a Forrestfield Progress Association was formed, and the name was shown on plans in 1944.

It was founded in 1971 as the Socialist Party of Australia (SPA) by former members of the Communist Party of Australia who resigned or were expelled from that party as a result of their opposition to policy changes. History =Socialist Party (1971–1996)= In the late 1960s, the CPA, under the leadership of National Secretary Laurie Aarons, became a strong supporter of \\"Eurocommunism\\", of abandoning Leninism and democratic centralism, and trying to form a \\"united front\\" of the various left-wing forces thrown up by the movement of opposition to the Vietnam War. The CPA leadership had become increasingly critical of the Soviet Union, particularly over the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. Dissidents took the view that the CPA should not become a left social-democratic party, and should continue as a Marxist–Leninist party. The group was described as pro-Soviet hardliners. Their position put them at odds with the CPA leadership. The SPA was led by a group of veteran trade union officials such as Pat Clancy and Peter Symon. Clancy resigned from the SPA in 1983,Australian Dictionary of Biography – Clancy, Patrick Martin (Pat) (1919–1987) and Symon was the general secretary from its formation until his death in December 2008, a total of 36 years. =Communist Party (1996–present)= The old CPA was dissolved in 1991. The SPA, believing itself to be the rightful successor to the original CPA formed in 1920, changed its name to Communist Party of Australia at its 8th Party National Congress in October 1996. After Symon's death, party president, Hannah Middleton, was elected general secretary by the 11th Party National Congress in October 2009. Vinicio Molina succeeded Middleton as party president. Bob Briton was elected general secretary at the 12th Party Congress in 2013. Bob Briton resigned as general secretary of the CPA in March 2019. Briton came into conflict with the central committee (CC) due to ideological differences between himself and others on the central committee, being accused of taking a defeatist position. This accusation was made after Briton attempted to work with the youth outside restrictive party structures which in effect hadn't maintained a youth wing in decades . Briton deleted most of the party's social media outlets in response. Briton split the party and formed the Australian Communist Party alongside other former members. On 13–14 April 2019, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Australia, elected a new leadership led by General Secretary Andrew Irving and National President Vinnie Molina. Policies The current Communist Party remains a traditional, albeit tiny, communist party, proclaiming itself to be a Marxist–Leninist party whose ultimate objective is the revolutionary transformation of Australian society and the establishment of socialism in Australia. It describes its objective as being to \\"change the direction of politics in Australia and eventually, to replace the capitalist system with a socialist one.\\" In the last 37 years of the party's existence, the party has been mainly a far-left wing political party and has played a limited role in Australia's trade union movement. The party's main policies are: * The socialist reconstruction of the Australian society * An end to privatisations of assets owned by the federal and state governments * To free Australia from foreign transnationals * Regulation by the Federal Government of prices, profit levels, and interest rates * The abolition of the Goods and Services Tax * Expansion of the public sector * Increase in the national minimum wage * Increase in pension, unemployment benefits * Reduction of the working week * Halt reductions in tariffs * Reduction of military spending Elections Michael Perth contested the seat of Port Adelaide in the 1998 and in the 2001 federal elections, but polled less than 1% of the vote in both cases. Bob Briton contested the SA state seat of Lee in 2010 and polled 2.9% of the votes. At the 2010 federal election the party endorsed a candidate for the House of Representatives seat of Sydney as part of the Communist Alliance. The party received 0.83% or 656 of the 79,377 votes cast.Virtual Tally Room – Division of Sydney It also endorsed two candidates for the Senate in New South Wales, receiving 0.17% or 6,999 of the 4,333,267 votes cast. The Australian Electoral Commission deregistered Communist Alliance successor name The Communists on 22 May 2012 due to the party failing to prove it had 500 members. The Communist Party of Australia received its first electoral win with the election of Tony Oldfield in local government elections on 8 September 2012 to Auburn City Council, New South Wales. The Communist Party of Australia planned to run candidates in the 2016 federal election, but their registration was rejected by the Australian Electoral Commission. In 2017 the party attempted to register under the name \\"The Communists\\", but they were again rejected due to the party failing to prove it had at least 500 members.

The station is currently owned by Hubbard Broadcasting, and is a full-time simulcast of Chicago-licensed WDRV (97.1 FM), serving Chicago's northern suburbs and southeastern Wisconsin. \\"The Drive\\" programs a broad-based classic rock format. History WAXO first signed on the air at 96.9 FM on November 4, 1962; the first voice heard was that of Paul Weyrich. The station's effective radiated power then was 3,500 Watts, broadcasting from a transmitter and tower at 6400 67th Street and studios in the Isermann Building at 616 56th Street in downtown Kenosha, WI. In 1966, WAXO built new AM-FM studios at the transmitter/tower location, and moved operations there. The building is now a medical facility, though the WAXO tower supports remain on the grounds. WAXO was Kenosha's second modern-day radio station after WLIP and was billed as \\"The new voice of a new and greater Kenosha\\". WAXO's first station manager was longtime broadcaster Roy Ambrose of Manitowoc, Wisconsin; Paul Weyrich was the first program director and Don Jensen was the first news director. Subsequent station managers included Richard Blaha and Darrell Gorr. In a late-1968 promotional stunt, WAXO announcer Gary Anderson held a record for constant on- air broadcast duties by performing an air shift of 96.9 hours. Service Broadcasting Corporation owned WAXO between 1962 and June 14, 1969. Arnold Johnson was president, Dr. Robert Heller was executive vice-president, and John E. Malloy Esq. was secretary-treasurer. The company had always intended to operate an AM radio station, and there was an available AM frequency allocation at 1500 kilohertz. However, there were competing interests for the AM license, most notably from neighboring Zion, Illinois, which had lost its 50,000 Watt radio station in a 1930s fire. After lengthy testimony the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) decided to grant the AM 1500 license to the Zion-Benton Broadcasting Company of Zion (principals: Billie Bicket and family), and the station became WZBN, signing on the air on September 19, 1967. After that, Service Broadcasting decided to sell WAXO, and competition developed for the licensed 96.9 FM frequency from broadcasting interests in both Zion, IL and Racine, WI. The owners of WZBN in Zion were the successful applicants, and paid $250,000 for WAXO. Within weeks a lightning strike destroyed the transmitter and WAXO's new owners were granted permission for an increase in power to 10,000 Watts horizontal and 8,100 Watts vertical and a new antenna tower at Dexter's Corner, Wisconsin. By autumn of 1969 Zion-Benton Broadcasting had changed the call letters to WKZN (for \\"Waukegan-Kenosha-Zion- Newport\\"). They referred to themselves on-air as \\"KZ97\\". The new ownership had ordered and installed a new Schafer automation system, then sold the three- year-old building and moved the WKZN studios to 2219 63rd Street in uptown Kenosha, which was built as a fire station. By 1971 WKZN was moved from Kenosha to combined WZBN-WKZN studios on the second floor of the Bicket Pharmacy (a former bank building constructed in 1909) at 2700 Sheridan Road in Zion, IL. A second Schafer automation system was added for WZBN programming. In the early 1970s, music programming was the Adult Standards format which came from a broadcast music service on open-reel tape with PSA's and spots loaded into NAB Cartridge carousels. The AM and FM music playlists differed slightly, but the Bicket's main focus was on providing ample local news covering a beat from North Chicago, IL through Kenosha, WI. News/sports/weather reports were simulcast. The WAXO call letters were later issued to 1220 AM in Lewisburg, Tennessee, where they are still in use. WAXO's 1969 tower at Dexter's Corner is still in use by the station. =Typical WAXO programming= *Sundial with Paul Weyrich *The Mike is Yours with Larry Taylor *Home Executive Club with Lida Hindley *The Noon Report and Showtime with Don Jensen *The Chuck Presley Show - Chuck Presley *The Lou Rugani Show - Lou Rugani *Sentimental Journey with Augie Gnorski (Gus Gnorski) *Moondial with Jay Wells *Passport to Italy with Mario Capponi *Your Opinion Please with Roy Ambrose *Sounds of Stereo (Chester Electronics)Gary Anderson *The Big Bands with Lew Strangberg *Play By Play with Jim Wynne *Invitation to Music with Wayne Blackmon *The Frank Carmichael Show - Frank Carmichael *The Hammond Organ Show with Lillian Crawford (and later, Lillian Gildenstern) WNIZ In 1983, WKZN was sold to Northern Illinois Broadcasting, the owners of WNIB (97.1 FM), which had been experiencing interference problems from WKZN's adjoining frequency. WKZN then became WNIZ, and simulcast nearly all of WNIB's programming until both stations were sold in 2000 for $158 million to the Bonneville broadcasting interests. On February 12, 2001, WNIB would begin stunting as a prelude to a change to classic hits a month later, while WNIZ became a simulcast of new sister station, WTMX. Call letters for 96.9 were changed to WTNX. This simulcast did very little for WTMX's ratings, and management felt it would be more appropriate to be paired up with its neighbor at 97.1. On January 1, 2003, 96.9 became the north metro frequency for \\"The Drive\\", and the call letters were changed to WWDV. Bonneville announced the sale of WWDV, as well as 16 other stations, to Hubbard Broadcasting on January 19, 2011. The sale was completed on April 29, 2011. WDRV 97.1 FM The 97.1 frequency signed on as WNIB (NIB=Northern Illinois Broadcasting, original owner) in 1957, playing classical music. Later, the company purchased the station at 96.9 FM in Zion, changing the call letters to WNIZ and serving as a simulcast for communities north of Chicago. The stations were sold in 2000 to Bonneville International. WNIB then became WDRV \\"The Drive\\" on March 15, 2001. It began as a classic hits format, but has slowly evolved into a broad-based classic rock format at the same time when former sister WLUP was sold to Emmis and changed to a mainstream rock format in 2005. Many of The Drive's personalities have had long histories at other Chicago radio stations.

It is set in Cheshire, England, in three time periods: Roman Britain, the English Civil War and the present. Plot introduction This is primarily a novel about adolescent despair, but one that uses devices of fantasy such as having events at different times in history influencing each other. It is said to be inspired by the legend of Tam Lin,Charles Butler, 'Alan Garner's Red Shift and the Shifting Ballad of \\"Tam Lim\\"' where a man or boy kidnapped by fairies is rescued by his true love. The author said that a piece of graffiti seen at a railway station, \\"Not really now not any more\\", became the focus of the novel's mood, and it forms the last line of the story. It took Garner six years to write. He provided three intertwined love stories, one set in the present, another during the English Civil War of the seventeenth century, and the third in the second century CE. Writer and folklorist, Neil Philip referred to it as \\"a complex book but not a complicated one: the bare lines of story and emotion stand clear\\". Academic specialist in children's literature, Maria Nikolajeva characterised Red Shift as \\"a difficult book\\" for an unprepared reader, identifying its main themes as those of \\"loneliness and failure to communicate\\". Ultimately, she thought that repeated re-readings of the novel bring about the realisation that \\"it is a perfectly realistic story with much more depth and psychologically more credible than the most so-called \\"realistic\\" juvenile novels.\\" =Explanation of the title= The title of the novel arises from the mind of the teenage character Tom. He talks of astronomy, cosmology and other subjects he is learning. He declares that he is too \\"blue\\", i.e. sad, and needs a \\"red shift\\". Since the cosmological red shift results from galaxies moving away from each other, this may be a metaphor for his need to get away from his current life. There are multiple occurrences of the colour red in the story. After killing many in Barthomley, Macey's skin is painted red by the tribal girl, using dye from alder bark. This marks him as a \\"redman\\", one who has killed, possibly one who has done so under the influence of a god. It is also an ancient symbol of rebirth. In Civil War Barthomley, the stone axe head is wrapped in a petticoat which has been dyed with alder. A petticoat can also be called a \\"shift\\". In modern-day Barthomley Tom notices some red colour on the rector's undergarment – again a \\"shift\\". Plot summary The folly on Mow Cop In Roman times, Macey is a soldier with a group of deserters. He has berserker fits in which he fights like ten men, using an old stone axe. Escaping from a local tribe, the \\"Cats\\" at Rudheath, the soldiers find a stockaded Cat village at Barthomley, which they pillage, killing the inhabitants except for a young girl, whom they take as a slave. They try to \\"go tribal\\", pretending to be members of another tribe, the \\"Mothers\\", and settle on Mow Cop. This is a sacred site to the Cats and the girl is their corn goddess. The Cats mine millstones on Mow Cop and bring food as offerings. The soldiers think they have engineered a truce, but the girl poisons their food and they have hallucinations, killing themselves. Only Macey is spared, as he never touched the girl, who was raped by the others. He and the girl leave together after he returns to Barthomley to bury the axe head in the burial mound, asking forgiveness for killing the villagers. In the English Civil War, Thomas Rowley lives in Barthomley with his wife Margery. They find the stone axe head buried in a mound and call it a \\"thunderstone\\", believing it to have been created by lightning striking the ground. They intend to build it into a chimney to guard against future strikes. The village is besieged by Royalist troops, who have fought in Ireland, searching for John Fowler, the village leader who has sided with Parliament. The troops eventually kill Fowler and other men of the village. Thomas and Margery are rescued by Thomas Venables, a villager serving with the Royalists who once desired Margery. He leads them to a shanty town settlement at Rudheath and tells them to go to his family on Mow Cop once Thomas has recovered from his wounds. They take the thunderstone with them and embed it in the chimney of their new home. In the modern day Tom is a teenager living cooped up in a caravan at Rudheath with his parents. He is sustained by his relationship with his girlfriend Jan, who is leaving to become a student nurse in London. They agree to meet regularly in Crewe railway station. One day they follow an ancient path from Crewe to the village of Barthomley. Returning next time on bicycles, they go further to Mow Cop, a hill dominated by a folly tower. Here they find the stone axe head embedded in an old chimney. They decide to make it a symbol of their love. Tom and Jan have been avoiding sex, but Jan reveals that she had an affair while working as an au pair in Germany. After this, Tom becomes unstable. He insists on having sex but becomes even more self-destructive and unbalanced. He tells Jan that he has sold the axe head to a museum, as it was a valuable Neolithic artefact. Their relationship dissolves and they bid a final farewell as Jan's train leaves for London. Pieces of the three narratives are alternated in an inconsistent pattern, calling attention to their similarities beyond the landscape: themes, circumstances, visual descriptions and even lines of dialogue echo throughout. Characters in Red Shift =In modern days= Tom and Jan are teenagers in love. Tom lives in a caravan park in Rudheath with his parents. His father is a sergeant major in the Army, but Tom's mother refuses to live in the barracks. There is no privacy for Tom. He has to pretend not to hear the doings of his parents at night, especially after \\"Mess night\\". Jan's parents are doctors, possibly mental health specialists. They also leave Rudheath, removing one of Tom's sanctuaries, as he used their house for studying, though his parents accuse the couple of using it for sex. Tom is highly intelligent and knowledgeable. He quotes cosmology, poetry and Shakespeare constantly, mostly as a defence against the world around him. He is polite, almost florid in his speech with strangers, even as he can be curt and sardonic with those close to him. As the novel progresses he descends into mental breakdown. Jan's commitment to Tom comes partially from the rootlessness of her upbringing, moving from place to place as her parents work at different hospitals. Tom to her represents stability and, to some extent, so does the axe head. She calls it her \\"Bunty\\", a \\"real thing\\". When Tom gives the axe head away it removes that token of stability, even as Tom himself is becoming unstable. Tom's parents seem to be living in a different world. Tom's mother does not like Jan, seeing her as a schemer who will derail Tom's chance at an education, just another girl who will get pregnant, possibly by some other boy. Tom's father is unable to communicate with his son, especially about sex. Both parents try to find refuge in an idealised family life, having Tom pose for pictures while pretending to cut his birthday cake. The family is constantly short of money. =During the Civil War= St Bertoline's Church, Barthomley Thomas and Margery Rowley live in Barthomley. Thomas has epileptic fits in which he has visions of another person in turmoil, who may be Tom. The village regards John Fowler, the son of the rector, as their leader. He is charismatic, educated and has sided with the Parliamentary forces. He is wanted by the Royalists. He may also be a sociopath. He taunts Thomas about his fits, about Margery, and about their old rival Thomas Venables, a former villager, enemy of John Fowler and a rival to Thomas Rowley for Margery. Venables was born on Mow Cop, a place thought to be cursed. He is now a soldier with the Royalists. Thomas Rowley stands watches in the church tower but only stares at Mow Cop. =In Roman times= A group of Roman soldiers are on the run from the army, the local tribes and anybody else who might threaten them. They are led by Logan, their former cohort leader, who reminds them constantly that they are \\"the Ninth\\", possibly meaning the lost Ninth Legion. Logan also complains that they are \\"soldiers, not bricklayers\\"; the last testified activity for the Ninth Legion in Britain is during the rebuilding in stone of the legionary fortress at York (Eboracum) in AD 107-8. Initially the other soldiers are Face, Magoo and Buzzard, along with Macey, who is subject to fits and berserker rages. In these states he fights like ten men but has strange visions, even claiming to be someone else, somewhere else while his body fights. In some ways Logan reflects John Fowler. Both use others to benefit themselves. Macey is Logan's weapon of choice – when there is killing to be done it is Logan who knows the \\"Big Words\\" that incite Macey's fits. Logan also kills Buzzard for disobeying him, even though Buzzard is the best at scouting territory. The girl-goddess-priestess sees all the soldiers as being lost from their tribes. This rootlessness echoes Tom and Jan's failure to find a place to call their own. =Accents and dialects= As in his other works, Garner peppers his characters' speech with Cheshire dialect. The inhabitants of Civil War Barthomley speak the broadest version, and the dialect is heard least among the rootless modern-day characters. The Roman-era characters speak, in the case of the legionaries, an Englishman's perception of contemporary military jargon of American GIs in the Vietnam War, and, for the rest, an English peppered with Cheshire dialect and pagan references. In attempting to \\"go native\\" Logan tries to master the differences between \\"Cats\\" speech and \\"Mothers\\" speech. Though the English language had not yet reached Britain, the differences in vocabulary suggest that the \\"Mothers\\" tribe speaks a Yorkshire dialect, e.g. calling a yard or enclosure a \\"garth\\". The name \\"Cats\\" for the Cheshire tribe may be an allusion to the Cheshire Cat popularised by Lewis Carroll, or a reference to the Catti tribes found in Germania. History and archaeology would place the area around Mow Cop on the frontier between the Cornovii and the Brigantes tribes. The etymology of Cornovii contains a reference to 'horns' rather than 'cats;' Garner may have employed the Celtic root *katu- (as in Catuvellauni) which meant 'battle,' a reference to the warlike nature of the tribe. The linguistic connection between the Brigantes and the Celtic goddess Brigantia might suggest an origin for Garner's \\"Mothers.\\" Major themes The stone axe head is one of two links between the stories. The characters Thomas Rowley and Macey also have shared visions of blue, silver and red. Macey seems to participate in the Civil War massacre while killing at the Barthomley stockade and, while on Mow Cop, he has visions of the folly tower. Tom in the modern day seems to be the source of the madness, although he too has intimations of contact with the other two. It is as if his tortured soul finds release in the savagery of the Roman times and the devotion of Thomas Rowley to his wife. After he and Jan are falsely accused of having sex in Jan's house, Tom puts his hands through a glass window in his rage. The narrative immediately switches to Macey in the grip of a berserker rage, after which he tells Logan of seeing hands pressing towards him from far away. Blue, silver and red are the colours Tom sees as the train pulls out of Crewe, taking Jan away from him. At the time they were the standard livery colours for British Rail Inter-City trains. Allusions On Christmas Eve 1643, during the civil war, Barthomley was the scene of a massacre. About 20 Parliamentary supporters had taken refuge in St Bertoline's Church when Royalist forces under the command of Lord Byron started a fire. The Parliamentarians surrendered but twelve of them were then killed. The site of Mow Cop is not particularly isolated as there is a village around the hilltop. The nearby A34 is a former Roman road. The Mow Cop Castle folly was built in 1754 to look like a ruined castle.Mow Cop website Rudheath is near Northwich. Approximately 2 miles (3.2 km) southeast of this is an area called Rudheath Woods, near the villages of Allostock and Goostrey. There is a caravan park outside Allostock, with nearby lakes, as described in the novel. Garner lives in Goostrey. Inspirations A 1975 lecture by Garner entitled \\"Inner Time\\" is concerned with engrams, experiences which remain in our subconscious and continue to affect us. Garner mentions repeatedly recounting a trauma to his psychiatrist to \\"release\\" it. The repetition of events over time is one of the main themes of Red Shift. Garner goes on to explain how memories form their own sequence, independent of chronology (hence \\"inner time\\"): “any two intensely remembered experiences[...] will be emotionally contemporaneous, even though we know that the calendar separates them by years.” He explains that this idea informs the structure of the novel. As for the plot, in the same lecture Garner stated that Red Shift is an \\"expression\\" of \\"the story of Tamlain\\", although critics have had some difficulty with the comparison. He also documents, in his introduction to the 2011 New York Review of Books edition, several unrelated bits of \\"compost\\" which inspired his novel. The first is the well-documented massacre at the parish church in Barthomley in 1643, the facts of which haunted Garner, a lifelong resident of the area, for some time. Next came a news article about a young couple; after a serious fight culminating in a break-up, the young man had given the woman a taped message in which he apologised but said if she did not care enough to listen to it within a week, he'd kill himself. She did not listen to the tape and he made good on his threat. Later, Garner heard a local legend that Mow Cop was first settled by a community of escaped Spanish slaves who were being marched north to build a wall. Garner recognised this as a potential garbled reference to the famous lost Ninth Legion of Rome, also called \\"The Spanish Legion\\". He believed that at the time the Legio IX Hispana disappeared, the emperor Hadrian had ordered the building of the stone barrier, Hadrian's Wall. From this he concocted the idea that the Ninth had been sent to build the wall but some went AWOL on the way, settling on Mow Cop; the basic premise for the Rome-era portions of the novel. Garner explains that this scenario immediately brought to his mind the unrelated event of the Barthomley massacre, the first connection between different historical periods that informs Red Shift. Finally, Garner saw some graffiti in a train station that said, in chalk, two lovers' names; beneath, however, was written in lipstick \\"not really now not any more\\". Upon reading this, all of the above-mentioned bits came back to him in a flash, and he wrote the novel. Television adaptation and popular culture In 1978 the BBC produced Alan Garner's own script adaptation of the story as an episode in the Play for Today series. Directed by John Mackenzie, the play was transmitted 17 January 1978. It was released on DVD by the British Film Institute in September 2014.http://www.bfi.org.uk/news- opinion/news-bfi/announcements/bfi-dvd-releases-announced-augustseptember-2014 The novel, including the Vigenère cipher used in the novel, is the theme of Listener crossword 4340, Red Shift. Coded message The end papers of the book are covered with a coded message. In the story, Tom and Jan write letters to each other in ciphertext, using a method they find in works by Lewis Carroll. Although we are not told of Tom's suggestion for a key, the message can be intuitively decoded and the code's key can then be identified as being \\"Tom's a-cold\\", representing his isolation and loneliness. This is itself a quote from King Lear (Act III, Scene iv) and is a phrase which appears elsewhere in the book during shift sequences. The message in the end papers should be decoded using the key sequence \\"TOMSACOLD\\". The decoded message is: :I love you. If you can read this you must care. Help me. I'm writing before we meet, because I know it'll be the last. I'll put the letter in your bag, so you'll find it on the train afterwards. I'm sorry. It's my fault. Everything's clear, but it’s too late. I'll be at Crewe next time. If you don’t come I'll go to Barthomley. I love you. The smell of your hair will be in my face.

Its forerunner was The Internationalist, sent to members of the student development organisation Third World First, since renamed People & Planet. It was set up with financial help from two UK NGOs, Oxfam and Christian Aid, who wanted to encourage more people to understand the processes of 'development' by publishing a monthly magazine to discuss and debate development issues in an accessible way.Maggie Black (ed.), A Cause for Our Times: Oxfam – The First Fifty Years, pp. 205–206. They formed a new publishing company, Devopress, with a subvention of £50,000 for the period 1973–76. Devopress comprised three Christian Aid directors and three from Oxfam.

Further information =Organizational structure= When New Internationalist started, the company operated as a conventional hierarchical organization, albeit with much sharing and teamwork. In 1976 a more co-operative approach was adopted and developed over the years so that, although legally it was a limited company owned by the original shareholders, Peter and Lesley Adamson, the NI operated as a collective, with decision- making shared by all members on an equal footing. In 1987 New Internationalist became an equal pay co-operative. Eventually the Adamsons transferred their ownership of the limited company, now called New Internationalist Publications Limited, to a trust called New Internationalist Trust. The trust was 2/3 controlled by the company's employees who became trustees automatically whilst 1/3 of votes were held by co-opted Advisory trustees.New Internationalist history In 2018 the Trust was replaced by a multi-stakeholder co-operative, following a successful Community Share Offer.New Internationalist crowdfunds more than £700,000 to provide 'a more compelling and complete view of the world', accessed 12 August 2020 =Editorial policy= Several changes in the editorial approach of New Internationalist magazine have taken place since its founding. Although its left-wing, Libertarian socialist-leaning editorial line has remained broadly unchanged – the approach has been modified over the years. New internationalist magazine nowadays is less Eurocentric and reflects broader concerns with environmental, gender and cultural angles in addition to social, economic and political ones. The magazine aims to reflect the views and concerns of its overseas subscribers as well as those in the UK. There is considerable emphasis on finding women contributors and writers and photographers from the South. In its early days, a wide range of subjects was covered in each issue. But in 1976 this changed and since then each month's edition has been devoted to one particular subject (for example Islam or World Food) to give the reader a comprehensive guide and analysis.New Internationalist history Some magazines are specially produced to tie in with campaigns. There have been issues on East Timor, Western Sahara, Cambodia, Burma, Fair trade (Coffee, Bananas and Cocoa), Homelessness, Jubilee 2000 and UN Sanctions on Iraq. The use of the term \\"Third World\\" – more or less unknown when the magazine started – is debated now and discarded by some. Terms such as \\"Majority World\\" and \\"Global South\\" have become more widespread . \\"Development\\" and \\"sustainable development\\" similarly are contentious to some people but the magazine still uses them as useful shorthand phrases. Reflecting this change, the magazine altered its strapline, which read \\"the people, the ideas, the action in the fight for global justice\\" until 2018. In 2018 following a complete redesign of the magazine, the strapline was changed to \\"The World Unspun\\". See also *P. J.

VIVO was found on high-end ATI and NVIDIA computer video cards, sometimes labeled \\"TV OUT\\". VIVO on these graphics cards typically supports composite, component, and S-Video as outputs, and composite and S-Video as inputs. Many other video cards only support component and/or S-Video outputs to complement VGA or DVI, typically using a component breakout cable and an S-Video cable. While component-out operation supports high-definition resolutions, it does not support the HDCP standard which would be required for official HDTV support as set out by the EICTA. A graphics card with VIVO, DVI and VGA outputs Some practical uses of VIVO include being able to display multimedia stored on a computer on a TV, and being able to connect a DVD player or video game console to a computer while continuing to allow viewing via a TV monitor. VIVO itself, however, can not decode broadcast signals from any source, and so, like HDTV sets without tuners and composite monitors, additional equipment is required to be able to show broadcast TV programs. Some manufacturers enable their version of the VIVO port to also transfer sound.  Limitations  The VIVO output on graphics cards is often not used by those who have no need to connect their computer to a TV. Also, there can be issues in software supporting the use of VIVO ports. A computer using VIVO must have software that can handle an input signal. For example, in the case of Nvidia GeForce series 6 and 7 video card users this means downloading Nvidia's WDM drivers. Additionally, On Windows XP computers that use GeForce video cards with Scalable Link Interface (SLI) mode enabled, using a TV to display part of the desktop via VIVO is disabled, just as dual-monitor mode is disabled. Confusingly, however, some distorted images may be visible on a properly-connected VIVO-driven television display at boot- up due to the fact that prior to the OS loading the display driver, the video bios might initialize outputs that are then unavailable once the OS takes over and the driver loads into SLI mode.

This Soyuz-TM spacecraft carried the members of Expedition 1, the first long-duration ISS crew. It was launched from Russia at 07:52 UT on October 31, 2000 by a Soyuz-U rocket. The crew consisted of Russian cosmonauts Yuri Gidzenko and Sergei Krikalev, and American William Shepherd. Gidzenko was Commander of the flight up, but once aboard the station, Shepherd became Commander of the long-duration mission Expedition 1. The spacecraft served as the crew's lifeboat while docked to the ISS. The Expedition 1 crew were returned to Earth via a Space Shuttle during STS-102 in March 2001, and the Soyuz TM-31 spacecraft stayed with the station for part of Expedition 2. In April 2001 another spacecraft, Soyuz TM-32, arrived at the station, and took over responsibilities as the station's lifeboat. The crew launched by Soyuz TM-32, which included the first paying space tourist Dennis Tito, were returned to Earth in May aboard Soyuz TM-31. The visiting mission of which Tito was a part is sometimes referred to as ISS EP-1.

The Progress M1-3 cargo craft that was docked with Zvezda was released to make way for the Soyuz. The crew of two Russian and one American spent over three months on the ISS, and returned to Earth in an American shuttle (STS-102) in February 2001. In the initial days, the crew brought a variety of life support systems on-line, and created a laptop computer network that helped run all systems in the ISS. The remaining months were allotted for exercise and space endurance practice. The crew was the group to launch the \\"permanent inhabitation\\" of the ISS.

Background Brockmeyer was born in Mankato, Minnesota on September 16, 1907, the son of Otto and Margaret Brockmeyer. He attended the University of Minnesota where he played football under two legendary college football coaches, Doc Spears and Fritz Crisler. He played halfback for the Gophers in a backfield that included Bronco Nagurski. His best college day came in 1928 when he gained 166 yards rushing and but scored all the points in the Gophers' upset of Purdue. He ran 46 yards for one touchdown and passed for two more and Minnesota won 18-0. Accomplishments After his graduation from Minnesota, he played semi-pro ball with the Minnesota All Stars, but his greatest ability was in coaching, and he quickly gave up his player role to concentrate on coaching. He started at Fergus Falls, Minnesota from 1931 to 1933 and Faribault, Minnesota from 1933 to 1937. In 1937, he came to Wausau and found a home. In his 40 years of coaching high school football, his teams had a combined record of 265–43–14. His record at Wausau High was 230–33–9. Over those 34 seasons, his team either won outright or shared in 26 conference championships. \\"For years he coached basketball, among other sports, and his basketball teams compiled a record of 128 wins against 88 losses, and won the state championship in his first year with the team. But, it was at football that he really excelled, and Wausau High's record in the early to mid-1940s was unequaled for many years. In 1939, Wausau won seven games and lost one. That one was the last game they would lose for years. In 1940, they not only went undefeated, but outscored their opponents 299 to 12, not giving up a single point until the final quarter of the final game of the year. In 1941, they went undefeated again and then again in 1943 and in 1945. They finally lost a game in 1946, with their 46-game winning streak setting a Wisconsin high school record for many years before it was broken in 1987 by Manitowoc Lincoln (48 straight games; 1984-1987) and later by Waunakee (48 games; 2009-2012). Mr. Brockmeyer's winning percentage of games is .845, making him one of the winningest football coaches in the history of the state of Wisconsin. Both Football Hall of Famers Elroy Hirsch and Jim Otto learned the basics of football from Brockmeyer when they played for him at Wausau High School. Brockmeyer is the only man ever to have coached two members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame in high school. While coaching high school in Minnesota, he also coached another Hall of Fame member, Bruce Smith the only man to win the Heisman Trophy (1941) from the University of Minnesota. In the 1954 movie Crazylegs the story of Elroy Hirsch, Coach Brockmeyer was played by Hollywood great Lloyd Nolan. To this day, it is the only Hollywood movie to ever premiere in Wausau. Mr. Brockmeyer was inducted as a charter member into the Wisconsin Football Coaches Hall of Fame in 1980, and in 1984 was inducted into the National Federation of State High School Associations along with 12 other inductees including Jack Nicklaus and Red Grange. IN 2004 he was inducted into the National High School Athletic Coaches Association Hall of Fame. As coach at Wausau High School from 1937 to 1970, Brockmeyer had a 230-33-9 record. He was undefeated in 13 seasons. His teams won 26 conference titles. In the 1940s, he had a 72-2-4 record that included a 46-game winning streak. A scholarship was later inaugurated in his honor. Personal life The son of Otto and Margaret Brockmeyer, \\"Brock\\" was married on Thanksgiving Day 1932 to Helen Mae Date. They raised three children. On March 14, 1980, Mr. Brockmeyer, 72, was on a golf outing in Florida with UW Athletic Director Elroy Hirsch and other members of the UW athletic staff when he was stricken with an apparent heart attack and died. In a tribute to Wausau, the city which Mr. & Ms. Brockmeyer loved so much, both of them were cremated and had their ashes scattered within the city.

Important papers of his include On series expansions determined by the methods of least squares, and Investigations of the number of primes less than a given number. The mathematical method that bears his name, the Gram–Schmidt process, was first published in the former paper, in 1883. Gram's theorem and the Gramian matrix are also named after him. For number theorists his main fame is the series for the Riemann zeta function (the leading function in Riemann's exact prime- counting function). Instead of using a series of logarithmic integrals, Gram's function uses logarithm powers and the zeta function of positive integers. It has recently been supplanted by a formula of Ramanujan that uses the Bernoulli numbers directly instead of the zeta function.

Born in Austria-Hungary, Berger immigrated to the United States as a young man and became an important and influential socialist journalist in Wisconsin. He helped establish the so-called Sewer Socialist movement. Also a politician, in 1910, he was elected as the first Socialist to the U.S. House of Representatives, representing a district in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In 1919, Berger was convicted of violating the Espionage Act for publicizing his anti- interventionist views and as a result was denied the seat to which he had been twice elected in the House of Representatives. The verdict was eventually overturned by the Supreme Court in 1921, and Berger was elected to three successive terms in the 1920s. Biography =Early years= Berger was born into a Jewish familySee: Rafael Medoff, Jewish Americans and Political Participation: A Reference Handbook, Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2002, p. 330.Mark Avrum Ehrlich, Encyclopedia of the Jewish Diaspora: Origins, Experiences, and Culture, Volume 1, Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2009, p. 593. on February 28, 1860, in Nieder-Rehbach, Austria-Hungary (today in Romania). He was the son of Julia and Ignatz Berger. He attended the Gymnasium at Leutschau (today in Slovakia), and the major universities of Budapest and Vienna. In 1878 he immigrated to the United States with his parents,Sally M. Miller, \\"Victor Louis Berger,\\" Historical Dictionary of the Progressive Era, 1890–1920. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1988, p. 38. settling near Bridgeport, Connecticut.Sally M. Miller, Victor Berger and the Promise of Constructive Socialism, 1910–1920. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1973, p. 17. Berger's wife, Meta Schlichting, later claimed that Berger had left Austria- Hungary to avoid conscription into the military. In 1881 Berger settled in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, home to a large population of German Americans and a very active labor movement. Berger joined the Socialist Labor Party (then headed by Daniel de Leon), and became the editor of two newspapers: Vorwärts [Forward] and Die Wahrheit [The Truth]. Berger taught German in the public school system. His future father-in-law was the school commissioner. In 1897, he married a former student, Meta Schlichting, who was an active socialist organizer in Milwaukee. For many years, Meta Berger was a member of the University of Wisconsin Board of Regents. The couple raised two daughters, Doris (who later went on to write television shows such as General Hospital with her husband Frank) and Elsa, speaking only German in the home. The parents were strongly oriented to European culture.Sally M. Miller, Victor L. Berger and the Promise of Constructive Socialism, 1910–1920. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1973; p. 22. =Socialist organizing= Berger was credited by trade union leader Eugene V. Debs for having won him over to the cause of socialism. Jailed for six months for violating a federal anti-strike injunction in the 1894 strike of the American Railway Union, Debs turned to reading: > Books and pamphlets and letters from socialists came by every mail and I > began to read and think and dissect the anatomy of the system in which > workingmen, however organized, could be shattered and battered and > splintered on a single stroke [...] It was at this time, when the first > glimmerings of socialism were beginning to penetrate, that Victor L. Berger > — and I have loved him ever since — came to Woodstock [prison], as if a > providential instrument, and delivered the first impassioned message of > socialism I had ever heard — the very first to set the wires humming in my > system. As a souvenir of that visit there is in my library a volume of > Capital by Karl Marx, inscribed with the compliments of Victor L. Berger, > which I cherish as a token of priceless value.Eugene V. Debs, \\"How I Became > a Socialist.\\" The Comrade, v. 1, no. 7 (April 1902), pp. 147–148. In 1896, Berger was a delegate to the People's Party Convention in St. Louis. Berger was short and stocky, with a studious demeanor, and had both a self- deprecating sense of humor and a volatile temper. Although loyal to friends, he was strongly opinionated and intolerant of dissenting views.Miller, Victor L. Berger and the Promise of Constructive Socialism, 1910–1920, pp. 22–23 His ideological sparring partner and comrade Morris Hillquit later recalled of Berger that > He was sublimely egotistical, but somehow his egotism did not smack of > conceit and was not offensive. It was the expression of deep and naive faith > in himself, and this unshakable faith was one of the mainsprings of his > power over men.Morris Hillquit, Loose Leaves from a Busy Life. New York: > Macmillan, 1934; p. 53. 1900 members of the National Executive Committee of the SDP. Berger was a founding member of the Social Democracy of America in 1897 and led the split of the \\"political action\\" faction of that organization to form the Social Democratic Party of America (SDP) in 1898. He was a member of the governing National Executive Committee of the SDP for its entire duration. Berger was a founder of the Socialist Party of America in 1901 and played a critical role in the negotiations with an east coast dissident faction of the Socialist Labor Party in the establishment of this new political party. Berger was regarded as one of the party's leading revisionist Marxists, an advocate of the trade union-oriented and incremental politics of Eduard Bernstein. He advocated the use of electoral politics to implement reforms and thus gradually build a collectivist society.Miller, \\"Victor Berger,\\" p. 38. In her short thumbnail sketch, Miller notes that Berger \\"opposed orthodox Marxists, who, in turn, called [Berger] an opportunist\\". This actually refers to the revolutionary socialist left wing rather than the \\"orthodox Marxist\\" followers of Karl Kautsky, which was the majority tendency in the Socialist Party of this era. Berger was a man of the written word and back room negotiation, not a notable public speaker. He retained a heavy German accent and had a voice which did not project well. As a rule he did not accept outdoor speaking engagements and was a poor campaigner, preferring one-on-one relationships to mass oratory.Miller, Victor L. Berger and the Promise of Constructive Socialism, 1910–1920, pp. 23–24. Berger was, however, a newspaper editorialist par excellence. Throughout his life he published and edited a number of different papers, including the German language Vorwärts (\\"Forward\\") (1892–1911), the Social-Democratic Herald (1901–1913), and the Milwaukee Leader (1911–1929). =First term in Congress= Berger ran for Congress and lost in 1904 before winning Wisconsin's 5th congressional district seat in 1910 as the first Socialist to serve in the United States Congress. In Congress, he focused on issues related to the District of Columbia and also more radical proposals, including eliminating the President's veto, abolishing the Senate,House Member Introduces Resolution To Abolish the Senate and the social takeover of major industries. Berger gained national publicity for his old-age pension bill, the first of its kind introduced into Congress. Less than two weeks after the Titanic passenger ship disaster, Berger introduced a bill in Congress providing for the nationalization of the radio-wireless systems. A practical socialist, Berger argued that the wireless chaos which was one of the features of the Titanic disaster has demonstrated the need for a government-owned wireless system. \\"FEDERAL OWNERSHIP URGED FOR WIRELESS; Berger, Socialist Representative, Introduces Bill Based on Titanic's Chaos of Messages.\\" The New York Times, April 25, 1912 Although he did not win re- election in 1912, 1914 or 1916, he remained active in Wisconsin and Socialist Party politics. Berger was very active in the biggest party controversy of the pre-war years, the fight between the SP's centrist \\"regular\\" bloc against the syndicalist left wing over the issue of \\"sabotage.\\" The bitter battle erupted in full force at the 1912 National Convention of the Socialist Party, to which Berger was again a delegate. At issue was language to be inserted into the party constitution which called for the expulsion of \\"any member of the party who opposes political action or advocates crime, sabotage, or other methods of violence as a weapon of the working class to aid in its emancipation.\\"Amendment to Article 2, Section 6, proposed by William Lincoln Garver of Missouri. John Spargo (ed.), National Convention of the Socialist Party Held at Indianapolis, Ind., May 12 to 18, 1912: Stenographic Report. Chicago: The Socialist Party, [1912], p. 122. Hereafter: 1912 National Convention Stenographic Report. The debate was vitriolic, with Berger, somewhat unsurprisingly, stating the matter in its most bellicose form:Speech of Victor Berger 1912 National Convention Stenographic Report, p. 130. The regulars won the day handily at the Indianapolis convention of 1912, with a successful recall of IWW leader \\"Big Bill\\" Haywood from the SP's National Executive Committee and an exodus of disaffected left wingers following shortly thereafter. The remaining radicals in the party remembered bitterly Berger's role in this affair and the ill feelings continued to fester until erupting anew at the end of the decade. =World War I= Victor Berger, in Literary Digest, 1920. Berger's views on World War I were complicated by the Socialist view and the difficulties surrounding his German heritage. However, he did support his party's stance against the war. When the United States entered the war and passed the Espionage Act in 1917, Berger's continued opposition made him a target. He and four other Socialists were indicted under the Espionage Act in February 1918; the trial followed on December 9 of that year, and on February 20, 1919, Berger was convicted and sentenced to 20 years in federal prison. During the 1918 Wisconsin special senate election, Berger ran for the seat under federal indictment. His newspaper, the Milwaukee Leader, had printed a number of anti-war articles which led to the postal service revoking the paper's second-class mail privileges. Despite the circumstances, Berger won 26% of the vote statewide in an April special Senate election to fill a vacancy, winning 11 counties in a three-way race.\\"Victor Berger Campaign Banner,\\" United States Senate campaign banner for Milwaukee Socialist Congressman Victor L. Berger, April 1918 (Museum object #1992.168) and Historical Essay, from the Wisconsin Historical Society. The espionage trial was presided over by Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis, who later became the first commissioner of Major League Baseball.Transcript of the trial His conviction was appealed, and ultimately overturned by the Supreme Court on January 31, 1921, which found that Judge Landis had improperly presided over the case after the filing of an affidavit of prejudice.Berger et al. v. United States, 255 U.S. 22, 41 S.Ct. 230,(1921). In spite of his being under indictment at the time, the voters of Milwaukee elected Berger to the House of Representatives in 1918. When he arrived in Washington to claim his seat, Congress formed a special committee to determine whether a convicted felon and war opponent should be seated as a member of Congress. On November 10, 1919, they concluded that he should not, and declared the seat vacant. He was disqualified pursuant to Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\\"In regard to the first question, your committee concurs with the opinion of the special committee appointed under House resolution No. 6, that Victor L. Berger, the contestee, because of his disloyalty, is not entitled to the seat to which he was elected, but that in accordance with the unbroken precedents of the House, he should be excluded from membership; and further, that having previously taken an oath as a Member of Congress to support the Constitution of the United States, and having subsequently given aid and comfort to the enemies of the United States during the World War, he is absolutely ineligible to membership in the House of Representatives under section 3 of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\\" Wisconsin promptly held a special election to fill the vacant seat, and on December 19, 1919, elected Berger a second time. On January 10, 1920, the House again refused to seat him, and the seat remained vacant until 1921, when Republican William H. Stafford claimed the seat after defeating Berger in the 1920 general election. =Second stint in Congress= Berger defeated Stafford in 1922 and was reelected in 1924 and 1926. In those terms, he dealt with Constitutional changes, a proposed old-age pension, unemployment insurance, and public housing. He also supported the diplomatic recognition of the Soviet Union and the revision of the Treaty of Versailles. After his defeat by Stafford in 1928, he returned to Milwaukee and resumed his career as a newspaper editor. =Death= On July 16, 1929, while crossing the street outside his newspaper office, Berger was struck by a streetcar travelling on North Third Street (now Dr. Martin Luther King Drive) at the intersection with West Clarke Street in Milwaukee. The accident fractured his skull, and he died of his injuries on August 7, 1929. Prior to burial at Forest Home Cemetery his body lay in state at City Hall and was viewed by 75,000 residents of the city.Elmer Beck, The Sewer Socialists: Vol. I, The Socialists Trinity of the Party, the Unions and the Press. Fennimore, WI: Westburg Associates Publishers, 1982; p. 133. =Legacy= According to historian Sally Miller: Sally Miller, \\"Berger, Victor Louis,\\" in John A. Garraty, ed., Encyclopedia of American Biography (1974) pp 87–88. :Berger built the most successful socialist machine ever to dominate an American city....[He] concentrated on national politics...to become one of the most powerful voices in the reformist wing of the national Socialist party. His commitment to democratic values and the non-violent socialization of the American system led the party away from revolutionary Marxist dogma. He shaped the party into force which, while struggling against its own left wing, symbolize participation in the political order to attain social reforms.... In the party schism of 1919, Berger opposed allegiance to the emergent Soviet system. His shrunken party echoed his preference for peaceful, democratic, and gradual transformation to socialism. Berger's papers are housed at the Wisconsin Historical Society, with smaller numbers of items dispersed to other locations.\\"Victor Luitpold Berger, 1860–1929: Guide to Research Collections,\\" Biographical Dictionary of the United States Congress, bioguide.congress.gov/ The complete run of the Milwaukee Leader exists on microfilm published by the Wisconsin Historical Society and on site at the University of Wisconsin in Madison.The Milwaukee Leader, University of Wisconsin-Madison Libraries, MadCat. Works Victor Berger's writing was voluminous, but rarely reproduced in book or pamphlet form outside of the newspapers in which it first appeared. In 1912, the Social-Democratic Publishing Co published a collection of his works in a publication entitled Berger's Broadsides. In 1929 the Milwaukee Leader published the Voice and Pen of Victor L. Berger: Congressional Speeches and Editorials (1860–1929) which also included an obituary. This publication included Berger's phrase regarding draining the swamp in reference to his assertion that the economic crises such as the Panic of 1893, were \\"hastened' by excessive profits—the $900,000,000 to Standard Oil \\"magnates.\\" According to Daniel Yergin in his Pulitzer Prize-winning The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power (1990), at the time the general public considered the Standard Oil conglomerate which was controlled by a small group of directors to be \\"all-pervasive\\" and \\"completely unaccountable\\".

The war was triggered by a German policy designed to force the indigenous population to grow cotton for export and lasted from 1905 to 1907.The Organization of the Maji Maji Rebellion John Iliffe, The Journal of African History, Vol. 8, No. 3 (1967), pp. 495–512. p. 495. 250,000–300,000 died, mostly civilians from famine. After the scramble for Africa among the major European powers in the 1880s, Germany reinforced its hold on several formal African colonies. These was German East Africa (Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, and part of Mozambique), German Southwest Africa (present-day Namibia), Cameroon, and Togoland (today split between Ghana and Togo). The Germans had a relatively weak hold on German East Africa. However, they maintained a system of forts throughout the interior of the territory and were able to exert some control over it. Since their hold on the colony was weak, they resorted to using violently repressive tactics to control the population. Germany levied head taxes in 1898 and relied heavily on forced labor to build roads and accomplish various other tasks. In 1902, Carl Peters ordered villages to grow cotton as a cash crop for export. Each village was charged with producing a quota of cotton. The headmen of the village were left in charge of overseeing the production, which set them against the rest of the population. The German policies were very unpopular, as they had serious effects on the lives of the natives. The social fabric of society was being changed rapidly. The social roles of men and women were being changed to face the needs of the communities. Since men were forced away from their homes to work, women were forced to assume some of the traditional male roles. Also, the fact that men were away strained the resources of the village and the people's ability to deal with their environment and remain self-sufficient. In 1905, a drought threatened the region. All that, as well as opposition to the government's agricultural and labour policies, led to open rebellion against the Germans in July. The insurgents turned to magic to drive out the German colonizers and used it as a unifying force in the rebellion. A spirit medium named Kinjikitile Ngwale, who practiced Folk Islam that incorporated animist beliefs, claimed to be possessed by a snake spirit called Hongo. Ngwale began calling himself Bokero and developed a belief that the people of German East Africa had been called upon to eliminate the Germans. German anthropologists recorded that he gave his followers war medicine that would turn German bullets into water. This \\"war medicine\\" was in fact water (maji in Kiswahili) mixed with castor oil and millet seeds. Empowered with this new liquid, Bokero's followers began what would become known as the Maji Maji Rebellion. The end of the war was followed by a period of famine, known as the Great Hunger (njaa), caused in large part by the scorched-earth policy advocated by Gustav Adolf von Götzen. Uprising The followers of Bokero's movement were poorly armed with spears and arrows, sometimes poisoned. However, they were numerous and believed that they could not be harmed because the Germans' bullets would turn to water. They marched from their villages wearing millet stalks around their foreheads. Initially, they attacked small outposts and damaged cotton plants. On 31 July 1905, Matumbi tribesmen marched on Samanga and destroyed the cotton crop as well as a trading post. Kinjikitile was arrested and hanged for treason. Before his execution, he declared that he had spread the medicine of the rebellion throughout the region. On 14 August 1905, Ngindo tribesmen attacked a small party of missionaries on a safari; all five, including Bishop Spiss (the Roman Catholic Bishop of Dar es Salaam) were speared to death. Soon the Yao tribes started participating and throughout August the rebels moved from the Matumbi Hills in the southern part of what is now Tanzania and attacked German garrisons throughout the colony. The attack on Ifakara, on 16 August, destroyed the small German garrison and opened the way to the key fortification at Mahenge. Though the southern garrison was quite small (there were but 458 European and 588 native soldiers in the entire area), their fortifications and modern weapons gave them an advantage. At Mahenge, several thousand Maji Maji warriors (led by another spirit medium, not Bokero) marched on the German cantonment, which was defended by Lieutenant Theodor von Hassel with sixty native soldiers, a few hundred loyal tribesmen, and two machine guns. The two attacking tribes disagreed on when to attack and were unable to co-ordinate. The first attack was met with gunfire from 1000 m; the tribesmen stood firm for about fifteen minutes, then they broke and retreated. After the first attack, a second column of 1,200 men advanced from the east. Some of these attackers were able to get within three paces of the firing line before they were killed. The Qadiriyya Brotherhood declared a Jihad against the Germans,\\"Christian-Muslim relations in Eastern Africa\\" p. 45 with Sufi Muslims now playing a major role in the rebellion. While this was the apex of the uprising, the Ngoni people decided to join in the revolt with a force of 5,000. The Muslim Gwangara Ngoni were relatively recent arrivals in the region, descendants of a remnant of the Ndwandwe confederation defeated by the Zulus in 1818 (other Ngoni states were formed in Malawi, Zambia, and north-central Tanzania). German troops, armed with machine guns, departed from Mahenge to the Ngoni camp, which they attacked on 21 October. The Ngoni soldiers retreated, throwing away their bottles of war medicine and crying, \\"The maji is a lie!\\" Upon the outbreak of the fighting, Count Gustav Adolf von Götzen, governor of German East Africa, had requested reinforcements from the German government. Kaiser Wilhelm immediately ordered two cruisers with their Marine complements to the troubled colony. Reinforcements also arrived from as far away as New Guinea. When 1,000 regular soldiers from Germany arrived in October, Götzen felt he could go on the offensive and restore order in the south. Three columns moved into the rebellious South. They destroyed villages, crops, and other food sources used by the rebels. They made effective use of their firepower to break up rebel attacks. A successful ambush of a German column crossing the Rufiji River by the Bena kept the rebellion alive in the southwest, but the Germans were not to be denied for long. By April 1906, the southwest had been pacified. However, elsewhere the fighting was bitter. A column under Lt. Gustav von Blumenthal (1879–1913, buried at Lindi) consisting of himself, one other European and 46 Askaris fell under continuous attack as it marched in early May 1906, from Songea to Mahenge. The Germans decided to concentrate at Kitanda, where Major Johannes, Lt. von Blumenthal and Lt. von Lindeiner-Wildau eventually gathered. Von Blumenthal was then sent along the Luwegu River, partly by boat. The southeast campaign degenerated into a guerrilla war that brought with it a devastating famine. The famine following the Maji Maji Rebellion was partly deliberate. Von Götzen was willing to pardon the common soldiers who gave up their weapons, leaders and witch doctors. However, he also needed to flush out the remaining rebels and so chose famine. In 1905, one of the leaders of German troops in the colony, Captain Wangenheim, wrote to von Götzen, \\"Only hunger and want can bring about a final submission. Military actions alone will remain more or less a drop in the ocean.\\"Pakenham, 622 quoting from Not until August 1907 were the last embers of rebellion extinguished. In its wake, the rebellion had left 15 Europeans and 389 native soldiers and tens or even hundreds of thousands of insurgents and innocent bystanders dead. It also broke the spirit of the people to resist, and the colony remained calm, partly because of a new governor, who brought a more enlightened regime, until the outbreak of World War I. Aftermath and interpretation The Abushiri revolt of 1888–1889 and the Wahehe Rebellion of 1891–1898 are viewed by historians as precursors of the Maji Maji uprising. The suppression of the Maji Maji people changed the history of southern Tanzania. Tens, perhaps hundreds, of thousands of people died or were displaced from their homes. In the wake of the war, the imperial government instituted administrative reforms, and by the outbreak of the First World War, Tanganyika could be said to be among the better-administered European colonies in Africa . The rebellion became a focal point in the history of the region. Journalist John Gunther noted in 1953 that \\"even today the Southern Province of Tanganyika, the 'Cinderella Province,' has not fully recovered from the German terror half a century ago. The economy of the region has never been successfully rebuilt.\\" Later Tanzanian nationalists used it as an example of the first stirrings of Tanzanian nationalism, a unifying experience that brought together all the different peoples of Tanzania under one leader, in an attempt to establish a nation free from foreign domination. Later historians have challenged that view and claimed that the rebellion cannot be seen as a unified movement but rather a series of revolts conducted for a wide range of reasons, including religion. The Muslim Ngoni chiefs were offered Christian baptism before execution. Many people in the area itself saw the revolt as one part of a longer series of wars continuing since long before the arrival of Germans in the region. They cite the alliance of some groups with the Germans to further their own agendas.

It was a real-time tactics and tactical shooter game with real-time strategy elements. The game served as the prototype for its sequel Herzog Zwei, which was released in 1989 for the Sega Mega Drive and is often considered the first true real-time strategy game. Overview The game is centered around a fictional war between the countries of Mercies (Blue side in game) and Ruth (Red side in game). In the single player mode of the game, the player takes control of the Mercies army, whose goal is to reach and capture the headquarters of the Ruth army. Gameplay takes place among nine battlegrounds, beginning at the capital of Mercies, Vaxan. Each victory for the player brings the player's army to the next battleground and closer to Remerje, the capital of Ruth. The game ends when either the player is defeated at Vaxan, or the computer controlled army is defeated at Remerje. The game will also end if the player loses the last Land- Armor in stock (see Units below). If the player loses at a battleground other than Vaxan, the player will move backwards and complete the previous stage again. Plot Ten years prior to the game's events, President Hughes, head of the Republic of Mercies, is assassinated. The Ruth Liberian Army, a terrorist organisation lead by Roger Tense, takes responsibility for the act. The previously friendly relations between Mercies and Ruth deteriorate and war breaks out. Major powers intervene in the conflict on both sides, and the war spreads to engulf the world. A decade later, Ruth's army is at the gates of Vaxan, capital of Mercies, and the war begins to draw to a close. If the player is successful and captures Remerje, capital of Ruth, the war ends and the two countries sign a peace treaty five years later.  Gameplay mechanics  Each battleground is a linear path in which the player's base is located on one side and the enemy base is located on the other side. Each side has a Land-Armor that can fly in the air or travel on the ground, pick up and drop other friendly units, and attack units (including friendly ones). Each side must use their funding, which is automatically replenished at a rate of ten money units every half-second approximately, to build various units that will travel the length of the battlefield while doing battle with opposing units. If a unit successfully manages to reach the opposing end of the battlefield, the unit will cause a certain amount of damage to the enemy base. The battle is over when a side manages to damage the opposing base enough to destroy it. The visual aspect of the gameplay is represented by a vertically aligned graphical area where units are controlled in real-time, and a small horizontal radar at the top of the screen where units are represented by colored dots which scroll across the screen according to their position. At the bottom of the screen, each side has gauges the show the percentage of damage taken by their respective Land-Armors and Bases. When either reaches 100 percent damage, they will be destroyed. The gameplay in two-player mode is essentially the same as in the single player game. The graphical area is split into two sides for each player, with player one being blue and player two being red. The only major difference is that the first battle takes place at the location in the middle of the two capitals and will progress forward or backward depending on who wins, until one capital is defeated.  Units  During combat, the deployable units available are as follows: Land-Armor - The Land- Armor is the most important unit in the game. Only one Land-Armor at a time can be active on the battleground and is directly controlled by the player (the other units move independently). The Land-Armor can travel on the ground or hover in the air and attack enemy ground and air units. The Land-Armor can also pick up other units and drop them a different locations. The Land-Armor's health is displayed on screen and will be replaced by another Land-Armor when destroyed. The computer controlled army has an infinite number of Land-Armors, but the player does not and must buy extras if needed. The destruction of the player's last Land-Armor results in an automatic game over. Soldier - Soldiers are fairly slow moving ground units that fire single shots at other ground enemies. Soldiers are weak and can only take one hit before being destroyed, but they are very cheap to create and when a Land-Armor picks one up, it can repair the Land-Armor at a rate of 1 percentage point per second (this is the only way to repair the Land-Armor). The Land-Armor can carry five Soldiers at a time. Tank - Tanks are the main attack unit of an army. They are fairly expensive to make and slow moving, but they can take a lot of hits before being destroyed, and do a lot of damage to bases. A Tank's rate of fire is about the same as a Soldier. The Land-Armor can carry one Tank at a time. AAM(Anti Aircraft Missile)-Carrier - AAM-Carriers are medium speed moving units that are not equipped to attack ground units. Instead, they are armed with a finite number of homing missiles that can seek and attack the enemy Land-Armor on the ground and in the air. They are the only other unit that can attack the Land-Armor in the air besides another Land-Armor. The Land-Armor can carry one AAM-Carrier at a time, and upon pressing the fire button, the Land-Armor can unleash the entire payload of homing missiles the AAM-Carrier is holding. Side Car - Side Cars are lightweight, inexpensive, motorcycle units that are fast and can reach the enemy base quickly. They also have a higher rate of fire than other units and can do damage a little faster. Their downside is that they have a low tolerance for damage. The Land-Armor can carry one Side Car at a time. Antitank-Gun - Antitank-Guns are ground turrets that must first be placed by the Land-Armor, then they attack enemies from that position. Although they are expensive and unable to move without assistance, they are very durable and have a high rate of fire, making them ideal to take out tanks as the name suggests, or to defend bases. The Land- Armor can carry one Antitank-Gun at a time. Grand-Slam - Being the most expensive unit next to the Land-Armor, the Grand-Slam missile is very powerful. It travels across the battleground very slowly, and if it successfully reaches the opposing base, it automatically destroys it with 100 percent damage. The Grand-Slam can't be seen or interacted with on the graphical area and can only be seen as a blip on the radar (the game will flash a warning when a Grand-Slam is launched). The only way to destroy a Grand-Slam is to send another Grand-Slam to collide with it on the opposite end of its path. As a final note, the player can only have a maximum of 50 units out on the battleground at a time. Herzog Zwei Herzog served as the prototype for its more well known 1989 Sega Mega Drive sequel Herzog Zwei, which is considered the first real time strategy game. It was the first with a feature set that falls under the contemporary definition of the genre, predating the genre-popularizing Dune II (1992).

Plot summary Herzog is set in 1964 in the United States, and is about the midlife crisis of a Jewish man named Moses E. Herzog. At the age of forty-seven,Herzog, p. 207 he is just emerging from his second divorce, this one particularly acrimonious. He has two children, one by each wife, who are growing up without him. His career as a writer and an academic has floundered. He is in a relationship with a vibrant woman, Ramona, but finds himself running away from commitment. Herzog's second marriage, to the demanding, manipulative Madeleine, has recently ended in a humiliating fashion. While still actively married, Madeleine convinced Moses to move her and their daughter Junie to Chicago, and to arrange for their best friends, Valentine and Phoebe Gersbach, to move as well, securing a solid job for Valentine. However, the plans were all a ruse, as Madeleine and Valentine were carrying on an affair behind Moses's back, and shortly after arriving in Chicago, Madeleine throws Herzog out, secures a restraining order (of sorts) against him, and attempts to have him committed to an asylum. Herzog spends much of his time mentally writing letters he never sends. These letters are aimed at friends, family members, and famous figures. The recipients may be dead, and Herzog has often never met them. The one common thread is that Herzog is always expressing disappointment, either his own in the failings of others or their words, or apologizing for the way he has disappointed others. The novel opens with Herzog in his house in Ludeyville, a (fictional) town in the Berkshires in western Massachusetts. He is contemplating returning to New York to see Ramona, but instead flees to Martha's Vineyard to visit some friends. He arrives at their house, but writes a note – this one an actual note – saying that he has to leave: :\\"Not able to stand kindness at this time. Feeling, heart, everything in strange condition. Unfinished business.\\" He heads to New York to start trying to finish that business, which includes regaining custody of his daughter Junie. After spending a night with Ramona, he heads to the courthouse to discuss his plans with his lawyer. He ends up witnessing a series of tragicomic court hearings, including one where a woman is charged with beating her three-year-old to death by flinging him against a wall. Moses, already distraught after receiving a letter from Junie's babysitter about an incident in which Valentine locked Junie in the car while he and Madeleine argued inside the house, heads to Chicago. He goes to his stepmother's house and picks up an antique pistol with two bullets in it, forming a vague plan to kill Madeleine and Valentine and run off with Junie. The plan goes awry when he sees Valentine giving Junie a bath and realizes that Junie is in no danger. The next day, after taking his daughter to the aquarium, Herzog crashes his car and is charged with possession of a loaded weapon. His brother, the rational Will, picks him up and tries to get him back on his feet. Herzog heads to Ludeyville, where his brother meets him and tries to convince him to check himself into an institution. But Herzog, who has previously considered doing just that, is now coming to terms with his life. Ramona comes up to join him for dinner – much to Will's surprise – and Herzog begins making plans to fix up the house, which, like his life, needs repair but is still structurally sound. Herzog closes by saying that he doesn't need to write any more letters. Through the flashbacks that litter the novel, other critical details of Herzog's life come to light, including his marriage to the stable Daisy and the existence of their son, Marco; the life of Herzog's father, a failure at every job he tried; and Herzog's sexual molestation by a stranger on a street in Chicago. Style \\"People don't realize how much they are in the grip of ideas\\", Bellow once wrote. \\"We live among ideas much more than we live in nature.\\"PInsker, The Schlemeil as Metaphor, p. 133 Herzog is such a person. In fact, he considers his addiction to ideas to be his greatest virtue. Herzog's ideas, as expressed in his letters, are brilliant and seductive; \\"After Herzog\\", the New York Times book reviewer exulted, \\"no writer need pretend in his fiction that his education stopped in the eighth grade.\\"Times review (Sep. 20, 1964) But, said Bellow in an interview, Herzog \\"comes to realize at last that what he considers his intellectual 'privilege' has proved to be another form of bondage.\\"Conversations with Saul Bellow, p.63 It is only when he has loosened this bondage and gotten in touch with the \\"primordial person\\" who exists outside this ideology that Herzog can \\"achieve the experience of authentic being.\\"E. Pifer, Saul Bellow against the Grain, p. 115 The story is told entirely from Herzog's point of view. Of the hero's pervasive consciousness, Irving Howe wrote: \\"We are made captive in the world of Herzog... the consciousness of the character forms the enclosing medium of the novel.\\"The Critic as Artist: Essays on Books, p. 184 In typical Bellow style, the descriptions of characters' emotions and physical features are rich in wit and energy. Herzog's relationships are the central theme of the novel, not just with women and friends, but also society and himself. Herzog's own thoughts and thought processes are laid bare in the letters he writes.Dipple, The Unresolvable Plot, p. 213 As the novel progresses, the letters (represented in italics) become fewer and fewer. This seems to mirror the healing of the narrator's mind, as his attention turns from his inner struggles and the intellectual ideas that fascinate him towards the real world outside and the real options offered by his current situation – not having to be a scholar, the possibility of starting afresh with Ramona, and so on. Autobiographical elements The character of Herzog in many ways echoes a fictionalized Saul Bellow. Both Herzog and Bellow grew up in Canada, the sons of bootleggers who had emigrated from Russia (St. Petersburg). Both are Jewish, lived in Chicago for significant periods of time, and were divorced twice (at the time of writing; Bellow would go on to divorce four of his five wives). Herzog is nearly the same age that Bellow was when he wrote the novel. The character of Valentine Gersbach is based on Jack Ludwig, a long-time friend of Bellow who had an affair with Bellow's second wife, Sondra.\\"Bellow's Emulators\\" . The Walrus, November 8, 2010. Similarly, Ramona is based on Rosette Lamont, a professor of French whom Bellow dated after divorcing his second wife Sasha Tschacbasov. Both Lamont and Ludwig reviewed Herzog without mentioning the autobiographical elements, the latter favorably describing it as \\"a major breakthrough\\". Asked about these similarities, Bellow said \\"I don't know that that sort of thing is really relevant. I mean, it's a curiosity about reality which is impure, let's put it that way. Let's both be bigger than that.\\"Conversations with Saul Bellow, p. 99 Trivia * In the Kingsley Amis novel Stanley and the Women (1984), Stanley's son Steve reads a copy of Herzog and abruptly tears it up. * Ian McEwan begins his 2005 novel Saturday with an extended epigraph from Herzog. * The middle initial E. in Moses E. Herzog stands for Elkanah, who in I Samuel was the husband of Hannah and thus the father of the prophet Samuel. * The narrator/protagonist of J. M. Coetzee's \\"The Vietnam Project\\" in Dusklands, before being committed to an asylum, has in his possession a copy of Herzog in addition to Patrick White's Voss. All three authors (Bellow, White, and Coetzee) went on to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature after the publication of Dusklands, which was published in 1974. * The plot of the movie A Serious Man from the Coen brothers is partly similar to the plot of Herzog, as the main character in both is a middle-aged Jewish professor whose wife leaves him for their family friend. In both the wife asks him to leave his own house, and he passively agrees without arguing. As a consequence, he teeters on the verge of losing his mind and his academic career suffers.

The idea was that the card catalog, then in fairly general use by libraries, could be adapted with advantage to certain 'commercial indexes'. ... Directly connected with these is one of the most important principles of all - the 'unit record' principal in business. Hitherto, the records of a business house had been kept, each for one fixed purpose, and their usefulness had been restricted by the inflexible limitations of a bound book. The unit record principle, made possible by the card system, gave to these records a new accessibility and significance. ... By 1887 ...Doctor Herman Hollerith had worked out the basis for a mechanical system of recording, compiling and tabulating census facts... Each card was used to record the facts about an individual or a family - a unit situation. These cards were the forerunners of today's punched cards or unit records. Data processing equipment can be divided into two basic types - computers and unit record machines. Unit Record derives form the common use of punchcards to carry information on a one-item-per-card basis, which makes them unit records. Like the index card, the punched card is a unit record containing one kind of data, which can be combined with other kinds of data punched in other cards. Unit record machines came to be as ubiquitous in industry and government in the first two-thirds of the twentieth century as computers became in the last third. They allowed large volume, sophisticated data-processing tasks to be accomplished before electronic computers were invented and while they were still in their infancy. This data processing was accomplished by processing punched cards through various unit record machines in a carefully choreographed progression. This progression, or flow, from machine to machine was often planned and documented with detailed flowcharts that used standardized symbols for documents and the various machine functions. All but the earliest machines had high-speed mechanical feeders to process cards at rates from around 100 to 2,000 per minute, sensing punched holes with mechanical, electrical, or, later, optical sensors. The operation of many machines was directed by the use of a removable plugboard, control panel, or connection box.Cemach, Harry P., 1951, The Elements of Punched Card Accounting, Pitman, p.27. Within certain limits the information punched in any column of a card can be reproduced in any desired position by the tabulator. This is achieved by means of a Connection Box. ... The connection box can be easily removed from the tabulator and replaced by another. Initially all machines were manual or electromechanical. The first use of an electronic component was in 1937 when a photocell was used in a Social Security bill-feed machine. Electronic components were used on other machines beginning in the late 1940s. IBM was the largest supplier of unit record equipment and this article largely reflects IBM practice and terminology. Sheet 1 of Hollerith's U.S. Patent 395,782 showing his early concept for recording statistical information by means of holes punched in paper. History =Beginnings= In the 1880s Herman Hollerith invented the recording of data on a medium that could then be read by a machine. Prior uses of machine readable media had been for lists of instructions (not data) to drive programmed machines such as Jacquard looms and mechanized musical instruments. \\"After some initial trials with paper tape, he settled on punched cards [...]\\".Columbia University Computing History - Herman Hollerith To process these punched cards, sometimes referred to as \\"Hollerith cards\\", he invented the keypunch, sorter, and tabulator unit record machines.U.S. Census Bureau: The Hollerith MachineAn early use of \\"Hollerith Card\\" can be found in the 1914 Actuarial Soc of America Trans. v.XV.51,52- Perforated Card System These inventions were the foundation of the data processing industry. The tabulator used electromechanical relays to increment mechanical counters. Hollerith's method was used in the 1890 census. The company he founded in 1896, the Tabulating Machine Company (TMC), was one of four companies that in 1911 were amalgamated in the forming of a fifth company, the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company, later renamed IBM. Following the 1900 census a permanent Census bureau was formed. The bureau's contract disputes with Hollerith led to the formation of the Census Machine Shop where James Powers and others developed new machines for part of the 1910 census processing. Powers left the Census Bureau in 1911, with rights to patents for the machines he developed, and formed the Powers Accounting Machine Company.U.S. Census Bureau: Tabulation and Processing In 1927 Powers' company was acquired by Remington Rand. In 1919 Fredrik Rosing Bull, after examining Hollerith's machines, began developing unit record machines for his employer. Bull's patents were sold in 1931, constituting the basis for Groupe Bull. These companies, and others, manufactured and marketed a variety of general-purpose unit record machines for creating, sorting, and tabulating punched cards, even after the development of computers in the 1950s. Punched card technology had quickly developed into a powerful tool for business data-processing. =Timeline= Replica of Hollerith tabulating machine with sorting box, circa 1890.

The warning often printed on cards that were to be individually handled, \\"Do not fold, spindle or mutilate\\", coined by Charles A. Philips, became a motto for the post-World War II era (even though many people had no idea what spindle meant).Lee, J.A.L. (1995) Computer Pioneers, IEEE, p.557 With the development of computers punched cards found new uses as their principal input media. Punched cards were used not only for data, but for a new application - computer programs, see: Computer programming in the punched card era. Unit record machines therefore remained in computer installations in a supporting role for keypunching, reproducing card decks, and printing. * 1955: IBM produces 72.5 million punched cards per day. * 1957: The IBM 608, a transistor version of the 1948 IBM 604. First commercial all-transistor calculator. * 1958: The \\"Series 50\\", basic accounting machines, was announced.IBM Archives - DPD chronology These were modified machines, with reduced speed and/or function, offered for rental at reduced rates. The name \\"Series 50\\" relates to a similar marketing effort, the \\"Model 50\\", seen in the IBM 1940 product booklet. An alternate report identifies the modified machines as \\"Type 5050\\" introduced in 1959 and notes that Remington-Rand introduced similar products. * 1959: BTM is merged with rival Powers-Samas to form International Computers and Tabulators(ICT). * 1959: The IBM 1401, internally known in IBM for a time as \\"SPACE\\" for \\"Stored Program Accounting and Calculating Equipment\\" and developed in part as a response to the Bull Gamma 3, outperforms three IBM 407s and a 604, while having a much lower rental. That functionality combined with the availability of tape drives, accelerated the decline in unit record equipment usage. * 1960: The IBM 609 Calculator, an improved 608 with core memory. This will be IBMs last punched card calculator.Columbia University: The IBM 609 Calculator Many organizations were loath to alter systems that were working, so production unit record installations remained in operation long after computers offered faster and more cost effective solutions. Specialized uses of punched cards, including toll collection, microform aperture cards, and punched card voting, kept unit record equipment in use into the twenty-first century. Another reason was cost or availability of equipment: for example in 1965 an IBM 1620 computer did not have a printer as standard equipment, so it was normal in such installations to punch printed output onto cards, using two cards per line if required and print these cards on an IBM 407 accounting machine and then throw the cards away. * 1968: International Computers and Tabulators (ICT) is merged with English Electric Computers, forming International Computers Limited (ICL). * 1969: The IBM System/3, renting for less than $1,000 a month, the ancestor of IBM's midrange computer product line, aka. minicomputers, was aimed at new customers and organizations that still used IBM 1400 series computers or unit record equipment. It featured a new, smaller, punched card with a 96 column format. Instead of the rectangular punches in the classic IBM card, the new cards had tiny (1 mm), circular holes much like paper tape. By July 1974 more than 25,000 System/3s had been installed.IBM System 3 * 1971: The IBM 129 Card Data Recorder (keypunch and auxiliary on-line card reader/punch) is the last, or among the last, 80-column card unit record product announcements (other than card readers and card punches attached to computers). * 1975 Cardamation founded, a U.S. company that supplied punched card equipment and supplies until 2011.Dyson, George (1999) The Undead (Cardamation), Wired v.7.03 =Endings= * 1976: The IBM 407 Accounting Machine was withdrawn from marketing.IBM 407 Accounting Machine * 1978: IBM's Rochester plant made its last shipment of the IBM 082, 084, 085, 087, 514, and 548 machines.IBM Rochester chronology, page3 The System/3 was succeeded by the System/38. * 1980: The last reconditioning of an IBM 519 Document Originating Punch.IBM Rochester chronology * 1984: The IBM 029 Card Punch, announced in 1964, was withdrawn from marketing.IBM 029 Card Punch IBM closed its last punch card manufacturing plant.IBM Punch-Card Plant Will Close, Joseph Perkins, The Washington Post, July 2, 1984 * 2010: A group from the Computer History Museum reported that an IBM 402 Accounting Machine and related punched card equipment was still in operation at a filter manufacturing company in Conroe, Texas.Visit to a working IBM 402 in Conroe, Texas The punched card system was still in use as of 2013.Conroe company still using computers museums want to put on display By Craig Hlavaty, Houston Chronicle, April 24, 2013 *2011: The owner of Cardamation, Robert G. Swartz, dies, and the company, perhaps the last supplier of punch card equipment, ceases operation. *2015: Punched cards for time clocks and some other applications were still available; one supplier was the California Tab Card Company. As of 2018, the web site was no longer in service. Punched cards The basic unit of data storage was the punched card. The IBM 80-column card was introduced in 1928. The Remington Rand Card with 45 columns in each of two tiers, thus 90 columns, in 1930. Powers-Samas punched cards include one with 130 columns.(Cemach, 1951, pp 47-51) Columns on different punch cards vary from 5 to 12 punch positions. The method used to store data on punched cards is vendor specific. In general each column represents a single digit, letter or special character. Sequential card columns allocated for a specific use, such as names, addresses, multi-digit numbers, etc., are known as a field. An employee number might occupy 5 columns; hourly pay rate, 3 columns; hours worked in a given week, 2 columns; department number 3 columns; project charge code 6 columns and so on. Keypunching IBM 029 Card Punch. Original data was usually punched into cards by workers, often women, known as keypunch operators. Their work was often checked by a second operator using a verifier machine. Sorting IBM 082 Sorter. An activity in many unit record shops was sorting card decks into the order necessary for the next processing step. Sorters, like the IBM 80 series Card Sorters, sorted input cards into one of 13 pockets depending on the holes punched in a selected column and the sorter's settings. The 13th pocket was for blanks and rejects. Sorting an input card deck into ascending sequence on a multiple column field, such as an employee number, was done by a radix sort, bucket sort, or a combination of the two methods. Sorters were also used to separate decks of interspersed master and detail cards, either by a significant hole punch or by the cards corner-cut. More advanced functionality was available in the IBM 101 Electronic Statistical Machine, which could * Sort * Count * Accumulate totals * Print summaries * send calculated results (counts and totals) to an attached IBM 524 Duplicating Summary Punch. Tabulating Accounting Machine at US Army's Redstone Arsenal in 1961. Reports and summary data were generated by accounting or tabulating machines. The original tabulators only counted the presence of a hole at a location on a card. Simple logic, like ands and ors could be done using relays. Later tabulators, such as those in IBM's 300 series, directed by a control panel, could do both addition and subtraction of selected fields to one or more counters and print each card on its own line. At some signal, say a following card with a different customer number, totals could be printed for the just completed customer number. Tabulators became complex: the IBM 405 contained 55,000 parts (2,400 different) and 75 miles of wire; a Remington Rand machine circa 1941 contained 40,000 parts. Calculating In 1931, IBM introduced the model 600 multiplying punch. The ability to divide became commercially available after World War II. The earliest of these calculating punches were electromechanical. Later models employed vacuum tube logic. Electronic modules developed for these units were used in early computers, such as the IBM 650. The Bull Gamma 3 calculator could be attached to tabulating machines, unlike the stand-alone IBM calculators. Card punching IBM 519 Document-Originating Machine Card punching operations included: *Gang punching - producing a large number of identically punched cards--for example, for inventory tickets. *Reproducing - reproducing a card deck in its entirety or just selected fields. A payroll master card deck might be reproduced at the end of a pay period with the hours worked and net pay fields blank and ready for the next pay period's data. Programs in the form of card decks were reproduced for backup. *Summary punching - punching new cards with details and totals from an attached tabulating machine. *Mark sense reading - detecting electrographic lead pencil marks on ovals printed on the card and punching the corresponding data values into the card. Singularly or in combination, these operations were provided in a variety of machines. The IBM 519 Document- Originating Machine could perform all of the above operations. The IBM 549 Ticket Converter read data from Kimball tags, copying that data to punched cards. With the development of computers, punched cards were also produced by computer output devices. Collating IBM collators had two input hoppers and four output pockets. These machines could merge or match card decks based on the control panel's wiring as illustrated here. The Remington Rand Interfiling Reproducing Punch Type 310-1 was designed to merge two separate files into a single file. It could also punch additional information into those cards and select desired cards. Collators performed operations comparable to a database join. Interpreting An interpreter would print characters equivalent to the values of columns on the card. The columns to be printed could be selected and even reordered, based on the machine's control panel wiring. Later models could print on one of several rows on the card. Unlike keypunches, which printed values directly above each column, interpreters generally used a font that was a little wider than a column and could only print up to 60 characters per row.IBM Card Interpreters Typical models include the IBM 550 Numeric Interpreter, the IBM 557 Alphabetic Interpreter, and the Remington Rand Type 312 Alphabetic Interpreter. Transmission of punched card data Electrical transmission of punched card data was invented in the early 1930s. The device was called an Electrical Remote Control of Office Machines and was assigned to IBM. Inventors were Joseph C. Bolt of Boston & Curt I. Johnson; Worcester, Mass. assors to the Tabulating Machine Co., Endicott, NY. The Distance Control Device received a US patent in Aug.9,1932: . Letters from IBM talk about filling in Canada in 9/15/1931. Processing punched tape The IBM 046 Tape- to-Card Punch and the IBM 047 Tape-to-Card Printing Punch (which was almost identical, but with the addition of a printing mechanism) read data from punched paper tape and punched that data into cards. The IBM 063 Card- Controlled Tape Punch read punched cards, punching that data into paper tape. Control panel wiring and Connection boxes IBM 402 Accounting Machine control panel The operation of Hollerith/BTM/IBM/Bull tabulators and many other types of unit record equipment was directed by a control panel. Operation of Powers-Samas/Remington Rand unit record equipment was directed by a connection box. Control panels had a rectangular array of holes called hubs which were organized into groups. Wires with metal ferrules at each end were placed in the hubs to make connections. The output from some card column positions might connected to a tabulating machine's counter, for example. A shop would typically have separate control panels for each task a machine was used for. Note: Control panel wiring is sometimes referred to as programming, however that term applies only to the control panels of calculators, such as the IBM 602 and IBM 604, that specified a sequence of operations. Paper handling equipment A decollator and a burster For many applications, the volume of fan-fold paper produced by tabulators required other machines, not considered to be unit record machines, to ease paper handling. * A decollator separated multi-part fan-fold paper into individual stacks of one-part fan- fold and removed the carbon paper. * A burster separated one-part fan-fold paper into individual sheets. For some uses it was desirable to remove the tractor-feed holes on either side of the fan-fold paper. In these cases the form's edge strips were perforated and the burster removed them as well.

Founded in 1923 as the successor company to Gerlinger Motors, Kenworth specializes in production of heavy-duty (Class 8) and medium-duty (Class 5-7) commercial vehicles. Headquartered in Seattle suburb Kirkland, Washington, Kenworth has been a wholly owned subsidiary of PACCAR since 1945, operating alongside sister company (and marketplace rival) Peterbilt Motors. Kenworth marked several firsts in truck production; alongside the first truck produced with a standard diesel-fuel engine, the company introduced a raised-roof sleeper cab, and the first heavy-duty truck with an aerodynamically-optimized body design. The Kenworth W900 was produced continuously from 1961 to 2019, serving as one of the longest production runs of any vehicles in automotive history. History Kenworth was founded in 1912 by brothers George T. and Louis Gerlinger, Jr. as a car and truck dealership known as Gerlinger Motors in Portland, Oregon. In 1914, they decided to build their own truck with a more powerful inline six-cylinder engine, the first put into a commercial truck. The Gersix, as it was known when introduced in 1915, was framed in structural steel, which along with its power, made the truck ideal for loggingGreat Trucks in the rugged Northwest.Starner, D. Earl. A Pictorial History of the Straddle Carrier, 1988. 48p. In 1916 the company moved to Tacoma, Washington, where Seattle businessman Edgar K. Worthington was managing his mother's commercial building. He became intrigued by the Gerlinger company, which was doing quite well, or so it seemed, as the Gersix became a popular fixture in the Northwest.Kenworth History - at Kenworth.com In 1917 Worthington and his business partner Captain Frederick Kent bought the business, renaming it the Gersix Motor Co. In 1919 Kent retired from the business, and his son Harry Kent became Worthington's new partner. In 1922, Gersix made 53 trucks at its factory on Fairview Avenue at Valley Street. Under the new name, the company moved to 506 Mercer Street and later to 1263 Mercer Street. Trucks and motor coaches were assembled in individual bays rather than on a conventional assembly line. In 1923 Kent and Worthington reincorporated the business as the Kenworth Motor Truck Company, a combination of the names \\"Ken\\"t and \\"Worth\\"ington. In 1926 they started making buses, and in 1933 Kenworth was the first American company to offer diesel engines as standard in their trucks. In 1945 Kenworth was bought by The Pacific Car and Foundry Company. The 1970s television series \\"Movin On\\" featured a Kenworth tractor, as did “BJ and the Bear”. In the 1989 James Bond movie Licence to Kill, Bond drives a Kenworth W900B semi-truck as he duels drug dealer Franz Sanchez. The maximum legal load is .

The first Kenworth model in Australia was the KWS925, imported fully built in 1962. Soon later, Kenworths were imported in complete knock-down kits and assembled in Preston, Victoria. Australian built Kenworth models are also exported to nearby RHD markets in New Zealand, Japan, Thailand and Papua New Guinea. Popular models include the T600, T601, T604, T608, T609, T610, T610SAR, T650,T658, T659, W925, T900, T904, T908, T909, T950, T350, T359,T360, T400/T401/404S/T404ST/404SAR, K124, K100E, K100G, K104, K104B,K108, K200 (COE) and C500, C501, C508, C509, C510 and C540. The T range includes the bonneted conventional models and the C for heavy haulage, mining, off-road and road train use, and the K range covers the cab over models. As of July 2020 the only models that do not have Twin-Steer configurations are T410 SAR, T610 SAR, T900, C510, C540. Kenworth Australia started building the new range of trucks tying in their 2008 release with the model range being the '08 Series'. This includes the following conventional (bonneted) models; in approximate order of smallest to largest: the T358/A, T408SAR, T408, T608, T658, T908 and C508. The only cab over truck built was the K108, which was very popular in the B-Double market segment owing to its shorter length. Current Australian Kenworth models include: T Series - T360, T410, T410 SAR, T610, T610 SAR, T659, T909 C Series - C509, C510, C540 K Series - K200 Bus industry =1926–1933= BU series *Bus production was a mainstay at Kenworth for much of the company's early years, and at one time was the company's most lucrative form of business. When the company was known as Gerlinger Motor Car Works, their first two full-chassis vehicles were school buses based on the Gersix truck chassis. In 1926, Kenworth developed a chassis specifically for school and transit bus operators, known as the BU. The BU model sported a wheelbase of that was expanded two more inches in 1927, and could be fitted with bodies ranging from 21 to 29 passengers. The BU model also heralded the return of the Buda six- cylinder engine, and remained the company's principal offering through 1931. The new model became so popular in the Pacific Northwest that production rose from 99 units in 1927 and 127 units in 1927, to 230 units by 1930. By that time, the predominant number of BU models produced were sent to school bus body builders, and were built for use in school districts throughout the Seattle and Puget Sound area of Washington state. KHC series *Kenworth continued expanding into bus production throughout the 1930s, despite the Great Depression being a major influence. To assist Kenworth's 80 factory workers - who were idled by the Depression, the company undertook a bold move by introducing a new line of buses in August 1932. Known as the KHC-22 (Kenworth - Heiser - City), the 23-passenger bus was developed by Kenworth engineers as a stock demo vehicle to help aid a glum sales picture, and to jumpstart the local economy. At a time of mild economic recovery, the KHC22 proved to be very popular and sparked a renewed interest in Kenworth buses. Major operators of the KHC-22 (later expanded to a wheelbase, 33-passenger KHC-33, in September 1933) were the Portland Railway, Light & Power Company of Portland, Oregon, and Spokane United Railways. =1933–1939= *In that year, Kenworth also released its most popular and successful line of transit bus, a conventional styled bus based on their Model 86 heavy duty truck. Powered by a Hercules JXCM engine, the model 870 as it was known, would soon be replaced by a model 871, which became Kenworth's standard line of buses throughout the early and mid-1930s. Experiments with \\"deck-and-a-half\\" buses would soon follow, made reality in the W-1 model, as well as the company's very first experiments with rear-engine coach-type buses in 1936. *Production of Kenworth buses continued throughout the 1930s and into the early 1940s, and during this time Kenworth was manufacturing bus chassis for body builders such as Wentworth and Irwin (later renamed Wentwin), and Heiser. Heiser, long an often chosen body for school buses bearing Kenworth chassis, would later be purchased by Pacific Car and Foundry Company in 1937. *Kenworth changed its production line early in 1939, reflecting a desire to remain \\"in tune\\" with market forces. The conventional bus chassis, which had become poor sellers, were dropped altogether, and Kenworth focused its designs on more transit or \\"coach-type\\" buses with engines being located either underfloor or at the back of the bus. *By this time, Kenworth was a major force in transit bus production, and nearly every major transit company in the Pacific Northwest were running Kenworth buses. Seattle Municipal Railway purchased several new model 601s to replace the previous model H30s, which were powered by a Hall- Scott 135 engine underfloor and had bodies built by the Pacific Car and Foundry Company. Kenworth also built a model 612, which became the company's most widely distributed underfloor coach. 27 were built with 14 wheelbase variations (and seven engine variations), and all 27 were sold by as many as 15 different operators. =1940–1959= *At the onset of World War II, Kenworth's bus production waned again, but Kenworth was able to remain afloat because orders were now larger than before. This was possible because the early effects of the war forced the amalgamation of several smaller, more regional operators into larger, territorial ones. These conditions meant more bus orders for Kenworth, only there were fewer buyers. Bremerton Transit purchased several buses in 1940 to accommodate the increase in ridership due to the preparations for the war itself. *In the face of these conditions, Kenworth still maintained production at about 40 units annually. In 1940, the Seattle Municipal Railway purchased 30 buses in a single order, assisting Kenworth in breaking a production record. With low volume production, Kenworth was more than willing to build special order coaches. Gray Line affiliates Seattle, Portland, and Vancouver purchased several of these special coach orders known as Grayliner or Grayliner Junior buses, and the bodies for these buses were all built by PC&F.; When wartime ensued, Kenworth found itself once again focusing its efforts towards war production, producing troop transports and a number of military variations of their commercial truck line. *Near the end of World War II, the company would become part of the Pacific Car and Foundry Company. In 1944, the passing of Kenworth president Philip G. Johnson meant that the major stockholders, the widows of Johnson, and Kenworth founders Kent and Worthington - could sell their controlling shares and stake of the company. Foreseeing a drastic downturn at war's end, Kenworth and PC&F; believed bus production would play a pivotal role in jumpstarting the economy. It also saw an opportunity to hire former military truck and aircraft workers, and began a major push of four primary postwar models set to be relaunched in 1946. *The postwar Kenworth buses were part of a small group that included small intercity or interurban buses, dubbed the model K; a trolley coach known as the model E; a city transit bus known as the model N; and a model W - an intercity bus. The choice of model designations derived from the first four letters of the name KENWorth. Later on, a one-door transit bus dubbed the Model O and a prototype school bus dubbed the model T,Pacific Photos - at Gillig Coaches which was the early forerunner of nearly 3000 model CT and LR buses produced by Kenworth from 1949 to 1957. Ultimately, the company built trolley buses for just one city – a single order of 50 of model E2 built in 1947–48 for the Portland Traction Company, in Portland, Oregon.Murray, Alan (2000).

LCCN Tel:73-84356%7C73-84356. K & W series *The Model K and Model W buses looked quite similar, but all similarities ended there. The differences were their length, side window design, and the choices of available engines. The model W had a pancake underfloor Hall-Scott 190 engine, while the K was powered by an International Red Diamond RD450 in the rear of the bus. The shorter model K was capable of hauling 25-33 passengers, while its bigger brethren could haul anywhere between 31 and 41 passengers depending on configuration. The Model N, as announced, would have seated 36 to 44 passengers in an underfloor engine configuration, but in 1947 it was downsized to a 32 to 36 passenger bus when the original design found no takers. After 1947, Kenworth began assigning numerals to the model designations to signify evolutionary variants in the design. *As production orders for the interurban model Ks and model Ws waned, Kenworth focused its attention on special orders including an order of 10 \\"Brucks\\"KW Bruck - at Gillig Coaches for Great Northern Railway in Montana, (an earlier version was built for Northern Pacific Transport, but was a split- level coach) and several Highway Post Office coaches. These \\"special order coaches\\" were based on the model T school bus, which entered production in early 1949, after additionally test-marketing a small 20-passenger bus known as the Carcoach (only one was built, but none entered full production). T & C series A retired 1955 Kenworth T126 \\"Pacific School Coach\\", seen here in Cathlamet, Washington. Compare with image below, of same bus, taken after restoration has commenced. *The Model T school bus, which entered production after the last bus was built for Great Northern in April 1949, was an immediate hit with many school bus operators in the Pacific Northwest. The T-126 as it was known, boasted a unique four-pane windshield that offered unheralded forward visibility in any school bus at the time, and was the first school bus ever built to feature a roof escape hatchPacific Trivia - at Gillig Coaches (now required equipment). Production of the T-126 averaged over 375 buses per year, making it Kenworth's most lucrative bus offering in the company's history up to that time. Shortly after its launch, Kenworth renamed the line the model CT. The model CT also came in several varying passenger capacities ranging from 55, 61, 67, 73, and 79 passengers. The model CT \\"Pacific School Coach\\" was powered by an International Red Diamond 450 inline six-cylinder gas engine placed at the rear of the bus, and a LeRoi H540 engine was made available for an LR-73 model that was produced in August 1950. Some orders for modified model CTs were made available and sold internationally, with variants being sold to Uruguay and Venezuela, as well as the Middle East. *After the boon of school bus production, and to focus more on truck production due to a rising number of heavy duty truck orders, all bus production was shifted from Kenworth over to Pacific Car and Foundry in the middle of 1956. After some final cleanup, PC&F; wound up completely outstanding orders for the Pacific School Coach in early 1957. Shortly afterwards, PC&F; sold all rights, tooling, and equipment to Gillig Bros., a school bus manufacturer based in Hayward, California. Gillig would later incorporate many designs of the model CT \\"Pacific School Coach\\" into their own Transit Coach line of school buses, starting with the 501- and C-series models in 1958 and 1959, respectively. =Bus industry legacy= A retired 1955 Kenworth T-216 \\"Pacific School Coach\\" formerly from Cathlamet, Washington, is seen here in a photo taken after restoration has commenced. Compare with above image, of same bus, taken in March 2007. Kenworth's role in the transit and school bus industry has largely been forgotten. This is likely due to a number of factors including Kenworth's current status as a leading manufacturer of Class 8 heavy-duty semi trucks, and the fact that hardly any examples of Kenworth-built buses exist today (with exception of a few surviving model CT-73 \\"Pacific School Coach\\" buses and one remaining \\"Bruck\\"). In light of that fact, and having been a major builder of transit and school buses, interest in the history and preservation of the Pacific School Coach (as well as Kenworth's involvement in the transit and bus industry as a whole) has increased in recent years, especially in the Pacific Northwest where Kenworth's buses were most commonly found. The Gillig Transit Coach / Pacific SchoolCoach Online Museum, a website focusing on preserving Gillig's line of earlier-built school buses, was expanded shortly after its 2001 launch to include the history of the Kenworth-Pacific SchoolCoach. It has since expanded even further to include the entire history of Kenworth's involvement in the public transportation industry, as well as their local dominance in the school bus industry throughout the 1950s. In 2006, at the American Truck Historical Society's 11th Annual Truck Show at the Mason County Fairgrounds in Shelton, WA, a historical society dedicated to preserving the Gillig Transit Coach and Kenworth-Pacific School Coach was officially dedicated.

Formal citation: . A page from the June 14 to June 28, 1935, Congressional Record. The Congressional Record is the official record of the proceedings and debates of the United States Congress, published by the United States Government Publishing Office and issued when Congress is in session. Indexes are issued approximately every two weeks. At the end of a session of Congress, the daily editions are compiled in bound volumes constituting the permanent edition. Chapter 9 of Title 44 of the United States Code authorizes publication of the Congressional Record. Overview The Congressional Record consists of four sections: the House section, the Senate section, the Extensions of Remarks, and, since the 1940s, the Daily Digest. At the back of each daily issue is the Daily Digest, which summarizes the day's floor and committee activities and serves as a table of contents for each issue. The House and Senate sections contain proceedings for the separate chambers of Congress. A section of the Congressional Record titled Extensions of Remarks contains speeches, tributes and other extraneous words that were not uttered during open proceedings of the full Senate or of the full House of Representatives. Witnesses in committee hearings are often asked to submit their complete testimony \\"for the record\\" and only deliver a summary of it in person. The full statement will then appear in a printed volume of the hearing identified as \\"Statements for the Record\\". In years past, this particular section of the Congressional Record was called the \\"Appendix\\". While members of either body may insert material into Extensions of Remarks, Senators rarely do so. The overwhelming majority of what is found there is entered at the request of Members of the House of Representatives. From a legal standpoint, most materials in the Congressional Record are classified as secondary authority, as part of a statute's legislative history. By custom and rules of each house, members also frequently \\"revise and extend\\" their remarks made on the floor before the debates are published in the Congressional Record. Therefore, for many years, speeches that were not delivered in Congress appeared in the Congressional Record, including in the sections purporting to be verbatim reports of debates. In recent years, however, these revised remarks have been preceded by a \\"bullet\\" symbol or, more recently and currently, printed in a typeface discernibly different from that used to report words spoken by members. The Congressional Record is publicly available for records before 1875 via the Library of Congress' American Memory Century of Lawmaking website, and since 1989 via Congress.gov (which replaced the THOMAS database in 2016). Thanks to a partnership between GPO and the Library of Congress, digital versions of the bound editions are available on govinfo.gov for 1873 to 2001 (Volumes 1-147) and 2005 to 2015 (Volumes 151-161). Govinfo.gov also provides access to digital versions of the daily edition from 1994 (Volume 140) to the present.  History  The Constitution, in Article I, Section 5, requires Congress to keep a journal of its proceedings, although the House and Senate Journals are separate publications from the Congressional Record, and include only a bare record of actions and votes, rather than verbatim texts of the debates. The Congressional Record was first published in 1873. Prior to this, proceedings, roll calls, debates, and other records were recorded in The Annals of Congress (formerly known as The Debates and Proceedings in the Congress of the United States; 1789–1824), the Register of Debates in Congress (1824–1837), or the Congressional Globe (1833–1873). A digital collection of these historical volumes is now available online via the Library of Congress.

This ensures that seeds will be distributed evenly. The seed drill sows the seeds at the proper seeding rate and depth, ensuring that the seeds are covered by soil. This saves them from being eaten by birds and animals, or being dried up due to exposure to sun. With seed drill machines, seeds are distributed in rows, however the distance between seeds along the row cannot be adjusted by the user as in the case of vacuum precision planters. The distance between rows is typically set by the manufacturer. This allows plants to get sufficient sunlight, nutrients, and water from the soil. Before the introduction of the seed drill, most seeds were planted by hand broadcasting, an imprecise and wasteful process with a poor distribution of seeds and low productivity. Use of a seed drill can improve the ratio of crop yield (seeds harvested per seed planted) by as much as nine times.The use of seed drill saves time and labor. Some machines for metering out seeds for planting are called planters. The concepts evolved from ancient Chinese practice and later evolved into mechanisms that pick up seeds from a bin and deposit them down a tube. Seed drills of earlier centuries included single- tube seed drills in Sumer and multi-tube seed drills in China, and later a seed drill by Jethro Tull that was influential in the growth of farming technology in recent centuries. Even for a century after Tull, hand sowing of grain remained common.  Design  Canterbury Agricultural College farm, 1948 Drilling the field In older methods of planting, a field is initially prepared with a plow to a series of linear cuts known as furrows. The field is then seeded by throwing the seeds over the field, a method known as manual broadcasting. The seeds may not be sown to the right depth nor the proper distance from one another. Seeds that land in the furrows have better protection from the elements, and natural erosion or manual raking will cover them while leaving some exposed. The result is a field planted roughly in rows, but having a large number of plants outside the furrow lanes. There are several downsides to this approach. The most obvious is that seeds that land outside the furrows will not have the growth shown by the plants sown in the furrow since they are too shallow on the soil. Because of this, they are lost to the elements. Many of the seeds remain on the surface where they are vulnerable to being eaten by birds or carried away on the wind. Surface seeds commonly never germinate at all or germinate prematurely, only to be killed by frost. Since the furrows represent only a portion of the field's area, and broadcasting distributes seeds fairly evenly, this results in considerable wastage of seeds. Less obvious are the effects of overseeding; all crops grow best at a certain density, which varies depending on the soil and weather conditions. Additional seeding above this will actually reduce crop yields, in spite of more plants being sown, as there will be competition among the plants for the minerals, water, and the soil available. Another reason is that the mineral resources of the soil will also deplete at a much faster rate, thereby directly affecting the growth of the plants. The invention of the seed drill dramatically improved germination. The seed drill employed a series of runners spaced at the same distance as the plowed furrows. These runners, or drills, opened the furrow to a uniform depth before the seed was dropped. Behind the drills were a series of presses, metal discs which cut down the sides of the trench into which the seeds had been planted, covering them over. This innovation permitted farmers to have precise control over the depth at which seeds were planted. This greater measure of control meant that fewer seeds germinated early or late and that seeds were able to take optimum advantage of available soil moisture in a prepared seedbed. The result was that farmers were able to use less seed and at the same time experience larger yields than under the broadcast methods. History Chinese double-tube seed drill, published by Song Yingxing in the Tiangong Kaiwu encyclopedia of 1637. While the Babylonians used primitive seed drills around 1400 BCE, the invention never reached Europe. Multi-tube iron seed drills were invented by the Chinese in the 2nd century BCE.History Channel, Where Did It Come From? Episode: \\"Ancient China: Agriculture\\"Temple, p.25 This multi-tube seed drill has been credited with giving China an efficient food production system that allowed it to support its large population for millennia. This multi-tube seed drill may have been introduced into Europe following contacts with China.Temple, p.25 In the Indian subcontinent, the seed drill was in widespread use among peasants by the time of the Mughal Empire in the 16th century. The first known European seed drill was attributed to Camillo Torello and patented by the Venetian Senate in 1566. A seed drill was described in detail by Tadeo Cavalina of Bologna in 1602. In England, the seed drill was further refined by Jethro Tull in 1701 in the Agricultural Revolution. However, seed drills of this and successive types were both expensive and unreliable, as well as fragile. Seed drills would not come into widespread use in Europe until the mid to late 19th century, when manufacturing advances such as machine tools, die forging and metal stamping allowed large scale precision manufacturing of metal parts. Early drills were small enough to be pulled by a single horse, and many of these remained in use into the 1930s. The availability of steam, and later gasoline tractors, however, saw the development of larger and more efficient drills that allowed farmers to seed ever larger tracts in a single day. Recent improvements to drills allow seed-drilling without prior tilling. This means that soils subject to erosion or moisture loss are protected until the seed germinates and grows enough to keep the soil in place. This also helps prevent soil loss by avoiding erosion after tilling. The development of the press drill was one of the major innovations in pre-1900 farming technology.  Uses  1902 model 12-run seed drill produced by Monitor Manufacturing Company, Minneapolis, Minnesota. Drilling or seeding are the terms used for the mechanized sowing of an agricultural crop. Traditionally, a seed drill consists of a hopper filled with seeds arranged above a series of tubes that can be set at selected distances from each other to allow optimum growth of the resulting plants. Seeds are spaced out using fluted paddles which rotate using a geared drive from one of the drill's land wheels. The seeding rate is altered by changing gear ratios. Most modern drills use air to convey seeds in plastic tubes from the seed hopper to the colters. This arrangement enables seed drills to be much wider than the seed hopper — as much as 12m wide in some cases. The seed is metered mechanically into an air stream created by a hydraulically powered onboard fan and conveyed initially to a distribution head which sub-divides the seeds into the pipes taking the seeds to the individual colters. Modern air seeder and hoe drill combination The seed drill allows farmers to sow seeds in well-spaced rows at specific depths at a specific seed rate; each tube creates a hole of a specific depth, drops in one or more seeds, and covers it over. This invention gives farmers much greater control over the depth that the seed is planted and the ability to cover the seeds without back-tracking. The result is an increased rate of germination, and a much-improved crop yield (up to eight timesThe story of wheat  Ears of plenty  Economist.com Paid subscription required). The use of a seed drill also facilitates weed control. Broadcast seeding results in a random array of growing crops, making it difficult to control weeds using any method other than hand weeding. A field planted using a seed drill is much more uniform, typically in rows, allowing weeding with a hoe during the growing season. Weeding by hand is laborious and inefficient. Poor weeding reduces crop yield, so this benefit is extremely significant. Before the operation of the seed drill, the ground must be plowed and harrowed. The plow digs up the earth and the harrow smooths the soil and breaks up any clumps. The drill must then be set for the size of the seed used. Afterwards, the grain is put in the hopper on top which then follows along behind the drill while it spaces and plants the seed. This system is still used today but has been modified and updated so that a farmer can plant many rows of seed at the same time. A seed drill can be pulled across the field using bullocks or a tractor. Seeds sown using a seed drill are distributed evenly and placed at the correct depth in the soil.

Distinctiveness, Coercion and Sonority: A Unified Theory of Weight. Routledge. p. 203. is a regional dialect of American English spoken by many people in New York City and much of its surrounding metropolitan area. Described by sociolinguist William Labov as the most recognizable dialect in North America, the dialect is known through its association in the media with many public figures and fictional characters. Its features are most densely concentrated in New York City proper and its immediate suburbs (whose residents often commute to New York City), but they also extend somewhat to the wider metropolitan area and the New York City diaspora in other regions. The dialect is widely known for its pronunciation system, the New York accent, which comprises a number of both conservative and innovative features. Major features of the accent include a high, gliding vowel (in words like talk and caught); a split of the \\"short a\\" vowel into two separate sounds; variable dropping of r sounds; and a lack of the cot–caught, Mary–marry–merry, and hurry–furry mergers. History The origins of many of New York City English's diverse features are probably not recoverable. New York City English, largely with the same major pronunciation system popularly recognized today, was first reproduced in literature and also scientifically documented in the 1890s.Mencken, H. L. (1919; reprinted 2012). American Language, 4th Edition. Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group. p. 367 It was then, and still mostly is, associated with ethnically diverse European-American native-English speakers. The dialect likely evolved from an older English variety that encompassed much of the larger Mid-Atlantic region, including the Delaware Valley (whose own distinct dialect centers around Philadelphia and Baltimore), since all of this larger region's dialects still share certain key features, including a high vowel with a glide (sometimes called the aww vowel) as well as a phonemic split of the short a vowel, (making gas and gap, for example, have different vowels sounds)—New York City's split not identical though to Philadelphia's. Linguist William Labov has pointed out that a similarly- structured (though differently pronounced) split is found today in both the standard and London-area accents of England, indicating the likely origin of the New York split. New York City became an urban economic power in the eighteenth century, with the city's financial elites maintaining close ties with the British Empire even after the Revolutionary War. According to Labov, New York speakers' loss of the r sound after vowels (incidentally, not found in the nearby Delaware Valley) is thus an imitation of the prestigious British feature, consistently starting among the upper classes in New York City in the nineteenth century before spreading to other socioeconomic classes. After World War II, social perceptions reversed, and the r-preserving (rhotic) pronunciation became the prestige norm throughout the whole United States. Thus, what was once an upper-class feature only remained strong among vernacular speakers, due to the loss of Britain's imperial status, the national embracing of non-East Coast features,Labov (1966/2006) and widespread postwar migrations of rhotic speakers directly to New York from other regions of the country. Today, most New York City English is variably rhotic, a remnant of the older non-rhotic pronunciation. Other features of the dialect, such as the dental d and t, as well as th-stopping, likely come from contact with foreign languages, particularly Italian and Yiddish, brought into New York City through its huge immigration waves of Europeans during and before the early twentieth century. Grammatical structures, such as the lack of inversion in indirect questions, similarly suggest contact with immigrant languages, plus several words common in the city are derived from such foreign languages.Labov 1972 =Influence on other dialects= Philadelphians born in the twentieth century exhibit a short-a split system that some linguists regard as a simplification of the very similar New York City short-a split.Ash, Sharon (2002). \\"The Distribution of a Phonemic Split in the Mid- Atlantic Region: Yet More on Short a .\\" University of Pennsylvania Working Papers in Linguistics. University of Pennsylvania. p. 1 Younger Philadelphians, however, are retreating from many of the traditional features shared in common with New York City. Due to an influx of immigrants from New York City and neighboring New Jersey to southern Florida, some resident southern Floridians now speak with an accent reminiscent of a New York accent. Additionally, as a result of social and commercial contact between the two cities and the influx of immigrants from the same countries, the traditional accent of New Orleans, Louisiana, known locally as \\"Yat\\", bears distinctive similarities with the New York accent, including the (moribund) coil–curl merger, raising of to , a similar split in the short-a system, and th- stopping. Therefore, older New York City English also presumably influenced dialect evolution in Cincinnati, Ohio, and Albany, New York, whose older speakers in particular may still exhibit a short-a split system that appears to be an expanded or generalized variant of the New York City short-a system. Certain New York City dialect features also appear in New York Latino English. =Recent developments= Though William Labov argued in 2010 that the New York accent is basically stable at the moment, some recent studies have revealed a trend of recession in certain features of the accent, especially among younger speakers from middle-class or higher backgrounds. Documented loss of New York City accent features includes the loss of: the coil–curl merger (now almost completely extinct), non-rhoticity, and the extremely raised long vowel (as in talk, cough, or law). Researchers proposed that the motivation behind these recessive trends is the stigmatization against the typical New York accent since the mid-1900s as being associated with a poorer or working-class background, often also corresponding with particular ethnic identities. While earlier projects detected trends of emphasizing New York accents as part of a process of social identification, recent researches attribute the loss of typical accent features to in-group ethnic distancing. In other words, many of the young generations of ethnic groups who formerly were the most representative speakers of the accent are currently avoiding its features in order to not stand out socially and/or ethnically. Pronunciation The pronunciation of New York City English, most popularly acknowledged by the term \\"New York accent\\", is readily noticed and stereotyped, garnering considerable attention in American culture.Labov et al., 2006, p. 233 Some well-known phonological features include its traditional dropping of r, a short-a split system (in which, for example, the a in gas is not assonant to the a in gap), a high gliding vowel in words like talk, thought, all, etc. (and thus an absence of the cot–caught merger), absence of the Mary–marry–merry merger, and the stigmatized (and largely now- extinct) coil–curl merger.Labov et al., 2006, p. 260 Vocabulary and grammar There are some words used mainly in Greater New York City. For instance, a \\"stoop\\" (from the Dutch word \\"stoep\\") is the front steps of a building. In the black and Latino communities, the word punk tends to be used as a synonym for \\"weak\\", \\"someone unwilling or unable to defend himself\\" or perhaps \\"loser\\", though it appears to descend from an outdated African- American English meaning of male receptive participant in anal sex. New Yorkers tend to say they stand on line, whereas most other American-English speakers tend to stand in line. Small convenience stores have, in recent decades, often been called bodegas, from the Spanish term originally meaning \\"a wine storehouse\\" via the Puerto Rican Spanish term for \\"small store; corner store\\"; by extension, \\"bodega cats\\" is the term for the cats that inhabit such establishments. These small stores may also be called delis, which is the short form of delicatessens. Conversational styles New York speakers have some unique conversational styles. Linguistics professor Deborah Tannen notes in a New York Times article it has \\"an emphasis to involve the other person, rather than being considerate. It would be asking questions as a show of interest in the other person, whereas in other parts of [the] country, people don't ask because it might put the person on the spot.\\" New Yorkers \\"stand closer, talk louder, and leave shorter pauses between exchanges,\\" Tannen said. \\"I call it 'cooperative overlap'. It's a way of showing interest and enthusiasm, but it's often mistaken for interrupting by people from elsewhere in the country.\\" On the other hand, linguist William Labov demurs, \\"there's nothing known to linguists about 'normal New York City conversation'\\".John Leland, \\"Was it 'normal New York City conversation'?\\" New York Times, June 9, 2017 Notable speakers The accent has a strong presence in media; pioneer variationist sociolinguist William Labov describes it as the most recognizable variety of North American English.

However, New York City English does extend beyond the city proper, including on western Long Island (although the boundaries there are not clearly established).Labov, William. 2010. Principles of Linguistic Change, V. 3: Cognitive and Cultural Factors. Cambridge/NY Cambridge University Press. Chapter 15, footnote 13. p.390 Moreover, the English of the Hudson Valley forms a continuum of speakers who gather more features of New York City English the closer they are to the city itself; some of the dialect's features may be heard as far north as the city of Albany. =New Jersey= The northeast quarter of New Jersey, prominently Bergen, Hudson, and Essex counties, including the cities Weehawken, Hoboken, Jersey City, Bayonne, and Newark,Labov, William (2007) \\"Transmission and Diffusion\\", Language June 2007 p. 17 plus Middlesex and Monmouth Counties, are all within the New York City metropolitan area and thus also home to the major features of New York City English. With the exception of New York City's immediate neighbors like Jersey City and Newark, the New York metropolitan dialect as spoken in New Jersey is rhotic (or fully r-pronouncing), so that, whereas a Brooklynite might pronounce \\"over there\\" something like \\"ovah theah/deah\\" , an Elizabeth native might say \\"over there/dare\\" . The Atlas of North American English by William Labov et al. shows that the New York City short-a pattern has diffused to many r-pronouncing communities in northern New Jersey like Rutherford (Labov's birthplace) and North Plainfield. However, in these communities, the function word constraint is lost and the open syllable constraint is variable. Notable speakers The following is a list of notable lifelong native speakers of the rhotic New York City English of northeastern New Jersey: * Jon Bon Jovi * Danny DeVito * James Gandolfini * Ed Harris * William Labov * Ray Liotta * Joe Pesci * Zakk Wylde Frank Sinatra is an older example of a non- rhotic speaker from New Jersey.

It is the largest civil aircraft design organisation in the Asia Pacific region and is now headquartered in Adelaide. History AEA was established by Graham Swannell in Perth in 1978 in order fill the gap in airworthiness people authorised to approve the design of modifications and repairs in Western Australia. Originally starting with a few desks in a part-owned hangar at Jandakot Airport, the practice grew and moved to its current location at 1 Eagle Drive in 1990. In 1995, the company established its second office at Parafield Airport in Adelaide to widen its client base and better serve existing customers in the Adelaide region. In 2000, AEA joined with HSJ aviation and founded its third office at Sydney's Bankstown Airport. The company has since gone on to establish offices at Brisbane and Melbourne. In 2003, a Cessna 404 crashed at Jandakot Airport. On investigation, the ATSB found a replacement bush used in one of the engine fuel pumps and approved by AEA had seized, causing the engine to fail on takeoff. even though the Cessna 404 is designed to climb on one engine. The pilot had no option but to turn the plane around to attempt to make a safe landing on the runway, however the plane lost altitude and crashed into bushland. The pilot's quick actions saved the lives of 3 passengers. In order to recover costs and losses as a result of the accident, the families and employer of the victims are suing the Civil Aviation Safety Authority though AEA, as many of the other companies involved have since ceased trading. In 2010 AEA was bought by the Nova Defence Group to expand Nova's business into the commercial sector. Services AEA provides a variety of services to the general aviation industry, including the design and certification of aircraft modifications, repairs and testing of aircraft components, aircraft weight control (aircraft reweighs, trimsheets and loading systems) in accordance with Civil Aviation Order 100.7 (CAO 100.7), design and manufacture of aircraft components (such as cargo nets, replacement parts, survey installations, equipment frames, skis, etc.) under a Production Certificate and Civil Aviation Safety Regulation Part 21 (CASR 21), flammability testing to FAR/JAR25.853 and similar provisions, systems integration, flight and performance testing, aircraft design, aeronautical consultancy, civil/military platform design etc. Additionally Airline Technical Services was established as a wholly owned subsidiary of AEA to provide speciality services to the airline sector, and Swannell Racing now provides roll cage homologation services to the local racing industry.

The Explorer is a high-performance but rugged utility aircraft that can perform a wide variety of roles at a lower cost than other equivalent aircraft. It was developed to cope with the harsh Australian conditions and unprepared dirt strips but still deliver a 180 kn cruise, almost 1000 nmi range and economical performance. The aircraft utilises the latest in aerofoil design, a carbon fibre fuselage shell, a unique retractable undercarriage, flat cabin floor, and a newly devised construction method that minimises construction and assembly time. The aircraft was initially developed as the 350R but now incorporates the 500T turbine variant and the stretched 750T. AEA conceived, designed and developed the Explorer and started Explorer Aircraft Australia Pty Ltd to develop and market the family of aircraft. As the Explorer project grew, this role was passed onto Explorer Aircraft Inc. which is now located in Houston, Texas. To date, no funding has been received to continue the project to the development stage. *Eagle Aircraft 150B---- (1997) Single-engine two-seat civil utility aircraft with conventional tailplane and canard surfaces.

This approved data is usually contained within the aircraft's manuals (aircraft maintenance manual, structural repair manual, component maintenance manuals etc.) issued by the aircraft's manufacturer. However, sometimes there is damage to the aircraft that is outside the scope of these manuals or the operator wishes to modify the aircraft to help it perform a specific function (aerial firefighting, search and rescue) or alter the aircraft in some other way. To ensure that the aircraft continues to be airworthy (i.e. safe to fly), the repair or modification must be examined by an aeronautical engineer so that the many complex factors that affect aircraft flight, structures and systems can be assessed and the design change approved as airworthy. To do this the engineer assesses the design of the modification or repair against the airworthiness requirements for the aircraft and then must justify that the design meets these requirements through the use of analysis, testing and experience. If the design has been shown to meet the airworthiness requirements it may be approved under Civil Aviation Regulation 35 (CAR35) and is hence 'approved data', satisfying CAR42U. Provisions similar to CAR42U exist for how to and what to use when performing maintenance on an aircraft under CAR42V. If maintenance personnel wish to deviate from the aircraft's approved maintenance data, the materials and procedures need to be approved under CAR36A. AEA, along with other similar approved persons around Australia, is an approved design authority under CAR35 and CAR36 (for the approval of replacement components). AEA is also approved under the Papua New Guinea Civil Aviation Rules Part 146 which mirrors CAR35 for PNG registered (P2 registered) aircraft.

In European understanding, a cappella is also used to describe this form of singing. The word itself does not have a literal translation; it is derived from the Zulu verb -cathama, which means walking softly, or tread carefully. Isicathamiya contrasts with an earlier name for Zulu a cappella singing, mbube, meaning \\"lion\\". The change in name marks a transition in the style of the music: traditionally, music described as mbube is sung loudly and powerfully, while isicathamiya focuses more on achieving a harmonious blend between the voices. The name also refers to the style's tightly-choreographed dance moves that keep the singers on their toes. South African singing groups such as Ladysmith Black Mambazo demonstrate this style. Isicathamiya choirs are traditionally all male. Its roots reach back before the turn of the 20th century, when numerous men left the homelands in order to search for work in the cities. As many of the tribesmen became urbanized, the style was forgotten through much of the 20th century. Today, isicathamiya competitions in Johannesburg and Durban take place on Saturday nights, with up to 30 choirs performing from 8 o'clock at night to 8 o'clock the following morning.  Origin: traditional music, culture and spirituality  Although the style originated in the 20th century, specifically in the 1920s and 1930s, many academics argue it can be traced back to the end of the 19th century. They believe the roots of isicathamiya are found in the American minstrels and ragtime US vaudeville troupes that toured South Africa extensively in 1860. Isicathamiya would have merged from a combination of minstrel inspired songs and Zulu traditional music. Culturally and traditionally, isicathamiya is influenced by Zulu indigenous beliefs such as: belief in communalism which is expressed in the Zulu dictum, \\"umuntu, ngumuntu, ngabantu\\" , competition, strength and power associated with animals, reverence of the fireplace as a resource for food and warmth and, dreams for communicating with ancestors. The expression \\"umuntu, ngumuntu, ngabantu\\" which means \\"a person is a person because of other people\\", dominates Zulu social organization and is used as a tool to strengthen social harmony. In the Zulu community, competition is highly valued, especially with music, as it is seen as a social issue which is subject to competition. It is also perceived as a public platform in which people can establish a concept of identity in a community. Isicathamiya performers improve their image by winning competitions. In Zulu folklore, bulls are a common symbol of power and masculinity. Other wild animals such as snakes, crocodiles, tigers and lions are expressions of power relations and assertion of power in competitive isicathamiya competitions. Early isicathamiya groups were named after animals such as Empangeni Home Tigers and Brave Lion Singers. The fireplace is used metaphorically for the \\"cooking of songs\\" in isicathamiya stage performances. Emphasis is placed on the social organization based on the Zulu indigenous residence which took form in a circular bee-hive grass hut and at the center the head of surrounded by wives and children. The same formation takes places when isicathamiya songs were created with the leader in the center of the group. Dreams were an essential part of communicating with ancestors and formed part of a deeply rooted Zulu religious process. Some isicathamiya musicians claim some of their songs were created in the spiritual realm given to them by ancestors. University of Transkei, South Africa. A Paper Prepared for the African Arts Education Conference 2001 in South Africa. Joseph Shabalala of Ladysmith Black Mambazo explains he composes through dreams whereby for six months in the 1960s he was visited by voices in his dreams. These were spiritual elders who were singing in the isicathamiya style. He experienced a final examination where each of the twenty-four elders asked him a musical question and Shabalala achieved a perfect score.  Pre- and post-Ladysmith  In the 1980s, isicathamiya competitions were held in male hostels such as Glebeland, in Umlazi, one of townships in Durban. The groups were allowed to perform two songs adhering to the competition formation. Joseph Shabalala formed Ladysmith Black Mambazo and had the opportunity to work with Paul Simon on the Graceland album which included two tracks, \\"Homeless\\" and \\"Diamonds on Soles of her Shoes\\", which gained the group international recognition. The influence Joseph Shabalala had would change the context of isicathamiya in the late 20th century. Shabalala, Bongani Mthethwa and Paulos Msimango formed an organization called South African Traditional Music Association to help reclaim isicathamiya as a form of traditional music. Competitions were no longer in hostels but at the YMCA in Beatrice Street in the city center of Durban. The change in venues allowed for variation in the basic theme of the competitions. A competition for the best dressed man was implemented and on occasion for the best dressed woman. Furthermore, all who registered to compete now paid a voluntary amount to the event conveners and the contribution of each group would be announced as they entered the hall. Shabalala recognized the significance of his position on a global scale and would honor the community by conducting workshops for aspiring isicathamiya groups. Ladysmith Black Mambazo addressed pressing issues in South African in the 1990s such as HIV/AIDS, crime, violence and rape. The group would honor prominent members of South African society such as Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The level of interaction the group uses with the audience has grown vastly. Shabalala communicated with the audience beyond the musical and dance aspects. There was a shift in language usage, no longer restricted to Zulu, Shabalala would recite the words to \\"Homeless\\" to teach the audience. Shabalala continued to extend the boundaries of isicathamiya formalities by introducing Zulu maskanda (traditional musicians playing on European instruments, guitar and concertina) to open the Shabalala and his group.  Competition etiquette and formalities  The core of isicathamiya were the all-night choir competitions that took place during the weekends in Johannesburg and Durban. Competitions were held all night long due to the number of choirs that would sign up at the start of the evening. Each choir had a group leader who was responsible for signing up the group and paying an entrance fee which would contribute to the monetary prize at the end of the evening. = Dress code = The isicathamiya groups dressed in suits, with white gloves, sparkling white shirts, shiny black shoes and red socks. The leader dressed in opposing colours from the group. = Formation = Before the group enters the stage, there would be a moment of pre-performance prayer with the group gathered in a circle praying for spiritual guidance. This circle formation is reminiscent of the cattle enclosure of a Zulu village, a sacred space where the men could feel the presence of their ancestors and pray to them. The isicathamiya groups enter the stage for the competition and start with the group standing in a semicircle with the leader in front of the group. The group faces the judges and audience. Usually the first song is sung with the group standing still under the instruction of the leader in a makwaya (choral) setting. In the second half the group would incorporate leg dances or i-steps with their bodies synchronized to the rhythm of the song. At this point, the participants' girlfriends or wives would come up to support the group.  Style and composition  The leader of the group is often the founder and the composer. Often the migrant workers are not educated in music notation, however possess a different compositional technique. The founder of Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Joseph Shabalala, has said he composes when his body is sleeping and his spirit is at work. Typically the songs are written in response to what is troubling him at that moment. He strives to address troubling situations by composing a new song. These topics vary from love to politics and religious matters. The recurring theme is the social and political issues pertaining to life for black South Africans in KwaZulu-Natal, which burdened him greatly. Shabalala acknowledges the group used their music to educate the audiences they would encounter. Shabalala shares how he learned to compose in the isicathamiya style; as it was through dreams where he heard voices from spiritual elders. This is common amongst Zulu traditionalists and isicathamiya composers. Stylistically, isicathamiya is characterized by male voices performing a capella, with the SATB formation (one leading voice, a tenor, followed by one soprano (falsetto), one alto and the rest singing bass); however, in some cases there are recordings with banjo or piano as it was thought the instruments would appeal to the Black elite. A good isicathamiya performance includes call and response and multilayered vocal polyphony. Worldwide recognition The Western breakthrough for this style was Paul Simon's album Graceland (1986), which featured such tracks as \\"Homeless\\" and \\"Diamonds on the Soles of her Shoes\\", in which Simon was backed by the haunting voices of Ladysmith Black Mambazo. The group itself has since gone on to enjoy great popularity and recognition, including songs such as \\"Hello My Baby\\" and also recordings of Bob Dylan's \\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\\", the Rugby World Cup theme \\"The World in Union\\", and \\"Mbube\\" (a song composed in 1939 by Zulu worker Solomon Linda - The song, with additional lyrics, is also known as \\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\\") -- this last having given its name, meaning lion, to the genre. \\"Mambazo\\" members are also born again Christians and frequently demonstrate the close relationship between isicathamiya and gospel music in songs such as \\"Amazing Grace\\" and various Zulu hymns. \\"Mambazo\\" is the primary a cappella group from South Africa to garner worldwide attention; all other widely known South African musicians use some form of instrumental backing, though some groups such as the Mahotella Queens, who sing against an electric guitar \\"Mbaqanga\\" melody, occasionally sing without instrumental backing.

It was generally broadcast by cable systems on existing channels during the early morning hours when no regular programming was scheduled. In late 2002, ATN expanded with the purchase of the Product Information Network (PIN), a similar 24-hour cable infomercial network. However, after incidents where ATN/PIN paid programming (often unknown to the customer where it was coming from) was laid over several NBA and NHL playoff games which went into multiple overtimes in the graveyard slot on their networks, earning heavy customer complaints to providers about the arrangement (along with networks such as Animal Planet beginning to carry a 24/7 schedule which would be pre-empted by the practice), networks cracked down on the practice of their own programming being overlaid by their carriage partners, and began to enforce their networks in future contracts as being carried as-is full-time, severely affecting the ATN/PIN business model. After that ATN began to be carried individually as its own channel on most systems, but was either completely ignored or immediately deleted by cable customers on their channel map who saw no original programming on its channel. History ATN was founded by William Bernard in 1993 in Irvine, California. It had over 200 shareholders which included a venture capital firm Spectrum Equity Investors and the Hearst Family Fund. ATN bought out Spectrum Equity with a loan through Wells Fargo Foothill. This loan was in turn purchased by Gladstone Capital who is the current largest debt holder of ATN. In early 2012 ATN ceased operations as it could no longer generate sufficient revenues to pay its affiliates and satellite transponder obligations.

Published by Comico Comics, it lasted until 1996, including a series of specials and miniseries. Comico's publisher Andrew Rev purchased the Elementals property from Willingham in the 1990s. Fictional setting When a centuries-old sorcerer named Lord Saker built a machine called the Shadowspear to harness the supernatural powers of the world, he upset the natural order of the universe. In response, the four elements, unimaginably powerful spirits who together formed the foundation of existence, each chose an ordinary human who had been killed by their element, and resurrected him or her. They granted each control of that particular element, eternal youth, and the ability to heal from any wound (given sufficient time). These four were the Elementals, sent to oppose Saker. Unlike a usual group of superheroes and the rest of the characters in the fictional world, the Elmentals have been dead and their return is seen as something strange and their way of behaving as detached. The comic frequently portrayed together with the usual superhero topics adult problems such as abuse, death, fame, and alienation.  Characters  The team consisted of: *Morningstar, aka Jeanette Crane, a Los Angeles homicide detective who had burned to death while confronting a serial arsonist; she received various fire-related abilities, including pyrokinesis and an immunity to fire. *Vortex, aka Jeff Murphy, a Coast Guard pilot and Vietnam veteran who was asphyxiated in a helicopter crash; he received various air-related abilities, including flight and wind-blasts. *Fathom, aka Becky Golden, a flighty debutante who fell off a boat and drowned; she received various water- related abilities, as well as bright green skin and webbed fingers. She was also able to convert her body entirely into sentient water and shoot high- pressure streams. *Monolith, aka Tommy Czuchra, a brilliant if introverted teenaged boy who was crushed to death by a landslide; he received the ability to become an enormous super-strong stone/earth golem. Later, Tommy came to follow Saker's view that the supernatural beings were entitled to be in charge across earth, and he quit the Elementals and absorbed some of Saker's 'black' magic, to become one of his generals. Monolith was then re-embodied in a deceased insurance salesman (Donald Ridgeway), who neither wanted the power, nor ever understood fully how to use it or how to integrate with the other three Elementals. The four eventually defeated Saker and his minions, the Destroyers, a team of six: Shapeshifter, Annihilator, Chrysalis, Behemoth, Ratman (who later changed sides), and Electrocutioner. (The Destroyers and an early version of Saker known as Doctor Apocalypse originally appeared in Death Duel with the Destroyers and The Island of Dr. Apocalypse, two Willingham- written supplements for the superhero roleplaying game Villains and Vigilantes). Shadowspear, once released from Saker's control, formed a giant malevolent thunderstorm that circled the globe, occasionally transforming animals and corpses into monsters, thus keeping the Elementals busy for many years.

Tomos acquired a production license from Puch to produce moped models under the Tomos name in 1954. Tomos had since produced various goods for the Eastern European market, including motorcycles, mopeds, outboard motors and Citroën cars for the home market. Tomos mopeds were also produced in Epe, Netherlands since 1966. A very good-selling model was the Tomos \\"4L\\", produced from 1969 until 1980. The Dutch development team was responsible for the introduction of models like the Colibri, Targa and Revival. Tomos was the last remaining moped factory in the Netherlands, surviving at least 36 others since 1966. Tomos mopeds were sold in the U.S. from 1976 to 2014.Tomos USA: About Recently Tomos has also expanded to the United Kingdom. Tomos went bankrupt on January 3rd, 2019. History =Establishment= Tito at Tomos factory - 1959 After World War II, the Yugoslavian government sought to develop new industries. A company to produce two-wheelers was established in Sežana in July 1954, and soon a license agreement was signed with the Austrian company Steyr-Daimler-Puch. Puch had economical and robust motorcycles suitable for gravel roads and steep terrain characteristic of the region, and Puch also offered favorable licensing terms and conditions, as it doubted that the factory would ever be able to operate independently. The very next month, the name TOMOS (TOvarna MOtornih koles Sežana) appeared in the company documents for the first time. In October 1954, the Yugoslav government started to build the Tomos factory in Koper, the seaside industrial center of Slovenia, where it remains today. Production in temporary facilities started in 1955 and the factory was officially opened in 1959 by Josip Broz-Tito, the President of Yugoslavia. Tomos remained a state-owned enterprise as Slovenia, with its close ties to Austria and Italy, was first to gain its independence as the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia broke up in the early 90s. The company navigated these challenges successfully and in 1998 it was privatized and sold to Hidria, a private Slovenian corporation. =License production - motorcycles= Delivering Tomos motorcycles - 1960 Tomos first product was a motorcycle called TOMOS Puch SG 250. In 1955 they made 137 these motorcycles and assembled 124 RL 125 scooters and one hundred mopeds. The next year, mopeds accounted for the majority (1712) of the total number of assembled units, followed by motorcycles (615) and scooters. Simultaneously with the licensed production, Tomos started development of its own serial models. In the late 1950s, numerous variants of the moped Puch MS 50 were produced under the common name Colibri. The first Colibris were marked VS 50; later marks ranged from 01 to 013. Individual variants were adapted to foreign markets. In 1959, they produced more than 17,000 Colibris and signed a contract for the first major export to Sweden. Among the most successful Colibris was the type 12, while its version Colibri T 12, which was first presented in 1961 became the most popular moped in Slovenia. In early 1960s, market research showed that the interest in heavy motorcycles was decreasing all over Europe, and Tomos adapted its range of motorcycles and focused exclusively on the production of two-stroke 50 cm3 motorcycles. In order to ensure systematic and organized development, the Institute for Technical and Economic Research was established in 1962. The 1960s were the most productive period for Tomos. The Netherlands emerged as an important market in 1960. Tomos had so much success, that the only other plant outside of Slovenia was built in the Netherlands in 1966. Until 2009 the factory produced for the Dutch market along with research and development of new units. Tomos became the longest surviving moped factory in The Netherlands until production ended in 2009 due to the fact production- and labor costs are lower in Slovenia. The Netherlands remains the strongest market for Tomos today. =License production - automobiles= Beginning in 1959, Tomos began producing Citroën automobiles under license at the Koper plant, and selling them in the Yugoslav market. The Yugoslav automobile market was closed, so this joint venture with a local firm allowed Citroën to access the market. Cimos was owned at 50% by Citroën and 50% by the Yugoslavian government. The Yugoslavian government was short of hard currency and often used the barter system, paying Citroën with cereals and raw materials, which Citroën resold in Western Europe. In 1972 Tomos, Iskra, and Citroën formed a new company, Cimos (Citroën, Iskra, Tomos), for the manufacture and export of cars and car sub-assemblies. Iskra was a manufacturer of automotive components, especially generators. Locally made vehicles included the Ami 8, 2CV6, GS, and Citroën Dyane (called the Diana). Cimos also sold imported vehicles, the CX and Méhari. The Cimos GS can be distinguished by round headlights, developed for the US market but never used there. In 1981, Cimos began to produce a specific model, the Dak, an enclosed cargo utility vehicle, very similar to the fourgonette. The basis was an unstretched Diana chassis, unlike the French Acadiane which was based on the longer chassis of the 2CV AK400. Cimos also prepared a pick up truck from the same basis, the Geri. Sales were 2,200 Dak and 900 Geri. Citroën did not allow Cimos to export these utility vehicles, and this rift led to the French firm ceasing delivery of parts to its Yugoslav partner by 1985, dooming the joint venture. =Own- design motorcycles - automatics= Tomos APN-4MS At the brink of the 1970s, Tomos started preparing for the production of \\"automatics\\" of its own design, as the market was increasingly interested in such type of motorcycles and the components produced abroad were more and more expensive. Therefore, they produced Automatic A1 with improved single gear engine which was built into the framework structure of the previous Automatic. Its successor, Automatic A3 was made in 1973 when they launched the new, modernized production line with automated machines for framework welding. This was the beginning of the production of new frameworks in Tomos which were visually different from the licensed Puch's motorcycle frameworks. As the standard of living increased significantly in the 1970s, the number of young buyers also grew. These were attracted by automatics and mopeds of the type A-OS, A-ON and APN. The latter type was particularly popular among the young, which is why Tomos started producing special variants of these mopeds with raised handlebars, seat with back support, side bags and a lot of chrome. In the 1970s, several new models of Colibris were sent to the markets. Colibris T-03, T-12 and T-13 had Puch's motors while Colibri 14V had inbuilt motor produced by Tomos, according to its own design. After 1973 all motorcycles and bicycles with motors attached produced by Tomos were equipped with in-house manufactured engines. In this period, they also developed Colibri 15 with a stronger motor which could almost compete with motorcycles. =Oil crisis and modernization = In the 1960s and 1970s Tomos' developmental activity reached its peak in terms of the volume of patents and prototypes. However, during the 1979–1980 time frame Tomos was faced with restrictive environmental standards for the first time. In the 1980s, Tomos modernized the entire range of two-wheelers and concentrated on reducing the level of noise and harmful emissions, and increased the rider's comfort along with a more modern look. 1976 saw the debut of Tomos in the United States of America through US distributors. There were many European manufacturers who had mopeds in the USA market. The market hit its zenith in 1979 as gas prices were at a premium and shortages were common due to a change in OPEC policy. People started to rethink their consumption of gasoline and looked to more efficient means. The moped surfaced as that alternative reaching over 100 mpg. The entire range of two-wheelers was again competing globally after the modernization in the 1980s. The first product from this new range was APN 6 which was introduced in 1981. In 1985, TOMOS launched a new generation of motorcycles, the BT 50 with cast wheels and turn signals. Based on this model, TOMOS ATX 50 C was produced later for off- road use. =1990s= In the 1990s Tomos came out with the Sprint, Targa, and Targa LX. The later two were eventually changed to TOMOS ST and TOMOS LX. A new engine was introduced called the A35. Tomos USA was started in Spartanburg, South Carolina, in a new office and warehouse complex of over . =2000s= In 2006 the A35 engine was replaced with the A55. This new engine featured lighter weight rotating parts as well as better power output. This engine is currently used on all 50cc applications. In 2004, Slovenia was admitted into the European Union and a contract was signed with Germany's BMW to produce component parts for some of its units, that production continues today from Koper. New models introduced during these years such as the MC Off- Road Line, Revival, Streetmate, and Arrow. Complementing these new units was a new family engine called the A55 in 2006, meeting stricter EPA emission standards. =2010s= Tomos returned to the US market with two new mopeds, the redesigned Sprint with classic details, and the all-new Racing TT, but went bankrupt in 2019.

The news caused a stir for several days in the Tomos moped community. However, a problem in translation had caused a misunderstanding, and the company later confirmed it was not ending sales, but instead outsourcing parts of the production.

The type and only species, S. inequalis, was named by Charles Mortram Sternberg in 1932, based on a foot, fragments of a hand, and some caudal vertebrae from the Late Cretaceous of Alberta. S. inequalis was reassigned in 1987 by Phil Currie to the genus Troodon, which was reverted by the recognition of Stenonychosaurus as a separate genus from the possibly dubious Troodon in 2017 by Evans et al. and also later in the same year by Van der Reest and Currie.  Description  Size compared to a human Stenonychosaurus was a small dinosaur, up to in height, in length,Holtz, Thomas R. Jr. (2008) Dinosaurs: The Most Complete, Up-to-Date Encyclopedia for Dinosaur Lovers of All Ages Supplementary Information and to in mass. The largest specimens are comparable in size to Deinonychus and Unenlagia. They had very long, slender hind limbs, suggesting that these animals were able to run quickly. They had large, retractable sickle-shaped claws on the second toes, which were raised off the ground when running. Their eyes were very large (perhaps suggesting a partially nocturnal lifestyle), and slightly forward facing, giving Stenonychosaurus some degree of depth perception. =Brain and inner ear= Restoration Stenonychosaurus had one of the largest known brains of any dinosaur, relative to its body mass (comparable to modern birds). This has been calculated as a cerebrum-to-brain- volume ratio 31.5% to 63% of the way from a non-avian reptile proportion to a truly avian one. Additionally, it had bony cristae supporting their tympanic membranes that were ossified at least in their top and bottom regions. The rest of the cristae were either cartilaginous or too delicate to be preserved. The metotic strut of Stenonychosaurus was enlarged from side-to-side, similar to Dromaeosaurus and primitive birds like Archaeopteryx and Hesperornis.Larsson, H.C.E. 2001. Endocranial anatomy of Carcharodontosaurus saharicus (Theropoda: Allosauroidea) and its implications for theropod brain evolution. pp. 19–33. In: Mesozoic Vertebrate Life. Ed.s Tanke, D. H., Carpenter, K., Skrepnick, M. W. Indiana University Press. = Specimens and distinguishing features = The holotype of Stenonychosaurus inequalis, CMN 8539, is a partial skeleton consisting of six caudal vertebrae, hand bones, the distal end of the left tibia and astragalus, and a complete left foot. A couple of cranial specimens were also referred to the genus: UALVP 52611 (a nearly complete skull roof) and TMP 1986.036.0457 (a partial braincase). Many Dinosaur Park troodontid specimens once referred to Troodon have recently been referred to Stenonychosaurus and Latenivenatrix. The specimens now referred to Stenonychosaurus include several frontals (UALVP 5282, TMP 1986.078.0040, TMP 1988.050.0088, TMP 1991.036.0690), a partial dentary (TMP 1982.019.0151), and the distal portion of a left metatarsal III (TMP 1998.068.0090). This genus can be distinguished from other troodontids (particularly its close relative Latenivenatrix) due to the following features: * A metatarsal III with a convex anterior surface. * An L-shaped frontal with a flat, anteroposteriorly rippled nasofrontal contact. History of discovery The first specimens currently assigned to Troodon that were not teeth were both found by Sternberg in 1928, in the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta. The first was named Stenonychosaurus inequalis by Sternberg in 1932, based on a foot, fragments of a hand, and some tail vertebrae. A remarkable feature of these remains was the enlarged claw on the second toe, which is now recognized as characteristic of early paravians. Sternberg initially classified Stenonychosaurus as a member of the family Coeluridae. The second, a partial lower jaw bone, was described by Gilmore (1932) as a new species of lizard which he named Polyodontosaurus grandis. Later, in 1951, Sternberg recognized P. grandis as a possible synonym of Troodon, and speculated that since Stenonychosaurus had a \\"very peculiar pes\\" and Troodon \\"equally unusual teeth\\", they may be closely related. Unfortunately, no comparable specimens were available at that time to test the idea. Natural History Museum, London A more complete skeleton of Stenonychosaurus was described by Dale Russell in 1969 from the Dinosaur Park Formation, which eventually formed the scientific foundation for a famous life-sized sculpture of Stenonychosaurus accompanied by its fictional, humanoid descendant, the \\"dinosauroid\\". Stenonychosaurus became a well-known theropod in the 1980s, when the feet and braincase were described in more detail. Along with Saurornithoides, it formed the family Saurornithoididae. Based on differences in tooth structure, and the extremely fragmentary nature of the original Troodon formosus specimens, saurornithoidids were thought to be close relatives while Troodon was considered a dubious possible relative of the family. Phil Currie, reviewing the pertinent specimens in 1987, showed that supposed differences in tooth and jaw structure among troodontids and saurornithoidids were based on age and position of the tooth in the jaw, rather than a difference in species. He reclassified Stenonychosaurus inequalis as well as Polyodontosaurus grandis and Pectinodon bakkeri as junior synonyms of Troodon formosus. Currie also made Saurornithoididae a junior synonym of Troodontidae. In 1988, Gregory S. Paul went farther and included Saurornithoides mongoliensis in the genus Troodon as T. mongoliensis, but this reclassification, along with many other unilateral synonymizations of well known genera, was not adopted by other researchers. Currie's classification of all North American troodontid material in the single species Troodon formosus became widely adopted by other paleontologists, and all of the specimens once called Stenonychosaurus were referred to as Troodon in the scientific literature through the early 21st century. However, the concept that all Late Cretaceous North American troodontids belong to one species began to be questioned soon after Currie's 1987 paper was published, including by Currie himself. Currie and colleagues (1990) noted that, while they believed the Judith River troodontids were all T. formosus, troodontid fossils from other formations, such as the Hell Creek Formation and Lance Formation, might belong to different species. In 1991, George Olshevsky assigned the Lance formation fossils, which had first been named Pectinodon bakkeri but later synonymized with Troodon formosus to the species Troodon bakkeri, and several other researchers (including Currie) reverted to keeping the Dinosaur Park Formation fossils separate as Troodon inequalis.Currie, P. (2005). \\"Theropods, including birds.\\" in Currie and Koppelhus (eds). Dinosaur Provincial Park, a spectacular ecosystem revealed, Part Two, Flora and Fauna from the park. Indiana University Press, Bloomington. Pp 367–397. In 2011, Zanno and colleagues reviewed the convoluted history of troodontid classification in Late Cretaceous North America. They followed Longrich (2008) in treating Pectinodon bakkeri as a valid genus, and noted that it is likely the numerous Late Cretaceous specimens currently assigned to Troodon formosus almost certainly represent numerous new species, but that a more thorough review of the specimens is required. Because the holotype of T. formosus is a single tooth, this may render Troodon a nomen dubium. In 2017, Evans and colleagues, building on the work of Zanno and others, confirmed the currently undiagnostic nature of the holotype of Troodon formosus and suggested that Stenonychosaurus be used for troodontid skeletal material from the Dinosaur Park Formation. Later in 2017, Van der Reest and Currie found Stenonychosaurus to be a valid genus, but reassigned much of the known material to the new genus Latenivenatrix. =The \\"Dinosauroid\\"= A model of the hypothetical Dinosauroid, Dinosaur Museum, Dorchester In 1982, Dale A. Russell, then curator of vertebrate fossils at the National Museum of Canada in Ottawa, conjectured a possible evolutionary path for Stenonychosaurus, if it had not perished in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, suggesting that it could have evolved into intelligent beings similar in body plan to humans. Over geologic time, Russell noted that there had been a steady increase in the encephalization quotient or EQ (the relative brain weight when compared to other species with the same body weight) among the dinosaurs. Russell had discovered the first Troodontid skull, and noted that, while its EQ was low compared to humans, it was six times higher than that of other dinosaurs. Russell suggested that if the trend in Stenonychosaurus evolution had continued to the present, its brain case could by now measure 1,100 cm3, comparable to that of a human. Troodontids had semi-manipulative fingers, able to grasp and hold objects to a certain degree, and binocular vision. Russell proposed that his \\"Dinosauroid\\", like members of the troodontid family, would have had large eyes and three fingers on each hand, one of which would have been partially opposed. Russell also speculated that the \\"Dinosauroid\\" would have had a toothless beak. As with most modern reptiles (and birds), he conceived of its genitalia as internal. Russell speculated that it would have required a navel, as a placenta aids the development of a large brain case. However, it would not have possessed mammary glands, and would have fed its young, as some birds do, on regurgitated food. He speculated that its language would have sounded somewhat like bird song.Naish, D. (2006). Dinosauroids Revisited Darren Naish: Tetrapod Zoology, April 23, 2011. However, Russell's thought experiment has been met with criticism from other paleontologists since the 1980s, many of whom point out that his Dinosauroid is overly anthropomorphic. Gregory S. Paul (1988) and Thomas R. Holtz, Jr., consider it \\"suspiciously human\\" and Darren Naish has argued that a large-brained, highly intelligent troodontid would retain a more standard theropod body plan, with a horizontal posture and long tail, and would probably manipulate objects with the snout and feet in the manner of a bird, rather than with human-like \\"hands\\".  Paleobiology  Restoration of two individuals playing in snow Stenonychosaurus are thought to have been predators, a view supported by its sickle claw on the foot and apparently good binocular vision. Stenonychosaurus teeth, however, are different from most other theropods. One comparative study of the feeding apparatus suggests that Stenonychosaurus could have been an omnivore.Holtz, Thomas R., Brinkman, Daniel L., Chandler, Chistine L. (1998) Denticle Morphometrics and a Possibly Omnivorous Feeding Habit for the Theropod Dinosaur Troodon. Gaia number 15. December 1998. pp. 159–166. The jaws met in a broad, U-shaped symphysis similar to that of an iguana, a lizard species adapted to a plant-eating lifestyle. Additionally, the teeth of Stenonychosaurus bore large serrations, each of which is called a denticle. There are pits at the intersections of the denticles, and the points of the denticles point towards the tip, or apex, of each tooth. The teeth show wear facets on their sides. Holtz (1998) also noted that characteristics used to support a predatory habit for Stenonychosaurus – the grasping hands, large brain and stereoscopic vision, are all characteristics shared with the herbivorous/omnivorous primates and omnivorous Procyon (raccoon). Age determination studies performed on the Two Medicine troodont using growth ring counts suggest that this dinosaur reached its adult size probably in 3–5 years.Varricchio, D. V. (1993). Bone microstructure of the Upper Cretaceous theropod dinosaur Troodon formosus. J. Vertebr. Paleontol. 13, 99–104. A partial skeleton has been discovered with preserved puncture marks.Jacobsen, A.R. 2001. Tooth-marked small theropod bone: An extremely rare trace. p. 58-63. In: Mesozoic Vertebrate Life. Ed.s Tanke, D. H., Carpenter, K., Skrepnick, M. W. Indiana University Press. = Reproduction = Eggs partly encased in rock, Burke Museum Dinosaur eggs and nests were discovered by John R. Horner in 1983 in the Two Medicine Formation of Montana. Varriccho et al. (2002) have described eight of these nests found to date. These are all in the collection of the Museum of the Rockies and their accession numbers are MOR 246, 299, 393, 675, 676, 750, 963, 1139. Horner (1984) found isolated bones and partial skeletons of the hypsilophodont Orodromeus very near the nests in the same horizon and described the eggs as those of Orodromeus.Horner, John R. (1984) \\"The nesting behavior of dinosaurs\\". \\"Scientific American\\", 250:130–137. Horner and Weishampel (1996) reexamined the embryos preserved in the eggs and determined that they were those of Troodon, not Orodromeus.Horner, John R., Weishampel, David B. (1996) \\"A comparative embryological study of two ornithischian dinosaurs – a correction.\\" \\"Nature\\" 383:256–257. Varricchio et al. (1997) made this determination with even more certainty when they described a partial skeleton of an adult Troodon (MOR 748) in contact with a clutch of at least five eggs (MOR 750), probably in a brooding position. Van der Reest and Currie considered it possible that the Two Medicine troodont was the same species as Stenonychosaurus. Varricchio et al. (1997) described the exact structure of the nests. They were built from sediments, they were dish shaped, about 100 cm in internal diameter, and with a pronounced raised rim encircling the eggs. The more complete nests had between 16 (minimum number in MOR 246) and 24 (MOR 963) eggs. The eggs are shaped like elongated teardrops, with the more tapered ends pointed downwards and imbedded about halfway in the sediment. The eggs are pitched at an angle so that, on average, the upper half is closer to the center of the nest. There is no evidence that plant matter was present in the nest. Clutch of eggs, Museum of the Rockies Varricchio et al.(1997) were able to extract enough evidence from the nests to infer several characteristics of troodont reproductive biology. The results are that they appear to have had a type of reproduction that is intermediate between crocodiles and birds, as phylogeny would predict. The eggs are statistically grouped in pairs, which suggests that the animal had two functional oviducts, like crocodiles, rather than one, as in birds. Crocodiles lay many eggs that are small proportional to adult body size. Birds lay fewer, larger, eggs. The Two Medicine troodont was intermediate, laying an egg of about 0.5 kg for a 50 kg adult. This is 10 times larger than reptiles of the same mass, but two troodont eggs are roughly equivalent to the 1.1 kg egg predicted for a 50 kg bird. Varricchio et al. also found evidence for iterative laying, where the adult might lay a pair of eggs every one or two days, and then ensured simultaneous hatching by delaying brooding until all eggs were laid. MOR 363 was found with 22 empty (hatched) eggs, and the embryos found in the eggs of MOR 246 were in very similar states of development, implying that all of the young hatched approximately simultaneously. The embryos had an advanced degree of skeletal development and empty eggs were relatively uncrushed, implying that hatchlings were precocial. The authors estimated 45 to 65 total days of adult nest attendance for laying, brooding, and hatching. Varricchio et al. (2008) examined the bone histology of Two Medicine troodont specimen MOR 748 and found that it lacked the bone resorption patterns that would indicate it was an egg-laying female. They also measured the ratio of the total volume of eggs in clutches to the body mass of the adult. They graphed correlations between this ratio and the type of parenting strategies used by extant birds and crocodiles and found that the ratio in the troodont was consistent with that in birds where only the adult male broods the eggs. From this they concluded that troodont females likely did not brood eggs, that the males did, and this may be a character shared between maniraptoran dinosaurs and basal birds. However, a later analysis of avian clutch mass found that the type of parental care cannot be determined using conventional allometric methods such as the one used by Varricchio et al. =Paleoecology= Stenonychosaurus inequalis is known from the Dinosaur Park Formation of southern Alberta, Canada, which at the time was a warm coastal floodplain covered by temperate forests. Apex predators included tyrannosaurids such as Daspletosaurus and Gorgosaurus. Herbivores included hadrosaurids such as Lambeosaurus, Corythosaurus, and Prosaurolophus; ceratopsids such as Styracosaurus, Centrosaurus, and Chasmosaurus; ankylosaurs such as Scolosaurus, Euoplocephalus, and Edmontonia; and pachycephalosaurs such as Stegoceras and Foraminacephale.

Biography Born David Rozenson in Smarhon’ (now in Grodno Region, Belarus), Vilnius in the Russian Empire, Raziel immigrated with his family in 1914 at the age of three to Ottoman Palestine, when his father was invited to teach at Tachkemoni, a religious school in Tel Aviv. During World War I, the family was exiled to Egypt by the Turks due to their Russian citizenship. They returned to Mandatory Palestine in 1923. In 1928, Raziel completed studies at the Tachkemoni high school, and studied for several years at Yeshivat Mercaz HaRav in Jerusalem. He was regular study partner with Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook, son and ideological successor to the Rosh Yeshiva and Chief Rabbi of Israel, Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook. When the 1929 Hebron massacre broke out, he joined the Haganah in Jerusalem, where he was studying philosophy and mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. When the Irgun was established, he was one of its first members, and displayed outstanding military skills. In 1937 he was appointed by the Irgun as the first Commander of Jerusalem District and a year later, Commander in Chief of the Irgun. His term as leader was especially marked by violence against Arabs, including a sequence of marketplace bombings. Most of those attacks were in response to Arab violence. Raziel worked with Avraham Stern and Efraim Ilin. On 17 May 1941 he was sent, with three of his comrades, including Ya'akov Meridor, to Iraq on behalf of the British army to help defeat the Rashid Ali al-Gaylani pro-Axis revolt in the Anglo-Iraqi War. On 20 May a Luftwaffe plane strafed the car in which he was travelling near Habbaniyah, killing him and a British officer. Meridor returned to Palestine and took over command of the Irgun. In 1955 his remains were exhumed and transferred to Cyprus, and again in 1961 to Jerusalem's Mount Herzl military cemetery. His sister, Esther Raziel-Naor, was later a member of the Knesset for Herut, the party founded by Irgun leader Menachem Begin. Commemoration Ramat Raziel, a moshav in the Judaean Mountains, is named after Raziel, as well as many streets in Israel bearing his name in commemoration. The Israel postal service issued a stamp in his honor. There is a high-school in Herzliya named after him.  References  * Daniel Levine: The Birth of the Irgun Zvai Leumi.

Although termed an armored cavalry regiment, it is being re-organized as a multi-component heavy brigade combat team. The regiment has served in the Philippine–American War, World War II, the Vietnam War, Cold War, Operation Desert Storm (scout platoons), and Operation Iraqi Freedom (Iraq War). The 11th ACR serves as the Opposing Force (OPFOR) for the Army and Marine task forces, and foreign military forces that train at the National Training Center. The OPFOR trained U.S. Army forces in mechanized desert warfare following a Soviet-era style threat until June 2002, when the OPFOR and the 11th ACR changed to portraying an urban/asymmetrical warfare style of combat U.S. soldiers are facing in operations abroad. From June to December 2003, members of the 11th ACR deployed to Afghanistan, where they helped to develop and train the armor and mechanized infantry battalions of the Afghan National Army. These specialized units would defend the Afghan capital during the country's constitutional convention. In January 2004, the 11th ACR deployed to Iraq. The 11th ACR was not reorganized under the U.S. Army Combat Arms Regimental System, but has been reorganized under the U.S. Army Regimental System. History =11th Cavalry Regiment= The regiment was constituted on 2 February 1901 in the Regular Army as the 11th Cavalry Regiment, and was organized on 11 March 1901 at Fort Myer, Virginia. The regiment participated in the 1916 Pancho Villa Expedition under the command of William Jones Nicholson. For an operational history of the regiment, see the separate squadron histories below. At the start of World War II, the 11th Cavalry was stationed at the Presidio of Monterey in California. They moved to Fort Ord in stages from 16 to 27 January 1940 and again to Camp Clayton on 15 April to 15 May 1940 for temporary training. They participated in maneuvers at Fort Lewis in Washington from 4 to 29 August 1940, and returned to the Presidio of Monterey on 31 August 1940, where they were detached from the 2nd Cavalry Division, and resumed its status as a separate regiment. They next moved to Camp Seeley in California on 7 November 1941, and again to Live Oaks, California on 24 July 1941; they then returned to Camp Seeley on 17 September 1941, and to Camp Lockett on 10 December 1941. They were next assigned to the United States Army Armored Force on 12 June 1942, and relocated to Fort Benning in Georgia on 10 July 1942, where they prepared to be inactivated and reorganized. The 11th Cavalry Regiment was deactivated on 15 July 1942 at Fort Benning, Georgia; personnel and equipment concurrently transferred to the 11th Armored Regiment, with concurrent development of the 11th Cavalry Group, and the 11th Tank Group. The remainder of 11th Cavalry was disbanded on 26 October 1944. =11th Armored Regiment= 11th Armored Regiment was constituted on 11 July 1942 in the national army, assigned to the 10th Armored Division, and organized at Fort Benning on 15 July 1942 from the personnel and equipment of the 11th Cavalry Regiment. The motto on the unit insignia is \\"Allons\\", which means \\"Let's Go\\" in French. The regiment moved to Murfreesboro, Tennessee on 22 June 1943, and then Fort Gordon on 5 September 1943. 11th Armored Regiment was broken up on 20 September 1943, and its elements were distributed as follows: * HHC-11th Armored Regiment, and 1st and 2nd Battalions were reorganized as the 11th Tank Battalion in the 10th AD. * 3rd Battalion, 11th Armored Regiment was reorganized and redesignated as the 712th Tank Battalion, and relieved from assignment to the 10th AD. 712th Tank Battalion was inactivated at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey on 27 October 1945, and redesignated the 525th Medium Tank Battalion on 1 September 1948. It was activated on 10 September 1948 at Fort Lewis, Washington. 525th Medium Tank Battalion was redesignated as 95th Tank Battalion on 4 February 1950, assigned to 7th Armored Division, and activated at Camp Roberts, California on 24 November 1950, and inactivated there on 15 November 1953. Reconnaissance Company was reorganized and redesignated as Troop E, 90th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron, which maintained a separate history thereafter. Maintenance and Service Companies were disbanded. =11th Tank Battalion= As part of the 10th Armored Division, 11th Tank Battalion shipped out from the New York Port of Embarkation on 13 September 1944, and landed in France on 23 September 1944. The battalion participated in the Rhineland, Ardennes-Alsace, and Central Europe Campaigns, and was located at Schongau, Bavaria, Germany on 14 August 1945. The battalion returned to the Hampton Roads Port of Embarkation on 13 October 1945, was inactivated at Camp Patrick Henry, Virginia on the same day, and was relieved from assignment to the 10th AD. =11th Cavalry Group (Mechanized)= HHT, 11th Cavalry Regiment was redesignated on 19 April 1943 as HHT, 11th Cavalry Group, and was activated at Camp Anza, California on 5 May 1943. At that time, the 36th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron and 44th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron were attached. The group was then moved to Fort Bragg on 31 January 1944, and again to Atlantic Beach, Florida on 15 March 1944 for amphibious training. They then moved to Camp Gordon on 1 June 1944 and then departed the New York Port of Embarkation on 29 September 1944, and arrived in England on 10 October 1944, and landed in France on 26 November 1944. They moved to the Netherlands on 8 December 1944, went into the line in Germany on 12 December 1944, and protected the Roer River sector; they recrossed into the Netherlands on 3 February 1945, and re-entered Germany on 27 February 1945 on the left flank of the U.S. 84th Infantry Division. The group then held a defensive line along the Rhine River near Düsseldorf on 12 March 1945 under the XIII Corps, and crossed the Rhine at Wesel on 1 April 1945, screened XIII Corps' northern flank, and saw action during the Battle of Munster and the seizure of the Ricklingen Bridge over the Leine River. During the campaign in northwestern Europe, Troop B of the 44th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron served as a mechanized escort and security force for the headquarters of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, supreme commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces. In August 1945, 11th Cavalry Group headquarters was located at Gross Ilsede, Germany. HHT, 11th Cavalry Group was converted and reorganized as HHT, 11th Constabulary Regiment on 1 May 1946. During this period, the regimental headquarters was located in Regensburg. As a constabulary unit, the 11th Constabulary Regiment patrolled occupied Germany and performed law enforcement and keeping of the public order missions. HHT 11th Constabulary Regiment was further reorganized and redesignated as HHC, 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment on 30 November 1948. =11th Tank Group= HHT, 11th Tank Group was constituted on 19 July 1943 in the National Army. It was activated at Camp Campbell, Kentucky on 28 July 1943 as a separate group. It was reorganized and redesignated as HHC, 11th Armored Group on 5 December 1943. During the war, armored groups such as the 11th were used as administrative headquarters for the numerous independent tank battalions fielded in the European Theater of Operations. HHC, 11th Armored Group was converted and redesignated HHT, 1st Constabulary Regiment on 1 May 1946. HHT, 1st Constabulary Regiment was inactivated on 20 September 1947 in Germany. =11th Armored Cavalry Regiment= Reassembly and organizing of 11th ACR was completed on 30 November 1948 by reconstitution and reorganization of elements of the 11th Cavalry Regiment and HHT, 1st Constabulary Regiment. HHT-1st Constabulary Regiment was converted, redesignated and consolidated into 11th ACR as HHT, 3rd Battalion, 11th ACR on 30 November 1948. 11th Tank Battalion was consolidated into 11th ACR on 8 January 1951. 95th Tank Battalion was consolidated into 3rd Battalion, 11th ACR on 1 October 1958. Air Troop inactivated 20 March 1972 in Vietnam; 2d Squadron inactivated 6 April 1972 in Vietnam; Air Troop and 2d Squadron activated 17 May 1972 in Germany. Around 1984, Air Troop was enlarged and became the 4th Squadron (Thunderhorse), also known as the Combat Aviation Squadron. Placed 17 June 1986 under the United States Army Regimental System Inactivated 15 October 1993 – 15 March 1994 in Germany Activated 16 October 1994 (less 3d and 4th Squadrons; the Air Defense Artillery Battery; and the Howitzer Batteries, 1st and 2d Squadrons) at Fort Irwin, California Germany 1957–64 As part of the Gyroscope unit rotations, the 11th ACR was sent to Germany in March 1957 for another round at the border surveillance mission along the Iron Curtain, replacing the 6th Armored Cavalry Regiment. Regimental headquarters and 1st Squadron were located in Straubing while the 2nd Squadron was stationed in Landshut and the 3rd Squadron in Regensburg.www.usarmygermany.com The regiment's border surveillance mission was along the German-Czech frontier. In 1964, the 11th ACR returned to the United States and would be bound for Vietnam within two years. Vietnam 1966–72 Propaganda leaflets depicting a Blackhorse tank urging the defection of Viet Cong and North Vietnamese to the side of the South Home now for the regiment was Fort Meade, Maryland where the \\"Blackhorse\\" engaged in operational training and support activities like participation in the Presidential Inauguration and support for ROTC summer training. With the war in Vietnam escalating, the Blackhorse Regiment was alerted for assignment to Southeast Asia on 11 March 1966. The regiment began specialized training for combat in a counterinsurgency environment. Modifications were made to the organization and equipment (MTOE) with emphasis on the use of modified M113 armored personnel carriers (APCs). Two M-60 machineguns with protective gun shield were mounted at the port and starboard rear of the vehicle, and a combination circular & flat frontal gun shield(s) were added around the .50 caliber machine gun located at the commander's hatch. This combination produced a M-113 Armored Cavalry Assault Vehicle, or, in Vietnam more simply referred to as an ACAV by GIs, a name coined by 11th Armored Cavalrymen.Starry p. 73 The regiment's modifications emphasized the use of ACAVs instead of the Patton medium tank and completely replaced the M-114 found in reconnaissance platoons, which may have existed in European and CONUS areas of operation. The M114 had been deployed to Vietnam in 1962, but withdrawn in 1964 due to its unsatisfactory, and often disastrous performance.Starry p. 38 Throughout the war, the tank companies, with their M48 Patton tanks, remained the same in each squadron. In 1968, Colonel George S. Patton IV (son of World War II General Patton), commander of the 11th ACR in South Vietnam recommended to General Creighton Abrams that one squadron from a division and the other from theater command be issued the army's new aluminum tanks (Sheridans) for combat testing. General Abrams concurred, and in January 1969, M551 Sheridans were issued to the 3rd Squadron 4th Armored Cavalry and the 1st Squadron 11th Armored Cavalry.Starry p. 143 Due to differences between the organization of regimental cavalry squadrons and divisional cavalry squadrons, in 1st Sqdn 11th ACR, the Sheridans were issued to the ACAV troops, replacing three M113 ACAVs in each platoon (the squadron's one tank company remained intact); in 3rd Squadron, 4th Cavalry, the Sheridans replaced M48A3 tanks throughout. Although the 3/4 Cavalry met near disaster with their Sheridans within a month of receiving them (one destroyed by a mine), the 1/11 Cavalry had just the reverse in luck, killing nearly 80 enemy soldiers during an engagement on 23 February 1969.Starry p. 144 All things considered, the army was satisfied with the Sheridan tank, and by the end of 1970 alone, well over 200 M551s would be in South Vietnam. While nearly all US armored cavalry squadrons were equipped with the M551 by 1970, the 11th ACR tank companies, as well as the three US Army armor battalions (1/69th, 2/34th, and 1/77th Armor) in country, all retained their 90mm gun M48A3 Patton tanks. Only the M48s, as well as the Australian Centurions, and ARVN M41 Walker Bulldog light tanks could effectively and safely conduct \\"thunder runs\\"; the firing of all tank weapons while driving down the highway or road. While ACAVs did not have a cannon, the Sheridan's high recoil from its 152mm main gun negated it from firing excessive broadsides while moving down a road. Thus the most favored tanks for clearing highways with \\"thunder runs\\"Starry p. 80 on a daily basis, most often fell to the M48s of the 11th ACR and accompanying armor units. Engineers supported by a M551 Sheridan Tank from the Blackhorse Regiment clear mines in Cambodia. =Arrival in country= The Blackhorse Regiment arrived in Vũng Tàu, South Vietnam on 7 September 1966 and was commanded by Col. William W. Cobb. Operation Hickory (7–15 October 1966) produced the first enemy casualties inflicted by the 3rd Squadron and elements of the 919th Engineer Company in the vicinity of Phu Hoa. =Blackhorse Base Camp= \\"Atlanta\\" was the code name for the establishment of Blackhorse Base Camp—the new home of the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in Vietnam. Blackhorse Base Camp was located approximately south of the village of Xuan Loc on Route 2 and approximately southeast of the village of Long Goia. Saigon is approximately to the west along Rt. 1. The operation began on 20 October and concluded on 3 November 1966. Stanton's Vietnam Order Of Battle lists the following locations for the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment's headquarters in Vietnam: *Bien Hoa September 1966 – November 1966 *Long Binh December 1966 – February 1967 *Blackhorse Base Camp/Xuan Loc March 1967 – January 1969 *Lai Khê February 1969 *Long Giao March 1969 – September 1969 *Bien Hoa October 1969 – June 1970 *Di An July 1970 – March 1971 =Operation Cedar Falls= From January until 18 May 1967, the regiment conducted three major search and destroy operations. These operations would later be known as reconnaissance in force (RIF) operations. The first of these operations commence on 8 January 1967 and was known as \\"Operation Cedar Falls\\". It continued until 24 January 1967. The 1st and 2nd Squadrons operated in the infamous \\"Iron Triangle\\" region near Ben Cat employing search and destroy tactics, screening and blocking, and security in attacks on successive objectives. =Operation Junction City= Operation Junction City I and II involved the 1st and 3rd Squadrons. It began on 18 February 1967 and ran through 15 April 1967. This operation took these squadrons to the headquarters of the Central Office South Vietnam (COSVN) believed to be located in Bình Dương Province with the objective of destroying this important headquarters. This joint mission conducted with the 1st Australian Task Force secured lines of communication and fire support bases (FSB). Extensive RIF operations were conducted as well. =Operation Manhattan= Commencing on 23 April 1967 the third operation titled Operation Manhattan was a thrust into the Long Nguyen Secret Zone by the 1st and 2nd Squadrons. This zone was a long-suspected regional headquarters of the Viet Cong. In a series of reconnaissance in force operations 60 tunnel complexes were uncovered. 1884 fortifications were destroyed. 621 tons of rice was evacuated during these operations. Operation Manhattan ended on 11 May 1967. Order of battle graphic showing the US 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in the Vietnam War =Operation Kittyhawk= Beginning in April 1967 and running through 21 March 1968, the regiment was tasked to secure and pacify Long Khánh District. This year-long mission was called Operation Kittyhawk. It achieved three objectives: Viet Cong (VC) were kept from interfering with travel on the main roads, Vietnamese were provided medical treatment in civic action programs like MEDCAP and DENTCAP and finally, RIF operations were employed to keep the VC off balance, making it impossible for them to mount offensive operations. =1967= From the summer of 1967 until the winter the regiment was led by Col. Roy W. Farley. Operation Emporia I & II was a road clearing operation with limited RIF missions by the 1st and 3rd Squadrons in Long Khánh District. Operation Valdosta I & II was a regimental size operation. Its purpose was to provide security at polling places during elections and to maintain reaction forces to counter VC agitation. As a result of the operation 84.7% of eligible voters cast ballots in Long Khánh District in the first general election and 78% in the second. =Operation Quicksilver= This operation involved the 1st and 2nd Squadrons of the 11th Armored Cavalry. Its purpose was to secure routes that moved logistical personnel of the 101st Airborne Division between Binh Long and Tây Ninh Provinces. Cordon, search and RIF missions were also performed. =Operation Fargo= Operation Fargo ran from 21 December 1967 until 21 January 1968. This regimental size operation conducted RIFs in Binh Long and Tây Ninh Provinces and opened Route 13 to military traffic for the very first time. =The Tet Offensive= The early part of 1968 was marked by the most ambitious and embolden offensive attack coordinated by the VC and NVA in the history of the war. The Tet Offensive was designed to coincide with the Vietnamese New Year. =Operation Adairsville= This operation began on 31 January 1968. Word was received by the II Field Force HQs to immediately re-deploy to the Long Binh/Bien Hoa area to relieve installations threatened by the Tet Offensive. At 1400 hours (2:00 pm) the 1st Squadron was called to move from their position south of the Michelin Rubber Plantation to the II Field Force headquarters. The 2nd Squadron moved from north of the plantation to III Corps POW Compound were enemy soldiers were sure to attempt to liberate the camp. The 3rd Squadron moved from An Lộc to III Corps Army, Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) headquarters. It took only 14 hours and 80 miles to arrive in position after first being alerted. =Operation Alcorn Cove= A Troop veterans are honored for their heroism in Vietnam, October 2009.The security operation in the Long Binh/Bien Hoa area and the area around Blackhorse Base Camp by the 1st and 2nd Squadrons is continue under Operation Alcorn Cove which began on 22 March 1968. This joint mission with the ARVN 18th Division and 25th Division was a twofold operation of security and RIFs. Operation Toan Thang was an extension of \\"Alcorn Cove\\". That joint operation involved the 1st and 25th Infantry Divisions. From April 1968 to January 1969, the 11th Cavalry was commanded Colonel (later Major General) George S. Patton IV, the son of General George S. Patton, Jr.. =\\"Workhorse\\" The 3rd Squadron= K Troop was part of the 3rd Squadron and known as \\"Killing K Troop\\". 3rd Squadron's nickname was \\"Workhorse\\". Shortly after its arrival in Vietnam, the 3rd Squadron engaged the Viet Cong for the first time. The squadron was awarded a Meritorious Unit Citation for this period. The Tet Offensive of 1968 gave the squadron a chance to fight the enemy's troop formations in open combat. In Bien Hoa the 3rd Squadron drove the enemy forces from the area near III Corps headquarters. Its action was crucial in smashing the enemy's offensive. On 20 October 2009 President Barack Obama presented a Presidential Unit Citation to troop commander Captain John B. Poindexter and all veterans of A Troop, 1st Squadron, 11th Cavalry for their heroism along the Cambodian border on 26 March 1970.John Poindexter fights for his brethren and winsArmy news report on PUC for Troop A Brigadier General John Bahnsen, a recipient of the Distinguished Service Cross, served with the 11th ACR in Vietnam, commanding first the regiment's Air Cavalry Troop, and later its 1st Squadron. Fulda Gap 11th ACR trooper on duty in the Fulda Gap during the Cold War.The 11th Cavalry Group Mechanized was redesignated as the 11th Constabulary Regiment on 3 May 1946 in order that the regiment could fulfill its occupation duties, and was restored as the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment and inactivated in November 1948. Blackhorse was brought back into active status 1 April 1951 at Camp Carson, Colorado. In 1954, the regiment transferred to Fort Knox, Kentucky to complete its training in armored tactics. The Blackhorse Regiment rotated to southern Germany in May 1957,11th ACR history page relieving the 6th ACR, and assumed the mission of patrolling the German-Czechoslovak border until its return to the United States in 1964. The Blackhorse arrived in Vietnam on 7 September 1966. Second Squadron spearheaded Operation Fish Hook into Cambodia on 1 May 1970, surrounding a North Vietnamese logistics center. During the drawdown of U.S. forces in Vietnam in early 1972, the 11th ACR was inactivated in stages (Air Troop inactivated 20 March 1972 in Vietnam; 2d Squadron inactivated 6 April 1972 in Vietnam) and subsequently reactivated in Germany (Air Troop and 2d Squadron activated 17 May 1972 in Germany) by reflagging the 14th Armored Cavalry Regiment. The unit, based at Downs Barracks, had the mission of patrolling the East-West German border. During the late 1980s the 11th's 4th Squadron (Air) operated the first air assault school in Europe, known as the Blackhorse Air Assault School, based in Fulda. After the Soviet Union dissolved in December 1991 the regiment ended its seventeen-year station along the Iron Curtain. The Blackhorse Regiment deployed an aviation task force on 10 April 1991 to Turkey for Operation Provide Comfort, an operation to support the Kurdish relief effort. One month later, the three maneuver squadrons (1st, 2d and 3d) along with the regiment's support squadron, deployed to Kuwait for Operation Positive Force, an operation to secure Kuwait so it could rebuild from the war. By October, the regiment had completed its missions in Turkey and Kuwait and returned to Fulda. As the need for US forces in Europe decreased, the Blackhorse Regiment was inactivated in a ceremony on 15 October 1993, and the remaining troops departed Germany in March 1994. =Training the force= Reactivated again on 26 October 1994, the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment now serves as the Army's Opposing Force at the National Training Center. The regiment portrays a determined opposing force that trains US forces in the basic principles of army operations and challenges all the battlefield operating systems. As the 2nd Brigade Tactical Group, the squadron trains brigade and battalion task forces during ten rotations a year at the National Training Center. Current organization =1st Squadron= First Squadron, 11th Armored Cavalry, \\"Ironhorse\\", was activated as a horse squadron at Fort Myer, Virginia in 1901. It has served in the Philippines, Mexico, Europe, and Vietnam. It is now organized as a combined arms battalion, and comprises one of the two maneuver elements of the 11th ACR. It is organized around a Headquarters and Headquarters Troop (HHT), and four line troops (two infantry, two armor), with a total authorized strength of 720 soldiers.MTOE as of December 2016 It is equipped with the OPFOR Surrogate Vehicle, an M901 ITV highly modified with an M2/M3 Bradley Fighting Vehicle turret to represent the BMP-2 armored personnel carrier, and the OSTV (OPFOR Surrogate Tank Vehicle) a vehicle based on the OPFOR Surrogate Vehicle which can simulate a wide spectrum of threat tanks. Using this equipment and configuration, the squadron performs the first of its two primary missions, acting as a non-permissive opposing force (OPFOR) during ten FORSCOM combat training rotations each year. The squadron's second mission is to deploy and fight as a combined arms battalion for various contingency operations throughout the world. In order to support this mission, the squadron must also maintain, operate and remain proficient on the M1A1 Abrams Tank and M2A2 Bradley Fighting Vehicle. Commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Hennisse, the approximately 400 men of the squadron trained nine months before becoming the first squadron to leave for the regiment's inaugural deployment, to the Philippines. Arriving in January 1902, Troops A and D patrolled Samar, where they fought the regiment's first engagement. In 1905, the regiment relocated to Fort Des Moines, Iowa. In 1906, the 1st Squadron remained in Des Moines while the rest of the regiment deployed to Cuba as part of President Theodore Roosevelt's Army of Pacification. In 1909, the 1st Squadron rejoined the rest of the regiment in Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia. On 12 March 1916, the regiment received orders to join General John J. Pershing as part of the Mexican Punitive Expedition to pursue Pancho Villa. Nine days later, the 1st Squadron led the way, arriving in Mexico on 21 March. Later, the 1st Squadron rode 22 hours straight to the rescue of United States forces besieged in Parral. Soldiers from India Battery ADA, 1st Squadron, 11th ACR participate in Stinger missile live fire over the skies of Ft. Irwin, California. The 11th ACR was not deployed during World War I. During this period, 1st Squadron conducted port operations in Newport News, Virginia. After the Armistice, the regiment, with its predominantly black horses, was stationed at the Presidio of Monterey, in California. The Army reorganizations for World War II eliminated the horse cavalry in 1940 and 1st Squadron traded in \\"saddles and hooves\\" for \\"tracks and steel\\". The regiment was inactivated 15 July 1942. The personnel and equipment of the former 1st and 2nd Squadrons was combined to form the newly designated 11th Tank Battalion, which later fought at the Battle of the Bulge. On 1 April 1951, the regiment was reactivated as the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, as part of the build-up for the Korean War. The regiment served in Fort Carson, Colorado and Fort Knox, Kentucky until deploying to Germany to replace the 6th ACR along the Czechoslovakian border. In July 1964, 1st Squadron, along with the regiment, transferred to Fort Meade, Maryland. In 1966, the regiment deployed to Vietnam. The 1st Squadron earned the Valorous Unit Awards (twice), the Republic of Vietnam Cross of Gallantry (three times), and the Presidential Unit Citation. It was during the Vietnam War that the 11th ACR was granted authorization to wear its distinctive unit patch. President Barack Obama awarded Alpha Troop of the 1st Squadron the Presidential Unit Citation on 20 October 2009, in recognition of a rescue mission 26 March 1970. In February 1971, 1st Squadron was inactivated, then reactivated in May 1972, at Downs Barracks in Fulda, Germany. During the Southwest Asia Campaign, Ironhorse operated Camp Colt, a scout training camp for reservists reporting to active duty. Following Desert Storm, the regiment deployed to Kuwait in support of Operation Positive Force from June 1991 to September 1991. 1st Squadron, along with the rest of the regiment, was inactivated at Fulda, Germany in March 1994.

The Headquarters and Headquarters Troop was redesignated on 19 April 1943 as the Headquarters and Headquarters Troop, 11th Cavalry Group Mechanized. The former squadrons of the 11th Cavalry were sent to fight with the 10th Armored Division and the 90th Infantry Division overseas. The new HHT, 11th Cavalry Group Mechanized drew new squadrons, the 36th and 44th, and also received an Assault Gun Troop (Howitzer Battery). After guarding the US southeastern coast from March 1944 until 1 June 1944, the group moved to Camp Gordon, Georgia to begin training for overseas deployment, The regiment arrived in the United Kingdom on 10 October 1944. The regiment entered France on 23 November 1944. Moving through France and Germany, the Blackhorse was assigned to the Ninth US Army and attached to XIII Corps, whose flank the Blackhorse screened during the corps' sweep from the Roer to the Rhine. =3rd Squadron= Memorial stone to 3rd Squadron in Bad Hersfeld. Post-Vietnam, the 3rd Squadron (\\"Workhorse\\") was based at McPheeters Barracks in Bad Hersfeld, Germany, about 40 kilometers north of Fulda. The 3rd Squadron was organized as an armored cavalry squadron like the 1st and 2nd Squadrons. HHT and I, K, and L Troops, Howitzer Battery, as well as M Company were organic to the squadron. Attached was the 58th Engineer Company. Bravo Battery, 2nd Battalion, 2nd Air Defense Artillery was also Headquartered with the Squadron. In the field, the attached units of the regiment like the 58th Engineer Company usually operated over a wide area, with smaller detachments dedicated to supporting the armored cavalry squadrons of the regiment. =4th Squadron= The 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment (ACR) arrived in Viet Nam in September 1966, the Air Cavalry Troop (ACT), organic to the regiment, arrived in December of the same year with a complement of UH-1C Gunships and UH-1D Command and Control \\"slicks\\". Early in January 1967, ACT was flying combat support for the regiment's missions. It was after this time that ACT earned its nickname Thunderhorse because of the distinctive roaring sound of rotorwash over the rice paddies and the unit's distinctive Blackhorse insignia. In July 1968, Air Cavalry Troop was reorganized into Air Troop (AT), consisting of nine AH-1G Cobra gunships, designated \\"reds\\" and nine OH-6 light observation helicopters (LOH), designated \\"whites\\", which flew in pairs as target acquisition and destroy missions as \\"pinks\\" and an aerial rifle platoon (ARP) \\"Blues\\" with infantry/cavalry scouts transported in the venerable UH-1 \\"Huey\\" (officially designated Iroquois).

In 1981, Air Troop, under the command of Major Joseph W. Sutton, won the Draper Cavalry Award; it was the first time an aviation unit had won the award. Later, under the command of Major Michael K. Mehaffey, Air Troop was recognized as the Army Aviation Association of America's (AAAA) Unit of the Year. On 1 June 1982, Command and Control Squadron was redesignated as Regimental Combat Aviation Squadron (RCAS) and officially as the Combat Aviation Squadron (provisional), 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment and nicknamed \\"Lighthorse\\". In the spring of 1984, Air Troop was once again named AAAA Aviation Unit of the Year. On 14 June of the same year, under the guidance of the Department of the Army's \\"Cavalry 86\\" and the new \\" J-series\\" Modified Table of Organization and Equipment (MTOE), elements of AT and CAT were combined to form the new 11th Combat Aviation Squadron (11th CAS), named \\"Thunderhorse\\" to honor the history of those Air Cavalry Troopers who had served before. The new squadron consisted of a Headquarters, and a Headquarters Troop, to include an Aircraft Maintenance Platoon (AVUM), designated \\"Crazyhorse\\"; Alpha Troop which was assigned a combat support aviation role, was the last Aerial Mine Platoon in the Army. It used a Yosemite Sam, clad in a cavalry uniform for its mascot and was called the \\"Miners\\"; Bravo Troop, an Attack Helicopter Troop used the old cobra logo from AT and later a bull dog; Charlie Troop, called \\"Tankbusters\\", an attack helicopter troop used the silhouette of a Soviet T-62 in an AH-1 turret gun site; Delta Troop an air cavalry troop was known as the \\"Death Riders\\" and used a \\"Jolly Roger\\" type skull on a red and white back ground: Echo Troop, an air cavalry troop used a red and white logo which included a large letter E an AH-1 and OH-58 profile; F Troop, an air cavalry troop used a cartoon figure of an AH-1 punching a Soviet MI-24(HIND) with the motto \\"Grab 'em by the nose - kick 'em in the ass\\" and the 511th Military Intelligence Company (MI/CEWI) \\"Trojan Horse\\" which had replaced the 340th ASA. In 1984, three EH-1H were assigned to the 511th. The squadron's S-4 section was known as \\"Hobbyhorse\\". On 17 Jun 1986 the squadron aligned itself in accordance with the US Army Regimental System (USARS). Now flying UH-60's, OH-58C's and AH-1F's, the squadron eventually ended up as HHT, N, O, P, Q, R S and AVUM Troops. On 9 November 1989 the wall fell and by the first of March 1990, the squadron ceased border operations. Early on 10 April 1991 elements of the squadron were issued no notice deployment orders to self-deploy from Fulda to Diyarbakır, Turkey in support of Operation Provide Comfort. Task Force Thunderhorse deployed 15 UH-60 and five OH-58D along with crews and support personnel. During this period the 511th MI (CEWI) was recognized as the best company sized military intelligence unit in the Army. With the fall of the wall, and the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, the regiment on 15 October 1993 to 15 March 1994 began the deactivation process of the unit. The regiment, less the 3rd and 4th Squadrons, was reactivated in October 1994 at Fort Irwin California.

The squadron's official name at that time was Combat Support Squadron (CSS). The nickname \\"Packhorse\\" is derived from the early days of the U.S. Cavalry, when soldiers went on campaigns accompanied by packhorses, additional horses and/or mules that carried all their essential supplies. Everything from food to gunpowder to horseshoes were transported in this manner. Initial organization included five units—Headquarters and Headquarters Troop, Maintenance Troop, Supply and Transportation Troop, Medical Troop, and the attached 54th Chemical Detachment. The squadron also operated the Regimental Material Management Center which had the responsibility for the overall logistics state of the regiment. Elements of the squadron were based at both Fulda and Wildflecken. The squadron was large for a battalion-sized unit, as the Maintenance Troop alone had some 400 soldiers assigned. The Packhorse provided logistical support during both the frequent regimental maneuvers of the Cold War and at gunnery exercises at Grafenwoehr, where the squadron operated for weeks at a time while the cavalry troops and tank companies rotated through the firing ranges. M88 of the 11th ACR in Iraq, 2005 Squadron vehicles during the Cold War included 3/4-ton M1009 CUCV's, 1&1/4-ton M1008 and M1010 pickup trucksThe 1&1/4-ton pickup trucks were also part of the CUCV family.globalsecurity.org that often carried special-purpose shelters mounting communications, medical, or maintenance equipment, HEMTT's, M88's, tanker trucks, and trucks carrying chemical decontamination equipment. A pair of M934 5-ton Expansible Vans (\\"Expando-vans\\")olive-drab.comDiscussion of expando-vans housed the squadron headquarters in the field. The squadron was also capable of highly specialized functions such as the provision of potable water by filtering fresh water sources through purification units. On 3 October 1990, the two Germanys re- unified. By December 1991 the Soviet Union dissolved, ending squadron's six- year presence along the Iron Curtain. In August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait, prompting the United States to respond. On 16 May 1991, the Packhorse received orders to deploy to Kuwait to support the regiment as it secured the country while it struggled to rebuild after the war. By October, the regiment had completed its mission and the Packhorse returned to Fulda. As the need for U.S. forces in Europe decreased, the Packhorse was inactivated on 15 February 1994, followed by the Blackhorse on 15 March 1994. The 177th Forward Support Battalion was inactivated on 26 October 1994, becoming the Regimental Support Squadron, 'Packhorse' now carrying its new role with the U.S. Army's Opposing Forces at the National Training Center. Since its reactivation Support Squadron has been the Forces Command (FORSCOM) winner of the Philip A. Connelly award for garrison food service excellence in FY 1992, 1993 and 1994. The squadron also won this same competition at the Department of the Army (DA) level in FY 1993. The squadron played a part in the regiment's selection as the only Army unit in the Department of Defense for the Phoenix award for Maintenance Excellence in FY 1995, FY 1999 and FY 2000. Headquarters and Headquarters Troop was the winner of the DA Award for Maintenance Excellence for FY 1995 and FY 1996 in the Intermediate Equipment Density Category, the only unit to do so in the 16-year history of the program.

In the United States, the FDA bans Gerovital H3 from interstate commerce as an unapproved drug and, since 1982, has prohibited its importation. Gerovital is promoted with false claims of its curative abilities for a wide range of human ailments; research has found no evidence that it has any health benefit [the claim that research has found no evidence that it has any health benefit -- is not backed by any citation of a study or review. In fact, there are studies that show evidence for a benefit - albeit not for the dubious purpose of 'anti-aging' which is itself a straw-man of an absurd type.] or \\"anti-aging\\" [who is making that claim other than a single article cited over and over again from 2013?] properties. [Addendum: It is of the opinion of this editor it is not a coincidence that the actual studies are simply not even mentioned. The actual evidence shows that GH3 as a reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor i.e. it increases the availability of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine, together with lowering cortisol, is a potential treatment for anxiety, depression, which can, in turn, improve outcome, thus might, in fact, have \\"any health benefit\\" as our sycophants for the war on drugs are all too quick to allege. We see in one study in 2015 that: \\"Participants were men and women between 50 and 89 years of age, with a median of 62.53 years. Before the intervention, the demographic characteristics and the baseline SF-36 scores, low mood, and anxiety statuses were comparable (p > 0.05). After the 12-week intervention, the scores of role-physical (RP), bodily pain (BP), general health (GH), vitality (VT), mental health (MH) and health transition (HT), mental composite score (MCS) of the G.H.3. group were higher than the placebo group (p < 0.05), There were no significant differences in other domains in SF-36 and PCS between the two groups(p > 0.05), the scores of SDS and SAS in the G.H.3. group were both lower than the placebo group(p < 0.01), the prevalence rates of low moods in the G.H.3. group and the placebo group were 20.8 % and 34.0 % respectively, no significant difference was found (χ2 =2.127,p = 0.145), while the prevalence rate of clinical anxiety concerns in the G.H.3. group was 2.1 %, which was significantly lower than the placebo group, 22.0 % (χ2 =9.040,p < 0.001).\\" ] Development and marketing The impetus for developing the drug is sometimes alleged to have come from Nicolae Ceaușescu, who funded the establishment of a research organization, the National Institute of Geriatrics, in Bucharest, Romania, headed by Ana Aslan (1897-1988). From the 1950s until her death in 1988, Aslan promoted Gerovital H3 with great success. In the 1960s and 1970s her Romanian clinic, the Parhon Institute, became a mecca for celebrities seeking treatment, and an upscale tourist attraction. The New York Times referred to Gerovital's \\"jet-set aura,\\" noting that Aslan had been covered in \\"society columns where such public figures as Nikita S. Khrushchev, Konrad Adenauer, and Ibn Saud have been listed among the multitudes said to have taken the drug.\\" As late as 1988 an advertisement by the Romanian National Tourist Office lauded \\"the picturesque and exciting cities, scenic delights, famous resorts (including Gerovital H3 treatment centers), cultural and historic treasures that await the traveler to Romania.\\" With the rise of the Web Gerovital has enjoyed a new lease of promotional life as it is promoted by many sites with claims of its \\"cure-all\\" abilities. Denouncement A 1973 New York Times article said \\"cold water was thrown on [Gerovital]'s reputation years ago\\" by \\"three reports published simultaneously in British Medical Journal [that said it] found no merit for procaine hydrochloride for any of the problems of aging.\\" Some clinical trials in the mid-to-late 1970s suggested that Gerovital H3 acts as a weak, competitive, reversible MAO inhibitor, and so may have some antidepressant value, but otherwise has a negligible effect on disease. In 1994, the U.S. FDA Consumer magazine said: \\"No health claims for Gerovital have been substantiated, and FDA considers it an unapproved new drug. It has caused low blood pressure, respiratory difficulties, and convulsions in some users.\\" Suppliers assert that the product is safe, and one cites a brief quotation from a newspaper article that says \\"while as early as 1973 Elmer Gardner of the FDA's Bureau of Drugs stated 'There is no safety problem with Gerovital H-3.'\\" Effectiveness There is no evidence that Gerovital is helpful in slowing aging or treating illness. Drug or nutrient? Procaine itself is often considered to be a drug. Earlier references by advocates of Gerovital H3 refer to it as a drug. Hoffer and Walker (1980) call it a \\"youth drug.\\" Mircea Dumitru, Aslan's colleague and personal physician, describes it as \\"a complex drug acting like the procaine molecule ... The addition of benzoic acid, potassium and disodium phosphate increase the effects of Gerovital-H3 biotrophic treatment.\\" FDA ban , the FDA's 1982 automatic detention alert is still in effect and bans the import of Gerovital H3 into the U.S. as \\"a new drug within the meaning of 201(p), without an approved new drug application [Unapproved New Drug, Section 505(a)].\\" The ban covers: *Gerovital, GH3, KH3, Zell H3, GH3 etc. This order was rescinded for GEROVITAL Cosmetics Lines, not containing procaine. *finished injectable or oral Procaine Hydrochloride References Category:Ageing Category:Alternative medicine Category:Health fraud Category:Withdrawn drugs Category:Patent medicines Category:Anti-aging substances Category:Romanian inventions ","title":"Gerovital"},{"id":"851389","text":"The Aero Engineers Australia (AEA) Maverick is a single-seat sportsplane of conventional configuration.

Hockey had been earlier introduced at St. Paul's from Canada, but Gordon is regarded as the individual who helped formalize the game by putting down on paper what is regarded as the first set of rules in the United States. This occurred in 1885; in 1888 he was made hockey coach. Play at St. Paul's was strictly intramural, but in 1896 Gordon took the first St. Paul's team to New York City to play at the old St. Nicholas Rink. In that first game the St. Paul's alumni defeated Gordon's team 3-1. His coaching career extended until 1917, during which time he developed numerous players, including Hobey Baker, for the Eastern colleges. It was such former players who provided the financial backing for the St. Nicholas Rink. Gordon was head of the history department at St. Paul's and in addition to hockey, also coached football and cricket as well. After World War I service he was in the real estate business until 1927, when he founded the Malcolm K. Gordon School at Garrison, New York.

Produced by the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) and the National Space Development Agency (NASDA), the spacecraft was launched on September 14, 2007. After successfully orbiting the Moon for a year and eight months, the main orbiter was instructed to impact on the lunar surface near the crater Gill on June 10, 2009. Nickname The orbiter's nickname, Kaguya, was selected by the general public. It comes from the name of a lunar princess in the ancient Japanese folktale The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter. After their successful release, its sub-satellites, Rstar and Vstar, were named Okina and Ouna, also derived from characters in the tale. Mission objectives The main scientific objectives of the mission were to: * Study the origins of the Moon and its geologic evolution * Obtain information about the lunar surface environment * Perform radio science, especially precise measurement of the Moon's gravity field Launch Launch of H-IIA F13 carrying SELENE (Photo by Narita Masahiro) SELENE launched on September 14, 2007 at 01:31:01 UTC on an H-IIA (Model H2A2022) carrier rocket from Tanegashima Space Center into a (perigee) / (apogee) geocentric parking orbit. The total launch mass was . The SELENE mission was originally scheduled to launch in 2003, but rocket failures on another mission and technical difficulties delayed the launch until 2007. Launch was planned for August 16, 2007, but was postponed when some electronic components were found to be installed incorrectly. Lunar operations On October 3, it entered an initial polar lunar orbit. On October 9, the relay satellite was released into a orbit, while on October 12 the VLBI satellite was released into a one. Finally, by October 19, the orbiter was in a circular orbit. The nominal mission duration was one year plus possible extensions. On October 31, 2007, Kaguya deployed its Lunar Magnetometer, Lunar Radar Sounder, Earth-looking Upper Atmosphere and Plasma Imager. On December 21, 2007, Kaguya began regular operations after all fifteen observation experiments had been satisfactorily verified. Kaguya completed the planned operation by the end of October 2008 and began extended operations planned to continue through March 2009. It would then be sent into a circular orbit, and finally to an elliptical one, with a controlled impact occurring by August 2009. Because of a degraded reaction wheel, the plan was changed so that on February 1, 2009, the orbit was lowered to ± , and impact occurred at 18:25 UTC on June 10, 2009. Design The mission featured three separate spacecraft: =Main orbiter= *Shape: octagonal prism *Mass: *Size: 2.1 x 2.1 x 4.8 m (6.9 x 6.9 x 16 ft) *Attitude control: Three-axis stabilized *Power: 3.5 kW (Max.) *Mission period: 1 year *Mission orbit: Circular, *Inclination: 90 degrees =Okina (small relay satellite)= Okina (formerly Rstar) and Ouna (formerly Vstar) were octagonal prisms to support radio science. Okina relayed radio communications between the orbiter and the Earth when the orbiter was behind the Moon. This allowed, for the first time, the direct Doppler shift measurements needed to precisely map the gravitational field of the lunar farside; previously, the farside gravity field could only be inferred by nearside measurements. The relay satellite impacted the lunar farside near the Mineur D crater at 19:46 JST (10:46 UTC) on February 12, 2009. *Function: two-way radio science relay, orbiter-earth *Mass: *Size: 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.65 m (3.3 x 3.3 x 2.1 ft) *Attitude control: spin-stabilized *Power: 70 W *Initial orbit: *Inclination: 90 degrees =Ouna (VLBI satellite)= Ouna used Very Long Baseline Interferometry as a second way to map the Moon's gravity field. It was especially useful at the lunar limb, where the gravitational acceleration is perpendicular to the line of sight to earth, making Doppler measurements unsuitable. *Function: VLBI radio science *Mass: *Size: 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.65 m (3.3 x 3.3 x 2.1 ft) *Attitude control: spin-stabilized *Power: 70 W *Initial orbit: *Inclination: 90 degrees Payload SELENE carried 13 scientific instruments \\"to obtain scientific data of the lunar origin and evolution and to develop the technology for the future lunar exploration\\": *Terrain camera (TC) (resolution 10 meters [33 ft] per pixel) *X-Ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRS) *Lunar magnetometer (LMAG) *Spectral profiler (SP) (resolution per pixel: 562 x 400 m [1840 x 1310 ft) *Multi-band imager (MI) (resolution of visible light 20 [66 ft] meters per pixel, near-infrared 62 meters [200 ft] per pixel) *Laser altimeter (LALT) *Lunar radar sounder (LRS) *Gamma ray spectrometer (GRS) *Charged particle spectrometer (CPS) *Plasma analyzer (PACE) *Upper atmosphere and plasma imager (UPI) *Radio wave repeater (RSAT) aboard Okina *Radio wave source for VLBI (VRAD) aboard Okina and Ouna Two 2.2 megapixel CCD HDTV cameras, one wide- angle and one telephoto, were also on board, primarily for public relations purposes. JAXA collected names and messages that were carried on SELENE through their \\"Wish Upon the Moon\\" campaign. 412,627 names and messages were printed on a sheet measuring 280 mm x 160 mm (11 x 6.3 in) at 70 µm (0.0003 in) per character. The sheet was installed under the photovoltaic modules and cooling panels beneath the multi-layered insulation. Results Major results include: *Improved lunar global topography maps. This detailed altitude and geological data is provided to Google for free to make Google Moon 3-D. *Detailed gravity map of the far side of the Moon. *First optical observation of the permanently shadowed interior of the crater Shackleton at the lunar south pole. *Evidence of earth's oxygen being transported to the moon via magnetospheric ions Other lunar probes Map of the lunar south pole showing the SELENE craft at the left. SELENE was part of a renewed global interest in lunar exploration; it was \\"the largest lunar mission since the Apollo program\\". It followed Japan's first lunar probe, Hagoromo, launched in 1990. China launched its Chang'e 1 lunar explorer on October 24, 2007, followed by India's October 22, 2008 launch of Chandrayaan-1 and the United States Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter in June 2009. The United States, European countries (ESA), Russia, Japan, India and China are planning future manned lunar exploration missions or lunar outpost construction on the Moon between 2018 and 2025.

It claims all-female shooting crews and prides itself on being at the forefront of the \\"natural\\", reality-based porn market. The site was launched in the year 2000 and has since been split into three \\"mini- sites\\" known as 'Solo', 'Girl-Girl', and 'Intimate Moments' (masturbation). Abby Winters originated as an Australian site with Australian participants and employees. It is now based in Amsterdam and intermixes its extensive Australian material with new material shot since its move. In addition to pictures and videos of erotic modelling and sex acts, the site also features a range of both scripted and unscripted 'real world'-type situations, especially in video, such as naked yoga, aerobics, video game playing, swimming, car washing, and so on. The site is noted for its mix of \\"core\\" professional models of whom it only has a few alongside a massive trove of genuinely amateur models, most of whom had never worked in erotic modelling or video before coming to the company. All material is captured with particularly high- quality camera-work, usually using high-definition video and photography (especially since 2009), together with somewhat atypical \\"signature\\" capture angles, and has no models with surgically enhanced breasts. Models wear very little make-up and many have a full patch of pubic hair. In addition, the website claims that its photos are not retouched in any way (other than basic colour balancing). In January 2008, abbywinters.com had about 30,000 subscribers. Despite its history as an Australian site and its enduringly close association with that country, 65% of Abby Winters subscribers are in the United States. In 2010, responding to a changing political climate in the Australian government on the question of pornography's acceptability in the country, the company's offices were moved to the Netherlands. Prior to that relocation, the site's web servers had already been based in the Netherlands and the United States for quite some time. Description of content Original logo The website features female models typically between the ages 18 to 25. With the exception of those who are long-time employees of the organisation, of whom there are only a small number, almost all Abby Winters models are completely new to pornography. In photo-based shoots the women are photographed in their own homes and bedrooms and/or in outdoor settings, and usually begin wearing their own clothes and underwear, which they gradually shed. In videos, there may also be candid interviews, but videos on the site involving groups usually have a theme, or at least implied back-story, such as a yoga class beginning fully clothed and gradually shedding garments as the yoga session progresses. According to Adultreviews.com Review of Abby Winters, as of March 2018 there were 1,485 models featured on the site, with more than 500,000 images and 5,459 videos. New content was uploaded twice daily. Wired.com writer Regina Lynn claimed that the site portrays sex more realistically than most pornography. Customers are able to suggest scenarios on the site's forum which are sometimes filmed. After establishing a rough scenario for each shoot the production team then lets the performers decide how fast the scene progresses, and which sex acts they will perform. It is claimed that all scenes are filmed by women, some of whom have previously modelled for the site. Models are paid approximately US$500 for a solo masturbation scene, and US$800 for a sex scene with another model. In 2003/04, Abbywinters.com deviated from featuring only girl/girl sex by filming six boy/girl scenes. All were claimed to be real couples and, as with the females, the males were amateurs. The site featured a boy/girl scene in May 2011 and after December 2011 featured one boy/girl release per month. The existence of Abby Winters (person) In its initial publicity, the company claimed that \\"Abby Winters\\" was a real person. In interviews with founder and CEO, Garion Hall, and many people employed with and/or modelling for the company, Abby Winters was spoken of as if she was an actual woman, personally overseeing, photographing and filming the vast majority of Abbywinters.com material. The status of Abby Winters as a real person was doubted by many commentators from the beginning, and in about 2007, Garion Hall's staff (and eventually Garion Hall himself) admitted that Abby Winters is an alias for Garion Hall, and that \\"her\\" story as an empowered and powerful sex-positive female pornographer is completely fictional. The revelation also tended to prove the suspicion among web commentators that Abby Winters models and employees had received coaching and/or training in how to convincingly insist to interviewers, and at events such as conferences of the pornography industry, that Abby Winters was a real person. Today on the website, the Abby Winters fictional \\"backstory\\" remains prominent. There is no mention that Garion Hall was the founder of Abbywinters.com, and also the founder and CEO of the company's interrelated companies such as GMBill, which is the site's payment service. The company, having moved from Australia and now owned and operated by Dutch company Abbywinters.com BV, and with its servers being located mostly in the Netherlands, still conveys the impression that it is an Australian company based in Melbourne: \\"Where possible, we select local suppliers over mega- corps, to keep our vibrant community of Fitzroy alive.\\"https://www.abbywinters.com/about#tabs-wecare > We Care Company status On 1 June 2010, Hall announced that G Media was selling the business to his new Dutch company, and would be moving its operations to Amsterdam, Netherlands because of legal problems in Australia (see below for details). The company had been based in the Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy before their move. It now operates from an office in central Amsterdam. In late 2007, the company had also briefly opened a second office in Sydney. In late 2007, the site partnered with Wicked Pictures as the exclusive distributor for Abbywinters.com DVDs. The company claims to have regularly donated $1,000 a week to various organisations including Samba, ASACP, and other open source projects, as well as health aid organisations.

Criticism by former model Liandra Dahl In 2007, ex-Abby Winters model Liandra Dahl wrote on her blog about privacy problems concerning G Media sites, which was picked up by the Herald Sun. Dahl was concerned that Abby Winters fails to inform young and inexperienced models that content may be available outside of the confines of the paysite, on file sharing networks, and how their involvement in pornography might revisit them inhibiting their future choices. However, following the raid on G Media (see below), Dahl reopened her blog to make clear that the Herald Sun had \\"misquoted her\\" and that she didn't support the new laws against pornography in Australia. Police raid on G Media On 16 June 2009, G Media offices in Melbourne were raided by Victoria Police as part of a wider \\"Operation Refuge\\". The Herald Sun article gave two grounds for the raid: that G-Media may have filmed an under-age model, and that G Media's DVD productions may have contravened Victoria's film classification laws. The report stated that CEO Garion Hall was arrested but released later the same day, and claimed that the raid was made in response to information provided by the paper. G Media later released a statement stating that nothing had been seized in the raid, and that the police were polite and amiable throughout. In December 2009 CEO Garion Hall was charged by Victoria Police with 54 counts of making objectionable films for gain, and possessing a commercial quantity of objectionable films. According to a post by Hall on the site, the charges against him were eventually dropped and two charges were filed against the company itself. A judge fined the company $6,000 on 28 May 2010. This combination of legal problems, law enforcement encounters, financial penalties, and a less accepting climate for the company's activities, led Hall to move the company out of Australia altogether and relocate it to Amsterdam.

Overview St. Mary's was founded in 1885 on Detroit's east side on the corner of Forest and St. Aubin by Rev. Joseph Dabrowski as a school for Polish-American boys to train for the priesthood. The school moved to the 125 acre (0.5 km²) campus of the former Michigan Military Academy on the shores of Orchard Lake in 1909 and is still there today. St. Mary's now offers a college preparatory education. The campus is shared with SS. Cyril and Methodius Seminary and contains some offices and classrooms for Madonna University of Livonia, Michigan. The Felician Sisters from Livonia, Michigan have served the Orchard Lake Schools since 1935. Academics St. Mary's academic program is designed to meet the basic entrance requirements for any college curriculum. Requirements for graduation are: four years of theology and English; four years of mathematics three years of science and social studies; three years of foreign language; and a semester each of computer programming, computer applications, physical education, health, fine arts, and speech. Students are required to fulfill 28 credits for graduation. Although students need not be Catholic to attend St. Mary's, all students are educated in the Catholic tradition. This tradition includes four years of theology in the classroom as well as attendance at Mass twice weekly. Class retreats and other activities are available for students. The school chaplain and many campus priests can guide students regarding their individual programs. 100 percent of St. Mary's graduates who apply to college have been accepted. A full-time guidance counselor assists students in selecting colleges and universities. The school held the national record for most students from one year to go to the U.S. Naval Academy (4). The \\"Prep Building\\" is the main school building of St. Mary's Preparatory. Formerly the Academic Building of Michigan Military Academy, it is now home to many administrative offices, one student lounge, thirteen classrooms, and two computer labs. St. Mary's Preparatory is fully accredited and licensed by the State of Michigan's Department of Education, the Michigan Non-Public Schools Accrediting Association (MNSAA), and is a member of the Orchard Lake Schools, the Archdiocese of Detroit, the Detroit Catholic League, the Oakland Schools Consortium, and the Michigan High School Athletic Association. Campus and student life Campus buildings include a hockey arena, volume library, a Marian grotto, a three-story residence hall, a bookstore, two gymnasiums, a science center, administration buildings, a laboratory and science building, a dining hall and the Shrine Chapel. It has a quarter of a mile of beach on Orchard Lake open only to members of the school. About 90% of the school participates in sports. The school offers 14 varsity sports: football, basketball, baseball, bowling, track and field, cross country, golf, wrestling, rowing, hockey, soccer, lacrosse, skiing, and snowboarding. The Eaglets have won many league, district, and regional titles in its history. it had 41 Michigan State Championships. In 1998 the school's rowing team placed second in the Henley Royal Regatta. The Eaglet football team reached the state finals fourteen times, winning eight times. The athletic facilities include an athletic center with a hockey arena, a weight room, an indoor track, locker rooms, a banquet hall, and a basketball gymnasium. The crew team has its own boathouse just off Orchard Lake. Outdoors, St. Mary's has two football fields, two baseball diamonds, and a basketball court. The St. Mary's Ski team practices at Alpine Valley Snow Ski Area in White Lake, Michigan. The Eaglets compete in the MHSAA Division I (ice hockey), II, and III, depending on the sport. In the Detroit Catholic League, they compete in the Central Division. St. Mary's fiercest rivals are De La Salle Collegiate High School, Birmingham Brother Rice, U of D Jesuit, and Catholic Central High School. St. Mary's holds the largest high school fair in the country every year for fund-raising attracting thousands of people (http://www.stmaryspolishcountryfair.com/).

At the end of the first paragraph, the word \\"lorem\\" is an orphan in the second sense: a very short final line that, because the rest of its line is white, creates an impression of two lines of whitespace between the paragraphs. In typesetting, widows and orphans are lines at the beginning or end of a paragraph which are left dangling at the top or bottom of a page or column, separated from the rest of the paragraph. (The typographer's terms for the top and bottom of a page or column are head and foot.) Definitions There is some disagreement about the definitions of widow and orphan; what one source calls a widow another calls an orphan.Carter, Rob. A widowed line, highlighted in yellow.Day, Ben. Meggs, Philip. Typographic Design: Form and Communication. 2nd ed. John Wiley & Sons: 1993. p. 263.Chicago Manual of Style. The Chicago Manual of Style provides these definitions: > ;Widow: A paragraph-ending line that falls at the beginning of the following > page or column, thus separated from the rest of the text. Mnemonically, a > widow is \\"alone at the top\\" (of the family tree but, in this case, of the > page). ;Orphan: A paragraph-opening line that appears by itself at the > bottom of a page or column, thus separated from the rest of the text. > Mnemonically, an orphan is \\"alone at the bottom\\" (of the family tree but, in > this case, of the page). : Alternately, A word, part of a word, or very > short line that appears by itself at the end of a paragraph. Mnemonically > still \\"alone at the bottom\\", just this time at the bottom of a paragraph. > Orphans of this type give the impression of too much white space between > paragraphs.  Remembering the terms  A common mnemonic is \\"An orphan has no past; a widow has no future\\"Bringhurst, Robert. The Elements of Typographic Style. 3rd ed. Hartley and Marks Publishers: 2004. pp. 43–44 or \\"An orphan is left behind, whereas a widow must go on alone\\". Another way to think is that orphaned lines appear at the \\"birth\\" (start) of paragraphs; widowed lines appear at the \\"death\\" (end) of paragraphs. \\"An orphan is alone from the beginning; a widow is alone at the end,\\" or \\"An orphan starts alone, a widow ends alone.\\"  Guidelines  Writing guides, such as the Chicago Manual of Style, generally suggest that a manuscript should have no widows and orphans even if the result of avoiding them is additional space at the bottom of a page or column.Chicago Manual of Style, 15th Edition, 3.11 Overall appearance: \\"A page should not begin with the last line of a paragraph unless it is full measure and should not end with the first line of a new paragraph.\\" However, in its 16th edition (2011) the Chicago Manual of Style suggests a new convention in which pages may end with the first line of a new paragraph.Chicago Manual of Style, 16th Edition, 2.113: \\"A page should not begin with the last line of a paragraph unless it is full measure. (A page can, however, end with the first line of a new paragraph.)\\" Some techniques for eliminating widows include: *Forcing a page break early, producing a shorter page; *Adjusting the leading, the space between lines of text (although such carding or feathering is usually frowned upon); *Adjusting the spacing between words to produce \\"tighter\\" or \\"looser\\" paragraphs; *Adjusting the hyphenation within the paragraph; *Adjusting the page's margins; *Subtle scaling of the page, though too much non-uniform scaling can visibly distort the letters; *Rewriting a portion of the paragraph; *Reduce the tracking of the words; *Adding a pull quote to the text (more common for magazines); and *Adding a figure to the text, or resizing an existing figure. An orphan is cured more easily, by inserting a blank line or forcing a page break to push the orphan line onto the next page to be with the rest of its paragraph. Such a cure may have to be undone if editing the text repositions the automatic page or column break. Similarly, a single orphaned word at the end of a paragraph can be cured by forcing one or more words from the preceding line into the orphan's line. In web-publishing, this is typically accomplished by concatenating the words in question with a non-breaking space and, if available, by utilizing the orphans: and widows: attributes in Cascading Style Sheets. Sometimes it can also be useful to add non-breaking spaces to the first two (or few) short words of a paragraph to avoid that a single orphaned word is placed to the left or right of a picture or table, while the remainder of the text (with longer words) would only appear after the table. Most full- featured word processors and page layout applications include a paragraph setting (or option) to automatically prevent widows and orphans. When the option is turned on, an orphan is forced to the top of the next page or column; and the line preceding a widow is forced to the next page or column with the last line. In technical writing where a single source may be published in multiple formats, and now in HTML5 with the expectation of viewing content at different sizes or resolutions, it is recommended to use the word processor settings that automatically prevent widows and orphans. Manual overrides such as inserted empty lines or extra spaces can cause unexpected white space in the middle of pages.

Crest; On a wreath of the colors (Or and Tenné) the head dress of the dragoons of 1836 Proper. Motto Toujours Prêt (Always Ready). Symbolism The color of the facings of the old dragoon regiment was orange, which is used for the field of the shield; the insignia was an eight-pointed star of gold, two of them (conforming with the numerical designation) are placed on the shield. The traditional episode in the regiment is the charge of Captain May's squadron on the Mexican artillery at Resaca de la Palma which is commemorated by the principal charge on the shield. Background The coat of arms was originally approved for the 2d Cavalry Regiment on 6 August 1920. It was amended to change the 6 pointed stars to 8 pointed stars to conform to the old dragoon star on 28 April 1924. The coat of arms was redesignated for the 2d Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron on 31 July 1944. On 26 November 1946, it was redesignated for the 2d Constabulary Squadron. It was redesignated for the 2d Armored Cavalry Regiment (US Constabulary) on 17 March 1949. The coat of arms was redesignated for the 2d Armored Cavalry on 1 September 1955. The insignia was redesignated effective 16 April 2005, for the 2d Cavalry Regiment. =Distinctive Unit Insignia= Description/Blazon A metal and enamel device one inch (2.54 cm) in height consisting of a gold eight pointed star of rays surmounted by a green palmetto leaf charged with a silver color fleur-de-lis, on a green ribbon scroll forming the base of the device, the regimental motto \\"Toujours Prêt\\" in gold metal letters. Symbolism The eight-pointed star insignia worn by dragoons, the 2d Cavalry having been originally formed as the Second Regiment of Dragoons in 1836. The palmetto leaf represents the Regiment's first action against the Seminole Indians in Florida, where the palmetto leaf grows in abundance. The fleur-de-lis is for combat service in France in both World War I and World War II. The motto \\"Toujours Prêt\\" (Always Ready) expresses the spirit and élan of the Regiment.

History =Between 1808 and 1815= In 1808, there was one regiment of light dragoons and during the War of 1812 another regiment was raised. Units of both regiments of dragoons served in engagements at the Mississineway River; the Battle of Lundy's Lane; Fort Erie and the Siege of Fort Meigs. These two regiments were consolidated on 30 March 1814 into the Regiment of Light Dragoons but this new unit was dissolved on 15 June 1815.Stubbs, Mary Lee; Connor, Stanley. Armor- Cavalry Part I: Regular Army and Army Reserve. From the Office of the Chief of Military History, Washington D.C., 1969. =Early organization= Resaca de la Palma, Texas, 9 May 1846. Here Captain Charles A. May's squadron of the 2d Dragoons (now 2d Armored Cavalry Regiment) slashed through the enemy lines in an attack that climaxed the opening campaigns of the Mexican War. Their bravery proved that the 2,500 American soldiers under Zachary Taylor had enough self-confidence and pluck to shatter the Mexican force of 6,000 and eject it forever from Texas. May's attack order was simple and effective: \\"Remember your regiment and follow your officers.\\" Bezaleel W. Armstrong, second lieutenant, 2nd Dragoons, 1846; served in the Mexican War at Vera Cruz and Mexico City, 1847–48; died 1849, aged 26, daguerreotype c. 1846. The precursor organization was originally established by President Andrew Jackson on 23 May 1836, as the Second Regiment of Dragoons of the US Army. A and I Companies were recruited in the Fort Myer, Virginia area, B Company recruited from Virginia and Louisiana, C Company drew recruits from Tennessee, E, F, G, and H recruited from New York, and K Company was drawn from New Orleans. D Company was organized from a detachment of the 1st Dragoons and served in Florida immediately. In April 1837, the regimental headquarters was moved to Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, where the 400 new recruits and their instructors participated in the School of the Trooper, and learned the tactics and ways of being a dragoon, while some of their compatriots were battling the Indians in Florida. Second Seminole War The 2nd Dragoons saw their first combat during the Second Seminole War. Company D drew first blood on 10 June 1836 in an engagement at Welika Pond, close to Fort Defiance, Florida. In December 1836, A, B, C, E, and I Companies arrived in South Carolina, and immediately moved south. In January 1837, the troopers were engaged by the Seminoles at Fort Mellon only two days after their arrival. On 9 September 1837, three Dragoon companies and two companies of Florida militia surrounded and attacked a hostile village, capturing King Philip, an important chief. The 2nd Dragoons brought the fight to the hostile Seminoles, rather than wait to be ambushed inside a fort like other units did. =Mexican–American War= Under an act of Congress dated 23 August 1842 the regiment was re-designated as the Regiment of Riflemen effective 4 March 1843. This act was repealed on 4 April 1844 and the regiment reverted to its previous designation. In October 1842, A, D, E, F, and G Companies moved to Fort Jessup, Louisiana and Fort Towson. The remainder of the regiment stayed in Florida to patrol for hostile bands of Seminoles. Fort Jessup became the regimental headquarters, and was the 2nd Dragoons' home for four years. When hostilities with the Centralist Republic of Mexico began to boil over in 1845, General Zachary Taylor assembled his \\"Army of Observation\\" at Fort Jessup, and the 2nd Dragoons marched overland to occupy Corpus Christi, Texas. They soon established Fort Texas, near modern- day Brownsville, Texas. The regiment conducted aggressive patrolling along the Rio Grande, and on 25 April 1846, they received word that Mexican troops were crossing the river. Two companies of the 2nd Dragoons were ambushed by 500–1,600 Mexican troops (accounts vary), and all were either killed or captured. This battle, known as the Thornton Affair, gave US President Polk the casus belli he needed to invade Mexico. When General Taylor counterattacked, the 2nd Dragoons forced the enemy to turn their flank during the Battle of Palo Alto. The next day, during the Battle of Resaca de la Palma on 9 May 1846, Companies D and E under Captain Charles A. May were ordered to eliminate a battery of Mexican guns. Prior to the charge, May issued a simple order; \\"Remember your Regiment and follow your officers.\\" This became the 2nd Dragoon Regiment's motto. The attack destroyed the enemy battery and captured a Mexican general. On 29 June 1846, COL David Twiggs was given command of the regiment from COL William S. Harney, and he was lauded for his bravery at the Battle of Monterrey. COL Twiggs commanded the 2nd Dragoons for the rest of the war, and by the end, the regiment was one of two regiments in the Army that had elements participate in every major battle. Heroism was not limited to the officers of the 2nd Dragoons; in November 1847, SGT Jack Miller's small patrol of 20 Dragoons was ambushed by near Monclova by 100 Mexicans. Reaching for their carbines, SGT Miller urged them to charge with only their sabers. In the ensuing battle, 6 Mexicans were killed, 13 were wounded, and 70 were captured at the cost of 1 wounded Dragoon and 3 wounded horses. =Frontier duty= After the Mexican–American War, the 2nd Dragoons headed west to protect the settlers on the new frontier that had just been gained by the United States in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. In June 1849, F Company, under MAJ Ripley Arnold, established Fort Worth along the Trinity River. These years were spent patrolling the frontier in order to protect American settlers heading west from hostile Indians. In 1854, the Companies E and K of the regiment defeated a sizable Sioux force in the Battle of Ash Hollow in Nebraska, forcing the Sioux to sign a peace treaty. In late 1857, in response to growing hostilities between federal authorities and Mormon settlers in Utah, a battalion of the 2nd Dragoons was sent to quell any Mormon resistance to federal power. These Dragoons, under LTC Philip St. George Cooke, joined a 2,500-man expedition and began the march to Utah, and in response, Brigham Young, the Mormon leader, mobilized the Nauvoo Legion to combat this force. Peace talks succeeded before much blood was shed, but the 2nd Dragoons still had to complete a long and arduous winter march across the frontier. The Utah War ended in July 1858. On 14 June 1858, William S. Harney was promoted to Brigadier General, and LTC St. George Cooke was made the 3rd Colonel of the 2nd Dragoons. On 1 October 1858, other elements of the 2nd Dragoons that hadn't gone to Utah were engaging in operations against the Comanche in Texas. In the summer of 1858, a group of Dragoons pursued a number of Comanche who had captured a white child, but soon were ambushed by 25 braves. The firefight escalated and the Dragoons and Texas Rangers fought off a band of roughly 500 Comanches, and killed 70 after five hours of fighting. The captured child was rescued in the end, and the engagement became known as the Battle of the Wichita Village. =Civil War= The final charge at the Battle of Winchester. Sgt Conrad Schmidt At the onset of the Civil War in 1861, the regiment was recalled to the Eastern theater and redesignated on 3 August 1861 as the Second Cavalry Regiment. Thomas J. Wood was named the fourth Colonel of the regiment, but was promoted out of the job shortly after. Throughout the war, the 2nd Cavalry would be commanded by many company-grade officers such as Captains Wesley Merritt and Theophilus Francis Rodenbough. C Company was the last unit of the regiment to fight as dragoons; during the Battle of Wilson's Creek. For much of the war, it was a key part of either the \\"Reserve Brigade\\" or the \\"Regular Brigade\\" of the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac and served in numerous campaigns and battles. They fought in numerous battles, including the Siege of Yorktown, the Second Battle of Bull Run, the Battle of Antietam, the Battle of Fredericksburg, the Battle of Chancellorsville, the Battle of Gettysburg, the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, and the Battle of Cold Harbor. During the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862, SGT Martin Hagan of the 2nd Cavalry and a small group of troopers held a Confederate cavalry brigade at bay, covering the Union retreat across the river. This action was completed without the loss of a man or a horse, and SGT Hagan was awarded the regiment's first Medal of Honor. The 2nd Cavalry was also present during the Stoneman Raid just prior to the Battle of Chancellorsville. This raid is regarded as the \\"resurgence of the Union Cavalry.\\" During the Battle of Kelly's Ford, the 2nd Cavalry became the first Union cavalry regiment to engage Confederate General J.E.B. Stuart's cavalry in a head-to-head charge. This action hurt Stuart's reputation in the eyes of Southern leadership, just three weeks before the Battle of Gettysburg. Leading up to the Battle of Gettysburg, the 2nd Cavalry fought a continuous recon and counter-recon with Stuart's cavalry until the two armies met at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Here, the regiment dismounted and skirmished the Confederates in a delaying action until the main Union force could reach the battlefield. During the Battle of Trevilian Station in June 1864, the 2nd Cavalry Regiment charged the Confederate Cavalry and smashed their lines. CPT T.F. Rodenbough led the charge and was wounded, but earned the Medal of Honor for his heroism in this brief but savage charge. Returning to duty in September 1864, he led the regiment in another charge during the Third Battle of Winchester. He was wounded again and lost his mount and right arm. First Sergeant Conrad Schmidt of K Company bravely rode back under fire to rescue his regimental commander. Schmidt was given the Medal of Honor for his swift and courageous action. On 9 October 1864, the 2nd Cavalry, as part of the reserve brigade of the 1st Cavalry Division, the regiment attacked the flanks of the Confederate line, forcing them to retreat. During this action, PVT Edward Hanson of H Company earned the Medal of Honor for braving enemy fire to capture the flag of the 32nd Virginia Cavalry. The 2nd Cavalry Regiment earned 14 battle streamers and 5 Medals of Honor during their Civil War service. Lt William Orton Williams. William Preston Longley Deserter from Company B 2nd Cavalry 1870-1872 In 1895 Second Lieutenant Cornelius C. Smith, a Medal of Honor recipient, posed with his favorite horse, Blue, in front of his quarters while serving in the 2d Cavalry. Like the other early mounted units, many members of the Second Cavalry went on to higher ranks and command positions on both sides during the war. A former lieutenant of the regiment, Colonel Orton Williams, C.S.A who had been commissioned into the regiment on the recommendation of Robert E. Lee, was hanged as a spy by the federal authorities in 1863. =Indian wars= When the Civil War ended, the 2nd Cavalry Regiment was sent west to fight against hostile Indian tribes and protect American settlers. With US troops focused on fighting Confederate forces in the east, the Indians of the frontier grew bolder. The vastness of the American frontier meant that the regiment was seldom together, and was spread out, often with only one troop occupying a post. In December 1866, 25 troopers of the 2nd Cavalry under LT George W. Grummond accompanied CPT William J. Fetterman in his expedition against Chief Red Cloud. In northern Wyoming, these 81 men were engaged by a force of roughly 1,000 Indians, where they were all massacred in a desperate battle. On 29 June 1867, a small party of 10 troopers and 1 Indian scout under LT Lyman Kidder were ordered to take dispatches from General William Sherman to LTC George A. Custer. Custer grew impatient and moved out ahead of schedule, and when LT Kidder's party arrived, they found the camp to be deserted. Making their way to Fort Wallace, the troopers were set upon by a band of Lakota and Cheyenne warriors near present- day Goodland, Kansas. The 12 cavalrymen and scout were surrounded and killed to a man, and their bodies were scalped and mutilated. However, they managed to kill an enemy chief, Yellow Horse, in the fight (known as the Kidder massacre). On 23 January 1870, elements of Companies F, G, H, and L participated in the Marias Massacre in the Montana Territory, where 200 Piegan Blackfeet Indians were killed. After this massacre, Federal Indian policy changed under President Grant, and more peaceful solutions were sought. On 15 May 1870, SGT Patrick James Leonard was leading a party of 4 other troopers from C Company along the Little Blue River in Nebraska attempting to locate stray horses. A band of 50 Indians surrounded this detachment and the men raced for cover and made a fortified position with their two dead horses. One trooper, PVT Thomas Hubbard, was wounded, but they managed to hold the Indians at bay and inflicted several casualties. When the hostile band retreated after an hour of fighting, the troopers left, took a settler family under their charge and returned safely. All 5 men were awarded the Medal of Honor (SGT Patrick J. Leonard, and PVTs Heth Canfield, Michael Himmelsback, Thomas Hubbard, and George W. Thompson). Today, junior NCOs in the 2nd Cavalry Regiment compete for the Sergeant Patrick James Leonard award. On 17 March 1876, troopers from Companies E, I, and K (156 men) joined the 3rd US Cavalry Regiment under COL Joseph J. Reynolds to combat the Cheyenne and Lakota in the ill-fated Big Horn Expedition. During the Battle of Powder River, the cavalrymen attacked, but were repulsed, and the 2nd Cavalry lost 1 man killed and 5 wounded. 66 men also suffered from frostbite. The 2nd Cavalry was once again repulsed by the Cheyenne and Lakota at the Battle of the Rosebud on 17 June 1876, and only a few days later, Custer's 7th Cavalry were defeated at the Battle of Little Bighorn. By April 1877, most of the US cavalry was in the west, fighting against bands of hostile Indians. The Cheyenne surrendered in December, Sitting Bull escaped to Canada, and Crazy Horse, the victorious chief in the Battles of the Rosebud and Little Bighorn, surrendered in April 1878. Chief Lame Deer was one of the last Lakota war-chiefs left resisting the US Government. The \\"Montana Battalion\\" of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment eventually caught up with his band near the Little Muddy Creek, Montana on 6 May 1878. After a midnight march, the troopers surprised Lame Deer's warriors at dawn on 7 May. H Company charged the village and scattered the enemy horses, while the remaining troopers charged and routed the band of Lakota. During the intense battle, PVT William Leonard of L Company became isolated, and defended his position behind a large rock for two hours before he was rescued by his comrades. He, and PVT Samuel D. Phillips of H Company both earned the Medal of Honor for their gallantry in this battle. While searching the ruined village, the troopers found many uniforms, guidons, and weapons from the 7th Cavalry Regiment, and they left knowing that they had avenged those fallen at Little Bighorn. Map of Bear Paw Battlefield part of Nez Perce National Historical Park On 20 August 1877, elements of the 2nd Cavalry which had been pursuing Chief Joseph's band of Nez Perce Indians through Idaho reported that their quarry had turned on them, stole their pack train, and began attempting to escape to Canada. Despite being low on supplies, L Troop and two additional Troops of the 1st Cavalry were dispatched to retrieve the pack train. After a hard ride, the Indians were overtaken and a fierce battle ensued. CPL Harry Garland, wounded and unable to stand, continued to direct his men in the battle until the Indians withdrew. For his actions, he would receive the Medal of Honor along with three other men from L Troop; 1SG Henry Wilkens, PVT Clark, and Farrier William H. Jones. Today, the annual award for the most outstanding trooper in the 2nd Cavalry is called the Farrier Jones Award. On 18 September, a force of 600 men under General Oliver Otis Howard and Colonel Nelson A. Miles, including Troops F, G, and H of the 2nd Cavalry, marched to stop Chief Joseph's band from reaching Canada. L Troop was sent back to Fort Ellis to gather supplies but would join the expedition later. On 30 September 1877, the Battle of Bear Paw Mountain began. The three Troops of 2nd Cavalry were dispatched to drive away the Indians' ponies by attacking their rear. G Troop, under LT Edward John McClernand, caught up with Chief White Bird as he and his band tried to escape to Canada. The ensuing engagement was brief, but violent, and resulted in the capture of the Indians and their mounts. Lt McClernand was awarded the Medal of Honor for his gallantry. After a four-day siege, Chief Joseph surrendered his band to General Howard on 4 October 1877. In the fall of 1878, the 2nd Cavalry was posted in two forts in Montana; Fort Custer and Fort Keogh with the mission of preventing Chief Sitting Bull from returning to US territory after escaping to Canada. In early winter, Chiefs Dull Knife and Little Wolf left their reservations in Oklahoma and began moving northwards. Dull Knife was intercepted and surrendered at Fort Robinson, Nebraska, but Little Wolf sought shelter in the Sand Hills of Wyoming. Elements of E and I Troop under LT William P. Clark (who had earned a special rapport with the Indians) were sent to negotiate with these stalwarts. The band was located near Box Elder Creek, Montana on 25 March 1879, and was persuaded to accompany the troopers back to Fort Keogh. During the march back, on 5 April, several Indians escaped and attacked the soldiers. SGT T.B. Glover took 10 men of B Troop and charged the numerically superior enemy, forcing them to surrender, and SGT Glover received the Medal of Honor for this action. Chief Little Wolf eventually surrendered his band when the party returned to Fort Keogh. In the winter of 1886, the 2nd Cavalry Regiment was charged with preventing Indians from crossing the border from Canada and protecting settlers in Montana and Wyoming. In early March 1887, a large band of Sioux entered Montana from Canada without warning, and C Troop from Camp Stambaugh, Wyoming and E Troop from Fort Sanders, Wyoming were sent to pursue them. After a 150-mile chase, the combatants met at O'Fallon's Creek, Montana. In the fierce battle that followed, the cavalrymen killed many braves and captured 46 of their horses. CPT Eli L. Huggins and 2LT Lloyd M. Brett both earned the Medal of Honor during this battle for their intrepid leadership and courage. This action forced the Sioux to flee back to Canada. CPT Huggins became the 12th Colonel of the 2nd Cavalry, and today, the annual Regimental award for the most outstanding junior officer is named in honor of CPT Eli L. Huggins. During the Indian Wars, the 2nd Cavalry Regiment earned 13 battle streamers to add to their flag, and 15 troopers received the Medal of Honor for their gallantry. =Spanish–American War= When the Spanish–American War began, the 2nd Cavalry Regiment was stationed in Kansas, Colorado, and New Mexico and assembled together in Georgia, the first time the entire regiment had been together since the Civil War. The troopers and horses of Troops A, C, D, and F boarded transports in Mobile, Alabama and set sail for Cuba, while the rest of the regiment traveled overland to Tampa, Florida. Due to a lack of transports, they served as logistical troops, and helped load units like Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders onto their ships. These four troops quickly found that they were the only horse-mounted cavalry units in Cuba, and soon began working for General William Rufus Shafter. Joining Teddy Roosevelt and the Rough Riders, the 2nd Cavalry fought at the Battle of El Caney, the Battle of San Juan Hill, the Battle of the Aguadores, and the Siege of Santiago. During the armistice period, the women and children of Santiago were sent out of the city and into American lines to a camp in El Caney. D Troop was in charge of feeding and policing these 22,000 refugees. B Troop was committed to the Puerto Rican Campaign in July and August 1898, but illness forced them to return to the US. In January 1899, the entire regiment began pacification duty in Cuba where they remained for three years, facilitating public education and improving the island's sanitation. =The Philippines and the Mexican Border= The 2nd Cavalry Regiment was sent to the Philippines during the Philippine Insurrection soon after their tenure in Cuba. From 23 January – 18 July 1905, they participated in the Cavite Campaign, working to root out insurgents and secure the surrounding countryside. On 14 February 1910, the troopers of the 2nd Cavalry fought in the Battle of Tiradores Hill on Mindanao island. Their next clashes were during the Moro Rebellion on Jolo island. They fought in the Battle of Mount Bagoak on 3 December 1911, and the Battle of Mount Vrut from 10–12 January 1912. The regiment continued patrolling and security operations until they arrived home in June 1912. When they returned to the US in 1912, the 2nd Cavalry was sent to the border of Mexico to enforce border laws and prevent raids by banditos. The regiment's sector extended from El Paso, Texas all the way to Presidio, Texas, a stretch of 262 miles. The troopers were busily engaged in the duties of border surveillance and border security. In December 1913, the 2nd Cavalry was moved out of their post at Fort Bliss and sent to Fort Ethan Allen, Vermont to conduct maneuvers with several Army National Guard units. In 1914, troopers of the 2nd Cavalry were selected to represent the US Army in the annual horse show in Madison Square Garden in New York City. =World War I= The USA entered World War I on the side of the Allies on 6 April 1917. The 2nd Cavalry Regiment, while at Fort Ethan Allen, was split into thirds; one third remained as the 2nd Cavalry, and the other two became the 18th Cavalry Regiment and the 19th Cavalry Regiment. These \\"skeletons\\" of cadre were then recruited to full strength. Later in the year, the 18th Cavalry was redesignated as the 76th Field Artillery Regiment, and the 19th Cavalry was redesignated as the 77th Field Artillery Regiment. The 76th Field Artillery served with the 3rd Infantry Division during the war and their unit heraldry still bears the insignia of the 2nd Dragoons. The 77th Field Artillery served with distinction with the 4th Infantry Division. General Pershing, the commander of the American Expeditionary Force, arrived in France on 26 June 1917, and 31 troopers from the 2nd Cavalry Headquarters Troop served as his escort. These were the first American troops to land on European soil in the First World War. April 1918 saw the rest of the 2nd Cavalry arrive in France. The regiment was sent to the Toul sector and was initially used to manage horse remount depots and as a military police unit. Troops B, D, F, and H were formed into a provisional squadron and were the last element of the regiment to engage the enemy as horse-mounted cavalry. The 2nd Cavalry fought in the Aisne-Marne Offensive from 18 July – 6 August 1918, and assisted the 1st Infantry Division and the 2nd Infantry Division penetrate the German flanks at Soissons. Detachments of the 2nd Cavalry also fought in the Oise-Aisne Offensive from 8 August – 11 September 1918. The troopers of the 2nd Cavalry also served with distinction in the Battle of Saint-Mihiel; Troops A, B, C, D, F, G, and H fought valiantly under the command of LTC D.P.M. Hazzard from 12–16 September. At this point in the war, 6 American divisions massed on an 18-mile front separate from any European command. The 1st Infantry Division began their attack on Mount Sec and reached the Germans reserve lines. From here, the 2nd Cavalry passed through the forest and scouted the open country around Heudicourt, Creue, and Vigneulles. Elements of the regiment advanced to Saint Maurice, Woël, and Jonville to pursue the retreating enemy. The 2nd Cavalry's next engagement, the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, would be the largest battle the AEF would fight in World War I. From 26 September – 11 November 1918, the regiment was attached to the 35th Infantry Division and served as the left flank of the advance. Later they served as the main effort of the advance between the Meuse River and the Argonne Forest. From 26 September-2 October, spearheading the assault on the left flank, the 2nd Cavalry fought in a six-day running battle starting in Vauquois and winding through the woods nearby. The men from the Regiment were commended for \\"...accomplishing their tasks with fearlessness, courage, and disregard for danger and hardship.\\" By the end of the war, 2nd Cavalry troopers had earned three more campaign streamers for the regimental standard for their gallant service. The 2nd Cavalry remained in Koblenz, Germany as part of the Army of Occupation until August 1919. =World War II= In the years prior to American entry into the Second World War, the 2nd Cavalry was garrisoned at Fort Riley, Kansas from 1919–1939. They performed their peacetime duties as a school training regiment for the Cavalry School. Here at Fort Riley, the regiment was equipped with its first armored cars in 1936, the year they celebrated their centennial, marking 100 years of proud national service. In 1938, the 1st Armored Regiment and the 13th Armored Regiment joined the 2nd Cavalry for maneuvers at Fort Riley, to practice and develop combined arms tactics. These maneuvers combined infantry, cavalry, armored, artillery, and aviation units. Nazi Germany's Invasion of Poland in 1939 forced American strategists to focus on building up the Army's armored capabilities, and the Attack on Pearl Harbor thrust the US into the war. On 15 May 1942, the 2nd Cavalry Regiment said farewell to their horses, and the all the troops and equipment were transferred to the newly formed 2nd Armored Regiment attached to the 9th Armored Division. Other elements eventually stemmed from this regiment and went on to fight in the European and Pacific theaters of war, but shared the same heritage and history of the 2nd Cavalry. These units are; the 2nd Tank Battalion, 19th Tank Battalion, 776th Amphibian Tank Battalion, and D Company 89th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron. On 23 December 1943, the regiment was redesignated the 2nd Mechanized Cavalry Group, or the 2nd MCG (Between 1943-46 cavalry were organized into Groups, but this term is interchangeable with Regiment in this context). Charles H. Reed became the 31st Colonel of the Regiment. It was reorganized as the Headquarters and Headquarters Troop (HHT), 2nd Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron, Mechanized (present day 1st Squadron), and 42nd Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron, Mechanized (present day 2nd Squadron). In July 1944, the 2nd MCG landed in Normandy as part of General Patton's Third Army. Their early assignments during the Battle of Normandy included rear area security, attempting to disrupt the activities of German infiltrators. They were then attached to General Troy Middleton's VIII Corps during Operation Cobra, and served as a flank security and reconnaissance element for the 4th Armored Division. The cavalry scouts performed such daring reconnaissance missions that their German foes gave them the nickname, \\"Ghosts of Patton's Army.\\" In August, the 2nd MCG conducted recon of the city of Nantes and aggressively used its light armor and firepower to probe the edges of the Wehrmacht's defense. As the Third Army began to advance east, the 2nd MCG protected the vulnerable rear and supply lines over a large frontage of 45 miles between Nantes and Angers, as well as the area west of Nantes. In small patrols, the cavalrymen screened the main drive east and disrupted German movement in the Rennes-Nantes Corridor for ten days until 23 August 1944. Now assigned to XII Corps, the 2nd MCG began moving east toward Lorraine. On 26 August, the 42nd Squadron attacked a German regimental-sized unit near Carisey, protecting the southern flank of the 4th Armored Division as it drove on Troyes. On 30 August, the Dragoons led the XII Corps assault across the Marne River, with the 2nd Squadron in front of the 80th Infantry Division and the 42nd Squadron in front of the 4th Armored Division. By 2 September, the drive reached the Moselle River near Toul and the 2nd Squadron began scouting for possible crossing points. Despite a failed crossing attempt by 80th Division troops against stiff resistance, the 2nd MCG was active in scouting and screening during this period. On 4 September, B and F Troops of the 42nd Squadron defeated a column of 1,000 German soldiers attempting to attack the XII Corps flank by massing direct fire from their light tanks, and indirect fire from artillery units. On 7 September, the 602nd Tank Destroyer Battalion, equipped with M18 Hellcats, was attached to the 2nd MCG. This allowed the 42nd Squadron to assault and capture Fort de Pont-Saint- Vincent and defeat an enemy counterattack. The 2nd MCG then began to protect the southern flank of the 4th Armored Division as it fought to envelop Nancy on 11 September 1944. They were often engaged in heavy contact against German units while protecting the flanks of the 4th Armored Division's assault. On 16 September, the Dragoons launched a squadron-sized attack on Lunéville. The Germans put up a vigorous defense but could not hold against the 2nd MCG, and retreated. However, on 18 September, elements of the 111th Panzer Brigade counterattacked with \\"six Panther tanks and two companies of infantry.\\" The Panzers' armor was too thick and the cavalrymen were forced to retreat. This was the beginning of the Battle of Arracourt. Conducting a delaying action, the two squadrons worked in tandem and managed to keep the enemy at bay until 1100, when reinforcements of the 4th Armored Division arrived and beat back the Germans. This battle provides a perfect example of how Mechanized Cavalry Groups were designed to function in World War II. Had it not been for the screening and delaying efforts of the 2nd MCG, the main effort of the Wehrmacht attack would have fallen on the flank of the 4th Armored Division. In late October, the 2nd MCG was assigned to protect the flanks of the 26th Infantry Division by seizing Moncourt Ridge. Despite fierce German resistance, the 42nd Squadron dismounted and attacked along a two-mile front and seized their objectives. The attack was conducted entirely dismounted with cavalrymen acting as infantry, much like dragoons, and showed that MCG's could be flexible. The cavalry group continued to screen and protect the flanks of the 26th Division until 22 November, when the 2nd MCG was split up. The 2nd Squadron remained in the south to cover the gap and maintain contact between XII Corps and XV Corps of the Seventh Army. The 42nd Squadron was sent north to assist the 80th Infantry Division and maintain contact with XX Corps. On 14 December 1944, the 2nd MCG joined the 35th Infantry Division as it was assaulting the Siegfried Line. They were relieved on 22 December by the 44th Infantry Division and moved north to assist in the relief of Bastogne. Holding the flank against the Germans, the 2nd MCG freed up troops needed for the assault on the southern shoulder of the Bastogne salient. This period was marked by active patrolling and small unit actions to harass the Germans and divert their attention from their main objectives. In early January 1945, C Troop of the 2nd Squadron seized the town of Machtum, killing nine Germans and capturing fourteen, while only losing three wounded. On 7 February 1945, the 2nd MCG screened the advance of the XII Corps across the Sauer River, and conducted their own assault across the Moselle on 19 February in order to support the advance of the 10th Armored Division. The 2nd Squadron dismounted and led the attack; they seized the town of Wincheringen, and captured 30–40 Germans at the loss of 5 killed and 22 wounded. Conducting limited patrols along the Moselle, the 2nd MCG was assigned to the 76th Infantry Division and was sent to clear the compromised southern flank of the division. After completing this mission, the 42nd Squadron attacked the town of Zemmer on 7 March, and killed 10 Germans, and captured 61. On 2 April, the cavalrymen, conducting scouting and screening missions, located and liberated 3,328 US and 3,205 Allied POWs, including a Soviet general near Bad Orb. The rapid nature of the US advance made rear security of paramount importance, and the 2nd MCG conducted this mission along with other cavalry units. On 10 April, the 42nd Squadron attacked 300 SS troops and 3 tanks near Gleicherwiesen, destroying the enemy's freedom of movement and protecting the advance of XII Corps. One of the most remarkable missions the 2nd MCG performed was at the end of the war. On 28 April, A Troop, 42nd Squadron seized the town of Hostouň in Czechoslovakia in order to liberate Allied POWs. They discovered 300 POWs, as well as 670 horses, including the famous Lipizzaner stallions. General Patton, a cavalryman himself, ordered their rescue when he learned that the Lipizzaners would fall under Soviet control. On 12 May, four days after VE Day, \\"Operation Cowboy\\" was launched to rescue the fine horses, and all were successfully herded or ridden back to American lines. This was dramatized by Walt Disney in the 1963 movie, Miracle of the White Stallions. =Cold War= The Cold War began in 1945 with the ending of World War II, and the 2nd Cavalry was charged with conducting border surveillance along the Iron Curtain. In 1951, the regiment was headquartered in Nuremberg and operated out of the cities of Freising and Augsburg. In 1955, the cavalry returned to the US and were relieved by the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment. They returned to Germany in 1958, and would remain there for the next 33 years; they operated out of Nuremberg, Feucht, Bindlach, Amberg, and Bamberg. Throughout this period, the 2nd Cavalry was responsible for reconnoitering and providing border security along 731 kilometers of the Iron Curtain; 375 km along with West German-East German border, and 365 km along the West German-Czechoslovak border. In 1978, M Troop, of 3rd Squadron, was selected to represent the US in the 1979 Canadian Army Trophy (CAT), finishing 4th – the first time the US entrant had not placed last. In 1989, the Iron Curtain was lifted, and the regiment halted their border security missions on 1 March 1990. =Operation Desert Storm= When the Gulf War began in 1990, the regiment was ordered to move to Saudi Arabia and prepare for combat operations. By mid-December, the 2nd ACR had established itself in the VII Corps sector of the Saudi desert and began training to fight. The 210th Field Artillery Brigade, AH-64 Apache helicopters from 2-1 Aviation Battalion, and the 82nd Engineer Battalion joined the regiment to form \\"Dragoon Battle Group,\\" a force of 8,500 soldiers. On 23 February 1991, the 2nd Cavalry attacked across the Saudi–Iraq border after preparatory fires, and engaged in their first combat operation in 45 years. Spearheading the VII Corps advance, the regiment attacked into southern Iraq and fought a series of sharp battles with four divisions of the Iraqi Army. The 2nd and 3rd Squadrons of the regiment destroyed two brigades of the Iraqi Republican Guards Tawakalna Division in the Battle of 73 Easting. The 2nd Squadron, 2nd ACR alone contributed 55 Iraqi tanks destroyed, 45 other armored vehicles, an equal number of trucks, hundreds of Iraqi infantry KIA, and 865 Iraqi soldiers taken prisoner.Guardia p.71 The unit earned the Valorous Unit Award for its service in Operation Desert Storm. By the end of its covering force mission in Iraq, the 2nd ACR had broken the Republican Guard's defensive line, provided intelligence to the VII Corps commander, and moved over 250 kilometers. It also captured 2,000 prisoners, destroyed 159 enemy tanks, and 260 other vehicles. The regiment's losses include 6 Dragoons killed, and 19 wounded. =Haiti= Returning from the Gulf, the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment was inactivated at Nuremberg, Germany. The regiment was reactivated as the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment (Light) in 1992 by renaming the previous 199th Infantry Brigade (Motorized), the former 3rd Brigade, 9th Infantry Division,Dinackus, \\"Order of Battle: Allied Ground Forces of Operation Dessert Storn,\\" p 11-3 at Fort Lewis, Washington. The regiment's ground squadrons became light cavalry units equipped with Humvees mounted with TOW launchers, Mk 19 grenade launchers, .50 caliber machine guns and M249 light machine guns (SAWs). The 2nd ACR (Light) was then sent to Fort Polk in Louisiana in 1992. From there, the regiment deployed in support of the peace enforcement operation in Haiti from 1995 to 1996; Operation Uphold Democracy. The 3rd Squadron (\\"Wolfpack\\") was the first ground unit to deploy and operated under the 25th Infantry Division in Port au Prince, Haiti. After six months in Haiti, 1st Squadron arrived to replace 3rd Squadron. In October 1995, 2nd Squadron replaced 3rd Squadron and redeployed in March 1996 completing the cycle. In Haiti the Dragoons served in a number of different roles. They guarded humanitarian relief convoys, and served as the United Nations Quick Reaction Force (UNQRF). They also seized illegal weapons, conducted security patrols, and protected the Haitian president, and the US President (Bill Clinton) and Vice President (Al Gore) when they visited the island. =Bosnia service= In April 1997, the regiment received orders to be prepared to deploy to Bosnia and Herzegovina. Following the first mission rehearsal exercise held at the JRTC in June, the unit moved to Germany to begin integration with the 1st Armored Division. Meanwhile, all its equipment was shipped to the intermediate staging base at Taszar, Hungary. The regiment's participation in Operation Joint Guard began when the 2nd and 3rd Squadrons moved across the Sava River into Bosnia in August 1997 to augment the 1st Infantry Division (Forward) in support of Bosnia-Herzegovina's municipal elections. The regiment's air cavalry, the 4th Squadron and the Regimental Support Squadron also moved into the country. The regiment's separate units – the 502nd Military Intelligence Company; the 84th Engineer Company; Company H (Aviation Maintenance), 159th Aviation Regiment; and the Air Defense Battery – completed the regimental troop list. While the ground squadrons were in Bosnia, the regimental headquarters deployed to Germany to train with the 1st Armored Division Headquarters in preparation for assuming command in Bosnia. During August and September, the regiment was spread across five countries on two continents, and was under the direct command and control of three different general officer commands. This period included another first for any Army unit during a 12-month period: the regiment participated in major training exercises at all three of the Army's combat training centers: The National Training Center (NTC) at Fort Irwin, the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) at Fort Polk, and the Joint Multinational Readiness Center (JMRC) at Hohenfels, Germany. In October the remainder of the regiment rode into theater, assuming responsibility for the American sector of Multinational Division (North), which stretched from the war-torn bridge at Brčko in the north to the shattered city of Srebrenica in the south. The first major action of the regiment in Bosnia was the seizing of Serbian radio-television towers to control communications into the Republika Srpska. Other significant operations that the regiment conducted include: the restructuring of the Republika Srpska Specialist Police; the creation of the first multi-ethnic police department, in the city of Brčko; security for the announcement of the Brcko Arbitration Decision (an effort to resolve the status of this Serb- dominated city within Bosnia); institution of common license plates and currency in Bosnia, and the opening of the Bosnian rail system. In conducting operations in this sector, the regiment executed an estimated 12,500 patrols and 480 weapon storage site inspections, supervised the removal of over 12,000 mines, and oversaw 350 training exercises for the former warring factions. The regiment served one of the longest tours of military units there. =War on Terror= After returning from Bosnia, the unit remained at Fort Polk, Louisiana. On 13 April 2002, B Troop, 1-2 Cavalry deployed to Southwest Asia in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and the Global War of Terror. They provided port and site security in Kuwait, Qatar, Jordan, and Djibouti, and were relieved by L Troop, 3-2 Cavalry, in October, who continued these duties. Iraq War On 5 April 2003, 2nd Squadron was deployed again to the Gulf for Operation Iraqi Freedom. The rest of the regiment arrived in May and operated in eastern Baghdad. The troopers worked to improve the peoples' lives, and provided security to infrastructure sites such as power stations, telephone stations, fuel stations, schools, and hospitals. The 2nd Armored Cavalry also took direct action in hundreds of raids to disrupt the activities of the Fedayeen Saddam militia. The regiment also trained several companies of the Iraqi Civil Defense Corps (ICDC) to assist their operations. On 19 August 2003, a VBIED detonated near a UN compound and a spinal cord clinic causing consternation and much damage. Elements of the 2nd Cavalry rushed to secure the area, and saved the lives of 125 UN workers. On 4 April 2004, the 2nd Armored Cavalry and the 1st BCT-1st Cavalry Division engaged in fierce urban fighting during the Siege of Sadr City. The Dragoons and thousands of Muqtada al-Sadr's militiamen, the Mahdi Army, clashed in a violent battle that cost 8 US and 300 enemy deaths. This initial battle marked the beginning of several more uprisings throughout Iraq, and the 2nd Cavalry was soon sent south to battle insurgents in Hillah, Al Kut, An Najaf, Kufa, and Al Diwaniyah. This action forced them to stay in Iraq for a further three months. The battles of Al Kut, Kufa, and Al Diwaniyah were short, but intense. The regiment was forced to retake each town from hostile forces and seize government buildings. In An Najaf, hundreds of Mahdi Militiamen fought a protracted urban campaign that lasted a few weeks. In late June 2004, the 2nd Cavalry was relieved by elements of the 1st Infantry Division and returned to Fort Polk on 15 July 2004. In Iraq, the Dragoons suffered 21 killed and over 100 wounded. They had inflicted 1,000 deaths on their enemy and captured hundreds more. A total of 16 months was spent in combat, and the regiment earned another Presidential Unit Citation. On its return from combat operations, the 2nd ACR found itself heading back to Fort Lewis in Washington in December 2004. The regiment was re-designated the 2nd Cavalry Regiment and reorganized as a Stryker brigade combat team in April 2005. On 1 June 2006 at Fort Lewis, Washington, the 2nd Cavalry Regiment and the 1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division conducted a joint re-flagging and Casing of the Colors ceremony. The 2nd CR was reflagged as the 4th Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division (Stryker). The 1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division cased its brigade colors and was reflagged as the 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment. The Army re-stationed 2nd SCR to Rose Barracks, Vilseck, Germany, near the regiment's Cold War home of Nuremberg, as of 15 September 2006. With a foundation of infantry-based tactics and the mobility of the Stryker vehicle, the Stryker unit has become more of a hybrid, filling the gap between pure, light infantry and the mechanized, heavy infantry. A 2nd Cavalry Regiment soldier, watches a young Iraqi boy pound steel into chainlinks during his platoon's patrol through the market area in the Karkh District of Baghdad September 8, 2007. On 12 August 2007, the Dragoons arrived in Kuwait and prepared for another combat deployment in Iraq. On 13 September, the regiment replaced the 3rd Stryker Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division at Camp Liberty, Baghdad as part of President George W. Bush's surge campaign. 1st Squadron (War Eagles), with Troops A, B, and C, was sent to NE Baghdad to work in Sadr City, Hayy Ur, Thawra, Jamilla, and Adhamiyah. They conducted numerous cordon- and-search, checkpoint, and raid missions until the Jaysh al-Mahdi uprising in March 2008. Joining with Iraqi Army and Iraqi Police, 1st Squadron fought these insurgents until a ceasefire was brokered on 11 March.

G, H, and I Troops were sent to the \\"breadbasket of Iraq\\" in the Hamrin Mountains during Operation Raider Harvest to clear out AQI strongholds. From December 2007-October 2008, the region was made safer and infrastructure was improved by the squadron as they defeated numerous AQI cells and conducted humanitarian operations. 4th Squadron (Sabre), with Troops O, P, Q, and elements of I moved to FOB Prosperity in the Al Karkh district of the Green Zone. Here, the troopers secured the heart of Baghdad and turned it into one of the most secure areas of the city; they successfully partnered with units of the Iraqi Army and police to accomplish this mission. Fires Squadron (Hell), with A, B, and C Batteries along with support from K Troop, was based out of Camp Taji to secure the region of Agar Quf northeast of Baghdad. C Battery acted as the reserve force of the 1st Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division and conducted air assault mission to kill or capture high value targets. The remainder of the squadron continued to secure the Agar Quf region and conducted both combat and humanitarian operations. In January 2008, Fires Squadron was returned to Regimental control, and 1st Battalion-21st Infantry Regiment (Gimlets) was attached to the 2nd Cavalry. In April 2008, the 2nd Cavalry Regiment moved to Diyala Governorate to replace the 4th Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division and joined with elements of the 3rd Cavalry Regiment to combat extremist Sunni and Shia militias.

He also served on the Los Angeles Water Board. He was also known as M. H. Sherman and General M. H. Sherman. Biography =Early life= Moses Sherman was born in West Rupert, Vermont, on December 3, 1853. He obtained a teaching certificate at the Oswego Normal School (now SUNY Oswego) in Oswego, New York. He began as a teacher in Salem, New York and Wisconsin, after which he moved to Arizona. =Early career= In 1874, he moved to Prescott, Arizona, a small mining town where he continued teaching for two more years. In Prescott, he acquired his capital brokering mines and ranches while a teacher. John C. Fremont, then Governor of Arizona, appointed Sherman State Superintendent of Public Instruction. He earned the title, \\"General\\" after his appointment as Adjutant-General of the Territory of Arizona, in which position he served two terms. He would use the title \\"General\\" for the rest of his life. In 1884, he helped found the Valley Bank of Phoenix, acting as President while simultaneously building the Phoenix Railway and some canal and water services. With associate M. E. Collins, he donated ten acres of land for the capitol in Phoenix when the town became capital of the territory in 1889. He moved to Los Angeles, California, in 1890 to speculate in land and use the new electric railway, or trolley system, to promote his real estate ventures. He made millions and sold control of his Los Angeles Pacific lines to E.H. Harriman in 1906 for a reported additional six million dollars. =Los Angeles Consolidated Electric Railway= Los Angeles Pacific Railroad- Balloon Route map, 1905 Los Angeles Pacific - Balloon Route car, 1905 He started the Los Angeles Consolidated Electric Railway,Electric Railway Historical Association of Southern California, ERHA.org, Los Angeles Consolidated Electric Railway, California Illustrated, 1892 and made his brother-in-law, Eli P.

On June 16, 1903, Los Angeles Pacific Railroad merged with the Los Angeles-Santa Monica Railroad Company and the Los Angeles, Hermosa Beach and Redondo Railway Company. The new name after this merger was Los Angeles Pacific Railroad of California, but everyone continued to call it the Los Angeles Pacific Railroad. In March, 1906, an agreement was reached to sell control of the Los Angeles Pacific to E.H. Harriman’s Southern Pacific Railroad for a reported $6 million. =Hueneme, Malibu and Port Los Angeles Railway= Sherman was one of the incorporators of the Hueneme, Malibu and Port Los Angeles Railway, which was founded by Frederick Hastings Rindge and built, after he died, by his wife, May K. Rindge, in Malibu, California. Developing Los Angeles =Sherman (West Hollywood)= At the junction of his streetcar lines west of Hollywood, he built car barns and created a town called \\"Sherman\\".

Accessed 08 November 2012 =Port Ballona/Playa del Rey= In the late-19th century, Moye C. Wicks and Louis Mesmer thought of turning the Playa del Rey estuary into a commercial port. They formed the Ballona Development Company in 1888 to develop the area, but three years later the company went bankrupt. Sherman purchased 1,000 acres of land around the Ballona lagoon and Port Ballona in 1902 under the name the Beach Land Company. Sherman and Clark renamed the land \\"Del Rey\\". Port Ballona was then renamed Playa Del Rey. The port was serviced by the California Central Railway opened in September 1887, this line later became the Santa Fe Railway, that later became the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad. The rail line ran from the port to Redondo junction. A street car tram line was built to the port by the Redondo and Hermosa Beach Railroad company, which had been incorporated on February 21, 1901. This company was part of the Los Angeles Pacific Railroad owned by Sherman and Clark. The tram line opened December 1902, departing from downtown at 4th & Broadway.erha.org Los Angeles Pacific Corporate Historiesdelreync.org, Del Rey Neighborhood Council, Marina Del Rey History =San Fernando Valley= 1920 Sherman Way in downtown Owensmouth, with Los Angeles Pacific Railroad line In 1904, in his role on the Board of Water Commissioners, he received advanced notice of purchases of water rights in the Owens Valley—Owens River for the proposed Los Angeles aqueduct, planned by William Mulholland and Fred Eaton. The additional water to Los Angeles, with the aqueduct's terminus in the San Fernando Valley, triggered a rush by land speculators to buy Valley real estate. The formation of a land speculation syndicate, the Los Angeles Suburban Homes Company, included Moses Sherman and partners Hobart Johnstone Whitley, Isaac Newton Van Nuys, James Boon Lankershim, and Harry Chandler, manager of the Los Angeles Times, as directors. The syndicate purchased the parcel from the Los Angeles Farming and Milling Company, owned by Van Nuys and son-in-law Lankershim, in 1909. It comprised nearly the entire south half of the San Fernando Valley (south of present-day Roscoe Blvd.). The price was $2,500,000, or just under $53 an acre. As part of his speculation in the syndicate purchase, General Sherman (as he was called) retained property in what later became the neighborhood of Sherman Oaks, named for him. The income Sherman received from real estate development made up for flagging railroad profits. Pacific Electric Line and Sherman Way In 1911 Sherman directed the construction of the new San Fernando Line, a long extension of the Pacific Electric railway system, to serve the Los Angeles Suburban Homes Company developments. Starting at the terminus of an existing line over Cahuenga Pass from Hollywood to Lankershim (present-day North Hollywood), the line went west through the townsite of Van Nuys in 1911, the mid-valley townsite of Marion (present-day Reseda), to its terminus in the townsite of Owensmouth (present-day Canoga Park) in 1912. The streetcar line, with tracks along the \\"$500,000 boulevard\\" named Sherman Way, was the key to the development. By 1912, 45-minute streetcar service from Van Nuys to downtown and the \\"no speed limit\\" paved road (if you could get your \\"Model T\\" to do 30 mph) were key selling points. The entire grand road's length was originally named \\"Sherman Way\\" in his recognition. The name remains on the westernmost original segment from Canoga Park and West Hills to Sherman Circle at Van Nuys Boulevard, and now also extends to Burbank. The easternmost original segment, with its electric railway right of way now a landscaped median/Orange Line route, survives as present-day Chandler Boulevard. The north/south original segment, as present-day Van Nuys Boulevard in Van Nuys, connects Chandler Boulevard to Sherman Circle. Hazeltine Avenue, which runs north/south from Sherman Oaks to Panorama City, was named after his daughter Hazeltine. The Pacific Electric's San Fernando Line was closed in 1952http://www.erha.org/pewsfv.htm. In the 2000s the MTA Orange Line restored a dedicated route for cross-valley public transportation. An exclusive busway, it uses the former San Fernando Line and Southern Pacific Railroad right of ways, from North Hollywood to Chatsworth. Sherman Way is currently served by local Metro bus routes 162/163. Personal life He married Harriet Emily Pratt, daughter of Robert H. Pratt, a leading figure in the Central Pacific Railway of San Francisco. They married in 1885 and had two daughters, Hazeltine and Lucy; Sherman also adopted Harriet's son Robert Pierce from a previous marriage. =Death= He died on September 9, 1932.

A member of Parliament from Quebec City, he was a top adviser to Prime Minister W. L. Mackenzie King, especially on issues relating to legal affairs, Quebec and French-speaking Canada. Education, early career Lapointe earned his law degree from Laval University. He was a practicing lawyer in Quebec City, and was appointed Crown Prosecutor for Kamouraska before entering politics. Enters politics He was first elected by acclamation to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1904 general election as the Liberal MP for Kamouraska, and was re-elected in 1908, 1911 and 1917. He resigned his seat in 1919 in order to run in the Quebec East seat vacated by the death of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, and won that. Cabinet minister In 1921, Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King appointed Lapointe to his first Cabinet as Minister of Marine and Fisheries. During his term as minister of fisheries, he negotiated a treaty with the United States on west-coast fishing rights. This was the first time that a Canadian minister negotiated on foreign affairs without any assistance from Great Britain. In 1924 he became Minister of Justice, and served in that position in successive Liberal cabinets until his death in 1941. King's Quebec lieutenant Lapointe served as King's Quebec lieutenant and was one of the most important ministers in Cabinet. King did not speak French; he relied on Lapointe to handle important matters in the province. Lapointe gave a strong Quebecker voice to the cabinet decision, something that had not existed since the defeat of Laurier in 1911.Conrad Black, Rise to Greatness: The history of Canada from the Vikings to the present (2014) p 520 Lapointe shared King's vision of Canadian autonomy from Britain, and chaired the Canadian delegation to the Imperial Conference of 1926. This led to the drafting of the subsequent Balfour Declaration that raised the status of dominions to one of equality with Britain, and eventually led to the Statute of Westminster 1931. In the late 1930s, Lapointe recommended that the federal Cabinet disallow several Acts passed by the Alberta Social Credit government of William Aberhart. However, he did not recommend disallowance of the Padlock Act passed by the Quebec government of Maurice Duplessis, fearing that doing so would only aid the Union Nationale government. Conscription issue Lapointe helped draft Mackenzie King's policy against conscription for overseas service in 1939, and his campaigning helped defeat the Duplessis provincial government in 1939. During the 1939 election, Lapointe made many speeches in the province of Quebec, in which he argued that if Duplessis was to be re-elected, every French Canadian minister would resign from the federal cabinet, leaving it without a francophone voice. Having been a Liberal MP during the 1917 conscription crisis, Lapointe knew how much a new crisis like the last one would destroy the national unity that Mackenzie King had tried to build since 1921. Death Lapointe died in office in 1941, leaving the Canadian government in serious trouble. King decided to appoint the reluctant Louis Saint-Laurent to the cabinet as the new minister of justice. His son, Hugues Lapointe, was also a parliamentarian and Lieutenant Governor of Quebec. Further reading * Betcherman, Lita-Rose.

predecessor units= The Third Brigade of the Tennessee Militia was absorbed into the National Guard of the United States on 25 March 1887 as the 3rd Tennessee Infantry Regiment with headquarters in Knoxville. 1st Battalion was located in Knoxville, and 2d Battalion was located in Chattanooga. In the spring of 1898, the 1st and 2d Battalions were consolidated to form the 6th Tennessee Infantry Regiment. Between 18 and 20 May 1898, the 6th Infantry was re-designated as the Third Tennessee Volunteer Infantry Regiment. =Spanish–American War= The Third Tennessee was mustered into federal service 18–20 May 1898 at Camp Dewy, Nashville for the War with Spain. The Third Tennessee was deployed to Tampa, Florida and later returned and mustered out of federal service at Anniston, Alabama on 31 January 1899. It was reorganized in Knoxville in the Tennessee National Guard as the 6th Infantry Regiment. Five years later, the 6th Infantry Regiment was re-designated once again as the Third Infantry Regiment in 1903. =Mexican Punitive Expedition= On 3 July 1916, the Third Infantry Regiment was mustered into federal service at Nashville and deployed to Eagle Pass, Texas to take part in the Army's pursuit of the Mexican bandit Francisco (Pancho) Villa along the Mexican and US Border. They returned home and were mustered out of federal service on 14 March 1917. =World War I= Four months after returning from Texas, on 24 July 1917, the Third Infantry Regiment was mustered into federal service and assigned as an element of the 30th Division. The 30th Division had been called into federal service on 25 July 1917, seven days after designation as a division. On 3 August, the War Department ordered concentration and organization at Camp Sevier, Greenville, South Carolina. On 5 August 1917 the Third Tennessee Infantry Regiment was \\"drafted\\" into federal service. Concentration continued throughout August 1917. The 30th Division (The Old Hickory Division named after President Andrew Jackson of Tennessee) was reorganized in accordance with the tables of organization of 8 August 1917. On 12 September 1917 infantry brigades were organized in the 30th Division. The 59th Infantry Brigade was composed of the Third Tennessee and the First South Carolina Regiments of Infantry, and detachments of the First North Carolina and Second South Carolina Regiments of Infantry, and the Tennessee Cavalry. The 60th Infantry Brigade included, the Second and Third North Carolina Regiments of Infantry, and detachments of the First North Carolina, and Second Tennessee Regiments of Infantry and of North Carolina Cavalry. On 14 September 1917 the Third Tennessee Infantry Regiment was reorganized and re-designated as the 117th Infantry Regiment assigned to the 30th Division. The 30th Division underwent a term of systematic training from 17 September until 30 April 1918. During October 1917, selective service men from Camps Gordon, Jackson and Pike completed the regiment and filled out the rest of the division. The 117th Infantry Regiment as part of the 59th Brigade, 30th Infantry Division received its first taste of war on 9 July 1918. With the 27th (US) Division, it was assigned to the organization and defense of the East Poperinghe Line, a third defensive position in the Dickebusch Lake and Scherpenberg Sectors. The 30th Division on 11 July 1918 assumed full responsibility for the East Poperinghe trench system. Affiliated with the British, 117th Infantry Regiment as part of the 30th Division reached the front lines for training on 16 July 1918 and remained until 18 August. Actual training was carried until 9 August. The 117th Infantry Regiment and the rest of the 59th Infantry Brigade remained with the British 3rd (GB) Division, while the machine gun and infantry units served by battalions and other divisional troops by detachments remained with 30th Division. After a brief return to the rear for further training, the 30th Division relieved the 3rd (GB) Division in the front line of the Canal Sector from the vicinity of Elzenwalle to the railroad southeast of Transport Fme on the nights of 16 and 17 August 1918. On 18 August 1918 the 30th Division (US) assumed command, with the 6th (GB) Division to its right. On the next day the Canal Sector occupation was merged into the Ypres-Lys Operation. From 19 August until 4 September 30 (US) Division, less Artillery and 105th Ammunition Trains took part in the Ypres- Lys Operation. 26 August – 11 September rumors of a German withdrawal of troops was investigated. 31 August combat patrols of the 30th (US) Division determined that the Germans were withdrawing. The next day, the 59th Infantry Brigade leading, the division captured Moated Orange, Voormezeele, Lock No. 8, and Lankhof Fme, and occupied a line connecting these localities with the original front at Gunners' Lodge. The 27th (US) Division served to the right, the 14th (GB) Division to the left. On the nights of 3 through 5 September, the 30th Division (US) was relieved by the 35th (GB) Division, and on 4 September, the command passed. The 30th (US) Division concentrated near Proven on 5 September and 6, and moved into the St. Pol Area, in the zone of the British First Army on 7 September for training. Meanwhile, on 12–15 September, the 37th Infantry Division, along with the two 30th Division units, occupied the Avocourt Sector on 23–25 September 1918. The 30th (US) Division, less artillery, and the 105th Ammunition Train participated in the Somme Offensive Operation 22 September – 1 October. On the nights of 21 to 24 September 1918, the 30th (US) Division moved to the Tincourt-Boucly (British Fourth Army) Area, where the Second Corps was affiliated with the Australian 1st Division, east of Villeret and Hargicourt. The lines extended from 300 meters east of Buisson-Gaulaine Fme, through La Haute Bruyere, la Terrasse Trench, Bois des Tuyas, Boyeu du Chevreau, to Malakoff Fme. The 59th Infantry Brigade occupied the forward area. Command passed to the 30th (US) Division on 24 September 1918. On 26–27 September 30 (US) Division attacked from a line of departure between 300 and 400 meters east of the line between La Haute Bruyere and Malakoff Fme, with the 46th (GB) Division on the right, and the 27th (US) Division on the left. On the night of 27 September and 28, the 60th Infantry Brigade relieved the 59th Infantry Brigade and the 117th Infantry Regiment. On 29 September 1918 the 30th (US) Division with the 59th and 60th Infantry Brigades in the lead, battered through the formidable Hindenburg Line. Immediately after the penetration, the 30th Division crossed the canal and captured Bellicourt, then entered Nauroy. It was at Bellicourt, France, that the 30th Division smashed its way through the \\"Hindenburg Line\\", a victory that hastened the close of the war. The 5th Division (Australia) moved up to pass through the 30th (US) Division, and both divisions advanced to establish a front from the intersection of Wattling Street road and canal, east and northeast to Bois du Cabaret, 800 meters northeast of the Boise de Malakoff. The next day the command passed to the Australian 5th Division, but units of the 30th (US) Division, which were in line, participated until noon. During its advance of , the 30th (US) Division captured 98 officers, 3,750 enlisted men, 72 pieces of artillery, 26 trench mortars and 426 machine guns. It suffered 8,415 casualties. On 1 and 2 October 1918, the 117th Infantry Regiment as part of the 59th Infantry Brigade, 30th (US) Division moved to the Heroecourt and Mesnil-Bruntel Areas, and on the 5th, the II Corps prepared to relieve the Australian troops in the front line. Returning to the front the 117th Infantry as part of the 59th Infantry Brigade and other units moved to the Tincourt-Boucly Area. On the night of 5 and 6 October 1918 the 59th Infantry Brigade took position in support near Hargicourt and Bellicourt. The next day the 59th Infantry Brigade attacked to realign the front. The 30th (US) Division on 8 October, assisted by tanks had the 59th Infantry Brigade and one battalion from the 60th Infantry Brigade, leading, attacked northeast, and captured Brancourt-le-Grand and Premont, and reached a line from the Fme de la Piete to the eastern outskirts of Premont. The 6th (GB) Division served on the right, while the 25th (GB) Division was on the left. The 60th Infantry Brigade passed through the 59th on 9 October, and captured Busigny and Becquigny. The next day the division front extended along the western outskirts of Vaux-Andigny, through La Haie-Menneresse, and St. Souplet, to St. Benin. During this advance on 7 October 1918 Sergeant Edward R. Talley, from Russellville, Tennessee, Company L, 117th Infantry Regiment near Ponchaux, France, was undeterred by seeing several comrades killed in attempting to put a hostile machinegun nest out of action. He attacked the position single-handed, armed only with his Springfield 03 rifle. Sergeant Talley rushed the machinegun nest in the face of intense enemy fire, killed or wounded at least 6 of the crew, and silenced the gun. When the enemy attempted to bring forward another gun and ammunition Sergeant Talley drove them back by effective fire from his rifle. For this action, he was awarded the Medal of Honor. The next day, Sergeant James Ernest Karnes from Knoxville, and Private Calvin John Ward from Morristown, Company D, 117th Infantry Regiment near Estrees, France, on 8 October 1918 were taking part in a general advance. Their company was held up by a machinegun, which was enfilading the line of troops. These two soldiers \\"had all they could take\\" so they fixed their bayonets and charged the machine gun position and succeeded in destroying the machine gun nest by killing 3 and capturing 7 of the enemy and their guns. Sergeant Karnes and Private Ward were both awarded the Medal of Honor for this action. On 11 October, the 30th (US) Division occupied Vaux-Andigny, La Haie- Menneresse, and reached the northwestern outskirts of St. Martin-Riviere, its front extending north along the West Bank of the La Selle River to St. Benin. It was relieved during the night of 11/12 October and 1918 by the 27th (US) Division, and rested near Premont, Brancourt-le-Grand, and Monibrehain. Command passed on 12 October 1918. The 30th (US) Division returned to the line on the night of 15/16 October 1918. The 59th Infantry Brigade relieved the 54th Infantry Brigade (27th Division), in the right sector of the II Corps from Vaux-Andigny to one-half kilometer west of St. Martin-Riviere. The 6th (GB) Division on the right, 27th Division (US) on the left. On 17 October 30 (US) Division attacked northeast, crossing the La Selle River, captured Molain and established a line from three-quarters kilometer north of La Demi-Lieue to l'Arbre-de-Guise. The next day Ribeauville was occupied. The front extended from Rejet-de-Beaulieu to three-quarters kilometer southeast of la Jonquiere Fme, on 19 October 1918. The 30th (US) Division was relieved by the 1st (GB) Division on the night of 19/20 October and moved, 20–23 October to the vicinity of Tincourt-Boucly and Roisel. The division moved to Querrieu Area on 23 October 1918 for rehabilitation and training. The 117th Infantry moved back to the United States after the signing of the Armistice on 11 November 1918 and was demobilized during 13–17 April 1919 at Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia near Chattanooga. In 1921, a monument to the 117th Infantry was erected in front of the old Knoxville High School on the corner of E 5th Ave NE & Lamar St NE. It consists of a charging soldier with raised fist and rifle. Several plaques around the base honor the soldiers killed in action and list accomplishments of the regiment. =Interwar period= In 1921 and 1923 the 117th Infantry and the 4th Infantry Regiment were consolidated and reorganized in the Tennessee National Guard as the 117th Infantry and assigned to the 30th Division on 24 April 1923. =World War II= On 16 September 1940 the 117th Infantry Regiment from Tennessee was inducted into federal service at home stations for a period of one year. The regiment was moved by train and arrived in Fort Jackson South Carolina on 24 September 1940 as part of the 30th Division once again. The regiment was housed in pyramid tents at Fort Jackson. Colonel Grant A. Schlieker assumed command of the regiment on 12 August 1940. In October 1940, the unit was filled by Selective Service with men primarily from the Knoxville area. The 117th Infantry moved by motor convoy to Dixie, Tennessee on 27 May 1941 for the VII Corps Tennessee Maneuvers. The regiment returned to Fort Jackson on 5 July 1941. The regiment along with the rest of the National Guard soldiers inducted in 1940 was extended for the duration of World War II. The regiment then moved to Chester, South Carolina on 27 September 1941 for both the October and November 1941 Carolina Maneuvers. The 117th Infantry Regiment as part of the 30th Division returned to Fort Jackson on 29 November 1941 where the 30th (Old Hickory) Division was redesigned as the 30th Infantry Division. On 16 February 1942 the 30th Infantry Division arrived at Camp Blanding, Florida for extensive Infantry Training. On 12 September 1942, the 117th Infantry Regiment was ordered to the Infantry School, located at Fort Benning, Georgia, to furnish troops for demonstration purposes and to assist instructors in the training of officer classes and the Officer Candidate School (OCS). The 117th Infantry Regiment moved back to Camp Blanding, Florida by motor convoy on 28 February 1943 to conduct training designed to physically harden the troops. They moved on 30 May 1943 to Murfreesboro, Tennessee. Starting on 4 September 1943, the regiment participated in the Second Army's No.3 Tennessee Maneuvers. On 7 September 1943 the 117th Infantry Regiment returned to Camp Forrest (Arnold AFB today), near Tullahoma, Tennessee. The 117th Infantry Regiment arrived at Camp Atterbury, Indiana on 14 November 1943 to complete their final phase of training. The 117th Infantry Regiment departed Camp Atterbury and arrived at the staging area in Camp Myles Standish, Massachusetts on 29 January 1944. The regiment departed from the Port of Boston, which was the Port of Embarkation, on the USS John Ericsson on 12 February 1944. The 117th Infantry Regiment disembarked in Liverpool, England on 24 February 1944. In England, from 25 February, to 5 April 1944 the regiment was quartered in Nissen huts near Petworth, England and undertook extensive Infantry training. From 6 April to 9 June 1944, the regiment was billeted in the town of Berkhamstead, England and completed their final training before entering combat in Normandy. On \\"D-Day\\" 6 June 1944 the regiment was alerted for movement to France. The regiment moved to the staging area in Southern England where a briefing was given on the general situation, then moved to Southampton dock for loading. The 117th Infantry Regiment crossed the English Channel and landed on Omaha Beach in Normandy on D+4, 10 June 1944. The regiment initially moved into a Staging Area near Lison, France. The regiment remained here until 2 July 1944. The first casualties of World War II were suffered here as a result of German 88 mm fire on the Staging Area. The regiment's initial mission was to replace some units of the 29th Division, which had been almost immediately lost on D-Day. The balance of the 30th Infantry Division went into Normandy and was almost immediately committed to action against the German Army. The 117th Infantry Regiment attacked across the Vire river along with the 120th Infantry at 04:30 am the morning of 7 July 1944 as part of the initial breakout from the Normandy Beachhead. They assaulted across the Vire-Taute Canal on 7 July 1944, establishing a bridgehead toward Les Landes, east of St Jean-de-Day, which the 3rd Armored Division passed through the regiment to conduct exploitation operations. The regiment repulsed a major German counter-attack conducted by the German Panzer-Lehr-Division the night of 7 July 1944 and again during the morning of 9 July 1944. The Germans suffered heavy losses as the result of the Tennessee guardsmen's tenacious fighting and accurate fire. As the 117th Infantry advanced on Saint-Lô, as part of the 30th (US) Infantry Division, it checked a German counterattack along the main Hauts-Vents Highway 11 July 1944 and Pont Hebert fell after protracted fighting 14 July 1944. Patrols reached the Periers-Saint-Lô Road by 18 July 1944. VII (US) Corps made the main effort along the St. Lo-Periers highway just west of Saint-Lô. The corps commander's intent was to drive through the German crust-like defense before the Germans could reform, then exploit the break thought by passing mechanized forces into the Germans' rear. The plan called for saturation bombing by fighter-bombers, medium and heavy bombers from the front line back to the enemy's artillery positions to disorient and dislodge the Germans. Following the bombers, 4th(US) Infantry Division, 9th (US) Infantry Division, and the 30th (US) Infantry Division were to attack southward along a narrow front, clearing the way for the 2d (US) and 3d (US) Armored Divisions and the 1st (US) Infantry Division to pass through. The armored forces were to sweep south then southwest into the rear of German forces opposing the VIII Corps along the western portions of the Cotentin Peninsula. The 30th (US) Infantry Division attacked with the 120th Infantry Regiment on the right and 119th Infantry Division on the left. Two battalions from the 117th Infantry Regiment were attached (one battalion each) to the 119th and 120th Infantry Regiments. The remainder of the 117th Infantry was in division reserve prepared to pass through on the left and clear out the curve in the Vier River. The air plan called for 350 fighter-bombers hitting the German front lines followed by 1,500 bombers assigned to targets deep and wide. As the friendly troops moved forward, another 396 medium bombers would bomb the rear areas for another 45 minutes. Friendly troops were moved back from their line of departures for safety. After two postponements due to bad weather, the attack got underway on the morning of 24 July 1944. At 11:30 am, 350 P-47 fighter-bombers arrived on schedule and started dive-bombing, followed by the steady drone 1,500 heavy bombers. Some P-47 fighter-bombers bombed friendly troop positions and one squadron of heavy bombers dropped its bombs squarely on friendly troops. Twenty minutes after the attack started it was called off. \\"Operation COBRA\\" the breakout from St. Lo, the 30th Infantry Division endured the heaviest bombing by \\"friendly aircraft\\" of the entire war. Approximately 88 men were killed and over 500 seriously wounded over the two-day period. Lieutenant General Lesley J. McNair, Commanding General Army Ground Forces, was visiting and observing this attack in the area of the Second Battalion, 120th Infantry, 30th Infantry Division when bombs instantly killed him dropped by friendly B-17s flying in support of Operation COBRA. The two battalions of the 117th attacked with the units to which they were attached on 25 July 1944 to drive beyond Saint-Lô during Operation COBRA. On 26 July 1944 the 117th Infantry Regiment took the high ground overlooking Saint-Lô. The Armor and Infantry Forces passed through the hole in the German defenses and advanced south. The 30th Infantry Division had made a spectacular attack, and opened the way for Patton's newly arrived Third Army to drive into Brittany and onward to Brest, France. The division took well-defended Troisgots on 31 July 1944 and relieved the 1st Infantry Division near Mortain, France on 6 August 1944. The 30th Infantry Division and the 117th Infantry Regiment was subjected to a strong German counterattack, which ruptured its lines in the area on the following day during the battle for Avranches. In the morning of 6 August 1944, the regiment moved southwest to the vicinity of Bracy, France near Mortain to relieve the 26th Infantry and to take up defensive positions. At dusk, it was apparent the Germans were in the 1st Battalion's area in strength. About 01:30 am, on 7 August 1944 the 117th Infantry Regiment was attacked by crack troops of the 1st SS Adolf Hitler Division. Between midnight and 04:00 the regiment was blanketed by intense and devastating mortar and artillery fire. Enemy aircraft strafed supporting Artillery units as they tried to register their fire on Germany tanks and infantry. The situation became critical at dawn when the main body of the Germans attacked in a thick fog and overran two company roadblocks. C Company of the 117th Infantry held their position, which caused the Germans to pause in their attack. Colonel Walter M. Johnson, the regimental commander issued orders to hold at all costs because there was nothing behind the 117th Infantry Regiment to stop the Germans from reaching the sea. A new defensive line was established on a sunken road bisected by the highway from Juvigny to Saint Barthelemy and situated on a hill overlooking Saint Barthelemy. Cooks, clerks, messengers, and administrative personnel from the battalions and the regimental headquarters became riflemen. The Tennessee Infantrymen held their positions against intense attacks by German infantry and armor. Late in the afternoon of 8 August 1944, the Germans launched a fresh large-scale attack employing numerous tanks and fresh Infantry. Despite the terrible odds, the 117th Infantry Regiment stopped the German assault. Determined and stubborn Tennessee riflemen and machine gunners held their positions and stopped the German Infantrymen. Company B from Athens, Tennessee bore the brunt of the attack. Private Timothy L. Birt of Company B was a platoon runner and ended up as the runner for all the platoons. Through heavy enemy fire he carried orders, ammunition, rations and mail from the company command post to all the platoons. On six occasions he repaired telephone lines between the CP and the platoons. He helped evacuate seriously wounded soldiers from an open field under intense enemy fire. Twice he went with litter bearers to help evacuate the wounded. Once during the battle he served as observer and adjusted the Company's 60 mm mortar fire. Private Birt, from rural Meigs County, Tennessee was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his bravery. During combat at Mortain and Saint-Barthelemy, the 117th Infantry Regiment and the 30th Infantry Division became known as the Workhorse of the Western Front. It was also known as \\"Roosevelt's SS Troops,\\" so named by German high command because of the consistent vigor and pressure the division brought to bear on the elite 1st SS Adolf Hitler Division. According to three of Germany's top generals interviewed after World War II, (Jodl, Keitel and von Kesslring) the battle for Mortain and Saint-Barthelemy was one of the two critical operations leading to the defeat of Germany in the west. Mainly the 1st Battalion, 117th Infantry at Saint-Barthelemy, absorbed the main drive of the Germany Army in Normandy, thus allowing Lieutenant General George Patton's armored forces to race forward through France, thereby shortening the war by many months. The 117th Infantry Regiment went over to the offensive again 11 August 1944 and forced back German gains to Mortain. The 117th Infantry Regiment along with the rest of the 30th (US) Infantry Division then pushed east behind the 2nd Armored Division, taking Nonancourt on 21 August 1944. The 117th Infantry Regiment was moved by truck on 14 August to the vicinity of Rouelle near Domfront France. German artillery fired on the battalions of the regiment forcing them to dismount and move on foot to l’Onlay-l’Abbaye, France. Tennessee's 117th Infantry Regiment crossed the Seine river near Mantes- Grassicourt west of Paris to relieve the 79th (US) Infantry Division, which had established a bridgehead across the Seine River. After two days of fighting the regiment was moving quickly in open country towards Belgium. The 30th (US) Infantry Division (with the 117th Infantry Regiment) was the first American infantry division to enter Belgium 2 September 1944, and advanced over the Meuse River at Vise and Liege 11 September 1944. The 117th Infantry Regiment was the first Allied unit to enter the Netherlands on 13 September 1944. On 14 September 1944 the 117th and 119th Infantry advanced into Maastricht east of the Meuse River where the 2d Battalion, 117th Infantry Regiment cleared the area west of the river. The 117th Infantry Regiment attacked from Maastricht towards the German border in the vicinity of Scherpenseel Germany starting on the morning of 17 September 1944. Here German resistance intensified as the Germans employed 155 mm artillery against the regiment as they approached the border. On the afternoon of 19 September 1944 the 1st Battalion crossed into Germany and entered the town of Scherpenseel. The next morning, the regiment planned the attack on the Siegfried Line, which the German claimed to be invincible fortress. The 119th and 120th Infantry attacked toward the West Wall north of Aachen and the former reached positions commanding the Wurm River on 18 September 1944. The 30th Infantry Division attacked across the Rhine River between Aachen and Geilenkirchen 2 October 1944 against strong German opposition. On the following day the 117th Infantry Regiment seized Uebach after house-to-house fighting as the 119th Infantry finally captured Rimburg Castle. At 11:00 hrs, 2 October 1944, the 117th Infantry, along with the rest of the 30th Infantry Division, launched an attack on the Siegfried Line near Palenberg, Germany. It was here that Private Harold G. Kiner from Aline, Oklahoma of Company F, 117th Infantry Regiment won the Medal of Honor. With four other men, Private Kiner was leading a frontal assault on a Siegfried Line pillbox near Palenberg, Germany. Machinegun fire from the strongly defended enemy position away pinned down the attackers. The Germans threw hand grenades, one of which dropped between Private Kiner and two other men. With no hesitation, Private Kiner hurled himself upon the grenade, smothering the explosion. By his gallant action and voluntary sacrifice of his own life, he saved his two comrades from serious injury or death. The Medal of Honor was awarded posthumously to Private Kiner. Private Kiner was the fourth soldier from the regiment to be awarded the Medal of Honor. Presidential Unit Citation awarded to E Company, 117th Infantry for its actions at Aachen on 16 October 1944 The 117th Infantry Regiment was assisted by elements of the 2nd Armored Division as it continued with slow progress against the West Wall. The 1st Battalion of the 117th Infantry Regiment was the only lead battalion to crack the West Wall for the entire XIX Corps. The regiment's advance was checked by a strong German counterattack on 9 October 1944 which isolated the 119th Infantry at North Wuerselen. The encirclement of Aachen was completed on 16 October 1944 when the 117th Infantry made contact with the 1st Infantry Division. On 17 December 1944 the 117th Infantry Regiment was ordered to an assembly area in the vicinity of Haustet, Belgium in the Belgian Ardennes. En route, the regiment was stopped by an assistant division commander and diverted to Malmedy and Stavelot to block a powerful German counterattack. As the regiment approached Stavelot it was noted that a German Panzer unit already occupied the town. Elements of the 117th Infantry were ordered to retake Stavelot, a key crossroads on the Amblève River. As they moved to their objectives, Axis Sally was on the radio that morning boasting of a huge counterattack though the Ardennes, which she said, could not possibly be stopped. She said \\"The fanatical 30th Division, Roosevelt’s SS Troops, are en route to the rescue, but this time they will be completely annihilated!\\" As the regiment approached the town of Stavelot, huge Tiger Royal (Mark VIb) tanks, and assault riflemen were observed in the center of town. The 1st Battalion of the regiment attacked and established a defensive position in the Town Square. The 1st Battalion was reinforced with tank destroyers, machineguns, and mortars. Late in the day, two American jeeps, and two half-ton trucks roared into Stavelot loaded with Germans dressed in American uniforms with guns blazing. The Tennesseans from the 117th quickly annihilated all the Germans captured and seized the jeeps and trucks. It was determined that the Germans had occupied Stavelot with the 1st SS Adolf Hitler Division. This was the second time the 1st SS Adolf Hitler Division faced the 117th Infantry Regiment and the 30th Infantry Division during the Ardennes Offensive in the winter of 1944–45. The 1st SS Adolf Hitler Division, the main effort of the 1st SS Corps and the spearhead of the Sixth Panzer Army, gave up on their attempt to recapture Stavelot after the 117th Infantry Regiment repulsed six fanatical German assaults on 20 December 1944. Stavelot, like Mortain, was the key to the Sixth Panzer Army's attack in the Ardennes. It was estimated that at least 1000 German dead lined the bank of the Amblève River which was mute testimony to the heroic actions of the 1st battalion, 117th Infantry Regiment. Again the 117th Infantry Regiment had defeated the elite 1st SS Adolf Hitler Division, which was never again to do battle. The 117th Infantry Regiment moved into Germany and arrived in Varlautenheide, Germany at 2:00 am, 3 February 1945. On 19 February 1945 Major General Leland Hobbs, CG 30th Infantry Division, for the Saint-Barthelemy (Mortain) Performance awarded the Presidential Unit Citation the regiment for actions in France at Saint-Barthelemy. They were also awarded the Belgian Fourragere for its performance in the Ardennes and for the regiment's part in the liberation of Belgium 4–10 September 1944. On 23 February 1945 the 117th Infantry Regiment crossed the Roer River and continued to move into the heart of Germany. On 27 February 1945 elements of the 83d Infantry Division and the 2nd Armored Division passed through the regiment to exploit the Roer River breakthrough. The regiment spearheaded the Ninth Army's crossing of the Rhine River at 02:00 hrs on 24 March 1945. They drove west into Stockum, Germany, then crossed the Autobahn and went on to Hunxe, Germany. They captured a German Airfield here on 27 March 1945. On 31 March 1945, the 117th Infantry Regiment captured the Lippe Canal, then motored to Brensteinfurt, Germany. Here they encountered a mass German surrender with German soldiers, hands up and running towards POW cages in the rear. Here they met the first of the streams of Allied prisoners, thin as skeletons, liberated from German prison camps along with laborers from Poland, Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, and France. During the month of April 1945, the regiment continued its dash to towards the east. At 06:00 on 7 April 1945 the 117th Infantry Regiment attacked and took the town of Hamelin, Germany. Hamelin is famous for the Brothers Grimm story of \\"The Pied Piper of Hamelin\\" a children's fairy tale. Here the regiment captured hundreds of German soldiers as prisoners of war. On 17 April 1945 the regiment seized the city of Magdeburg on the Elbe River. The regiment moved east on the morning of 18 April 1945 and by noon had closed on the Elbe River where they were ordered to set up a defense and wait for the Soviet Army. The regiment waited for three weeks on the Russians and the end of the war. On 27 May 1945 British troops occupied Magdeburg and the 117th Infantry moved south to Oelenln and Bad Elsren, Germany near the Czechoslovakian border for occupation. Plans were to transfer the regiment and the 30th Infantry Division to the Pacific Theater to fight the Japanese. On 13 August 1945 the regiment boarded the Liberty Ship Marine Wolfe and sailed to Southampton, England. Before departing Southampton, news of the Japanese surrender canceled to the plans to move the regiment to the Pacific. On 17 August 1945 the regiment sailed on board the RMS Queen Mary from the Ocean Pier at Southampton. They arrived at Pier 90 in New York City, the port of debarkation on 21 August 1945. The 117th Infantry Regiment moved to Fort Jackson S.C. on 21 August 1945. The 117th Infantry Regiment was inactivated 17–24 November 1945 at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. =Cold War= In a letter to the 30th Division commander in May 1946, the Supreme Allied Headquarters Army Historian Colonel S.L.A. Marshall called the 30th Infantry Division the \\"Finest Infantry Division in the European Theater of Operations\\". Marshall wrote, \\"It is the combined judgments of the approximately 35 historical officers who had worked on the records and in the field that the 30th merited this distinction. It was our finding that the 30th had been outstanding in three operations and we could consistently recommend it for citation on any of these occasions. It was further found that it had in no single instance performed discreditably or weakly ... and in no single operation had it carried less than its share of the burden or looked bad when compared to the forces on its flanks. We were especially impressed with the fact that it consistently achieved results without undue wastage of its men.\\" On 31 July 1946, the 117th was reorganized. The 1st Battalion at Cleveland was withdrawn, expanded, and re-designated as the 278th Armored Infantry Battalion. The 2nd Battalion at Kingsport was withdrawn, converted, and re- designated as the 168th Military Police Battalion. New 1st and 2nd Battalions were constituted in West Tennessee. The 278th Armored Infantry Battalion was federally recognized on 1 September 1947 in eastern Tennessee with headquarters at Cleveland, continuing the lineage of the 117th Infantry Regiment. On 18 March 1947, the 278th Battalion was expanded to become the 278th Regimental Combat Team (RCT) with headquarters in Athens. Korean War On 1 September 1950, during the Korean War, the 278th RCT was ordered into active federal service at home stations and moved to Fort Devens, Massachusetts. Individual soldiers from the 278th RCT were sent to 8th US Army in Korea as replacements. The 1st Battalion remained in Fort Devens as a training battalion, while the 2nd Battalion was sent to Iceland for garrison duty. The RCT was released from federal service on 8 September 1954 after the end of the war and reverted to state control. Reorganization and consolidation On 27 October 1954, federal recognition was withdrawn from the 278th Infantry RCT and it was broken up, its units becoming part of the 30th Armored Division. Headquarters and 1st Battalion became the 278th Armored Infantry Battalion at Athens, 2nd Battalion became the 330th Antiaircraft Battalion at Kingsport, and the 3rd Battalion became the 190th Armored Infantry Battalion. The 117th Infantry was also broken up, with headquarters and 1st Battalion becoming the 170th Armored Infantry Battalion at Henderson, the 2nd Battalion becoming the 174th Tank Battalion at Murfreesboro, and the 3rd Battalion becoming the 117th Armored Infantry Battalion at Dyersburg. On 1 March 1959, the 117th and 170th Armored Infantry Battalions consolidated with the 278th Armored Infantry Battalion, 330th Antiaircraft Artillery Battalion and 176th Tank Battalion and were reorganized and redesignated as the 117th Infantry Regiment, a parent regiment under the Combat Arms Regimental System (CARS). The new 117th consisted of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Battalions, all part of the 30th Armored Division. The 117th was reorganized to consist of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Battalions on 1 November 1973, with the 2nd and 3rd Battalions becoming part of the 278th Infantry Brigade and the 4th Battalion joining the 30th Armored Brigade. On the same day, the 278th Infantry Brigade was made a Separate Infantry Brigade, just before the 30th Armored Division was inactivated. On 29 April 1977, the 278th (Separate) Infantry Brigade was reorganized and re-designated the 278th Armored Cavalry Regiment, a separate corps maneuver Unit. Colonel Russell A. Newman was appointed as its first commander. The regimental motto, \\"I Volunteer Sir\\", was inspired by the volunteer units of east Tennessee in the Mexican–American War. The regiment's headquarters and headquarters troop (HHT) was redesignated on 1 May from the headquarters and headquarters company (HHC) of the 278th Brigade. The 1st and 2nd Squadrons were redesignated from existing units on the same day. The 2nd Battalion, 117th's HHC was redesignated as the HHT of the 278th ACR's 1st Squadron at Athens. 1st Squadron was mostly redesignated from the 2nd Battalion. The 1st Squadron's Troop A was redesignated from Company B at Cleveland, Troop B from the Support Company at Sweetwater, Detachment 1 of Troop B from Company C at Lenoir City, Troop C from the 376th Signal Company at Newport, Company D from Detachment 1 of the 130th Military Police Company at Oak Ridge, and the Howitzer Battery from Company A at Maryville. The headquarters and headquarters detachment of the 330th Transportation Battalion at Kingsport was redesignated as the HHT of the 2nd Squadron. Troop E was redesignated from the 1130th Transportation Company at Morristown, Troop F from the 1174th Transportation Company at Bristol, Troop G from Detachment 1 of the 376th Signal Company at Greeneville, Company H from the 130th Military Police Company at Clinton, and the Howitzer Battery from Detachment 1 of the 117th's 2nd Battalion at Knoxville. On 30 September 1978, the 777th Maintenance Company (GS), a separate unit stationed in Knoxville at the Knoxville Armory, was reorganized and redesignated as the Air Troop of the 278th. The unit was later relocated to Alcoa. A year later, the 450th Assault Helicopter Company, stationed in Smyrna, was reorganized and redesignated as the Attack Helicopter Troop of the regiment. The headquarters and headquarters detachment of the 130th Aviation Battalion and the 1155th Transportation Company (Aviation Intermediate Maintenance) were attached to the 278th by the State Area Command to serve as command and control for the separate air troop and attack helicopter troop. On 1 February 1980, the HHC of the 3rd Battalion, 117th at Cookeville was redesignated as the HHT of the 278th ACR's 3rd Squadron. 3rd Squadron was mostly redesignated from the 117th's 3rd Battalion. Troop I was redesignated from Company A at McMinnville, Detachment 1 of Troop I from Detachment 1 of Company A at Smithville, Troop K from the Support Company at Livingston, Detachment 1 of Troop K from Detachment 1 of Company B at Jamestown, Troop L from Detachment 1 of the Support Company at Crossville, Detachment 1 of Troop L from Detachment 1 of Company C at Harriman, Company M from Company C at Rockwood, and the Howitzer Battery from Company B at Sparta. The 1174th Medium Truck Company (Separate) was reorganized and redesignated as the regiment's 190th Engineer Company on 1 October at Pulaski. Detachment 1 was located at Waynesboro. On 17 October 1986, the 278th's aviation units were consolidated into a new 4th Squadron, the regiment's aviation squadron. While the 278th Military Intelligence (MI) Company in the ARNG is currently the MI organization for the 278th ACR, that was not always the case. From 1987 until 1997, the 278th's MI unit was the 302nd MI Company, U.S. Army Reserve (USAR), stationed in Memphis, TN. The MI organization for the 278th converted from the USAR to the ARNG as part of the realignment of combat, combat service, and combat service support units between the Army's two Reserve Components that began in 1995. The 302d MI Company was organized with a major (MAJ) as the company commander, and was authorized 156 soldiers. In addition to the company headquarters element, the 302nd had a technical control and analysis element (TCAE), two collection and jamming (C&J;) platoons, one ground surveillance (radar) (GSR) platoon, one counterintelligence (CI)/human intelligence (HUMINT) platoon, one communications platoon, and support personnel, including food service, motor maintenance, and communications/electronics repair. =Operation Iraqi Freedom III= The 278th ACR (278th RCT) deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom III (2004–2005) from late November 2004 until November 2005 under the command of COL Dennis Adams. The 278th mobilized out of Camp Shelby, MS beginning in June 2004 with roughly 3800 members. Its major attachments were the 1/128th Infantry (the \\"Eagle Battalion\\"), Wisconsin National Guard, and the 386th Engineers from the Texas National Guard. While conducting mobilization training at Camp Shelby, the three Armored Cavalry Troops of each Squadron were equipped with nine M1A1 Abrams main battle tanks, 13 M3A2 Bradley fighting vehicles, and two 120mm mortar carriers. The Howitzer Battery had six 155mm M109 howitzers and the Tank Company had 14 more M1A1s. The squadrons also had two additional Bradleys for the squadron commanders and their operations officers (S-3). 278th soldiers at memorial service for comrades killed in Iraq. The 278th RCT took over from the 30th BCT, North Carolina, commanded by BG Danny Hickman on Christmas Eve 2004 at FOB Caldwell where the regimental headquarters was established. Initially the 278th RCT fell under Task Force Danger and the 1st Infantry Division. In February 2005 the 278th became part of Task Force Liberty commanded by the 42nd Infantry Division. The 1/278th and the 386th Engineer Battalion were located at FOB Caldwell along with the regimental HQ. The regiment operated along the Iranian border in the Diyala Province and in the center of an ethnic triangle formed by Arabs, Kurds and Turkomen in the Salah Ah Din Province. Each squadron was assigned to a FOB (forward operating base) and detachments sent to other locations, with some performing convoy escort missions from Kuwait to Mosul. The 101st Airborne Division (AASLT) replaced the 278th RCT upon the 278th's redeployment to the United States.

Other missions included patrolling, providing listening and observation posts (LP/OPs) during elections and for force protection of the International Zone. This unit conducted checkpoints, convoy operations and provided security for the Naval Special Warfare EOD teams as well as Australian bomb squads. Eight 278th ACR soldiers were killed in action in Iraq in 2005. Two more died of accidents or natural causes. =Operation Iraqi Freedom 9-11= The 278th deployed again to Iraq in 2010 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom 9-11. The 278th mobilized out of JFTC Shelby (Camp Shelby) beginning in December 2009 with attachments from Wisconsin, Tennessee, and West Virginia National Guard units. The 278th acted as the convoy security element for the 13th ESC, and was tasked with the protection of retrograde activities and FOB closures from the Turkish border to Kuwait. FOB Assignments: Camp Taji: RHHT/278 ACR, SPT/278 ACR, RTS/278 ACR COB Speicher: 3/278 ACR Joint Base Balad: 2/278 ACR FOB Q-West: 1/278 ACR FOB Marez/Diamond Back: RFS/278 ACR FOB Prosperity: Spc.

The title page credits William Nicholson as the author, and much of the work was overseen by Jeremiah Joyce. Some of the plates were drawn by John Farey Jr., and engraved by Wilson Lowry and Scott. The work was published by a syndicate of twenty-three booksellers whose names appear on the title page of each volume, headed by the firm of Longman, Hurst, Rees, & Orme. Each purchased shares and in due time received a proportional profit from the eventual sales. This method of publishing was common in the 18th and early 19th century and was known as a conger. It was particularly suited to multi- part works such as encyclopaedias. The Philadelphia publishing house of Mitchell, Ames, & White published three American editions of The British Encyclopedia. The first American edition appeared in 1816-17 but little else is known of this edition. The second American edition appeared in 1818 in twelve volumes, and the third American, also in twelve volumes, closely followed in 1819 and 1821. In 1998 John Issitt compared the text of The British Encyclopedia with the text of Gregory's A Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, which was published in 1806-1807 and also edited by Jeremiah Joyce. Issitt suggests that Joyce developed Nicholson's Encyclopedia largely from the text of his prior work on Gregory's Dictionary, and he contends, without an empirical showing, that 50% of the text of the two works is identical.John Issitt. A tale of two encyclopaedias: transitions in the presentation of scientific knowledge, The Open University, The Textbook Colloquium, 1998 If Issitt is correct, given that Gregory's Dictionary appeared in two folio volumes and Nicholson's Encyclopedia was presented in six octavo volumes, it would seem that Joyce must have copied nearly the whole of Gregory's Dictionary into Nicholson's Encyclopedia. By observation of a sample of headwords and their articles between bergamot and bignonia, we find in Gregory 34 heads in 8 columns and in Nicholson 27 heads in 21 columns; of these, 17 articles share some text, and of these, only seven very short articles in Gregory are copied directly and with minimal paraphrasing into Nicholson. This is sufficient to demonstrate that Gregory's Dictionary was indeed a useful resource for Nicholson's Encyclopedia, but within this sample, less than two columns of text in Gregory can be found in Nicholson, and less than three columns of text in Nicholson can be found in Gregory. This sample then suggests that less than 25% of the text of Gregory found its way into Nicholson, and that of Nicholson's text, less than 15% can be traced to Gregory.

Early life Born in Lebanon, New Hampshire, the son of William Goodhue Perley and Mabel E. Ticknor Stevens, Perley was educated at the Ottawa Grammar School, at St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire, and at Harvard University where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1878. Perley became a partner in the Perley & Pattee, a lumber company in which his father was senior partner. After Perley & Pattee dissolved in 1893, Perley became head of G.H. Perley & Co which had mills at Pointe-Calumet, Quebec and vice president of the Hull Lumber Company, Ltd., which is operating largely on the upper Ottawa. For many years, Perley was vice president of the Canada Atlantic Railway Co., president of the Rideau Club and president of the Ottawa Golf Club. Along with the other heirs of his father, he donated his homestead on Wellington Street for the purpose of establishing a hospital and served as vice president of its Board of Management. In 1900, he was chairman of the Ottawa and Hull Fire Relief Fund, and distributed about $1,000,000 among the sufferers by the 1900 Hull–Ottawa fire. Perley married Annie Hespeler Bowlby in Kitchener, Ontario on 4 June 1884. Perley had two children: Mabel, born 8 July 1885 and died 13 March 1887, and Ethel Lesa, born 16 September 1888.

Edwards for the seat in Russell County during the election of 1900. Perley served as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and Minister of the Overseas Military Forces in the World War I government of Sir Robert Borden. He did not run for re-election in the 1917 federal election in order to concentrate on his duties in London. He returned to the House of Commons in the 1925 federal election and subsequently served as Secretary of State for Canada in the short-lived 1926 government of Arthur Meighen and then as Minister without Portfolio in the government of R. B. Bennett following the 1930 federal election. He was re-elected in the 1935 federal election which also saw the defeat of Bennett's government, and remained an MP until his death in 1938.

Development Designed by Robert Edison Fulton Jr., it was an aluminum-bodied car, built with independent suspension, aircraft-sized wheels, and a six-cylinder 165 hp engine. The fabric wings were easily attached to the fuselage, converting the car into a plane. Four prototypes were built. In December 1950, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) (later to become the FAA) certified one of the prototypes and gave it an 1A11 Aircraft Specification, N74104. Lou Achitoff, was the CAA test pilot. The N74154 is the aircraft that is today in the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center. The craft made its debut in November 1946 at Danbury, Connecticut.http://airphibian.com/Danbury.htm Financial concerns forced Fulton to sell to a company that never developed it.Martin, Douglas. - New York/Region: \\"Robert E. Fulton Jr., an Intrepid Inventor, Is Dead at 95\\". - New York Times. - May 11, 2004. - Retrieved: 2008-06-15 Design The Airphibian took the approach of converting from an aircraft to a roadable vehicle by a conversion process that left aircraft sections behind during road use. The process consisted of removing a three-bladed propeller and placing it on a hook on the side of the fuselage, cranking down support casters, and disengaging lock levers connecting the flight unit to the road unit. The wing and aft fuselage are detached for road use. Survivors In the mid-1990s, one of the surviving Airphibians was restored by Fulton III, along with David Dumas and Deborah Hanson. Later, it was put on display for several years at the Canada Aviation Museum in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada in their main display hall, but in 2009 it moved to the Steven F.

P. Hall, and Clarence O Lee was a loaned engineer between 1949 and 1950 in San Diego, California. It had an all-aluminum body and chassis and an air- cooled 10 hp (7 kW) Onan engine mounted at the back. Normally it would only use a single fluid-drive speed, plus an emergency low gear.  History  Hall had attempted several times to make a flying car, but stuck with a more conventional design for this car. The streamlined styling was considered to be modern and quite appealing, and its tiny wheels made the car look larger than it actually was. It used a large amount of aluminum and plastic to reduce its weight. Its wheelbase was in length ( all told) and wide. Only two are known to have been made, one of the coupe and one of the sedan, though a number of photographs exist.

In 1988, he voiced the character Tetsuo Shima in the movie Akira, which was adapted from the manga of the same name. He also provided the voice of Yusuke Urameshi in the anime adaptation of the manga YuYu Hakusho and returned to that role in video games for that franchise. He is sometimes mistaken for fellow voice actress Nozomi Sasaki, whose name is written the same way. Sasaki has emerged the victor of the Seiyū Grand Prix (in which votes were collected to compile a top ten list of voice actors) more times than any other voice actor. Sasaki was known for having a high-pitched voice, but it cracked due to constantly overworking in voice acting and singing, although it was suspected at first that the reason his voice changed was due to his constant smoking and drinking.

The Ajax was produced in the newly acquired Mitchell Motors Company plant in Racine, Wisconsin. In 1926, all Ajax models were converted into Nash Light Sixes.  Origin  Demand for Nash automobiles was so high that by November 1924, the company's existing plants were operating around the clock six days a week and Charles W. Nash announced a US$1 million expansion at the automaker's original Kenosha facility. Mitchell Motors Company was the manufacturer of Mitchell brand automobiles from 1903 to 1923. In April 1923 the company was forced into bankruptcy. At the 31 January 1924 auction of the Mitchell land and buildings with of floor space, Charles Nash offered the winning bid of $405,000. The Ajax was built using machinery moved from Nash's other acquisition, the LaFayette Motors Company of Milwaukee, and installed in the Racine plant. Thus, new Ajax was based on an earlier design, premium version of the Lafayette from the early 1920s. The Ajax was available in three body styles: 4-door sedan, 4-door touring, and a 2-door sedan. The advertised retail price was $865 for the five-passenger touring car, and $995 for the five-passenger four-door sedan. The Ajax came standard with a L-head Nash straight-six engine with a seven main bearing crankshaft, force-feed lubrication system, three-speed transmission, four-wheel brakes (at that time unusual for a car of its price), steel disc wheels, as well as mohair velvet upholstery and an electric clock. The Ajax Six produced \\"genuine 60 mph\\" (97 km/h) driving,. Badge engineering Despite receiving good reviews from the automotive press and the general public, the Ajax brand was discontinued in 1926 after over 22,000 models were sold. Charles Nash ordered that the production continue instead as the Nash Light Six. The Nash was a known and respected automobile brand that was the name of the company's founder. Production was stopped for two days while Nash hubcaps, emblems, and radiator shells were trucked to Racine where all unshipped Ajax brand cars were converted into Nash badged automobiles. Likewise, changeover kits were sent to dealers to retrofit all unsold cars by removing Ajax badges such as hubcaps. One of the first cases of \\"badge engineering\\" began in 1917 with Texan automobiles assembled in Fort Worth, Texas, that made use of Elcar bodies made in Elkhart, Indiana. Locke, p. 320. However, the transformation of the Ajax was \\"probably the industry's first example of one car becoming another.\\". Nash even made the kits available at no charge to consumers who bought Ajax cars, but did not want to own an orphaned make automobile, to protect the investment they had made in a Nash Motors product. Because of this, few unmodified original Ajax cars have survived. Sales of the rechristened Nash Light Six improved with the more known moniker. The 1926 four-door sedan was now advertised for $1,525. The combined Ajax and Nash Light accounted for more than 24% of the automaker's total production in 1926.

Delerue won numerous important film music awards, including an Academy Award for A Little Romance (1980), three César Awards (1979, 1980, 1981), two ASCAP Awards (1988, 1990), and one Gemini Award for Sword of Gideon (1987). He was also nominated for four additional Academy Awards for Anne of the Thousand Days (1969), The Day of the Dolphin (1973), Julia (1977), and Agnes of God (1985), four additional César Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, and one Genie Award for Black Robe (1991). The French newspaper Le Figaro named him \\"the Mozart of cinema.\\" Delerue was the first composer to win three consecutive César Awards for Get Out Your Handkerchiefs (1979), Love on the Run (1980), and The Last Metro (1981). Georges Delerue was named Commander of Arts and Letters, one of France's highest honours. Life and career Delerue was born 12 March 1925 in Roubaix, France, to Georges Delerue and Marie Lhoest. He was raised in a musical household; his grandfather led an amateur chorale group and his mother sang and played piano at family gatherings. By the age of fourteen he was playing clarinet at the local music conservatory. In 1940 he was forced to abandon his studies at the Turgot Institute in order to work at a factory to help support his family. He continued playing clarinet with local bands, eventually transitioning to piano under the instruction of Madame Picavet- Bacquart. He studied Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, and Grieg, and was particularly inspired by Richard Strauss. Following a long convalescence after being diagnosed with scoliosis, Georges decided to become a composer. In 1945, following his studies at the Roubaix conservatory, Delerue was accepted into the Conservatoire de Paris, where he studied fugue with Simone Plé-Caussade and composition with Henri Büsser. To help support himself, he took jobs playing at dances, baptisms, marriages, and funerals—even performing jazz in the piano bars near the Paris Opera. In 1947 he received an honorable mention for the Rome Prize, and the following year he won the Second Grand Rome Prize. That year at the Theater Festival of Avignon, Delerue conducted a performance of Scheherazade. In the 1949 Rome Prize competition, he won the First Second Grand Prize, and the First Prize for Composition. He began writing stage music during the late 1940s, including for the Théâtre National Populaire, Comédie- Française and the company of Jean-Louis Barrault. He also became friends with Maurice Jarre and Pierre Boulez.Brill, Mark. Georges Delerue. In: The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 2nd Edition. Macmillan, London, 2001. By the early 1950s Delerue was composing music for short films and writing theatrical music for the Théâtre Babylone and the Opéra Comique. He began collaborating with Boris Vian on a number of projects during this time, including theatrical adaptations of The Snow Knight and The Builders of Empire, an oratorio A Regrettable Incident, and a ballet The Barker. In 1952 he began directing the orchestra of the Club d'Essai for French National Radio and Television, and scored his first television drama Princes du sang. In 1954 he wrote his first compositions for historical spectacles of light and sound, Lisieux and The Liberation of Paris. In 1955 he composed his Concert Symphony for Piano and Orchestra, and on 31 January 1957 his opera The Snow Knight premiered at Nancy and was a popular success. In 1959 he composed his first score for a feature film, Le bel âge. His career was diverse and he composed frequently for major art house directors, most often François Truffaut (including Jules and Jim), but also for Jean-Luc Godard's film Contempt (Le Mépris), and for Alain Resnais, Louis Malle, and Bernardo Bertolucci, besides working on several Hollywood productions, including Oliver Stone's Platoon and Salvador. He composed the music for Flemming Flindt's ballet, Enetime (The Lesson), based on Ionesco's play, La Leçon. During his 42 years career he put his talent to the service of nearly 200 feature movies, 125 short ones, 70 TV films and 35 TV serials. The soundtrack for war docudrama by Pierre Schoendoerffer, Diên Biên Phu (1992), was one of the late notable works. Delerue composed the music for five of the films made by the noted British director Jack Clayton. Their first collaboration was The Pumpkin Eater (1964), followed by Our Mother's House (1967). In 1982 they reunited for the Disney film version of Ray Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes, but the production was fraught with problems. Unhappy with the sinister tone of Clayton's original cut, the studio took control of the film, and held it back from release for over a year. They reportedly spent an additional $5 million on re-editing the film, cutting some scenes and replacing them with newly shot footage, with the aim of making the film more commercial and 'family- friendly'. To Delerue's great disappointment, Disney also insisted on the removal of his original music (which was considered 'too dark'), and replaced it with a new, 'lighter' score by American composer James Horner. Speaking later about the rejection of his score, Delerue said: \\"It was extremely painful ... because it was probably the most ambitious score I wrote in the United-States.\\"Stephanie Lerouge, CD liner notes for Georges Delerue Unused Scores (Universal France, 2011) Delerue's music for the film was only available to collectors in low-quality bootleg copies until 2011, when Disney authorised the release of approximately 30 minutes of music, sourced from Delerue's personal tape copy of the score (which originally ran for over an hour). This was issued by Universal France (along with Delerue's music for the 1991 film Regarding Henry) in a limited edition of 3000 CDs, as the inaugural release of its \\"Ecoutez le Cinema!\\" soundtrack series. Despite this disappointment, Delerue worked with Clayton twice more, on his last feature film, The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne (1987), and Clayton's final screen project, a feature length BBC TV adaptation of Muriel Spark's Memento Mori (1992), which aired just a month after Delerue's death. Delerue made cameo appearances in La nuit americaine and Les deux anglaises et le continent. According to many testimonies he would do and redo some cues to fit the new editing of a sequence without any protestation. He insisted on being allowed to orchestrate and conduct himself in order to polish every detail. Georges Delerue had a great talent for melody and for creating surrounding overtones which encapsulated the spirit of the movies on which he collaborated, enhancing them often beyond the expectations of their directors. Georges Delerue died on 20 March 1992 from a heart attack in Los Angeles, eight days after his 67th birthday, just after recording the last cue for the soundtrack to Rich in Love. He is buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. He left behind his wife, Colette Delerue, whom he married in 1984, and his daughter Claire from an earlier marriage.

A chain-drive monobloc 20/27cv four was introduced early on; the company failed soon after, but regrouped and reformed in 1907. That year the company introduced four new models. These were a 2270 cc 16cv four and a 3267 cc 24cv four, as well as bi-bloc sixes of 3405 cc and 4900 cc. The cars had a mechanical starter, which would begin operating the moment anybody stood on the running board. In 1907 two Ajax cars competed at the Targa Florio race. One car was crashed, the other failed. The company made an unsuccessful venture into the Droschke (taxi) business which forced its closure once again in February 1910, this time for good.

Early life Nicholson was educated in Yorkshire, and after leaving school, he made two voyages as a midshipman in the service of the British East India Company. His first ship was reportedly called the Boston and the second voyage was on board the Gatton. Subsequently, having become acquainted with Josiah Wedgwood in 1775, he moved to Amsterdam, where he made a living for a few years as Wedgwood's agent. On his return to England he was persuaded by Thomas Holcroft to apply his writing talents to the composition of light literature for periodicals, while also assisting Holcroft with some of his plays and novels. Meanwhile, he devoted himself to the preparation of An Introduction to Natural Philosophy, which was published in 1781 and was at once successful. A translation of Voltaire's Elements of the Newtonian Philosophy soon followed, and he then entirely devoted himself to scientific pursuits and philosophical journalism. In 1784 he was proposed by Josiah Wedgwood (the current Chairman) and appointed as secretary to the General Chamber of Manufacturers of Great Britain, and he was also connected with the Society for the Encouragement of Naval Architecture, established in 1791. He gave much attention to the construction of various machines for comb-cutting, file-making, cylinder printing and other uses—he also invented an areometer. Scientific work On 12 December 1783, Nicholson was elected to the \\"Chapter Coffee House Philosophical Society\\". He was proposed by Jean-Hyacinthe Magellan and seconded by horologist John Whitehurst.Trevor Harvey Levere, Gerard L'Estrange Turner, Jan Golinski, Larry R. Stewart (2002) \\"Discussing Chemistry and Steam – The minutes of a coffee house philosophical society 1780–1787\\", Oxford University Press . Nicholson communicated to the Royal Society in 1789 two papers on electrical subjects. In the same year he reviewed the controversy which had arisen over Richard Kirwan's essay on phlogiston, and published a translation of the adverse commentaries by the French academicians (Lavoisier, Monge, Berthollet, and Guyton de Morveau) as ‘An Essay on Phlogiston, to which are added Notes.’ Nicholson's Hydrometer In 1790 he invented the Nicholson hydrometer, a constant volume hydrometer with a pan for small weights on top and a small container (\\"basket\\") on the bottom into which a sample can be placed.http://physics.kenyon.edu/EarlyApparatus/Fluids/Nicholsons_Hydrometer/Nicholsons_Hydrometer.html Nicholson's Hydrometer, kenyon.edu In 1797 he founded, published, and wrote part of the Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry and the Arts, generally known as Nicholson's Journal, the earliest monthly scientific work of its kind in Great Britain. The journal published the first known aerodynamic analysis of gliders and heavier-than-air fixed-wing flying machines designs, by George Cayley in 1809-1810.Cayley, George. \\"On Aerial Navigation\\" Part 1 , Part 2 , Part 3 Nicholson's Journal of Natural Philosophy, 1809–1810. (Via NASA). The publication continued until 1814. In 1799 he established a school in London's Soho Square, where he taught natural philosophy and chemistry, with the aid of a grant of £1,500 from Thomas Pitt. In May 1800 he with Anthony Carlisle discovered electrolysis, the decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen by voltaic current. The two were then appointed to a chemical investigation committee of the new Royal Institution. But his own interests shortly turned elsewhere.Enterprise and electrolysis. Chemistry World, August 2003, Royal Society of Chemistry In 1809 he became a first class corresponding member, living abroad, of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands. Besides considerable contributions to the Philosophical Transactions, Nicholson wrote translations of Fourcroy's Chemistry (1787) and Chaptal's Chemistry (1788), First Principles of Chemistry (1788) and a Chemical Dictionary (1795); he also edited the British Encyclopedia, or Dictionary of Arts and Sciences (6 vols., London, 1809). Later life During the later years of his life, Nicholson's attention was chiefly directed to water supply engineering at Portsmouth, at Gosport and in Hammersmith. William Nicholson died in Bloomsbury at the age of 61 on 21 May 1815, attended by Sir Anthony Carlisle.

Located in the Negev next to kibbutz Sde Boker, it falls under the jurisdiction of Ramat HaNegev Regional Council. In it had a population of . History The construction of a field school began in 1962, inspired by David Ben-Gurion's vision of developing a thriving Jewish culture in the arid Negev. The Jacob Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research, affiliated with Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, the Ben Gurion Heritage Institute, and a high school emphasizing environmental studies, are now located there. Ben-Gurion and his wife Paula Ben-Gurion are buried on the cliff overlooking the Zin valley. Solar energy research  The Jacob Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research has developed a solar energy research program focusing on how extremes of heat and cold in the desert can be mitigated through efficient storage of heat during the day for release at night. An adobe house was built with rational fenestration, small windows in the northern side and heat collecting concrete prisms in the windows of the south facing wall. The prisms are situated in the rooms. They absorb heat during the day and can be rotated to allow the heat to discharge into the rooms at night. The \\"chimney\\" is part of an evaporative cooling system that maintains the temperature of the house during the day at bearable levels. A double skin greenhouse uses copper sulfate solution as a heat screen during the day. The liquid is pumped between the two skins, protects the interior from ultraviolet rays and collects heat. At night the liquid is recirculated returning the heat to the greenhouse. David Faiman of the Solar Center has made advancements in the realm of concentrator photovoltaics CPV. Faiman has produced a CPV unit capable of producing energy at a factor of up to a thousand more than conventional units.PETAL: A research pathway to fossil- competitive solar electricity Agricultural and biotechnology research Researchers at Midreshet Ben-Gurion have made breakthroughs in agriculture and biotechnology relevant to drylands and sustainable agriculture. The STRS1 and STRS2 genes, master controller genes in stress responses, discovered by Dr. Simon Barak and his students in 2006, helped to elucidate some of the more important genes involved with abiotic stress responses Helicases That Attenuate Arabidopsis Responses to Multiple Abiotic Stresses Director of the institutes, Avigad Vonshak, made headlines for his discovery, together with Prof. Sammy Boussiba (also of the institutes) of astaxanthin accumulation in green algae.Astaxanthin Accumulation in the Green Alga Haematococcus pluvialis Astaxanthin is an extremely valuable poly-unsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) which is valued for its use as a pigment, nutritional value, and possible use in bio-diesel.

Biography Paula Munweis was born in Russia and raised in the United States. She was trained as a nurse at Beth Israel Hospital in Newark, New Jersey.. David Ben-Gurion met her at the home of his friend, Samuel Bonchek, on a visit to New York City. They married in 1917 at New York City's town hall before returning to Israel where Ben-Gurion enlisted as a soldier in the new Jewish Legion of World War I. Paula was originally against the idea of going to Israel, as her anarchist politics pitted her against both Zionism and state building.

This type of antenna is called a Hogg or horn-reflector antenna, invented by Albert Beck and Harald Friis in 1941 and further developed by D. L. Hogg at Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1961. It consists of a flaring metal horn with a metal reflector mounted in the mouth at a 45° angle. The advantage of this design over a parabolic dish antenna is that it has very low sidelobes; that is, the horn shields the antenna from radiation from angles outside the main beam axis, such as ground noise. Andover Earth Station was one of the first satellite earth stations, located at Andover in the US state of Maine. It was built by AT&T; in 1961 to communicate with the Telstar 1 satellite, the first direct relay communications satellite. It provided the first experimental satellite telephone and television service between North America and Europe. It was also used with the Relay satellite. The giant horn was dismantled in the mid 1980s along with the visitor center. The location was selected by AT&T; in December 1960. The main factors were the topography (set in the Western Maine Mountains), and the radio interference signal level. Other factors included a location in the Northeastern United States to give a short great circle path to Western Europe, it was located close enough to existing transcontinental radio relay television and telephone routes to facilitate interconnection. In addition, the site had to be large enough to accommodate an antenna structure and control building, and if necessary, provide room for expansion. Land was purchased in January 1961, and construction of the complex began on May 1\\\\. Building construction was completed and the equipment was installed in February 1962. The Ground Station was operational in the Spring of 1962. AT&T; and Bell Labs initiated, funded, constructed and took the leadership to make this project possible. The radio transmitter aboard Telstar was very low-powered compared to modern communication satellites, with a power of only 14 watts, and transmitted through an omnidirectional antenna. So the ground antennas that communicated with it had to be huge. The Andover Earth Station was equipped with a giant horn antenna, 7 stories high and weighing 340 tons. To protect it from bad weather, a radome made of Dacron covered the antenna. It was 160 feet (49 m) high, 210 feet (64 m) wide and weighed 30 tons. Since the satellite was not in a geosynchronous orbit like modern communication satellites, it passed overhead quickly, and the giant antenna had to be precisely steerable to track the satellite as it moved across the sky. Telstar was launched on July 10, 1962, from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and went into orbit at 4:46 a.m. The engineers at the Andover Earth Station would have to wait 15 hours for the satellite, travelling at a rate of 5 miles per second (8 km/s), 3,000 miles (4,800 km) above the earth to reach within their \\"view\\". The engineers successfully sent a signal to Telstar, which amplified it 10 billion times and relayed it back to Andover. Eugene F. O'Neill, Telstar Project Director and IEEE Fellow, oversaw the success of this project at Andover. He noted that one of the challenges was pointing an extremely sharp beam very accurately at the satellite. At 7:17 p.m. he announced \\"We've acquired Telstar!\\" At 7:31 p.m. an American flag at Andover appeared on the television screen. Then at 7:47 p.m. engineers at Andover received word that the French site, Pleumeur-Bodou, had received the television picture. The Large radome was torn down and land returned to nature in the mid-1980s. MCI Purchased the Andover Earth station in 1987, MCI was later purchased by Verizon including the Andover Earth station in 2006 and managed under the Verizon Business name. The site still operates to this day as part of Verizon's Satellite Solution group supporting satellite operations for Verizon.

Thus, a \\"Dutch uncle\\" is the reverse of what is normally thought of as avuncular or uncle-like (indulgent and permissive). Origins During the Anglo-Dutch Wars between England and the Netherlands in the 17th century, the English language gained an array of insults (including \\"Dutch uncle\\"), such as: { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" - valign=\\"top\\"  * Dutch courage (alcohol-induced bravery) * Double Dutch (incomprehensible, nonsense) * Dutch wife (prostitute, sex doll) * Dutch widow (prostitute)  * Dutch comfort (saying that \\"Things could be worse!\\") * Dutch metal or Dutch gold (cheap alloy resembling gold) * Dutch treat (social date where the invited person pays for himself/herself) * Dutch- bottomed (empty) * Dutch nightingale (frog) } These terms also gained prominence in 17th-century New England during its rivalry with New Netherland, which the Dutch captured (and later recaptured) during the Second Anglo-Dutch War. These colorful (though now incongruous) phrases became part of English usage worldwide, and some are still in use. Alternative explanations Another proposed explanation is that the term, often expressed as \\"talk to one like a Dutch uncle,\\" originated in the early 19th century as an allusion to the sternness and sobriety attributed to the Dutch people. Dutch behaviour is defined in the book Culture Shock! Netherlands: A Survival Guide to Customs and Etiquette as \\"practical, direct, outspoken, stubborn, well-organised, blunt and thinking they are always right.\\" According to that source, these are the alleged reasons behind the English term \\"Dutch uncle.\\"Janin, Hunt. Culture Shock! Netherlands: A Survival Guide to Customs and Etiquette. Another book that advocates this theory is The UnDutchables, which assigns comparable characteristics to Dutch people: \\"not lacking in self-esteem...caught up in a cycle of endless envy...always speak their mind...frank, obstinate, blunt\\", basically summed up by the phrase \\"the natives thrive on shaking their fingers at and scolding each other.\\"White, Colin & Boucke, Laurie.

Spencer was the son of Isaac and Mary (née Selden) Spencer. He was the great-grandson of Gerard and Hannah Spencer, who were part of the first settlers of East Haddam in 1662. Career He was trained as a lawyer and practiced until 1753, when he became a judge.

Bas relief sculpture on the memorial to Spencer located in East Haddam, CT (dedicated 1904)By the time the American Revolution began, Spencer had advanced to Brigadier General of Connecticut’s militia, and in April 1775 he led them to support the Siege of Boston as the 2nd Connecticut Regiment. In June, when these units were adopted into the national army, he was made a brigadier general in the Continental Army; he was amongst the first eight Continental Army brigadier generals so appointed. In 1776, Spencer was promoted to major general in support of William Heath in the Eastern Department. The following year his military career became difficult. He cancelled a planned attack on British forces in Rhode Island and was censured by the Continental Congress. He demanded a court of inquiry and was exonerated, but when the controversy was resolved, he resigned his commission on June 14, 1778. Spencer first served on the Connecticut Council (or Connecticut State Senate) in 1776. Free of military responsibility, the state sent him as a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1779.

The pressure coefficient is used in aerodynamics and hydrodynamics. Every point in a fluid flow field has its own unique pressure coefficient, C_p. In many situations in aerodynamics and hydrodynamics, the pressure coefficient at a point near a body is independent of body size. Consequently, an engineering model can be tested in a wind tunnel or water tunnel, pressure coefficients can be determined at critical locations around the model, and these pressure coefficients can be used with confidence to predict the fluid pressure at those critical locations around a full-size aircraft or boat. Definition The pressure coefficient is a parameter for studying both incompressible/compressible fluids such as water and air. The relationship between the dimensionless coefficient and the dimensional numbers is L. J. Clancy (1975) Aerodynamics, § 3.6, Pitman Publishing Limited, London. Abbott and Von Doenhoff, Theory of Wing Sections, equation 2.24 :C_p = {p - p_\\\\infty \\\\over \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\rho_\\\\infty V_{\\\\infty}^2 } = {p - p_\\\\infty \\\\over p_0 - p_\\\\infty } where: : p is the static pressure at the point at which pressure coefficient is being evaluated : p_\\\\infty is the static pressure in the freestream (i.e. remote from any disturbance) : p_0 is the stagnation pressure in the freestream (i.e. remote from any disturbance) : \\\\rho_\\\\infty is the freestream fluid density (Air at sea level and 15 °C is 1.225 \\\\rm kg/m^3) : V_\\\\infty is the freestream velocity of the fluid, or the velocity of the body through the fluid Incompressible flow Using Bernoulli's Equation, the pressure coefficient can be further simplified for potential flows (inviscid, and steady):Anderson, John D. Fundamentals of Aerodynamics. 4th ed. New York: McGraw Hill, 2007. 219. :C_p0=C_p_{Ma \\\\, \\\\approx \\\\, 0} ={1 - \\\\bigg(\\\\frac{u}{u_{\\\\infty}} \\\\bigg)^2} where u is the flow speed at the point at which pressure coefficient is being evaluated, and Ma is the Mach number: the flow speed is negligible in comparison with the speed of sound. For a case of an incompressible but viscous fluid, this represents the profile pressure coefficient, since it is associated with the pressure hydrodynamic forces rather than the viscous ones. This relationship is valid for the flow of incompressible fluids where variations in speed and pressure are sufficiently small that variations in fluid density can be neglected. This is a reasonable assumption when the Mach Number is less than about 0.3. * C_p of zero indicates the pressure is the same as the free stream pressure. * C_p of one corresponds to the stagnation pressure and indicates a stagnation point. * the most negative values of C_p in a liquid flow can be summed to the cavitation number to give the cavitation margin. If this margin is positive, the flow is locally fully liquid, while if it is zero or negative the flow is cavitating or gas. C_p of minus one is significant in the design of gliders because this indicates a perfect location for a \\"Total energy\\" port for supply of signal pressure to the Variometer, a special Vertical Speed Indicator which reacts to vertical movements of the atmosphere but does not react to vertical maneuvering of the glider. In the fluid flow field around a body there will be points having positive pressure coefficients up to one, and negative pressure coefficients including coefficients less than minus one, but nowhere will the coefficient exceed plus one because the highest pressure that can be achieved is the stagnation pressure. Compressible flow In the flow of compressible fluids such as air, and particularly the high-speed flow of compressible fluids, {\\\\rho v^2}/2 (the dynamic pressure) is no longer an accurate measure of the difference between stagnation pressure and static pressure. Also, the familiar relationship that stagnation pressure is equal to total pressure does not always hold true. (It is always true in isentropic flow but the presence of shock waves can cause the flow to depart from isentropic.) As a result, pressure coefficients can be greater than one in compressible flow.https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/608/1/Scherer_lr_1950.pdf * C_p greater than one indicates the freestream flow is compressible. = Perturbation theory = The pressure coefficient C_p can be estimated for irrotational and isentropic flow by introducing the potential \\\\Phi and the perturbation potential \\\\phi, normalized by the free-stream velocity u_{\\\\infty} \\\\Phi = u_{\\\\infty}x + \\\\phi(x, y, z) Using Bernoulli's Equation, \\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Phi}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\frac{ abla \\\\Phi \\\\cdot abla \\\\Phi}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{\\\\gamma-1}\\\\frac{p}{\\\\rho} = \\\\text{constant} \\\\end{align} which can be rewritten as \\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Phi}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\frac{ abla \\\\Phi \\\\cdot abla \\\\Phi}{2} + \\\\frac{a^2}{\\\\gamma-1}= \\\\text{constant} \\\\end{align} here w is a is the sound speed.

From the use of the momentum equation and the assumption of isentropic perturbations, one obtains the following basic piston theory formula for the surface pressure: p = p_{\\\\infty}\\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{\\\\gamma-1}{2}\\\\frac{w}{a}\\\\right)^{\\\\frac{2\\\\gamma}{\\\\gamma-1}} here w is the downwash speed and a is the sound speed. \\\\begin{align} C_p = \\\\frac{p-p_{\\\\infty}}{\\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{2}p_{\\\\infty} M^2} = \\\\frac{2}{\\\\gamma M^2}\\\\left[\\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{\\\\gamma-1}{2}\\\\frac{w}{a}\\\\right)^{\\\\frac{2\\\\gamma}{\\\\gamma-1}} - 1\\\\right] \\\\end{align} The surface is defined as \\\\begin{align} F(x,y,z,t)= z - f(x,y,t) = 0 \\\\end{align} The slip velocity boundary condition leads to \\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{ abla F}{ abla F}(u_{\\\\infty} + \\\\phi_x,\\\\phi_y,\\\\phi_z) = V_{\\\\text{wall}}\\\\cdot \\\\frac{ abla F}{ abla F} = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial t}\\\\frac{1}{ abla F} \\\\end{align} The downwash speed w is approximated as \\\\begin{align} w = \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial t} + u_{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x} \\\\end{align}  Pressure distribution  An airfoil at a given angle of attack will have what is called a pressure distribution. This pressure distribution is simply the pressure at all points around an airfoil. Typically, graphs of these distributions are drawn so that negative numbers are higher on the graph, as the C_p for the upper surface of the airfoil will usually be farther below zero and will hence be the top line on the graph.  Relationship with aerodynamic coefficients All the three aerodynamic coefficients are integrals of the pressure coefficient curve along the chord. The coefficient of lift for a two-dimensional airfoil section with strictly horizontal surfaces can be calculated from the coefficient of pressure distribution by integration, or calculating the area between the lines on the distribution. This expression is not suitable for direct numeric integration using the panel method of lift approximation, as it does not take into account the direction of pressure-induced lift. This equation is true only for zero angle of attack. :C_l=\\\\frac{1}{x_{TE}-x_{LE}}\\\\int\\\\limits_{x_{LE}}^{x_{TE}}\\\\left(C_{p_l}(x)-C_{p_u}(x)\\\\right)dx where: :C_{p_l} is pressure coefficient on the lower surface :C_{p_u} is pressure coefficient on the upper surface :x_{LE} is the leading edge location :x_{TE} is the trailing edge location When the lower surface C_p is higher (more negative) on the distribution it counts as a negative area as this will be producing down force rather than lift.

It is also known as the Deming circle/cycle/wheel, the Shewhart cycle, the control circle/cycle, or plan–do–study–act (PDSA). Another version of this PDCA cycle is OPDCA.Foresight University, The Foresight Guide, Shewhart's Learning and Deming's Quality Cycle, The added \\"O\\" stands for observation or as some versions say: \\"Observe the current condition.\\" This emphasis on observation and current condition has currency with the literature on lean manufacturing and the Toyota Production System. The PDCA cycle, with Ishikawa’s changes, can be traced back to S. Mizuno of the Tokyo Institute of Technology in 1959. Meaning The PDCA cycle Continuous quality improvement with PDCA =Plan= Establish objectives and processes required to deliver the desired results. =Do= Carry out the objectives from the previous step. =Check= During the check phase, the data and results gathered from the do phase are evaluated. Data is compared to the expected outcomes to see any similarities and differences. The testing process is also evaluated to see if there were any changes from the original test created during the planning phase. If the data is placed in a chart it can make it easier to see any trends if the PDCA cycle is conducted multiple times. This helps to see what changes work better than others, and if said changes can be improved as well. Example: Gap analysis, or Appraisals. =Act= Also called \\"Adjust\\", this act phase is where a process is improved. Records from the \\"do\\" and \\"check\\" phases help identify issues with the process. These issues may include problems, non-conformities, opportunities for improvement, inefficiencies and other issues that result in outcomes that are evidently less-than-optimal. Root causes of such issues are investigated, found and eliminated by modifying the process. Risk is re-evaluated. At the end of the actions in this phase, the process has better instructions, standards or goals. Planning for the next cycle can proceed with a better base-line. Work in the next do phase should not create recurrence of the identified issues; if it does, then the action was not effective. About PDCA was made popular by W. Edwards Deming, who is considered by many to be the father of modern quality control; however, he always referred to it as the \\"Shewhart cycle\\". Later in Deming's career, he modified PDCA to \\"Plan, Do, Study, Act\\" (PDSA) because he felt that \\"check\\" emphasized inspection over analysis. Also published by Simon & Schuster, 1991. The PDSA cycle was used to create the model of know-how transfer process, and other models. The concept of PDCA is based on the scientific method, as developed from the work of Francis Bacon (Novum Organum, 1620). The scientific method can be written as \\"hypothesis–experiment–evaluation\\" or as \\"plan–do–check\\". Walter A. Shewhart described manufacture under \\"control\\"—under statistical control—as a three- step process of specification, production, and inspection. Reprint. Originally published: Washington, DC: Graduate School of the Department of Agriculture, 1939. He also specifically related this to the scientific method of hypothesis, experiment, and evaluation. Shewhart says that the statistician \\"must help to change the demand [for goods] by showing [...] how to close up the tolerance range and to improve the quality of goods.\\" Clearly, Shewhart intended the analyst to take action based on the conclusions of the evaluation. According to Deming, during his lectures in Japan in the early 1950s, the Japanese participants shortened the steps to the now traditional plan, do, check, act. Deming preferred plan, do, study, act because \\"study\\" has connotations in English closer to Shewhart's intent than \\"check\\". Multiple iterations of the PDCA cycle are repeated until the problem is solved.A fundamental principle of the scientific method and PDCA is iteration—once a hypothesis is confirmed (or negated), executing the cycle again will extend the knowledge further. Repeating the PDCA cycle can bring its users closer to the goal, usually a perfect operation and output. Another fundamental function of PDCA is the \\"hygienic\\" separation of each phase, for if not properly separated measurements of effects due to various simultaneous actions (causes) risk becoming confounded. PDCA (and other forms of scientific problem solving) is also known as a system for developing critical thinking. At Toyota this is also known as \\"Building people before building cars\\". Toyota and other lean manufacturing companies propose that an engaged, problem-solving workforce using PDCA in a culture of critical thinking is better able to innovate and stay ahead of the competition through rigorous problem solving and the subsequent innovations. Deming continually emphasized iterating towards an improved system, hence PDCA should be repeatedly implemented in spirals of increasing knowledge of the system that converge on the ultimate goal, each cycle closer than the previous. One can envision an open coil spring, with each loop being one cycle of the scientific method, and each complete cycle indicating an increase in our knowledge of the system under study. This approach is based on the belief that our knowledge and skills are limited, but improving. Especially at the start of a project, key information may not be known; the PDCA—scientific method—provides feedback to justify guesses (hypotheses) and increase knowledge. Rather than enter \\"analysis paralysis\\" to get it perfect the first time, it is better to be approximately right than exactly wrong. With improved knowledge, one may choose to refine or alter the goal (ideal state). The aim of the PDCA cycle is to bring its users closer to whatever goal they choose. When PDCA is used for complex projects or products with a certain controversy, checking with external stakeholders should happen before the Do stage, since changes to projects and products that are already in detailed design can be costly; this is also seen as Plan-Check-Do-Act. Rate of change, that is, rate of improvement, is a key competitive factor in today's world. PDCA allows for major \\"jumps\\" in performance (\\"breakthroughs\\" often desired in a Western approach), as well as kaizen (frequent small improvements). In the United States a PDCA approach is usually associated with a sizable project involving numerous people's time, and thus managers want to see large \\"breakthrough\\" improvements to justify the effort expended. However, the scientific method and PDCA apply to all sorts of projects and improvement activities.

Sarkar conceived of PROUT in 1959. Supporters of PROUT (Proutists) claim that the theory exposes and overcomes the limitations of both capitalism and communism. It aims to be economically progressive and improve social development. The theory is in line with Sarkar's Neohumanist values which aim to provide \\"proper care\\" to every being on the planet, including humans, animals and plants.  History  By 1959, Sarkar had developed the ideas of Prout. In 1961, the theory was formally outlined in his book Ananda Sutram, published under his spiritual name Shrii Shrii Ánandamúrti. The theory is not widely accepted. Cooperative communities have been established by Ananda Marga in an attempt to provide ideal models for the society outlined in Prout. Theory = Overview = Prout proposes a socioeconomic system as an alternative to communism and capitalism, . Under the system material goods would be common property and distributed in a rational and equitable way to maximize the physical, mental, and spiritual development of all people. The distribution intends to guarantee food, clothing, shelter, education, and medical care (what the theory regards as minimum requirements for humans). Prout advocates a three-tiered approach to industrial organization. Key industries and public utilities would be nonprofit organizations. Decentralized industry run by sociolinguistic unions would provide people's minimum necessities. The majority of economic transactions would be through producers' and consumers' cooperatives. Incentives for people serving society would be funded via surpluses. At the political level, Prout rejects nationalism. Instead, there would be locally governed self-sufficient socioeconomic zones and a world government. There would be a world constitution and a bill of rights for animals and plants, as well as humans. = Law of social cycle and governance = Prout takes account of Sarkar's law of social cycle. It sees the social order as consisting of four classes of people that cyclically dominate society: shudras (workers), kshatriyas (warriors), vipras (intellectuals) and vaishyas (acquisitors). However, Prout does not seek the abolition of these four classes, as it sees them as \\"... not merely as a power configuration, but as a way of knowing the world, as a paradigm, episteme or deep structure if you will.\\" It considers that any person can be worker, warrior, intellectual or acquisitive minded. Prout see the four classes as connected to cyclic processes across time. That when a class of people struggle and rise to power they cause a revolution in the physical and mental world. To prevent any social class from clinging to political power and exploiting the others, a \\"spiritual elite\\" sadvipras (etymologically sad – true, vipra – intellectual) would determine who will hold political leadership. Prout theorises that the first sadvipras would come from disgruntled middle-class intellectuals and warriors. Sadvipras would be organized into executive, legislative, and judicial boards which would be governed by a Supreme Board. They would be responsible for the order of dominance within the social order. = Neohumanism = The Prout theory is inline with Sarkar's Neohumanism philosophy. The philosophy is a reinterpretation of humanism integrating the idea of unity of all life. In it all living beings belong to a universal family deserving equal care and respect. = The five fundamental principles = In 1962, Sarkar formally outlined Prout in sixteen aphorisms (see Chapter 5 of Ananda Sutram). The last five aphorisms (5:12-16) are commonly referred to as the five fundamental principles of Prout. These five principles are deemed to be fundamental because it would be difficult to get a clear understanding of Prout without comprehending the underlying concepts of these principles, the interrelationship of the principles, and their respective areas of application. The five aphorisms from Ananda Sutram translate into English as follows: # There should be no accumulation of wealth without the permission of society. # There should be maximum utilization and rational distribution of the crude, subtle, and causal resources. # There should be maximum utilization of the physical, mental, and spiritual potentialities of the individual and collective beings. # There should be a well-balanced adjustment among the crude, subtle, and causal utilizations. # Utilizations vary in accordance with time, space, and form; the utilizations should be progressive. An initial glimpse of these five principles first appeared in Sarkar's earlier work, Idea and Ideology. = The market = As far as Prout's values and goals differ from those of capitalism and communism, so does its economic structure. Following a close analysis of the two systems, Prout's propounder argues that these philosophies are \\"anti-human“ in the sense that they encourage people to relentlessly pursue material attainment, like name, fame, etc. Another criticism of neo-liberalism and capitalism in general is the centralization of economic power in the hands of the rich leads to the exploitation of the masses and ultimately to the degeneration of society. Prout claims that both capitalism and communism have been built on shaky foundations, and identifies weaknesses to a point where a new market system is required. He heavily critiqued communism, indicating that one of the reasons the USSRs experiment with communism did not work, causing the eventual implosion of their political structure, is that the sovietic central planning committees (Gosplan) had too much economic decision and cohersion power in the federation (see Marxism–Leninism). Nonetheless, Sarkar observed aspects of market planning that help to create and sustain a healthy economy. In summary, Proutist thought considers that planning allows the market to protect its stakeholders from the meanderings of neo-liberal economics where profit-motive speaks highest. However, he stresses that a planning committee at a national level should only outline the broader aspects of economic development, leaving the details to be resolved by planning bodies at a local level where problems are best understood and more easily dealt with. (see diseconomies of scale). Consequently, this kind of top-down planning will leave communities, enterprises and ultimately workers with a significant level of freedom to decide their own economic future (see decentralized planning). Prout also claims that the nationalization of enterprises is inefficient due to the larger costs and amount of bureaucracy necessary to keep state-controlled industries running. Yet, there are some industries that should be nationalized, operating on a \\"no-profit, no-loss\\" principle. Concerning wealth distribution among the population, Prout argues for an \\"optimal inequality\\" where the wage gap between the richer strata of society is substantially subsided. Richard Freeman, a Harvard economist, points out income inequality comes from the monopoly of power and other activities with \\"negative consequences\\" in terms of social development. Nonetheless Prout is not in favour of total income equality, claiming that in a society where material motivation to work is absent, the willingness to strive for financial success and to thrive in the creative development of industry and society will be lost in its citizens. Therefore, Sarkar argues for the implementation of a policy allowing the most meritous in society to receive added perks for the added benefits they bring to society. It is thus theorized that the communist's motto of from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs cannot work in the real world. Prout proposes instead a minimum and maximum wage, roughly attributed according to the value the work of each person brings to society. We see examples of attempts in this direction in companies like Mondragon or Whole Foods. Regarding neo-liberalism, Sarkar throws a new light to the concept of Adam Smith's invisible hand, where individual producers acting self-interest benefit the community as a whole. Prout claims that, unchecked, societies economic elite will disrupt the just circulation of material wealth within society. The market will then require regulatory measures so as to create a functional economic system. = Economic democracy = In relation to democracy, Prout argues that political democracy is not enough to free society from exploitation and what it considers extreme income inequality. As Roar Bjonnes, a known Proutist, states, \\"Unless we have deeper structural change – what we refer to as economic-systems change – we will never be able to solve such global and systemic problems as the environmental and inequality crises. History has demonstrated that political democracy is not enough.\\" Prout, therefore, advocates an economic democracy where the decision-making power for the economic future of a community is given to its inhabitants. Economic democracy is not a new term, but Sarkar reinvents it by setting four requirements for what he considers a successful one. The first and foremost requirement is guaranteeing the minimum requirements of life to all members of society. Secondly, and following one of the five fundamental principles, Prout argues that there should be an increasing purchasing capacity for each individual, stating that local people will have to hold economic power over their socio-economic region. Still, on this regard, Sarkar theorizes that, unlike capitalism, where the production and distribution of goods are mainly decided by market competition, in a Proutistic society it should be based on necessity. The third requirement of economic democracy is the decentralization of power, giving the freedom to make economic decisions to its stakeholders. That can be accomplished by adopting a worker-owned cooperative system and by the use of local resources (raw materials and other natural resources) for the development of the region and not merely for export. In summary, Prout advocates a decentralized economy where self- sufficient economic zones are created and organized according to a set of predetermined conditions (see socio-economic units). Prout claims this requirement does not express xenophobic feelings, it solely claims to be the realization that there should not be a constant outflow of local capital, where natural resources are explored by foreign investment companies that extract assets and money out of the community. From a Neohumanist perspective, all people are free to choose where they wish to live, as long as they merge their economic interests with the ones of the local people. = Socio-economic units = A socio-economic unit, or Samaj in Sanskrit, is the Proutist materialization of the collective effort to create a strong and resilient local community, built on strong feelings of solidarity and self-identity. There are a few criteria that Sarkar outlined in order to build a working and cohesive socio-economic unit. Similar to bioregions, their purpose is to facilitate cooperative development, moving towards a decentralized economy, where these units are economically independent and self-reliant. Though still guided by national and federal guidelines and laws, they should prepare its own economic plan. Aiming to achieve maximum efficiency in the utilization of local resources, they propose to make trade across borders more balanced and mutually beneficial. = Progress = From Prout's perspective, a progressive society cannot solely be measured by the wealth of a nation or its GDP levels. Prout recognizes the benefits of material progress, but deems them insufficient indicators of the development of human society. It argues that even though progress as its interpreted by society today has its advantages, there are negative side effects that, if unchecked, bring more harm than good. Ronald Logan, author of A new Paradigm of Development, reminds its readers that even though auto and air traffic enables us to travel at increasing speeds, bringing great convenience to travelers and commuters, it also brings air pollution, noise pollution, traffic congestion, accidental deaths, alienation from nature, etc. Presented with this quasi-paradoxical situation, Prout offers a concept of progress as a society that transcends material and technological development. Moving along the lines of the triple bottom line that analyzes the social, environmental and financial output of a given enterprise, Prout advocates a measure of progress that encompasses the qualities of what could be termed a \\"fourth bottom line\\", characterized by the incorporation of a transcendental dimension of human life that focuses on the integrated development of the body, mind and spirit. This fourth bottom line will allow society in general and individuals in particular to develop an expanded sense of identity, allowing for a neohumanist will of inclusion, creating a society where material gains are not the summum bonum of life and allowing space to be created for people to work together in a symbiotic movement that primes for individual and collective welfare through social, cultural, as well as technological development. Prout acknowledges that the well-being of individuals lies in the development of the collective, and that the collective depends on the development of individuals. Therefore, in order to understand how a progressive society is to be achieved, Sarkar tries to analyze what it means for a human being to grow and develop. He concludes that physical and psychic development render little progress for a human being as they are subject to deterioration and decay. There are multifarious diseases that affect our body and mind, and even if we stay free of them, eventually time will turn all our physical and mental faculties of no use. Sarkar argues that the only aspect of human life that seems to be subject to no change over time is its transcendental nature, the \\"supra-emotional values\\" intrinsic to the human mind and which exacerbate human multilateral existence. \\"The deepest truths of life are an eternal fountain of inspiration. Spiritual, transpersonal development is a process of expanding one's consciousness to link with the Infinite, to reach a state of deep peace and happiness.\\" From a Maslownian perspective, Sarkar defends the need to meet physical and mental needs before being able to engage in a journey to find that transcendental nature of the world. The five fundamental principles stem from this idea that society needs to provide for the basic necessities of all human beings so that they can engage in this journey of self-discovery and achieve true progress. Fundamentally, progress in society is the effort through which communities engage in the fulfillment of human needs, with the goal of achieving a transcendental existence. As a goal, transcendence will offer a fourth bottom line which ideally would propel human society into a more peaceful, inclusive and all-round more progressive existence. Criticism Prout is a relatively unknown theory. Ravi Batra was one of the first economists that used the ideas of Prout in his bestseller The Great Depression of 1990. In time, the theory attracted attention of people like Johan Galtung, founder of the UN Institute for Peace studies who claimed that \\"Sarkar’s theory is far superior to Adam Smith’s or that of Marx.\\" According to a description by Terry Irving and Rowan Cahill, Prout \\"envisages a decentralised, community-based world economy of self-sufficiency for the poor; economic democracy; small business; and limits on the accumulation of wealth.\\" Sohail Inayatullah stated that the philosophy \\"attempts to balance the need for societies to create wealth and grow with the requirements for distribution.\\" David Skrbina characterized Prout as a \\"model of social development... which advocates a 'small is beautiful' approach to society.\\" Economics instructor Mark Friedman places Sarkar's economic thought in the tradition of Monsignor John A. Ryan, E.F. Schumacher and Herman Daly in Sarkar's incorporation of spiritual values into economic goals. It has been characterized as a form of \\"progressive socialism\\" as well as a \\"socialist theory\\". Hans Despain noted, in Monthly Review, that there are similarities between Prout and the theories of David Schweickart, Gar Alperovitz and Richard D. Wolff. Particularly the focus on economic democracy and co-operatives.

History The company was run by two brothers, Bryan and David Shepherd. The car was designed as a veteran car, in the Edwardian style, but is not a replica of any particular marque although it bears some resemblance to a 1908 Buick. Early models used the BMC A-series engine and suspension from the Morris Minor in a specially built tubular steel chassis. The engine was governed to allow a maximum speed of . The car was hand built and quite expensive at £1987 before a long list of extras was added. Purchasers requiring a hood or a screen found themselves invited to pay an extra £70 or £50 for these luxuries. From 1974 a 1300 cc Standard SC engine from the Triumph Spitfire was used and a longer wheelbase five-seat option came in 1976. Albany also made a replica 1910 AEC open air bus, based on a Ford D Series lorry chassis, that now provides very brief quasi-vintage bus rides at the Beaulieu motor museum in Hampshire. It appeared in the 1970s remake of the film 'The 39 Steps' starring Robert Powell. In 1973 about a car every two weeks was being produced and exports to the United States started. However, after about 12 cars were shipped the importing company failed. The price in 1974, now with a 1500cc Triumph engine had risen to £2487. By 1977 110 cars had been built. As of 1992, the open-top Albany featuring a 1500 cc SC engine was being built for export only. The company closed in 1997.

The crew of the mission was sent by MirCorp, a privately funded company, to reactivate and repair the station. The crew also resupplied the station and boosted the station to an orbit with a low point (perigee) of 360 and a high point (apogee) of 378 kilometers (223 and 235 miles, respectively). The boost in the station's orbit, which was done by utilizing the engines of the Progress M1-1 and M1-2 spacecraft, made transit between Mir and the International Space Station impossible, as desired by NASA. The mission was the first privately funded mission to a space station. The mission was part of an effort by MirCorp to refurbish and privatize the aging Mir space station, which was nearing the end of its operational life. Further commercially funded missions beyond Soyuz TM-30 were originally planned to continue the restoration efforts of the then 14-year-old space station, but insufficient funding and investment ultimately led to the de-orbit of the station in early 2001. Crew Soyuz TM-30 was the first spaceflight for flight commander Zalyotin, who became a cosmonaut in 1990 and completed his general training two years later in 1992. TM-30 was the third visit to space made by flight engineer Kaleri, who became a cosmonaut in 1984 and completed general training in 1986. He served as flight engineer aboard the Soyuz TM-14 and TM-24 missions to Mir in 1992 and 1996-7, respectively. =Backup crew= While Soyuz TM-30 was in orbit, a second privately funded mission was being planned to continue the restoration efforts aboard Mir. The crew assigned to this mission, although never flown, was reported to have been the backup crew for TM-30, cosmonauts Salizhan Sharipov and Pavel Vinogradov. Background Soyuz TM-30 was intended by MirCorp to be the first in a series of missions to refurbish the 14-year-old Mir space station for commercial use. Although the mission was scheduled to last approximately two months, commander Sergei Zalyotin said before the flight that if additional funds became available the mission could be extended until August, when another crew would replace them. The other possible scenario, which occurred in reality, was again to leave the station uninhabited, as had been done several months before the mission. Towards the end of Soyuz TM-30 plans were formed to send another privately funded mission to continue with MirCorp's maintenance efforts; cosmonauts Salizhan Sharipov and Pavel Vinogradov were tentatively assigned as the crew. Mission highlights The launch of Soyuz TM-30 on April 4, 2000 Soyuz TM-30 launched at 05:01:29 UT on April 4, 2000. Docking occurred on April 6 at 06:31:24 UT. Although the Soyuz docking system is automated under normal conditions, the final few meters of the approach to the station were executed in manual mode. The decision to switch to manual mode came after the cosmonauts noticed a small deviation in the spacecraft's approach to the targeted docking port. At about 09:32 UT on the day of docking, the crew prepared to open the hatches between the Soyuz spacecraft and the station. After entering the station the crew stabilized the atmosphere inside Mir and undertook routine maintenance work. On April 25, an uncrewed Progress resupply mission, Progress M1-2, launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome to the station to deliver supplies to the crew. Progress M1-2 docked with Mir on April 27. On April 26, the Progress M1-1 spacecraft, which had been docked since February and was used by the Russian Federal Space Agency to boost the station to a higher orbit, undocked and de-orbited over the Pacific Ocean east of New Zealand. The mission's only Extra-Vehicular Activity, or spacewalk, took place on May 12, between 10:44 and 15:36 UTC. The primary objectives of the spacewalk were to repair damage to Mir's exterior components and record panoramas of the station's hull in order for experts on Earth to analyze the effects of space on the station itself. The cosmonauts inspected a malfunctioning solar array on the Kvant-1 module of the station. They discovered that a burnt-through wire connecting the array with its steering system was preventing its proper rotation. The array was subsequently deemed a loss. On June 15, 2000, the TM-30 spacecraft undocked from the station at about 21:24 UT. The de-orbit burn occurred at about 23:52 UT and landing followed at about 00:44 UT on June 16, about southeast of Arkalyk in Kazakhstan. Milestones Soyuz TM-30 was the first privately funded crewed space expedition but several other firsts were also achieved, including the first privately funded extra-vehicular activity, and the first privately funded uncrewed resupply mission to a space station, utilizing the Progress-M1 spacecraft. Soyuz TM-30 also managed to delay the de-orbit of Mir, which was originally scheduled to occur some time in 2000, but ultimately occurred in March 2001.

The 1247 cc 10 hp was sold in two versions. The Utility model had a three-speed gearbox and shaft drive to a rear axle with no differential and rear-wheel brakes only. It was only available with open two-seat coachwork and cost £200. The Special Touring model was similar in mechanical specification but did have a differential and electric starting and was available with a variety of bodies including closed saloons or as chassis only. It cost between £190 (chassis only) and £275 for the 2-seat coupe. In late 1923 the 10 hp was joined by a smaller 1094 cc 8 hp with 2-seat body at £165 or a sports model at £190. In 1924 the company appears to have been in financial difficulties and moved to new premises at Bedford Street, Coventry.

The first remains of Therizinosaurus were found in 1948 by a Mongolian field expedition at the Gobi Desert. Fossils of this species were first described by Evgeny Maleev in 1954 and originally thought to belong to a turtle-like reptile. It is known only from a few bones, including gigantic hand claws, from which it gets its name. Additional findings comprising forelimb and hindlimb elements have been discovered during the 1960s-1980s. Therizinosaurus comprises the single species T. cheloniformis, which could grow up from long and weigh possibly over . It had the longest known claws of any land animal, reaching up to in length. Unlike other therizinosaurs, the claws were very stiff and elongated, but like other members, it would have been slow, long-necked/high browser herbivore equipped with a keratinous beak and a wide torso. The feet ended in four weight-bearing toes, resembling the unrelated sauropodomorphs. Therizinosaurus was a very tall animal, likely outmatching predators like Tarbosaurus. It was (along with Nanshiungosaurus) one of the last and the largest representatives of its unique group, the Therizinosauria. Therizinosaurus is classified as a therizinosaurid, meaning it was more derived (advanced) than the primitive therizinosauroids. At first, therizinosaurs had very complex relationships due to the lack of genera and findings at the time. Originally, they were thought to be some kind of Cretaceous sauropodomorphs or transitional ornithischians, but after years of taxonomic debate they are now placed within the Theropoda, specifically as maniraptorans. History of discovery Cretaceous-aged dinosaur fossil localities of Mongolia; Therizinosaurus fossils have been collected from the Altan Uul, Hermiin Tsav, and Nemegt localities at the area A (Nemegt Formation localities) The first fossil remains of Therizinosaurus were discovered in 1948 by the Mongolian Paleontological Expedition of the USSR Academy of Sciences at the Nemegt Formation of the Gobi Desert, southwestern Mongolia. The expedition unearthed enormous manual unguals (claws) from the stratotype locality, Nemegt. This unusual specimen was labelled under the number of PIN 551-483 and consisted of three partial manual unguals, a metacarpal fragment and several rib fragments. Later on, the fossils were named and described by the Russian paleontologist Evgeny Maleev in 1954, who thought they belonged to a large, long marine turtle that used the giant claws to harvest seaweed. This specimen became the holotype for the new genus and species Therizinosaurus cheloniformis. The generic name, Therizinosaurus, is derived from the Greek θερίζω (therízo, meaning scythe, reap or cut) and σαῦρος (sauros, meaning lizard), in reference to the enormous manual claws and the specific name, cheloniformis, is taken from the Greek χελώνη (chelóni, meaning turtle) and the Latin formis, since the remains were thought to belong to a turtle-like reptile. Maleev only depicted a fragmented rib and the most complete claw and noted some inconsistencies regarding the affinities of this new taxon. Translated paper Though it was not fully understood what general kind of creature these claws belonged, in 1970, the Russian paleontologist Anatoly K. Rozhdestvensky was one of the first authors in suggest that Therizinosaurus was a theropod dinosaur and not a turtle. Contrary to Maleev, he illustrated the three holotypic manual unguals and reidentified the metacarpal fragment as a metatarsal. The unusual shape of both metatarsal and ribs fragments led Rozhdestvensky to classify them as sauropod remains. Further expeditions in the Nemegt Formation unearthed more fossils of this particular genus. In 1968, prior to Rozhdestvensky statements, the upper portion of a manual ungual was found in the Altan Uul locality and labelled as IGM 100/17. Another fragmented ungual was discovered at the Hermiin Tsav locality in 1972; this specimen, IGM 100/16, was found preserving its lower portion. During the year 1973, the fairly more complete specimen IGM 100/15 was also recovered from Nemegt, and consisted of the left and right arms compromising both scapulocoracoids (left is fragmented though), both humeri, right ulna with radius and left ulna, two right carpals, the right metacarpus including a complete digit Il, and some ribs with gastralia. All of these specimens were first described by the Mongolian paleontologist Rinchen Barsbold in 1976. In this new monograph, he observed that the rib fragments in IGM 100/15 are more slender than the ones of the holotype, and identified IGM 100/16 and 100/17 as pertaining to the first and third digit, respectively. During the same year and also from Hermiin Tsav, the specimen IGM 100/45 was discovered by the Joint Soviet- Mongolian Paleontological Expedition. Unlike the previous findings, this specimen is represented by a hindlimb composed of a very fragmented femur with tibia, astragalus, calcaneum, a lower tarsal, a tetradacyl pes compromising four partial metatarsals, nearly complete digits I, II and IV (although II and IV are missing the unguals) and the presumed second phalanx from the digit III. These newer remains were described by the also Mongolian paleontologist Altangerel Perle in 1982. He referred the specimen to Therizinosaurus based on the striking resemblance to Segnosaurus, another therizinosaurid genus also known from limb elements. Translated paper Description Size comparison (10 meters estimate) with a 1.8 m tall human For maniraptoran standards, Therizinosaurus obtained enormous sizes, estimated to have reach in length with ponderous weights from , or possibly over 5 tonnes. These dimensions make Therizinosaurus the largest therizinosaur known and the largest known maniraptoran. Along with the contemporaneous Deinocheirus, it was the largest maniraptoriform. Genus List for Holtz 2012 Weight Information Though the body remains of Therizinosaurus are relatively incomplete, inferences can be made about its physical characteristics based on more complete and related therizinosaurids. Like other members of their family, Therizinosaurus had a proportionally small skull bearing a keratinous beak atop the long neck, with bipedal gaits and a heavy, broad belly for foliage processing with the addition of sparse feathering. Its hindlimbs ended in four functionally, weight-bearing toes unlike other theropod groups in which the first toe was reduced to a dewclaw. In 2010, Senter and James used hindlimb length equations to predict the total length of the hindlimbs in Therizinosaurus and Deinocheirus. They concluded that an average Therizinosaurus may have had approximately long legs. More recently, Mike Taylor and Matt Wedel suggested that the whole neck would be 2.9 times the size of the humerus, which was , resulting in a long neck based on comparisons with the cervical vertebrae series of Nanshiungosaurus. Life restoration Therizinosaurus can be distinguished from other therizinosaurids in having very straight manual unguals that are side to side compressed (flattened) and hypertrophied (elongated) with poor curves, an extended deltopectoral crest on the humerus, the length of metacarpal I is larger than 2/3 the length of metacarpal III, and the metacarpal I has an enlarged inner crest that connects the inner lower condyle and upper inner lobe. The most distinctive feature of Therizinosaurus was the presence of gigantic claws on each of the three digits of its front limbs. These were common among therizinosaurs but particularly large and stiff in Therizinosaurus, and they are considered as the longest known from any terrestrial animal. =Forelimbs= Frontal view of the arms in specimen IGM 100/15 at the science center Experimentarium in left The most complete arm of Therizinosaurus is represented by the specimen IGM 100/15 which preserves an almost complete right arm and a more fragmented left arm. The right arm covers in total length. The scapula measures long with a stocky and flattened dorsal blade, wide acromial process and a very widened ventral surface; the blade seems to be broken at the end though. Near the anterior edge of the scapular widening and near the scapulocoracoid suture, a foramen is visible; it likely functioned as a channel for blood vessels and nerves when alive. The posterior edge of the scapula is robust and the acromion is lightly built, likely fused into a cartilaginous system with its periphery in life. The coracoid measures in length, it has a broad and convex lateral surface that forms a slightly inclined concavity near of the scapulocoracoid suture. This concavity bends down towards the scapular widening. Near the scapulocoracoid suture, this edge turns very thin and possibly into cartilage along with the periphery of the coracoid in life, as the case of the scapular edge. A large foramen is also present on the coracoid. The glenoid is broad and deep, slightly pointing to the outer lateral side. It has robust, convex crest-like borders. The supraglenoid thickness is developed in a convex crest-shaped form, it is divided across the top of the scapulocoracoid suture. The attachment for the biceps muscle is prominently developed by a large tubercle with a stocky top, indicating powerful muscles in life. Translated paper The humerus is robustly built, measuring long. It has a broad proximal end. The deltoid crest is tall and thick, its top is located approximately 1/3 from the upper end, the length of the crest is no less than 2/3 the length of the whole bone element. The lower end of the humerus is very expanded and flattened in a posterior direction. The condyles are developed onto the anterior side of the lower expansion while the epicondyles are very broad and project over the limits of the articular areas. The ulna is measured at and most of its length is occupied by the straight shaft. The ulnar process is very wide. The upper articular area can be divided into the inner and outer lateral sides. The lateral side has a triangular-shaped border and is slightly concave; it is limited in a top view by the fossa for the upper articulation of the radius. The inner side forms a semilunar-shaped fossa that caps the lunar-shaped condyle of the humerus. The radius is long and slightly S-curved. The upper end is flattened in a lateral direction, very wide and the distal end is highly robust. Hand and claws Frontal view of hand composite of referred specimens IGM 100/15, 100/16, and/or 100/17 in Japan The preserved right manus is composed of two lower carpal bones, complete three metacarpal bones and a complete second digit. The first lower carpal measures tall and wide having two articulations on the lowermost end. The upper surface of this carpal is divided by a broad fossa that forms the articulation of the carpus. On its inner side it has a triangular-shaped outline and attaches to the upper surface of metacarpal I occupying a little bit less than the lateral side, which articulates to metacarpal II. When they cross, these areas are separated by an oblique projection. The second lower carpal is smaller than the first one, it measures tall and tall. Its lower surface is flattened and the articular surface of the carpus extends from the first carpal to the second carpal over the articulation of the two bones. Claw cast of PIN 551–483 at the Australian Museum The metacarpal I is long and compared to the others is more robust and stocky. Overall, the lateral side is broad, especially on the uppermost area; the inner border is thin and narrow. The upper articulation is configured into three parts. The lower articular top is somewhat asymmetric, and bends to the inner side from the left, along with a wide, deep opening. The metacarpal II measures in length and is the most elongated and robust. It has an inclined, square and flattened upper articulation. The articulation on the lower head has very symmetrical condyles, being divided by a broad, deep fossa. The lateral connecting openings are poorly developed. The metacarpal III covers in length, it has a very thin shaft compared to the other metacarpals, and features an upper articulation that splits into three parts. The lower articular head is asymmetrical with deep and broad openings. As in metacarpal II, the lateral connecting openings are poorly developed. Only the second digit of the right manus was preserved, consisting of two phalanges and a large ungual. The first and second phalanges are somewhat equal in shape and length ( and , respectively), they also share the robust and stocky structure. The upper articular facets are very symmetrical and preserve a crest that is particularly taller in the first phalanx. The top border of this crest is very pointed and thick; it likely served as the site for attachment of the extensor tendons in life. The lower heads are nearly symmetrical, but the central fossa is considerably wider and deeper in the first phalanx. The preserved unguals are specially enormous, estimated to be approximately in length. Unlike other therizinosaurs, they are very straight, laterally flattened and not particularly curved with very sharp point tips. The upper articulation is symmetrical and has a cross-ridge that divides the surface into two asymmetrical parts. The size of the unguals IGM 100/16 and 100/17 may indicate that they belong to manual digits I and III, respectively. Classification Outdated quadrupedal, sauropodomorph-like restoration of Erlikosaurus The affinities and relationships of Therizinosaurus and kin were problematic in the early years of research. In 1954, Therizinosaurus was considered to have been a giant marine turtle and the genus was assigned by Maleev to a separate Therizinosauridae given how enigmatic the specimen was. The fossils remained with uncertainty among the scientific community, however, in 1970 Rozhdestvensky was one of the first paleontologists suggesting that Therizinosaurus was actually a theropod dinosaur instead of some turtle. Also, the supposed ribs of the holotype were likely from a different dinosaur, possibly some sauropodomorph. With the discovery and description of Segnosaurus, in 1979 Perle named a new family of dinosaurs, the Segnosauridae. He tentatively placed the family within Theropoda given the similarities of the mandible and dentition to other members. Translated paper A year later, the new genus Erlikosaurus was named by Barsbold and Perle in 1980. They named a new infraorder called the Segnosauria, composed by Erlikosaurus and Segnosaurus. They also noted that while aberrant and having ornithischian-like pelves, segnosaurs featured similar traits to other theropods. With the discovery of the referred hindlimb to Therizinosaurus in 1982 by Perle, he concluded that Segnosaurus was very similar to the latter based on the pes morphology and they possibly belonged to a single, if not the same group. In 1983, Barsbold named a new genus of segnosaur Enigmosaurus. He analysed the pelvis of this new genus and pointed out that segnosaurids were so different from other theropods that they could be outside the group or represent a different lineage of theropod dinosaurs. Later on the same year, he intensified the exclusion of segnosaurs from being theropods by noting that their pelves resembled those of sauropod dinosaurs. Translated paper Feather impressions from the holotype of Beipiaosaurus Consequently, the assignment of segnosaurs started to shift towards sauropodomorphs. In 1984, Paul claimed that segnosaurs rather than being aberrant theropods were indeed, sauropodomorphs which successfully managed to remain into the Cretaceous period. He based this idea on anatomical traits such as the skull and similar pes configuration. He maintained his position in 1988 by placing the Segnosauria into the now obsolete Phytodinosauria, and was one of the first in suggest a segnosaur assignment for the enigmatic Therizinosaurus. Other prominent paleontologists like Gauthier or Sereno supported this vision. In 1990, Barsbold and Teresa Maryanska agreed with Perle in that the hindlimb material from Hermiin Tsav he described in 1982 was segnosaurian, but casted doubt with his referral of it to Therizinosaurus and the segnosaurian identity for this taxon. Barsbold and Maryanska also disagreed with previous researchers who classified Deinocheirus as a segnosaur. In the same year, David B. Norman considered Therizinosaurus to be a theropod of uncertain classification. However, with the unexpected discovery and description of Alxasaurus in 1993, the widely accepted sauropodomorph affinities of segnosaurs were questioned by Rusell and Dong. This new genus was far more complete than any other segnosaur and multiple anatomical features indicated that is was related to Therizinosaurus. With this, they identified the Therizinosauridae along with the Segnosauridae to be same group, the former name having taxonomic priority. Due to some primitive characters present in Alxasaurus they coined a new taxonomic rank, the Therizinosauroidea, containing this new taxon and the Therizinosauridae. All of this new information provided data on the affinities of the new-named therizinosauroids. Lastly, Russell and Dong concluded that these animals were actual theropods with unusually aberrant features. In 1994, Clark and colleagues redescribed the very complete skull of Erlikosaurus and even more theropod traits were found this time. They also validated the synonymy of the Segnosauridae with Therizinosauridae and considered therizinosauroids as maniraptoran dinosaurs. In 1997, Rusell coined the infraorder Therizinosauria in order to contain all segnosaurs. This new infraorder was composed of Therizinosauroidea and the more advanced Therizinosauridae. With this, Segnosauria became a synonym of Therizinosauria. Though some uncertainties remained, a small and feathered therizinosauroid from China was described in 1999 by Xu and colleagues, the new genus Beipiaosaurus. It definitely confirmed the placement of therizinosaurs among theropods and also their taxonomic place on the Coelurosauria. This discovery also indicated that feathers were highly distributed among theropod dinosaurs. In 2010, Lindsay Zanno revised the taxonomy of therizinosaurs with extensive detail. She found that many parts on therizinosaur holotypes were lost or damaged, and sparse specimens with no overlapping elements were disadvantages when concluding the relationships of the members. Zanno accepted the referral of the specimen IGM 100/45 to Therizinosaurus since it matches multiple therizinosaurid traits but decided not include the specimen on its taxonomic analysis due to the lack of forelimb remains. She also excluded the supposed ribs that were present on the holotype since they likely came from a different animal and not Therizinosaurus. In 2019, Hartman and colleagues also performed a large phylogenetic analysis of Therizinosauria based on the characters provided by Zanno in her revision. They found similar results to Zanno regarding the family Therizinosauridae but this time with the inclusion of more taxa and specimens. Left cladogram from Zanno 2010, and right cladogram from Hartman et al. 2019: { width=\\"100%\\" - valign=\\"top\\"  align=\\"left\\" width=\\"50%\\"   align=\\"left\\" width=\\"50%\\"  align=\\"right\\" width=\\"60%\\"  } Paleobiology In 2012, Stephan Lautenschlager and colleagues analyzed the complete endocranial anatomy of Erlikosaurus and other therizinosaurs that preserve braincases. They found that therizinosaurids had well-developed senses of smell, hearing, and balance. The former two senses may have played an important role during foraging, predator evasion, and complex social behavior. These senses were also well-developed in earlier coelurosaurs and other theropods, indicating that therizinosaurs may have inherited many of these traits from their carnivorous ancestors and used them for their different and specialized dietary purposes. The discovery of fossilized embryos at the Nanchao Formation and multiple egg nests from other formations indicates that therizinosaurs had a colonial nesting-style similar to other herbivores like some sauropodomorphs, titanosaurs and hadrosaurs. Nestling therizinosaurs were capable of movements after birth and did not necessarily depend of their parents. It is also indicated that therizinosaurs did not have a philopatric behaviour when nesting. =Claws function= Lateral view of the claws in specimens IGM 100/15, 100/16 and 100/17. Therizinosaurus may have used its claws for grasping foliage When first described by Maleev in 1954, he considered that the unsually large claws were used to harvest seaweed. This however, based on the assumption of a giant marine turtle. In 1970, Rozhdestvensky re-examined the claws and suggested a possible function specialized in opening termite mounds. In 1995, Lev A. Nessov suggested the elongated claws were used for defense against predators and juveniles could have used their claws for arboreal locomotion. Translated paper In 2014, Lautenschlager tested the function of various therizinosaur hand claws—including Therizinosaurus—through digital simulations. Three different functional scenarios were simulated for each claw morphology with a force of 400 N applied in each scenario: scratch/digging; hook-and-pull; and piercing. Though the stocky claws of Alxasaurus resulted on low the stress magnitudes, the stress was greater with the curvature and elongation of the claws in Falcarius, Nothronychus and Therizinosaurus. Some of the highest stress, deformation and strain magnitudes were obtained in the scratch/digging scenario, the hook-and-pull scenario in contrast, resulted in lower magnitudes, and lesser ones were found in the piercing scenario. Particularly, the overall stress was most pronounced in the unusual claws of Therizinosaurus, which may represent an exceptional case of elongation specialization. Lautenschlager noted the more strongly curved and elongate claws of some therizinosaurian taxa were poorly functional in a scratch/digging fashion, indicating this as the most unlikely function. Though fossorial behaviour has been reported in several dinosaur species, the large body size largely rules out the possibility of burrow digging in therizinosaurs. Nevertheless, an overall digging action would have been done with the foot claws because, since as in other maniraptorans, feathers on the arms would have interfered with this function. Instead of being used for fossorial behaviour, it is more likely that Therizinosaurus make use of its hands in a hook-and-pull fashion to pull or grasp vegetation within reach. Lautenschlager could neither confirm nor disregard that the hand claws could have been used for defense, intraspecific competition, stabilization by grasping tree trunks during high browsing, sexual dimorphism, or gripping mates during mating given the lack of more specimens. He clarified that there is no evidence that the long claws of Therizinosaurus would have been used in active defense or attack, however, it is possible that these appendages could have had some role when facing a threat. Paleoenvironment The Nemegt Formation had similar environments to those of the swampy Okavango Delta The remains of Therizinosaurus were found in the well-known Nemegt Formation in the Gobi Desert, dating back to the Maastrichtian stage about 70 million and 68 million years ago. The environments that Therizinosaurus inhabited consisted of large meandering and braided rivers with highly wooden terrains that supported diverse herbivorous dinosaurs like Therizinosaurus. Large, enclosed, canopy-like forests composed by Araucarias have been determined by the δ13C level preserved on the tooth enamel of many herbivorous dinosaurs and the numerous petrified wood across the formation. In addition, the presence of oasis-like formations are also reported. These structures may have served as areas of interest for the smaller oviraptorosaurs. The dinosaur fauna of the Nemegt Formation was very diverse. Therizinosaurus shared its habitat with other theropods such as the deinonychosaurs Adasaurus and Zanabazar; ornithomimosaurs Anserimimus, Deinocheirus and Gallimimus; oviraptorosaurs Nemegtomaia, Elmisaurus, Gobiraptor, and the apex predator of the formation, Tarbosaurus. Other herbivorous dinosaurs include Barsboldia, Tarchia, Prenocephale, Nemegtosaurus, Opisthocoelicaudia and the most common herbivore, Saurolophus. Senter and James have noted that Therizinosaurus was among the tallest dinosaurs in the Nemegt Formation. Due to its prominent height and high-browsing life-style, it probably had no prominent competition with other herbivores over the foliage. However, they suggested a potential niche partitioning with the sauropods of the formation, which were also long-necked dinosaurs. If engaged in combat, a large Tarbosaurus may have been not able to bite any higher than the thighs or belly of an adult standing Therizinosaurus. The gigantic claws likely functioned as optimal defense against this situation. The paleontologist Thomas Holtz has compared the wet environments of the Nemegt Formation to those of the Okavango Delta. He suggested a resources competition between Deinocheirus, Saurolophus, Therizinosaurus and titanosaurs in these environments.

The church was originally built from 1830–1852 as a tribute to the Grand Duke of Finland, Tsar Nicholas I of Russia. It was also known as St Nicholas' Church until the independence of Finland in 1917.Kirkko Helsingissä - Cathedral It is a major landmark of the city. Description A distinctive landmark in the Helsinki cityscape, with its tall, green dome surrounded by four smaller domes, the building is in the neoclassical style. It was designed by Carl Ludvig Engel as the climax of his Senate Square layout: it is surrounded by other, smaller buildings designed by him. The church's plan is a Greek cross (a square centre and four equilateral arms), symmetrical in each of the four cardinal directions, with each arm's façade featuring a colonnade and pediment. Engel originally intended to place a further row of columns on the western end to mark the main entrance opposite the eastern altar, but this was never built. History After Helsinki was made into the capital of Finland in 1812, Alexander I decreed in 1814 that 15 percent of the salt import tax were to be collected into a fund for two churches, one Lutheran and one Orthodox. The cathedral was built on the site of the smaller 1724–1727 , which had been dedicated to its patroness, Ulrika Eleonora, Queen of Sweden. Helsinki Old Church was built between 1824 and 1826 in nearby Kamppi to serve the parish while the Ulrika Eleonora Church was being demolished and until the consecration of the new cathedral. The bells of the old church were reused in the cathedral. Construction of the cathedral began in 1830, although it was only officially inaugurated in 1852. Engel died in 1840. The building was later altered by Engel's successor , whose four small domes emphasise the architectural connection to the cathedral's models, Saint Isaac's Cathedral and Kazan Cathedral in St. Petersburg. Lohrmann also designed two extra buildings to the sides of the steps: looking from the square the left building is a bell tower and the right building a chapel. He also erected larger-than-life sized zinc statues of the Twelve Apostles at the apexes and corners of the roofline in 1849.Cast by the prominent firm of S. P. Devaranne, Berlin, and set up in 1852, according to Carol A. Grissom, Zinc sculpture in America, 1850–1950 2009:587. They were sculpted by August Wredov and Hermann Schievelbein and cast by S. P. Devaranne in Berlin in 1845–1847. The altarpiece was painted by Carl Timoleon von Neff and donated to the church by emperor Nicholas I. The cathedral crypt was renovated in the 1980s by architects Vilhelm Helander and Juha Leiviskä for use in exhibitions and church functions; Helander was also responsible for conservation repairs on the cathedral in the late 1990s. Today, the cathedral is one of Helsinki's most popular tourist attractions. In 2018 there were half a million visitors. The church is in regular use for services of worship and special events such as weddings. In popular culture The opening sequence of the music video for \\"Sandstorm\\" by Darude was filmed on Senate Square, prominently featuring the Cathedral in the background.

(21 May 1921 – 21 October 1990) also known as Ánandamúrti or Bábá (\\"Father\\") to his disciples, was a spiritual Guru, philosopher and composer of 5018 songs mostly in the Bengali language.Chatterjee, Gita. Bengal's Swadeshi Samgit. Published in Banerjee, Jayasri (ed.), The Music of Bengal. Baroda: Indian Musicological Society, 1987. He founded Ananda Marga (the Path of Bliss) in 1955 as a spiritual and social organisation that continues to offer instruction in meditation and yoga.Inayatullah, Sohail. (2002) Understanding Sarkar: The Indian Episteme, Macrohistory and Transformative Knowledge. Leiden: Brill, , authors book page. Sarkar developed his system of spiritual practice as a synthesis of Vedic and Tantric philosophies. He denounced materialism and capitalism and described the universe as a result of consciousness coming under the bondage of its own nature. Biography Sarkar was born during the full moon of the Indian month of Vaeshakh (Buddha Purnima), on 21 May 1921 (at 6:07 in the morning) to Lakshmi Narayan Sarkar, a homoeopathic doctor. His family hailed from Bamunpara (Brahmanpara), Burdwan District in West Bengal. In 1939 Sarkar left Jamalpur for Kolkata to attend Vidyasagar College of the University of Calcutta. Sarkar had to quit his studies to support his family after the death of his father, and from 1944 until the early 1950s, Sarkar worked as an accountant at the Indian railways headquarters in Jamalpur, Bihar. He taught the techniques of Tantra meditation to a select number of his colleagues and gradually more people were drawn to the spiritual practices he taught. In 1955, Sarkar founded Ananda Marga (the Path of Bliss), a socio- spiritual movement with a two-part mission that Sarkar stated as \\"self- realization and service to all\\" with a spiritual practice that synthesized Vedic and Tantric philosophies. Sarkar's ideas are collected in the series of books called \\"Subháśita Samgraha\\", which form part of the philosophical scriptures of Ananda Marga ideology. During the latter part of his life his main residence was in Lake Gardens in Kolkata, West Bengal. He also spent much time, especially early on, in the all-round development community he founded based on his PROUT theory at Anandanagar. Ananda Marga opened regional offices in various countries, including the US in 1969, and by 1973 had established approximately 100 local centres teaching yogic and social philosophies, with several thousand members, some living communally in the ashrams. In 1971, Sarkar was imprisoned in India for the alleged murder of Ananda Marga members. On 1 April, after recovering his health, Sarkar began fasting in support of a demand for an inquest into his poisoning. That demand was never met. So he continued his fast for the next five years, four months, and two days, until 2 August 1978 when he was released from jail after having been acquitted of all charges. In 1979, Sarkar took two world tours to meet disciples in various countries around the world, including Switzerland, Germany, France, Scandinavia, the Middle East, Philippines, Thailand, Taiwan, Jamaica and Venezuela. He was barred from entering the US by the State Department, so instead he met his American disciples in Jamaica in 1979. Just before he died on 21 October 1990, he founded Ananda Marga Gurukula on 7 September 1990, an educational network to preserve and develop his legacy through research, teaching and service. Spiritual philosophy Sarkar's teachings on spiritual philosophy are a synthesis of Vedic and Tantric philosophies. He considered himself to be \\"an incorrigible optimist\\" in his thinking. =Cosmology= Sarkar described the universe as a result of macropsychic conation – the entire universe exists within the cosmic mind, which itself is the first expression of consciousness coming under the bondage of its own nature. He described the cosmological flow as being from limitless consciousness to limited consciousness and back to limitless consciousness, attained by meditation. =Realms of the mind= According to Sarkar's philosophy the individual mind is composed of five layers called Kosas: #Kamamaya Kosa (\\"layer of desire\\") or \\"Crude Mind\\": is the layer that controls the body. It operates on instinct or passion. This layer is sometimes conscious and sometimes subconscious. #Manomaya Kosa (\\"layer of thinking\\") or \\"Subtle Mind\\": is the layer of thought and memory. This Kosa gives experience of pleasure and pain and is developed naturally through physical clash, and in Ananda Marga sadhana by pranayama with cosmic ideation. #Atimanasa Kosa or \\"Supramental Mind\\": is the intuitive layer. This Kosa gives the capacity of intuitive dreams, clairvoyance, telepathy and creative insight. It is developed naturally through psychic clash, and in Ananda Marga sadhana by methods of pratyahara (withdrawal) such as shuddhis and Guru Puja. #Vijinanamaya Kosa (\\"layer of the special knowledge\\") or \\"Subliminal Mind\\": is the layer of conscience or discrimination (viveka) and vaeragya (non-attachment). This Kosa is developed naturally through psychic clash, and its development is accelerated by the process of dharana. #Hiranyamaya Kosa (\\"golden level\\") or \\"Subtle Causal Mind\\": is the subtlest layer. Here the awareness of mind is very close to the direct experience of \\"Supreme Consciousness\\". Here there is only the separation of a thin veil of ignorance. This Kosa is developed naturally through the attraction for the Great, and dhyana accelerates this process for sadhakas (spiritual aspirants). =Biopsychology= Sarkar's \\"Biopsychology\\" reimagined the traditional tantric belief in chakras (\\"wheels\\") as being due to interactions of subtle energies through nerve plexuses. He believed this connected the endocrine glands of the neuroendocrine system with a psychic part of the body. The philosophy of Ananda Marga considers the human body as composed of the same five fundamental factors as the rest of the universe as explained in Brahmachakra. Every factor is said to be distributed throughout the body, but governed by a chakra, substations of the mind which control their own assigned areas. The biopsychology of Ananda Marga expands the concept of the seven basic chakras and in general, mainly considers: #The Muladhara Chakra: at the tip of the spine (controls the solid factor). #The Svadhisthana Chakra: at the level of the genitals (controls the liquid factor and is associated with the reproductive glands). #The Manipura Chakra: at the level of the navel (controls the luminous factor and is associated with Pancreas). #The Anahata Chakra: at the center of the chest (controls the aerial factor and is associated with Thymus). #The Vishuddha Chakra: at the throat (controls the ethereal factor and is associated with the Thyroid gland). #The Ajina Chakra: between the eyebrows (associated with the Pituitary gland). #The Sahasrara Chakra: at the crown of the head (associated with the Pineal gland). Mind's propensities (vrttis) associated with each Chakra affect the glands and the hormones secreted from those glands (hence the emotions, physical behaviour and functioning of the various body systems). But the glands and the hormones they secrete may also affect the mind in a chain of feedback. =Microvita= \\"Microvita\\" is plural for \\"Microvitum\\" and literally means \\"possessing or with micro-life\\". He believed that microvita are smaller and subtler than physical atoms and subatomic particles, and in the psychic realm contribute to \\"pure consciousness\\". Sarkar claimed that they would be recognised by conventional science. Sarkar gave the intuitional theory of Microvita in 1986. = Sadhana = A central point in Sarkar's philosophy is the concept of Sadhana. He described Sadhana as a practice for \\"the transformation of fearful love into fearless love\\". For Sarkar, Sandhana was concretized by the practice of meditation. He recommended to his disciples the daily practice of individual meditation and the weekly practice of collective meditation. These weekly meetings of his disciples, called Dharma Chakras, are preceded by the collective singing of a few Prabhat Samgiita (or \\"Songs of the New Dawn\\", composed by P. R. Sarkar himself) followed by Baba Nam Kevalam kiirtan, then the mantra called Samgacchadvam. The mantra Nityam Shuddham marks the end of the collective meditation, then the spiritual gathering will end with the Guru Puja mantra.  Social and political philosophy  = Law of Social Cycle = The concept of Varna describes four main socio-psychological types, whereby human psychological and physical endowment and social motivations are expressed: the Vipra (intellectual), Kshatriya (warrior), Vaishya (acquisitor) and Shudra (labourer). Varna, in Sarkar's perspective, however is more than just a psychological trait but rather an archetype, approximately to Michel Foucault's notion of epistemes, which are broader frameworks of knowledge defining what is true and real. Sarkar's \\"Law of Social Cycle\\" applies these traits in a theory of historical evolution, where ages rise and fall in terms of ruling elites representing one of the above-mentioned traits. This \\"law\\" possibly connects to the earlier cyclical historical ideas of Sri Aurobindo, with a focus on the psychology of human development, as well as Ibn Khaldun, among other macrohistorians ideas about cycles. However, along with a cyclical dimension — the rise and fall of ages — Sarkar's theory exhibits a correspondent linear dimension, in that economic and technological \\"progress\\" are considered critical in terms of meeting the changing material conditions of life. Ultimately, for Sarkar, true progress has to prioritise development in the spiritual dimension. Spirituality for Sarkar is defined as the individual realising the \\"true self\\". In addition to yogic meditational practices and purity of thought and deed, Sarkar attached great importance to selfless social service as a means of liberation. Sarkar considered it necessary for the social arrangements to support the inner development of human beings and rejected both capitalism and communism as appropriate social structures for humanity to move forward to the golden age of a balanced way of life sustaining all-round progress. A serious problem with capitalism was according to Sarkar the concentration of wealth in a few hands and stoppages in the rolling of money which he considered root causes of recessions, even depressions. A spiritual way of life, however, would in no way be divorced from creating structures that help meet the basic, though ever changing, needs — food, housing, clothing, health and education. Sarkar claimed to have developed both Ánanda Márga and the Progressive Utilization Theory as practical means to encourage harmony and co-operation to help society escape this proposed cycle. Sarkar argues that once the social cycle is understood and sadvipras evolved, then the periods of exploitation can be largely reduced, if not eliminated. With leadership that is representative of all aspects of the varnas — that is, the leader engaged in service, who is courageous, who uses the intellect for the benefits of others, and who has innovative/entrepreneurial skills — the cycle can become an upward spiral. Sarkar's concept of karma samnyasa refers to the principle that a yogi becomes a person with all-round development and a balanced mind, that he called a sadvipra; and that this is accomplished by someone who remains fixed on the \\"supreme\\" consciousness through transformative personal practices and engaging in the politics of social liberation as a form of service work. = PROUT: progressive utilisation theory = By 1959, Sarkar had developed the socio- economic Progressive Utilization Theory (Prout). In 1961, the theory was formally outlined in his book Ananda Sutram, published under his spiritual name Shrii Shrii Ánandamúrti. In 1968, Sarkar founded the organisation \\"Proutist Block of India\\" (PBI), to further the ideals of his theory through political and social action. The PBI was soon superseded by \\"Proutist Universal\\" (PU), which primarily consists of five federations (students, intellectuals, farmers, labour, and youth). A Prout economy is cooperative and decentralised. Its focus is collective welfare rather than to profit, without neglecting individuals and their merits. \\"Progressive utilization\\" refers to the optimising the use of natural, industrial and human resources on a sustainable basis for the entire ecosystem. The theory claims to overcome the limitations of both capitalism and communism. It is inline with Sarkar's social theory of the Law of Social Cycle. The theory aims to encompass the whole of individual and collective existence for all beings, including physical, educational, social, political, mental, cultural and spiritual. = Neohumanism: liberation of intellect = Ananda Marga in Bucharest, Romania In 1982, Sarkar extended his writings on the subject of human society with the introduction of his new theory of \\"Neohumanism\\". If humanism tends to contemplate only humans in a human-centric view, Neohumanism, according to Sarkar's theory, is instead the elevation of humanism to universalism. Sarkar said \\"When the underlying spirit of humanism is extended to everything, animate and inanimate, in this universe – I have designated this as \\"Neohumanism\\". This Neohumanism will elevate humanism to universalism, the cult of love for all created beings of this universe.\\" Neohumanism is said to prefer to existential value over utility value for all living beings. Sarkar's Neohumanism places great emphasis on rationality and encourages what he calls a protospiritual mentality, a process of continually recognising each object with which we come in contact, externally or internally, as a manifestation of the Supreme Consciousness (Brahma). According to Sarkar, rationality helps to give rise to devotion, which he consider to be the \\"highest and most valuable treasure of humanity\\". In Sarkar's view, Neohumanism leads to the liberation of human intellect from the constraints of imposed dogma and psychic complexes helping to bridge the gap between the inner and outer worlds. =Culture= In his series of discourses Talks on Prout, given in Ranchi in July 1961, Sarkar makes a distinction between the terms \\"culture\\" and \\"customs\\". According to Sarkar \\"culture... is the collective name for different expressions of life...\\" but \\"...all of society has the same culture. There are local variations in the mode or state of cultural expression, but the expression is universal... These local variations are called customs... Thus local modes of expression bearing local or group specialities are customs, but the expression itself is culture. Therefore it is a mistake to readjust boundaries on the basis of language and culture. Indian culture and the culture of the world are one and the same.\\" The philosophy of Sarkar reinterprets the general concept of culture by inserting it into a new universalistic outlook. As described by Antonello Maggipinto: Works Although Sarkar spent only seventeen years of his life working full-time for his organisations (1966–1971 & 1978–1990), he left behind a vast legacy, including over 250 books written on a wide variety of topics. Many of this books are compilations or collections of speeches given by him during spiritual or social meetings. He is primarily known as the spiritual teacher behind Ananda Marga, but Sarkar wrote over 1500 pages on his socio-politico-economic Progressive Utilization Theory (PROUT), with several thousand more pages dedicated to linguistics and the study of languages; Sarkar's writings on linguistics included, among other works, Shabda Cayanika (\\"A Collection of Words\\"), an unfinished, twenty-six volume dictated encyclopaedia on the Bengali language. Beyond this, he wrote books on sociology, agriculture, history, literature, education, medicine, cosmology, and philosophy, also notably founding the philosophy of Neohumanism in 1982 and the Theory of Microvita in 1986. In his Theory of Microvita, Sarkar \\"believed that the atoms and the subatomic particles throughout the boundless universe are imbued with life.\\" = Music = In 1982 Sarkar started composing songs.

Dress codes are created out of social perceptions and norms, and vary based on purpose, circumstances, and occasions. Different societies and cultures are likely to have different dress codes, Western dress codes being a prominent example. Dress codes are symbolic indications of different social ideas, including social class, cultural identity, attitude towards comfort, tradition, and political or religious affiliations. History =Europe= In seventh through the ninth centuries, the European royalty and nobility used a dress code to differentiate themselves from other classes of people. All classes generally wore the same clothing, although distinctions among the social hierarchy began to become more noticeable through ornamented garments. Common pieces of clothing worn by peasants and the working class included plain tunics, cloaks, jackets, pants, and shoes. According to rank, embellishments adorned the collar of the tunic, waist or border. Examples of these decorations included, as James Planché states, \\"gold and silver chains and crosses, bracelets of gold, silver or ivory, golden and jeweled belts, strings of amber and other beads, rings, brooches, [and] buckles\\". The nobility tended to wear longer tunics than the lower social classes. While dress codes of modern-day Europeans are less strict, there are some exceptions. It is possible to ban certain types of clothing in the workplace, as exemplified by the European Court of Justice's verdict that \\"a ban on Islamic headscarves at work can be lawful.\\" =The Americas= The indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast had a complex social hierarchy which consisted of slaves, commoners and nobles, with dress codes indicating these social distinctions. John R. Jewitt, an Englishman who wrote a memoir about his years as a captive of the Nuu-chah- nulth people in 1802-1805, describes how, after some time living there, Maquinna and the chiefs decided that he must now be \\"considered one of them, and conform to their customs\\". Jewitt resented the imposition of this dress code, finding the loose untailored garments very cold, and attributed to them a subsequent illness of which he almost died. He was not allowed to cut his hair, and had to paint his face and body as a Nootka would.A Narrative of the Adventures and Sufferings of John R. Jewitt, only survivor of the crew of the ship Boston, during a captivity of nearly three years among the savages of Nootka Sound: with an account of the manners, mode of living, and religious opinions of the natives.digital full text here p161 onwards = Muslim World = Islam, founded in the 7th century CE, laid out rules regarding attire of both men and women in public. Gold adornments and silk clothes are prohibited for men to wear, as they are luxurious, but they are permissible for women. Men are also required to wear the ihram clothing while on Hajj, or annual pilgrimage to Mecca. It is recommended in Islam for women to wear a hijab at all times when in public, as part of the Islamic standard of modesty. = Indian Subcontinent = Sikhism, which was founded in the Indian subcontinent around the end of the 15th century also requires a dress code. Male Sikhs, who are members of the Khalsa are required to wear a turban at all times. Laws and social norms Model of a nude beach in the DDR Museum, Berlin Each country has its own set of cultural values and norms. Wherever you go these norms and laws regarding clothing are subject to change depending on the region and culture. For example nudity is something that changes in acceptability depending on where you are. In New Guinea and Vanuatu, there are areas where it is customary for the men to wear nothing but penis sheaths in public. Women wear string skirts. In remote areas of Bali, women may go topless. This is uncommon in more western countries. Although in America and some parts of Europe, there are nude beaches. In the United States, The Gender Nondiscrimination Act prohibits employers, health care providers, and housing authorities from discriminating against people on the basis of gender. Private dress codes A visual on what Black Tie dress code looks like. Many place have their own private dress code; these organisations may insist on particular dress codes or standards in particular situations. Such as for weddings, funerals, religious gatherings, etc. = Workplace = Canadian Deputy PM Chrystia Freeland with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in Western dress code at a meeting. Employees are sometimes required to wear a uniform or certain standards of dress, such as a business suit or tie. This may depend on particular situations, for example if they are expected to interact with customers. (see also International standard business attire) In western countries, these policies vary depending on the industry with lawyers, bankers, and executives often wearing suit and tie. Some businesses observe that anti-discrimination laws restricts their determining what is appropriate and inappropriate workplace clothing. Requiring men and women to dress differently at the workplace can be challenged because the gender-specific dress codes would be based on one sex and could be considered stereotypical. Most businesses have authority in determining and establishing what workplace clothes they can require of their workers. Generally, a carefully drafted dress code applied consistently does not violate anti-discrimination laws. So long as the dress code does not favor one gender over the other it is usually acceptable by law for employers to have a private dress code. = Formal wear = In western countries, a \\"formal\\" or white tie dress code typically means tailcoats for men and full-length evening dresses for women. \\"Semi-formal\\" has a much less precise definition but typically means an evening jacket and tie for men (known as black tie) and a dress for women. \\"Business casual\\" typically means not wearing neckties or suits, but wearing instead collared shirts, and trousers (not black, but more relaxed, including things such as corduroy). \\"Casual\\" typically just means clothing for the torso, legs and shoes. \\"Wedding Casual\\" defines yet another mode of dress, where guests dress respectfully, but not necessarily fancily. = Business casual = Business casual dress is a popular workplace dress code that emerged in white-collar workplaces in Western countries in the 1990s, especially in the United States and Canada. Many information technology businesses in Silicon Valley were early adopters of this dress code. In contrast to formal business wear such as suits and neckties (the international standard business attire), the business casual dress code has no generally accepted definition; its interpretation differs widely among organizations and is often a cause of sartorial confusion among workers. The job search engine Monster.com offers this definition, \\"In general, business casual means dressing professionally, looking relaxed, yet neat and pulled together.\\" A more pragmatic definition is that business casual dress is the mid ground between formal business clothes and street clothes. Generally, neckties are excluded from business casual dress, unless worn in nontraditional ways. The acceptability of blue jeans and denim cloth clothing varies — some businesses consider them to be sloppy and informal. Education system  Many schools around the world implement dress codes in the school system to prevent students from wearing inappropriate clothing items to school and was thought to help influence a safer and more professional environment. = United States education = In 1996, former U. S. President Bill Clinton announced his support for the idea of school uniforms by stating, “School uniforms are one step that may help break the cycle of violence, truancy and disorder by helping young students understand what really counts is what kind of people they are.” Many school districts in the United States took up the idea. Even though dress code was created to positively affect schools, a common held belief in the U.S. is that the rules actually impede on students' right to self-expression. There have been many court cases regarding school dress code, the first being the Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District. The case was held because students wore black armbands to protest the Vietnam war. Dress code violations Non-communicative dress code violations in public schools are violations that are without implications of hate, gang-affiliation, etc.Herbon, Beth, and Jane E. Workman. \\"Dress and Appearance Codes in Public Secondary School Handbooks.\\" Journal of Family & Consumer Sciences 92.5 (2000): 68-76. Communicative dress code violations are violations of an explicit nature, where the clothing has implications of hate, violence, gang-affiliation, etc. In cases where dress code rules in public school systems have been violated by non-communicative clothing, courts repeatedly legitimise dress code discrimination based on gender.Smith, Natalie. \\"Eliminating Gender Stereotypes in Public School Dress Codes: The Necessity of Respecting Personal Preference.\\" Journal of Law & Education; 41.1 (2012): 251-60. Amongst the transgender populations, gender based dress codes are primarily enforced against individuals who do not yet pass.  Dress code backlash  Certain dress code restrictions in schools across North America are believed to be perpetuating sexist standards, In March of 2014, a group of middle-school girls from Evanston, Illinois protested their school's dress code, which prohibited them from wearing leggings to school under the pretense that it was \\"too distracting for boys.\\" Thirteen-year-old student, Sophie Hasty, was quoted in the Evanston Review saying that \\"not being able to wear leggings because it's 'too distracting for boys' is giving us the impression we should be guilty for what guys do.\\" In a Time magazine article covering the incident, Eliana Dockterman argued that teachers and administration in these schools are \\"walking the fine line between enforcing a dress code and slut shaming.\\" On Monday, September 22, 2014, \\"about 100 pupils walked out of Bingham high school in South Jordan, Utah.\\" Students staged a walkout because more than a dozen girls were turned away from a homecoming dance for wearing dresses which violated the dress code rules. \\"School staff allegedly lined up girls against a wall as they arrived and banished about two dozen for having dresses which purportedly showed too much skin and violated the rules.\\" It is believed that this act was awkward and humiliating towards the female students, which spawned the walkouts. = Canadian education =  Dress code backlash  A Canadian teenager, Lauren Wiggins, was given detention in May 2015 for wearing a floor-length dress with a halter neckline. The punishment prompted Wiggins to write an open letter to the school's assistant vice principal at Harrison Trimble High School in Moncton, New Brunswick. In the letter, Wiggins concentrated specifically on the fact that females are often blamed for the behaviour of males, saying that if a boy \\"will get distracted by my upper back and shoulders then he needs to be sent home and practice self-control.\\" She was then given a one-day suspension after writing and submitting the letter.

As a result, many traditional Swiss dishes tend to be relatively plain and are made from basic ingredients, such as potatoes and Swiss cheese. The great cultural diversity within Switzerland is also reflected in the great number of regional or local specialties. Well-known Swiss dishes include raclette and fondue (molten cheese eaten with bread or potatoes), rösti (fried grated potatoes), muesli (an oatmeal breakfast dish) and Zürcher Geschnetzeltes (veal and mushrooms on a cream sauce). Food and dishes A cart displaying food produced in Switzerland. Swiss chocolate often have entire aisles in Swiss supermarkets just for them, as this one in Interlaken There are many regional dishes in Switzerland. One example is Zürcher Geschnetzeltes, thin strips of veal with mushrooms in a cream sauce served with Rösti. Italian cuisine is popular in contemporary Switzerland, particularly pasta and pizza. Foods often associated with Switzerland include particular types of cheese and milk chocolate. Swiss cheeses, in particular Emmental cheese, Gruyère, Vacherin, and Appenzeller, are famous Swiss products. The most popular cheese dishes are fondue and raclette. Both these dishes were originally regional dishes, but were popularized by the Swiss Cheese Union to boost sales of cheese. Rösti is a popular potato dish that is eaten all over Switzerland. It was originally a breakfast food, but this has been replaced by the muesli, which is commonly eaten for breakfast and in Switzerland goes by the name of \\"Birchermüesli\\" (\\"Birchermiesli\\" in some regions). For breakfast and dinner many Swiss enjoy sliced bread with butter and jam. There is a wide variety of bread rolls available in Switzerland. Bread and cheese is a popular dish for dinner. Tarts and quiches are also traditional Swiss dishes. Tarts in particular are made with all sorts of toppings, from sweet apple to onion. In the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland, the Ticino area, one will find a type of restaurant unique to the region. The Grotto is a rustic eatery, offering traditional food ranging from pasta to homemade meat specialties. Popular dishes are Luganighe and Luganighetta, a type of artisan sausages. Authentic grottoes are old wine caves re-functioned into restaurants. Due to their nature they are mostly found in or around forests and built against a rocky background. Typically, the facade is built from granite blocks and the outside tables and benches are made of the same stone as well. Grottoes are popular with locals and tourists alike, especially during the hot summer months.

Riesling X Sylvaner is a common white wine produced in German-speaking parts of the country, while Chasselas is the most common white wine in the French-speaking parts of the country. Pinot noir is the most popular red grape in both the French-speaking and the German-speaking part, while this position is held by Merlot in the Italian-speaking part. Absinthe is being distilled officially again in its Val-de-Travers birthplace, in the Jura region of Switzerland, where it originated. Long banned by a specific anti-Absinthe article in the Swiss Federal Constitution, it was legalized again in 2005, with the adoption of the new constitution. Now Swiss absinthe is also exported to many countries, with Kübler and La Clandestine Absinthe amongst the first new brands to emerge. Wine and beer can legally be purchased by youths of 16 or more years of age. Spirits and beverages containing distilled alcohol (including wine coolers like Bacardi Breezer) can be bought at 18.

Bon Pere William is a famous regional Swiss brandy produced from pears, alcohol 43% by volume. It is usually paired with fondue or raclette dishes or taken after dinner, sometimes poured in coffee with dessert. Some bottles are available with the full size pear inside the bottle, grown with the bud placed in the bottle. There are many other types of regional brandies made from local fruit, the most popular being cherries (kirschwasser). Switzerland has the seventh highest per capita coffee consumption worldwide.

Biography Boissonade was born in Vincennes in 1825 to the famous scholar Jean François Boissonade de Fontarabie. He was a brilliant law student, and received his doctorate of law with honours from the University of Paris in 1853. He was in charge of law courses at Paris University until 1864, and was assistant law professor at the University of Grenoble until 1867. In 1873 he was invited to lecture on constitutional and criminal law to some Japanese visitors to Paris, and received an invitation to work in Japan by the Japanese Ministry of Justice as one of several foreign legal scholars needed to assist with the drafting of Japan's legal codes and in the renegotiation of the unequal treaties. Boissonade remained in Japan for more than 21 years, from 1873 to 1895, and worked as an instructor in the Law School of the Ministry of Justice. He worked closely with Ume Kenjirō and Hozumi Nobushige in drafting much of Japan's criminal and civil law. He was also an expert in international law, and was legal advisor to the government in the Taiwan Expedition of 1874. He was named a consultant to the Genrōin in 1875. He also opposed Inoue Kaoru's 1887 proposal to allow non-Japanese judges, and cautioned against too rapid movement towards revision of the unequal treaties. He was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun (2nd degree) in 1876 and was thus one of the few foreigners so honored at that time. Today, he is honored as one of the founders of Hosei University. The \\"Boissonade Tower\\", the Ichigaya campus of Hosei University halfway between Ichigaya and Iidabashi stations in central Tokyo, a 26-story building completed in 2000, was named after him. He returned to France in 1895 and lived in Antibes, where his tomb is located.

Description  Artist's impression Khaan did not differ much from other oviraptorids. At first, its remains were assigned to \\"Ingenia\\", but the Khaan manual structure, lacking the expansion of the upper third metacarpal, was considered to differ sufficiently from that of \\"Ingenia\\" for it to be assigned to its own genus. The oviraptorid diet is disputed, with plants and molluscs having been suggested. Like other oviraptorids, Khaan was probably at least partially a meat eater, feeding on small vertebrates like mammals, lizards and possibly other small dinosaurs. It was also probably feathered.  Discovery  The type species Khaan mckennai was in 2001 named by James M. Clark e.a. The genus name is derived from Mongol khaan, \\"lord\\" or \\"ruler\\". The specific name honours the paleontologist Malcolm Carnegie McKenna. The holotype IGM 100/1127, consists of an almost complete skeleton found together with another specimen, IGM 100/1002. Together they were informally referred to as \\"Romeo and Juliet\\". These individuals are about four feet long. A third, considerably larger, specimen, IGM 100/973, was referred to the species.  Paleobiology  Skull of referred specimen IGM 100/973 According to a 2014 study published in Nature, Khaan was possibly sexually dimorphic. Two specimens, the holotype MPC-D 100/1127 and referred specimen MPC-D 100/1002, were analyzed, the dimorphic feature being in the anterior chevrons. Both specimens were of the same size and build, and thus were likely the same age, ruling out ontogeny. In MPC-D 100/1127, the anterior chevrons showed great similarity to those of other theropods, with no great expansion on the distal end. However, in the other individual, the chevrons had a \\"heel\\"-like expansion above the distal end, which increased in size along the sequence. The study ruled out a possibly pathologic explanation, finding sexual dimorphism to have more support. It was thought that the reduced spines were a female characteristic, because they would increase space for laying eggs.

To this end, the Swiss Cheese Union mandated production be limited to only a few varieties, chiefly Gruyere and Emmental, and bought the entire production and distribution of cheese at prices set by the Swiss Federal Council. It also coordinated the national and international marketing for these three varieties of cheese. The Swiss Cheese Union was successful in campaigning for cheese fondue and raclette becoming national dishes in Switzerland. Before that, they were both regional dishes.  History  = 1914-1920s = Throughout the course of World War I, Switzerland remained neutral and maintained the health of its massive cheese production industry. Exports of the product suffered in part due to the devastation wrought upon customers in the surrounding countries; these numbers would remain low until after World War II. The war exacerbated this further as a lack of hay and fodder to use as feed for dairy animals showed sharp decreases in production. In an effort to combat this slump in exports, cheese producers determined to develop strict non-compete guidelines, establishing a cartel that became known as the Swiss Cheese Union. According to journalist Robert Smith, \\"The union set the price for milk. It told dairymen how much milk to produce and who they could sell it to. They told the cheesemakers how much cheese to make, and then set the prices for the cheese. And it was all so complicated, this cheese business, that they actually narrowed down the number of cheeses that people could produce. Switzerland used to make over 1,000 different kinds of cheeses; the Cheese Union supported seven.\\" = Inter-War Period = The Swiss Cheese Union's success in controlling production soon presented a problem: overproduction of cheese in a saturated, stagnant market. Initially, the Swiss Cheese Union was able to float the dairy market by buying cheese from the milk association at fixed prices and then and reselling the cheese to itself, but the logic of this was so dizzying that it could not be the final answer. thumb A more long-term solution presented itself in the form of fondue. According to former director of the Musee Gruerien Isabelle Raboud- Schuele, \\"Up until 1930, fondue was essentially only known in the French- speaking part of Switzerland but thereafter it became popular throughout Switzerland, to the point of becoming a national dish. This was due to the success of intensive campaigns to promote cheese, led by the Swiss Union for Marketing Cheese in the 1930s. Cheese production exceeded consumption and hence in order to expand the market for this former export, the Swiss needed to be convinced to eat more cheese.\\" Though marketed by the Swiss Cheese Union as an Alpine specialty, the dish did not originate in the mountains. Alpine cheese-making was limited to the summer months, and fondue was thus in the 18th century eaten only by upper class households in small towns in the Jura region and lowland Switzerland; cheese making spread throughout the country in the following century and became easier to make year-round thanks to advances in equipment. Alpine-cheese making could not keep up with the strong competition, and the economy of mountain-produced cheese weakened. According to the author of Swiss cheese: origins, traditional cheese varieties and new creations Dominik Flammer, typical families might have the dish only a few times a year. These facts did not stop the Swiss Cheese Union from fabricating an almost infectious enthusiasm for fondue in its marketing materials, drawing on a recipe requiring vast amounts of Swiss cheese and steeped in a narrative of tradition. The Swiss Cheese Union used iconography known around the world to promote the dish, invoking Heidi (the stories of whom had been translated into many languages at this point) to underline the wholesomeness and authenticity of the Swiss dish. Posters showcasing rain or snow as “fondue weather” reinforced the notion that fondue delivers a feeling of warmth in guests, and the recipes and tips were given on how to prepare fondue for anywhere from four to one hundred people, encouraging conspicuous consumption of the grossly overproduced product. = Rebellion = A rebel cheesemaker, Sepp Barmettler, strove against this near-universal acceptance of cheese restrictions and aimed to add the Parmesan-like Sbrinz cheese to the list of allowed cheeses. After eight years of applications and appeals to the Swiss Cheese Union, his request was denied. In a letter to Barmettler, no specific reason was given for the denial, but it was noted to Barmettler that \\"you do not fit into the envisaged structures.\\" Nevertheless, Barmettler continued to produce small, soft cheeses stanser fladen, selling them directly to small vendors like hotels and small restaurants rather than larger distributors that would have caught the attention of the cartel. After the collapse of the cartel, an explosion of new cheeses from Switzerland came onto the market, from recreactions of old recipes to continuations of classics like Sepp helped keep alive. = Decline of the Union = Union-sponsored skiers As the country's reputation shifted from that of a dairy farming nation raising cows to one peopled by scientists and engineers, concern grew over the vast sums of taxpayer money pumped into the dairy industry. In the 1960s and 1970s, the dairy industry purportedly cost the Swiss government more than the whole cost of the army of Switzerland. The Swiss Cheese Union sponsored the 1992-1993 Swiss National Ski Team. The team wore yellow ski suits with simulated cheese holes. After corruption charges were leveled against a number of the Swiss Cheese Union officials, the union was disbanded by the late 1990s. Dairy subsidies continued, but competition between cheese makers was reintroduced, causing prices to plummet.

A herbal brine, sometimes incorporating wine or cider, is applied to the wheels of cheese while they cure, which flavors and preserves the cheese while promoting the formation of a rind. Cheese from the region of Appenzell has a documented history of at least 700 years, being first mentioned in a document from 1282. However, the manufacturing process is not mentioned and must have been rather different from today. Today, about 75 dairies produce Appenzeller, each with a different recipe for their brine wash. Most of the recipes are trade secrets. The cheese is straw-colored, with tiny holes and a golden rind. It has a strong smell and a nutty or fruity flavor, which can range from mild to tangy, depending on how long it is aged. Three types are sold: *\\"Classic\\". Aged three to four months, mildly spicy. The wheels are wrapped in a silver label. *\\"Surchoix\\". Aged four to six months, strongly spicy. Gold label. *\\"Extra\\".

He was introduced in the original Samurai Shodown in 1993 and has since appeared in every title in the series. The character was based on the famed swordsman, Miyamoto Musashi, a duelist who claimed to have never lost a match. Though he is a swordsman with no loyalties to any lord, Haohmaru has a \\"samurai spirit\\" which is often stressed in the series. He is also often accredited to defeating most of the series' villains. Appearances =Samurai Shodown= Haohmaru appears in all Samurai Shodown games and their other-media adaptations. According to his backstory, at the age of fifteen he challenged the series' version of Jubei Yagyu to a duel but lost due to lack of experience. Jubei, amused by the youth's bravado, brought Haohmaru to Nicotine Caffeine so that he may gain proper training. Whilst living there, Haohmaru also met and befriended Kibagami Genjuro, fellow student and another orphan like himself. One day, Nicotine told them they would battle to determine who would learn the secrets in a magical scroll to increase their fighting ability. Genjuro won but almost killed Haohmaru; in response, Nicotine banished Genjuro which began the latter's grudge against Haohmaru and Nicotine. Encouraged by this defeat to further improve himself, Haohmaru travelled the lands, perfecting his sword skills and searching for worthy challengers in the name of Ashura. During his many travels, Haohmaru also raised Shizumaru Hisame and trained him to be a fighter. Haohmaru fell in love with a girl named Oshizu, but he eventually leaves her for his travels in Samurai Shodown VI even as she begs him to stay with her. In the same game, it is shown that Haohmaru shares a close relationship with Charlotte Christine de Colde, even travelling all the way to France in order to visit her. In Samurai Shodown: Warriors Rage, Haohmaru is a skilled and active swordsman at the age of forty-seven. At this time, he is trying to find his adopted niece, Mikoto and bring her back home. Samurai Shodown V character Rasetsumaru is a monstrous doppelganger of Haohmaru. =Other appearances= Haohmaru also made appearances in several other video games by SNK and other developers, including fighting games Capcom vs. SNK 2, SNK vs. Capcom: The Match of the Millennium, Neo Geo Battle Coliseum, mobile game Neo Geo Tennis Coliseum, dating sim Days of Memories: Oedo Love Scroll, The King of Fighters All Star, multiplayer online battle arena Honor of Kings, and battle arena game Lost Saga. Neo Geo Battle Coliseum developers stated that no matter what the fans wanted, they wanted to include Samurai Shodown characters and made Haohmaru's inclusion one of their top priorities in development. He also makes regular appearances in the series' merchandise, including at least two action figures. He is also a part of Soulcalibur VI season pass 2. This news was announced during EVO 2019 on August 4 in the season 2 trailer after the Cassandra Alexandra release date trailer shows that she is a part of season pass 1. It has been made apparent that Haohmaru is always been the SNK counterpart to the Soulcalibur series veteran Heishiro Mitsurugi prior to his gameplay trailer at EVO Japan 2020. He was released at the end of March 2020. His pack is also comes with Nakoruru and Kuroko Costume sets. Soulcalibur series marks the first time he use his sake-jug as a sub- weapon. If the fighters fights at Haohmaru’s DLC home stage, Gairyu Isle, Samurai Shodown main announcer Kuroko will be that stage’s announcer, rather than a regular announcer. Haohmaru appears as a spirit in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Design and gameplay Haohmaru's creation was inspired by the famous historical samurai Miyamoto Musashi. He was actually called 'Musashi' during the development of the first Samurai Shodown game. The series' creator Yasushi Adachi chose \\"the two flagship characters\\" Haohmaru and Nakoruru as the ones that best sum up the series: \\"With his use of powerful and damaging attacks as well as the Ikari gauge that increases attack power, Haohmaru does a great job representing the myriad of concepts game systems in these games.\\" His trademark moves are \\"Kogetsuzan,\\" a crescent-shaped uppercut, and \\"Senpuretsuzan,\\" a whirlwind projectile which lifts opponents into the air (like a hurricane) before dropping them on their heads. He also has a sake jug, which he uses to 'bless' his blade with liquor before he fights. In Samurai Shodown II, he may swing his jug in battle for a multi-hit short-range attack or alternatively use it to reflect projectiles. He also gained a somersault attack, which could cause massive damage upon crouching foes. When his style splits in Samurai Shodown III, his \\"Slash\\" form retains several strategies used in previous games, being a balanced and easy-to-master mid- range combatant. By contrast, his \\"Bust\\" form alters several moves, granting him access to aggressive close-combat fighting. His appearance in Warriors Rage for the PlayStation also combined some elements from Genjuro's fighting style such as his stance and crouching strikes. Reception Haohmaru was well received, often regarded as a classic character or an \\"old favorite.\\" In the Japanese Gamest magazine's 1997 Heroes Collection, Haohmaru was tied with Ukyo for their 29th spot (out of 50) in the staff's list of favorite arcade gaming characters. Greg Kasavin from GameSpot listed his \\"Crescent Moon Slash\\" move as one of the best special attacks in fighting games' history. Complex cited Haohmaru while including Samurai Shodown V on their list of top games with Fatality-like special moves, and included him among the fighters with most humiliating quotes. GamesRadar included him in a potential roster of their dream fighting game \\"Vertigo Vs. SNK\\" and Sony Online Entertainment art director Timothy Heydelaar took Haohmaru as his nickname.

Started in 1953, True West is headquartered in Cave Creek, Arizona, and publishes monthly. It is the world's oldest, continuously- published Western American magazine. True West observed its 65th anniversary in 2018, having offered past coverage in Blasts from the Past, beginning in its January 2013 issue. History True West began publication in 1953 under founder Joe Small of Austin, Texas. The idea for True West originated from a monthly feature in Small's first publication, Sporting Magazine. The magazine's recurring \\"Bad Man\\" article, about outlaws of the West, was the feature that generated the most reader mail and interest. True West was born to satisfy the readers' hunger for Old West history. True West was the largest Western magazine on the market in the 1960s, selling hundreds of thousands of copies monthly at newsstands. The magazine benefited from an era featuring popular television western series such as Bonanza, The Lone Ranger, and Gunsmoke. At least one episode, \\"The Hunted\\" (1958), of the ABC/Warner Brothers series Sugarfoot is based on a True West article. Fans interested in the lives of real cowboys and cowgirls found those stories in True West. After that, the early era of television westerns faded during the time of the Vietnam War and disco music. In 1979, Small sold the magazine to Chet Krause of Iola, Wisconsin. Small stayed on as publisher, with Krause as assistant publisher. The magazine saw a few moves — to Perkins, Oklahoma, then Stillwater — before the 1999 move to Cave Creek, Arizona. Among its new owners was Bob Boze Bell, who first discovered the magazine as a nine-year-old at Desert Drugs in Kingman, Arizona. The publication sparked a lifelong interest in the Old West. As the January 2000 issue was being edited, Bell flew to Stillwater to design the cover because he, \\"wanted to own the millennium.\\" Bell felt the magazine needed to change with the times or it would not survive. One of the first changes he made was switching the magazine from pulp paper to gloss, as True West was one of the last remaining publications using pulp. He also expanded the coverage of Western movies, since so many people developed a love of Old West history after being exposed to Westerns on television or the big screen. He added, and still writes, the successful \\"Classic Gunfights\\" department that has featured more than one hundred gunfights of the Old West. In 2007, Ken Amorosano joined the team as associate publisher. In 2011, he became True West's publisher and set the magazine in a new direction, catering the publication more toward its core history aficionados and expanding the magazine's readership globally. To put forth their vision, Bell and Amorosano rely on a quality editorial and production team headed by editor-in-chief Bob Boze Bell, art director Daniel Harshberger, production manager Robert Ray, and general manager Carol Compton Glenn. The magazine has continued to change with the times. Readers mingle on True West's regularly updated social network feeds: Facebook, Pinterest, YouTube and Twitter. Departments True West puts the focus on history with features like \\"Classic Gunfights\\" and \\"Ask the Marshall\\", featuring Arizona's official state historian Marshall Trimble, who responds to reader inquiries such as, \\"How prevalent was the stampede string on Old West hats?\\" Firearms expert Phil Spangenberger features a classic Western firearm each month in \\"Shooting from the Hip\\". The magazine also shines the spotlight on today's true Westerners with the departments \\"What History Has Taught Me\\" and \\"'Old West Saviors\\". Investigating History delves into questions of the past to bring readers answers to long-held mysteries. True West guides readers who still want to experience and live an Old West lifestyle by publishing features such as its hearty food column, \\"Frontier Fare\\", and \\"Evolution of Western Wear\\", sharing the history behind the clothing and gear worn by Westerners today. \\"True Western Towns\\" guides readers to cities where the West is still alive. \\"Renegade Roads\\" creates history-inspired travel routes for readers to embark to the West. Television Executive editor Bob Boze Bell is regularly featured on True West Moments, which airs on Encore's Westerns channel. He responds to inquiries from around the world. In 2012, in honor of Arizona's centennial, True West created and released the show Outrageous Arizona, an irreverent and humorous look at the history of Arizona, hosted by Bob Boze Bell and True West contributors Jana Bommersbach and Marshall Trimble. The show aired on select PBS stations in the Southwest. Outrageous Arizona received an EMMY Award from Rocky Mountain Southwest Chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (NATAS) in 2013. Awards True West has won multiple silver and bronze All-Industry Marketing (AIM) awards since 2005. In 2008, the Western Writers of America awarded True West the Lariat Award for outstanding support of the organization and its members. In June 2010, True West hit Fern Siegel's \\"Magazine Rack\\" in Media Post. \\"The Empire State Building is my true north—as it is for anyone who lives in downtown Manhattan... For those seeking an authentic experience without actual contact, try True West,\\" Siegel wrote, adding: \\"Today, the popular history pub hopes to 'capture the spirit of the West with authenticity, personality and humor,' linking its past to its present. In the immortal words of Seinfeld's Kramer: 'Giddy-up.'\\" The Oregon-California Trails Association awarded True West the Distinguished Service Award in August 2010 in recognition of consistently publishing travel articles on the National Historic Trails. An Oregon city, The Dalles, recognized True West as a top national magazine in January 2011.

It is named for its appearance as a pyramid from Wasdale, though it is dome-shaped from most other directions. It is one of the most popular of the Lakeland fells, and there are many different routes to the summit. Great Gable is linked by the high pass of Windy Gap to its smaller sister hill, Green Gable, and by the lower pass of Beck Head to its western neighbour, Kirk Fell. Topography The Western Fells occupy a triangular sector of the Lake District, bordered by the River Cocker to the north east and Wasdale to the south east. Westwards, the hills diminish toward the coastal plain of Cumbria. At the central hub of the high country are Great Gable and its satellites, while two principal ridges fan out on either flank of Ennerdale, the western fells forming a horseshoe around this valley.Alfred Wainwright: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Volume 7 The Western Fells: Westmorland Gazette (1966): Great Gable and its lesser companion Green Gable stand at the head of Ennerdale, with the walkers' pass of Sty Head to their backs. This connects Borrowdale to Wasdale, giving Gable a footing in both valleys. The Borrowdale connection is quite tenuous, but Great Gable is prominent in almost any view up the lake. The upper section of Great Gable has a roughly square plan, about half a mile on each side, with the faces running in line with the four points of the compass. The fells connecting and subsidiary ridges occupy the corners of the square. Head of Wasdale from Wastwater. Yewbarrow is on the left, Great Gable in the centre and the Scafell range on the right. The northern face is formed by Gable Crag, prominent in views from Haystacks and the surrounding fells. This is the longest continuous wall of crag on the fell and reaches up almost to the summit. Scree slopes fall away below to the headwaters of the River Liza, which flows down Ennerdale. There are few crags on the eastern slopes, although these fall steeply to Styhead Tarn, a feeder of the Borrowdale system. About deep, this tarn occupies a scooped hollow, dammed by boulders fallen from the slopes above. It is reputed to contain trout and is a popular location for wild camping.Blair, Don: Exploring Lakeland Tarns: Lakeland Manor Press (2003): The southern flank of Great Gable falls direct to Lingmell Beck, one of the main feeders of Wastwater. Right below the summit are the Westmorland Crags, and then a second tier breaks out lower down. These are Kern Knotts, Raven Crag and Great Napes, all footed by great tongues of scree. Finally on the west rough slopes fall below the rocks of White Napes to the narrow valley of Gable Beck, a tributary of Lingmell Beck. From the north- western corner of the pyramid the connecting ridge to Kirk Fell runs out across the col of Beck Head (). There is a small tarn in the depression, and sometimes a second after heavy rain. Both are blind, having no apparent inlet or outflow. Gable Beck runs south from Beck Head, while an unnamed tributary of the Liza flows northward. The main spine of the Western Fells continues along the north east ridge to Green Gable, dropping to Windy Gap () as it rounds the end of Gable Crag. This ridge is rough and rocky, further worn by the boots of countless walkers. Stone Cove lies on the Ennerdale side while the rough gully of Aaron Slack runs down toward Styhead Tarn. The south- eastern ridge provides the connection to the Southern Fells, across the pass of Sty Head. This is a major crossroads for walkers and climbers, the summit being at around . On the opposite slope is Great End in the Scafells. Kern Knotts lies on this south-east ridge, as does the small pool of Dry Tarn. The south-western ridge gives to high level connection, dropping down Gavel Neese in the angle between Lingmell Beck and Gable Beck. Geology Lying on the edge of the Scafell Syncline, the various strata dip to the east. The summit area is formed from a dacite lava flow (Scafell Dacite), directly underlain by the Lingmell Formation. This tuff, lapilli tuff and breccia outcrops a little to the west of the summit. Around Beck Head is evidence of the Crinkle Member, welded rhyolitic tuff and lapilli-tuff with some breccia. A dyke of andesite and hybridised andesite porphyry is responsible for Kern Knotts.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheets 29 and 38: BGS (1999) and (1998) Summit The Fell & Rock Climbing Club 1914-1918 War Memorial on the summit of Great Gable, Cumbria. This is the new plaque affixed in 2013, which removed earlier errors. The summit of Great Gable is strewn with boulders and the highest point marked by a rock outcrop set with a cairn. There is a plaque set on the summit rock commemorating those members of the Fell & Rock Climbing Club who died in World War I; an annual memorial service is held here on Remembrance Sunday. The club bought 3,000 acres of land including Great Gable and donated it to the National Trust in memory of these members, and the plaque was dedicated on Whit Sunday 1924 by Geoffrey Winthrop Young in front of 500 people. The bronze memorial, weighing 70 kg, was removed on 10 July 2013 by 13 soldiers and carried down the hill via a stretcher. A replacement, with spelling errors corrected, was installed by Royal Engineers in October 2013.Tribute to fallen of First World War gets new lease of life\\" Yorkshire Post 25 October 2013 Due to its central position within the Lake District and great prominence the summit offers panoramic views. All of the main fell groups are laid out, though Wast Water and Windermere are the only lakes visible. A hundred yards to the south west of the summit, overlooking the Napes, is the Westmorland Cairn. This cairn was erected in 1876 by two brothers named Westmorland to mark what they considered to be the finest view in the Lake District. From here ground falls away into the upper Wasdale valley. Further cairns mark the top of Gable Crag. The summit has become a popular site for the scattering of ashes following cremation.Hewitt, Dave (ed.): A Bit of Grit on Haystacks: A Celebration of Wainwright: Millrace (2004): Ascents Routes to climb to the summit start from all of the main dales that radiate out from central Lakeland. A popular route is to climb Sour Milk Gill from Seathwaite in Borrowdale, first ascending Green Gable before traversing Windy Gap.Bill Birkett:Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): Other walking routes Alfred Wainwright described the 'Gable Girdle', a circuit around the fell at mid height. This links a number of existing paths, namely the north and south traverses, Styhead Pass, Aaron Slack and Moses Trod. The south traverse climbs westward from Sty Head and provides access to the Napes and Kern Knotts for rock climbers. The route offers views of Napes Needle, Sphinx Rock and many other climbing locations. The north traverse similarly runs beneath Gable Crag to Windy Gap. In the west the two traverses are joined by a section of Moses Trod, running up the southern side of Beck Head. \\"Moses\\" was a possibly apocryphal trader-cum- smuggler, based at Honister Quarry. His route contoured the fellside from there to provide access to Wasdale markets for his illicit whisky. Moses Trod would also function as a route with minimal uphill sections for transporting slate from the quarry to the coast. Aaron Slack provides a fast down from Windy Gap to Sty Head. Rock climbing Napes Needle Great Gable has cliffs to the north (Gable Crag) and south (Westmorland Crags, the Napes, and Kern Knotts). The Napes are important in the history of English rock climbing: Walter Parry Haskett Smith's ascent of the detached pinnacle of Napes Needle in June 1886 (now graded Hard Severe) is thought by many to mark the origins in England of rock climbing as a sport in its own right, as opposed to a necessary evil undergone by mountaineers on their way to the summit.

It is often used instead of Parmesan cheese in Swiss cuisine. The cheese is produced in only 42 dairies in central Switzerland. Only local cow's milk is used when producing this cheese. It is kept in the region until ready for consumption. Contrary to popular belief, the name Sbrinz does not originally refer to a particular place or region. Nevertheless, the Swiss Cheese Union added to this myth by launching an advertising campaign in the 1990s. As a result of this campaign, there is now an area called Sbrinz. Character Sbrinz is an extra hard full fat cheese. It contains approximately 40% to 45% of fat when dry. The cheese must ripen for 16 months before it can be sold as Sbrinz, and the full flavour only develops after about 24–30 months in storage. History Sbrinz is claimed to be the oldest European cheese. The Celtic ancestors of the Swiss were making cheese centuries before the birth of Christ. This cheese may have been an ancestor to modern Sbrinz. The official web site claims that the cheese was first mentioned in 70 AD, but does not give any details. Other sources claim that the cheese is mentioned in contracts dated around 1200. It seems certain, however, that it is mentioned in documents dating from 1530, which are kept in the state archive in Bern. Starting in 2001, Sbrinz was granted an appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) certification. The AOC provides specifications for the origin of the milk and the processes that must be followed in order for the cheese to labeled as Sbrinz. In 2013, this was replaced by the appellation d'origine protégée (AOP) certification. Consumption Sbrinz is commonly consumed in several ways; it can be used grated, such as on pasta. It can be eaten in small pieces, often to accompany wine. It is also eaten in thin slices planed from the hard cheese. Sbrinz is often simply enjoyed with bread and butter.

In many respects, the investment trust was the progenitor of the investment company in the U.S.Lemke, Lins and Smith, Regulation of Investment Companies, §1.01 (Matthew Bender, 2014 ed.). The name is somewhat misleading, given that (according to law) an investment \\"trust\\" is not in fact a \\"trust\\" in the legal sense at all, but a separate legal person or a company. This matters for the fiduciary duties owed by the board of directors and the equitable ownership of the fund's assets. In the United Kingdom, the term \\"investment trust\\" has a strict meaning under tax law. However, the term is more commonly used within the UK to include any closed-ended investment company, including venture capital trusts (VCTs).

The board will typically delegate responsibility to a professional fund manager to invest in the stocks and shares of a wide range of companies (more than most people could practically invest in themselves). The investment trust often has no employees, only a board of directors comprising only non-executive directors. Investment trust shares are traded on stock exchanges, like those of other public companies. The share price does not always reflect the underlying value of the share portfolio held by the investment trust. In such cases, the investment trust is referred to as trading at a discount (or premium) to NAV (net asset value). Unlike open-ended funds that are UCITS, investment trusts may borrow money in an attempt to enhance investment returns (known as gearing or leverage). UCITS funds are not permitted to gear for investment purposes. The investment trust sector, in particular split capital investment trusts, suffered somewhat from around 2000 to 2003 after which creation of a compensation scheme resolved some problems. The sector has grown in recent years particularly through the launch of investment trusts investing in more illiquid assets such as property, private equity and infrastructure. Assets managed by investment trusts reached £174.4 billion at the end of December 2017. History The first investment trust was the Foreign & Colonial Investment Trust, started in 1868 \\"to give the investor of moderate means the same advantages as the large capitalists in diminishing the risk by spreading the investment over a number of stocks\\".  Classification of Investment Trusts  Investment trusts can hold a variety of assets: listed equities, government/corporate bonds, real estate, private companies and so on. These assets may be listed/incorporated/domiciled in any region. Moreover the investment objectives (growth, income, capital preservation...), risk profile (level of gearing, level of diversification via assets and risk factors) varies. According to such factors, investment trusts are classified into sectors by the industry body, the Association of Investment Companies. The largest sectors by assets under management in December 2017 were Global (£27.1 billion), Private Equity (£14.7 billion), UK Equity Income (£12.0 billion), Infrastructure (£10.0 billion) and Specialist Debt (£7.8 billion). These sector classifications were revamped in spring 2019. The new list of sectors and constituents comprised 13 new sectors, 15 renamed sectors and 31 sectors that were unchanged. The new sectors were added to reflect the greater numbers of investment companies investing in alternative assets. The amount of money invested by investment companies in alternative assets grew from £39.5bn in 2014 to £75.9bn in 2019. The growing debt sector was separated into three new sectors, Debt – Direct Lending, Debt – Loans & Bonds, and Debt – Structured Finance. Similarly, there were more specialist property sectors: Property – UK Commercial, Property – UK Healthcare, Property – UK Residential, and Property – Debt. Most of the equity sectors were unchanged, but Asia was split into three new sectors, Asia Pacific, Asia Pacific Income, and Asia Pacific Smaller Companies. There were new sectors for Growth Capital and for Royalties.Investment Trust Newsletter May 2019  Split Capital Investment Trusts  Most investment trusts issue only one type of share (ordinary shares) and have an unlimited life. Split capital investment trusts are investment trusts with more than one type of share, such as zero dividend preference shares, income shares and capital shares. However, the number of split capital trusts has fallen dramatically since the split capital investment trust crisis and there were only 12 split capital investment trusts left in existence by 2018. Each of these 12 has only two classes of share: zero dividend preference shares and ordinary shares. Some split capital trusts have a limited life determined at launch known as the wind-up date. Typically the life of a split capital trust is five to ten years. However, this life can be extended by shareholder vote. In the heyday of split capital trusts, splits were more complicated and could have share classes such as the following (in order of typical priority and increasing risk): * Zero Dividend Preference shares: no dividends, only capital growth at a pre-established redemption price (assuming sufficient assets) * Income shares: entitled to most (or all) of the income generated from the assets of a trust until the wind-up date, with some capital protection * Annuity Income shares: very high and rising yield, but virtually no capital protection * Ordinary Income shares (AKA Income & Residual Capital shares): a high income and a share of the remaining assets of the trust after prior ranking shares * Capital shares: entitled most (or all) of the remaining assets after prior ranking share classes have been paid; very high risk The type of share invested in is ranked in a predetermined order of priority, which becomes important when the trust reaches its wind-up date. If the Split has acquired any debt, debentures or loan stock, then this is paid out first, before any shareholders. Next in line to be repaid are Zero Dividend Preference shares, followed by any Income shares and then Capital. Although this order of priority is the most common way shares are paid out at the wind-up date, it may alter slightly from trust to trust. Splits may also issue Packaged Units combining certain classes of share, usually reflecting the share classes in the trust usually in the same ratio. This makes them essentially the same investment as an ordinary share in a conventional Investment Trust.  Real estate investment trusts In the United Kingdom, REITs are constituted as investment trusts. They must be UK resident and publicly listed on a stock exchange recognised by the Financial Conduct Authority. They must distribute at least 90% of their income.  Taxation Provided that it is approved by HM Revenue & Customs,Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, Section 842 an investment trust's investment income and capital gains are generally not taxed within the investment trust. This avoids the double taxation which would otherwise arise when shareholders receive income, or sell their shares in the investment trust and are taxed on their gains. An approved investment trust must * be resident in the United Kingdom * derive most of its income from investments * distribute at least 85% of its investment income as dividends (unless prohibited by company law) The company must not hold more than 15% of its investments in any single company (except another investment trust) and must not be a close company.HM Revenue & Customs Manuals, para CTM47110 Investment trusts were in 2012 given the ability to distribute capital profits to shareholders. Investment trusts that wished to take advantage of this had to change their Articles of Association, with shareholders' approval, to allow such distributions. However, only a small minority of investment trusts distribute their capital profits.

On 8 September, he accepted the office of Steward of the Manor of Northstead, thereby disqualifying himself from Parliament, and causing a by election. Polling took place on 30 September. It was the last of six by elections which were held during the 2001–2005 Parliament. Results Out of a registered electorate of 68,517, there were 31,362 valid votes, making a turnout of 45.77%. This was the highest by election turnout since the Romsey by election in May 2000. The Labour Party candidate Iain Wright won the seat with a majority of 2,033, a substantially reduced majority. The Liberal Democrat vote more than doubled, leaving them a close second. The United Kingdom Independence Party held their deposit, and beat the Conservatives into third place. This marked the first time UKIP had come third in a by election (and followed a successful European election in June 2004, in which they had come third country wide and won twelve seats). It would be over six years before they ever improved on this position, when they took second place at Barnsley Central in 2011. They would go on to win a by-election for the first time a little over a decade after the Hartlepool contest in Clacton, in October 2014. The Conservative vote in Hartlepool dropped considerably, leaving them in fourth place for the first time in an English by election since Liverpool Walton in 1991. Robert Kilroy- Silk of UKIP initially suggested he might stand but later ruled this out, as did Hartlepool and Middlesbrough mayors Stuart Drummond and Ray Mallon. Preceding by elections had seen the Liberal Democrats come from third place to beat the Conservative Party, and in Brent East and Leicester South take seats from Labour. The seat was safer (judging by the 2001 result) than Leicester but was vulnerable to swings such as achieved in Brent, or in Birmingham Hodge Hill where the Liberal Democrats narrowly failed to win. In the event, the Liberal Democrats were not quite able to repeat these performances. Their campaign suffered from the choice of a candidate who was not from Hartlepool, while the Labour candidate had been born and brought up in the town. In addition, the Liberal Democrat candidate made reference, on a campaign blog, to having canvassed a street where everyone she met \\"was either drunk, flanked by an angry dog, or undressed\\"; this happened despite a Liberal Democrat minder, Ed Fordham, having been appointed by the party's Campaigns Department to proof read Dunn's blog before any posts went up. Fordham removed a reference to some of the people canvassed being Labour supporters, but he thought the rest of the comment was fine.Greg Hurst, Charles Kennedy: A Tragic Flaw (Politico's, London, 2006) p.196 Labour gave wide publicity to this remark and asserted that it was an insult to the people of Hartlepool. Dunn defended her remarks on the Today programme, in a performance that was perceived to be unconvincing, so Labour party vans toured the constituency playing her Today interview on loudspeakers.Greg Hurst, Charles Kennedy: A Tragic Flaw (Politico's, London, 2006) p.197 Hartlepool had no significant ethnic minority vote, which had been present in the other three by-elections. The Liberal Democrats were nevertheless content to claim the large swing to them, and the Conservatives' fourth place established the Liberal Democrats as the main opposition party to Labour in the seat. UKIP did well with a local candidate, and their message of opposition to European Union fishing rules was a popular one in a port town. The Conservatives dropped from second place at the 2001 general election to fourth place, their worst place in an English by- election since 1991. Labour regarded the result as good news for them, as it came at the end of a very long campaign (effectively seventy one days), and with a swing markedly smaller than in other seats over the previous year. Labour also regarded the result – along with that in Hodge Hill – as a vindication of their decision to aggressively attack the Liberal Democrats and essentially ignore the Conservative challenge. 2001 result From the 2001 general election.

Distributed worldwide, E. rhusiopathiae is primarily considered an animal pathogen, causing the disease known as erysipelas that may affect a wide range of animals. Pigs, turkeys and laying hens are most commonly affected, but cases have been reported in other mammals, birds, fish, and reptiles. In pigs, the disease is known as \\"diamond skin disease\\". The bacterium can also cause zoonotic infections in humans, called erysipeloid. The human disease called erysipelas is not caused by E. rhusiopathiae, but by various members of the genus Streptococcus. History Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae was first isolated by Robert Koch in 1876. A few years later the bacterium was recognised as the cause of erysipelas in pigs and in 1884 the organism was first established as a human pathogen. In 1909, the genus was named Erysipelothrix. In 1918 the name Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae was introduced and in 1920 it was designated as the type species of the genus. Epidemiology Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae may be isolated from soil, food scraps, and water contaminated by infected animals. It can survive in soil for several weeks. In pig faeces, the survival period of this bacterium ranges from 1 to 5 months. Erysipeloid is transmitted by several animals, particularly pigs, in which the disease (very common in the past) has several names (swine erysipelas in English, rouget du porc in French and mal rossino in Italian). Urticaria-like lesions, arthralgia, arthritis, endocarditis, and sepsis are the most characteristic features of swine erysipelas. Other animals that can transmit the infection are sheep, rabbits, chickens, turkeys, ducks, emus, scorpion fish, and lobsters. Erysipeloid is an occupational disease, mainly found in animal breeders, veterinarians, slaughterhouse workers, furriers, butchers, fishermen, fishmongers, housewives, cooks, and grocers. One epidemic of erysipeloid was described in workers involved in manufacturing buttons from animal bone. The disease is of economic importance to the pig industries of North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. Clinical disease = Humans = In humans, E. rhusiopathiae infections most commonly present in a mild cutaneous form known as erysipeloid. Less commonly, it can result in sepsis; this scenario is often associated with endocarditis. Erysipeloid, also named in the past Rosenbach's disease, Baker–Rosenbach disease, and pseudoerysipelas, is a bacterial infection of the skin caused by traumatic penetration of E. rhusiopathiae. It occurs most commonly as an occupational disease. The disease is characterized clinically by an erythematous oedema, with well-defined and raised borders, usually localized to the back of one hand and/or fingers. The palms, forearms, arms, face, and legs are rarely involved. Vesicular, bullous, and erosive lesions may also be present. The lesion may be asymptomatic or accompanied by mild pruritus, pain, and fever. = Animals = Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae may infect a wide range of animals, with or without causing the clinical disease that in animals is termed erysipelas.  Pigs  In pigs, three forms of erysipelas may be seen; acute, subacute or chronic. The acute form is characterised by high fever, anorexia, depression and death of one or more animals. Also, diamond- shaped cutaneous lesions may be seen, these are pathognomonic for erysipelas in pigs. During subacute erysipelas, similar but milder signs than in the acute form are seen. The chronic form may follow from acute or subacute cases or subclinical infections. The chronic form is mostly characterised by arthritis but sudden deaths, due to valvular lesions in the heart, may occur.  Poultry  The bacterium has been isolated from a wide range of avian species and differences in susceptibility depending on species have been suggested. Erysipelas outbreaks have been reported in almost all poultry species. Historically, erysipelas has been considered a disease of significant importance primarily in turkeys. However, an increasing number of outbreaks in laying hen flocks have been reported in several countries. Signs seen during an outbreak of erysipelas in a laying hen flock include sudden onset of high mortality and egg production losses. =Muskox= Due to unregulated hunting of muskox the species was almost wiped out in the late 19th century. However, by 1917 regulations were in place and the herds began to recover to such an extent that regulated hunting was permitted in the 1980s. By the 1990s hunters were permitted to take 10,000 muskox on Banks Island alone and in 2001 it was estimated that there were more than 68,000 muskox on the island making it the largest population in the world. However, since then the numbers have dropped by 70% due to erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae. Kutz, S., Bollinger, T., Branigan, M., Checkley, S., Davison, T., Dumond, M., Elkin, B., Forde, T., Hutchins, W., Niptanatiak, A., et al. (2015). Cross-Canada Disease Report Rapport des maladies diagnostiquées au Canada. Can. Vet. J. 56,. Virulence factors Various virulence factors have been suggested as being involved in the pathogenicity of E. rhusiopathiae. The presence of a hyaluronidase and neuraminidase has been recognized, and neuraminidase was shown to play a significant role in bacterial attachment and subsequent invasion into host cells. The role of hyaluronidase in the disease process is controversial. The presence of a heat-labile capsule has been reported as important in virulence. Diagnosis Blood agar plate culture of E. rhusiopathiae = Isolation = Traditionally, culture methods for the isolation of E. rhusiopathiae involve the use of selective and enrichment media. Commercially available blood culture media are satisfactory for primary isolation from blood, since E. rhusiopathiae is not particularly fastidious. A number of selective media for the isolation of Erysipelothrix have been described, also. A commonly used medium is Erysipelothrix selective broth (ESB), a nutrient broth containing serum, tryptose, kanamycin, neomycin, and vancomycin. Modified blood azide medium (MBA) is a selective agar containing sodium azide and horse blood or serum. Packer's medium is a selective medium for grossly contaminated specimens, which contains sodium azide and crystal violet. Bohm's medium uses sodium azide, kanamycin, phenol, and water blue. Shimoji's selective enrichment broth contains tryptic soy broth, Tween 80, tris-aminomethane, crystal violet, and sodium azide. =Species identification= Conventional species identification is based on colony morphology, Gram-staining and biochemical tests. Colonies are small with a narrow zone of alpha hemolysis on blood agar plates. Laboratory smears show Gram-positive rods (though Gram stain has low sensitivity for this microbe). It is nonmotile, catalase- negative, microaerophilic, capnophilic, and non-spore-forming. It can also produce H2S (gas), which is a unique characteristic for a Gram-positive bacillus. Acid is produced from glucose, fructose, galactose, and lactose, but not from maltose, xylose, and mannitol. Sucrose is fermented by most strains of E. tonsillarum, but not by E. rhusiopathiae. Hydrogen sulfide H2S is produced by 95% of strains of Erysipelothrix species as demonstrated on triple sugar iron (TSI) agar. E. rhusiopathiae can be differentiated from other Gram- positive bacilli, in particular, from Arcanobacterium (Corynebacterium) pyogenes and Arcanobacterium (Corynebacterium) haemolyticum, which are hemolytic on blood agar and do not produce hydrogen sulfide in TSI agar slants, and from Listeria monocytogenes, which is catalase positive, motile, and sensitive to neomycin. Rapid identification of E. rhusiopathiae can be achieved with the API Coryne System. It is a commercial strip system based on a number of biochemical reactions for the identification of coryneform bacteria and related genera, including E. rhusiopathiae. The system permits reliable and rapid identification of bacteria and has been considered to be a good alternative to traditional biochemical methods. = Other assays = Several polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based methods have also been developed for detection of E. rhusiopathiae. Laboratory investigations of humans may reveal leucocytosis, slightly increased serum c-globulins, and an increase in inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and a-1 acid glycoprotein). Treatment = Humans = Penicillin is the treatment of choice for both disease states in humans. E. rhusiopathiae is sensitive in vitro and in vivo mainly to penicillins, but also to cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone), tetracyclines (chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline), quinolones (ciprofloxacin, pefloxacin), clindamycin, erythromycin, imipenem, and piperacillin. It is resistant to vancomycin, chloramphenicol, daptomycin, gentamicin, netilmicin, polymyxin B, streptomycin, teicoplanin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Penicillins and cephalosporins are the first-line choice for treatment. A 7-day course is appropriate, and clinical improvement is usually observed 2–3 days after the beginning of the treatment. = Poultry = Only a few poultry isolates have been investigated for antimicrobial susceptibility. Penicillin is the drug of choice for treatment of poultry, however the disease may reoccur. Therefore, antibiotic treatment may be combined with vaccination.

The episode premiered on September 16, 1993, on NBC. This first episode seeks to establish the show, introduce the primary characters and settings, and distance itself from its parent, Cheers. The final draft of the script was published on April 29, 1993. Excerpts from the show was promoted as the series finale of Cheers aired on May 20, 1993. Plot Six months after the conclusion of Cheers, Dr. Frasier Crane is divorced from Lilith Sternin and has moved back to his hometown of Seattle, Washington, in the hopes of a fresh start. Since the move, Frasier has been hosting a talk-radio show on KACL 780 AM Talk Radio as an on-air psychiatrist, alongside producer Roz Doyle. Frasier is approached by his brother, Niles, who informs him that their father, Martin, a retired police officer injured in the line of duty, can no longer live by himself. In hopes of renewing their father-son relationship, Frasier reluctantly offers to take his father in. Martin moves into Frasier's apartment but Frasier is startled when Martin brings in his tatty recliner and Parson Russell Terrier Eddie, both of which greatly annoy Frasier. Some time afterwards, Niles and his wife Maris offer to help Frasier taking care of Martin by jointly paying for a health care provider. Martin convinces Frasier to hire Daphne Moon, an eccentric immigrant from Manchester, England, who claims to be \\"a bit psychic\\", much to Frasier's disapproval. After Daphne reveals that she needs to move in, Frasier, who doesn't want more people living in his apartment, dismisses her. This leads to an argument with Martin, ending with Frasier storming out of the apartment. The next day at work, Frasier discusses his troubles with Roz, who in turn tells him the story of Lupe Vélez; she points out that although things might not go as planned, they can work out anyway. Frasier then takes his next call, only to find a remorseful Martin on the line. Frasier in turn apologizes for his insensitivity and reconciles with his father. Frasier then goes on to take a call from a woman, upset and tearful about breaking up with her boyfriend, and proceeds to tell her the story of Vélez. The episode ends with Daphne, Martin and Frasier watching TV in his apartment while Eddie silently stares at an annoyed Frasier.

The game was first unveiled at E3 in May 2004, and was released in Japan on December 16, 2004, in North America on March 22, 2005, and in Europe on September 1, 2005. It was the first game in the Metal Gear series for the PSP. A Java ME version for mobile phones was released by Glu Mobile in 2008 titled Metal Gear Acid Mobile. Acid focuses on turn-based tactics, using a trading card-based system to control the main character's movements and actions. Acid in the name stands for \\"Active Command Intelligence Duel\\". The cards are not truly collectible, as the game is complete with a single purchase. However, the game does feature deck design and deck optimization elements. The game allows for multiplayer gameplay by wireless ad-hoc connections of two PSPs.  Gameplay  Before each round, the player can customize the deck of cards used by the main characters. The majority of the cards are based upon elements spanning the entire Metal Gear series, such as weaponry, characters, and even the Metal Gear itself. When the game is started, the player's hand can consist of a maximum of six cards. The maximum number of cards in a deck increases with overall progress. In action mode, the player can choose to use the cards as they are intended or use them to move the character. Most cards only allow the player to move three spaces, while certain cards let the player move up to six or higher. Cost is an important factor in game play and can be summed up as the weight of the player's action. With some exceptions, all cards have a cost attached to them and when used this cost transfers to the player. Cost varies radically from card to card. The higher the cost a character has, the longer that character must wait until their next turn. The lower the cost a character has, the shorter that character must wait until their next turn. For example: if a player character has a cost of 10 and a guard has a cost of 15, then the character's turn would occur before the guard's. Some cards can be equipped; cards such as weapon cards, can have other cards attached to them in order to improve performance. In order to fire the weapon, another weapon card that uses the same kind of ammunition must be equipped. Some weapons don't need to be equipped and can be used by themselves, however they are discarded afterwards. Other cards that can be equipped include equipment cards and action cards. Multiplayer, or \\"Link Battle\\", is also a new feature. Two PSP systems running Acid can link wirelessly, allowing players to face each other in a \\"sneak-off\\". The objective is to collect a certain number of diskettes before the rival player. Diskettes can be stolen by another player, so there is an emphasis on avoiding detection.  Plot =Story= In 2016, a jumbo jet carrying Senator Hach, an important politician and likely future presidential candidate, is hijacked by terrorists. In exchange for the senator the terrorists demand from the United States government Pythagoras, a research project being conducted in the Moloni Republic in southern Africa. In efforts to identify these terrorists, the government begins an investigation of Pythagoras. The Moloni government refuses to cooperate and work with the United States, saying that it doesn't want to interfere in its current affairs. In response, the US sends in a covert special forces team to investigate, but the team is obliterated by armed resistance. With no other options and time running out, the US government calls Solid Snake to infiltrate the laboratory, discover the nature of Pythagoras, and to rescue Senator Hach. = Characters = * Solid Snake - The main character. A member of FOXHOUND who has achieved legendary status, he is brought to duty to infiltrate the Lobito Physics and Chemistry laboratory compound. Snake is led to believe that he is actually Hans Davis, a researcher involved in the development of the new Metal Gear model. * Teliko Friedman - A female Japanese-American member of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Hostage Rescue Team that was sent to the Lobito compound prior to Snake. She rendezvous with Snake and teams up with him as a second playable character in the game. She reappears in Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops as a hidden playable character. * Roger McCoy - A Central Intelligence Agency operative from New Jersey who serves as Snake's commanding officer in the game. He previously served in the Green Berets and is an acquaintance of Roy Campbell, Snake's former commanding officer. * Alice Hazel - An English girl who has aided the FBI and CIA in the past with her psychic abilities. She is one of Snake's radio contacts in the game. * Lt. Leone - The leader of a mercenary group hired by an anti-government militia in the Moloni Republic. He was once known as Jeff Jones and served under McCoy's unit during the Vietnam War until he was suspected of treason. * Gary Murray - A lab worker who requests Snake's help. He is actually William L. Flemming and is involved in the development of the new Metal Gear. * Elsie and Frances - A pair of marionettes that carry out the hijacking of Flight 326 * La Clown - An assassin of unknown gender with the ability to disguise their appearance. * Viggo Hach - A Dutch-American United States Senator from New York who is a presidential candidate. Taken hostage by terrorists during his flight. * Lena Arrows - Hach's secretary, who was also caught in the hijacking. * Minette Donnell - A young girl on the same flight as Hach. She is actually Constance Flemming, the daughter of William L. Flemming. * Charles Schmeiser - A CIA agent from Toronto, Canada who works under McCoy.  Production and release  According to an interview originally published by Electronic Gaming Monthly with the game's producer, Masahiro Hinami, the 'Acid' part of the title actually has three different meanings. The first meaning refers to Acid's departure from the previous Metal Gear games in terms of style, which is an analogue to acid's ability to dissolve metal. The second is a reference to vecuronium bromide, the chemical used by Elsie and Frances to hijack Flight 326. The third is stated to be an acronym for Active Command Intelligence Duel, a reference to the game's mixture of turn-based tactics with card-based gameplay. =Soundtrack= The game's soundtrack was composed by Nobuko Toda, Shuichi Kobori and Akihiro Honda. The soundtrack was released on December 21, 2005, packaged with the Metal Gear Acid 2 soundtrack. The album's title is Metal Gear Acid 1 and 2 Original Soundtrack. Reception Metal Gear Acid received generally positive reviews from critics. The game holds a 75 on Metacritic, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".  Sequel  Acid was followed by a sequel for the PSP, Metal Gear Acid 2, which released the following year. A mobile phone version, titled Metal Gear Acid Mobile was also produced.

Causes Intracranial bleeding occurs when a blood vessel within the skull is ruptured or leaks. It can result from physical trauma (as occurs in head injury) or nontraumatic causes (as occurs in hemorrhagic stroke) such as a ruptured aneurysm. Anticoagulant therapy, as well as disorders with blood clotting can heighten the risk that an intracranial hemorrhage will occur. More than half of all cases of intracranial hemorrhage is the result of hypertension. Diagnosis An acute bleed into a long-standing cystic mass within the brain. Arrow points to bleeding and mass. CT scan (computed tomography) is the definitive tool for accurate diagnosis of an intracranial hemorrhage. In difficult cases, a 3T-MRI scan can also be used. When ICP is increased the heart rate may be decreased. =Classification= Types of intracranial hemorrhage are roughly grouped into intra-axial and extra-axial. The hemorrhage is considered a focal brain injury; that is, it occurs in a localized spot rather than causing diffuse damage over a wider area. Intra-axial bleed Intra-axial hemorrhage is bleeding within the brain itself, or cerebral hemorrhage. This category includes intraparenchymal hemorrhage, or bleeding within the brain tissue, and intraventricular hemorrhage, bleeding within the brain's ventricles (particularly of premature infants). Intra-axial hemorrhages are more dangerous and harder to treat than extra-axial bleeds. Extra-axial bleed Extra-axial hemorrhage, bleeding that occurs within the skull but outside of the brain tissue, falls into three subtypes: *Epidural hemorrhage (extradural hemorrhage) which occur between the dura mater (the outermost meninx) and the skull, is caused by trauma. It may result from laceration of an artery, most commonly the middle meningeal artery. This is a very dangerous type of injury because the bleed is from a high-pressure system and deadly increases in intracranial pressure can result rapidly. However, it is the least common type of meningeal bleeding and is seen in 1% to 3% cases of head injury. **Patients have a loss of consciousness (LOC), then a lucid interval, then sudden deterioration (vomiting, restlessness, LOC) **Head CT shows lenticular (convex) deformity. *Subdural hemorrhage results from tearing of the bridging veins in the subdural space between the dura and arachnoid mater. **Head CT shows crescent-shaped deformity *Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), which occur between the arachnoid and pia meningeal layers, like intraparenchymal hemorrhage, can result either from trauma or from ruptures of aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations. Blood is seen layering into the brain along sulci and fissures, or filling subarachnoid cisterns (most often the chiasmatic cistern because of the presence of the anterior cerebral arteries of the circle of Willis and their branchpoints within that space). The classic presentation of subarachnoid hemorrhage is the sudden onset of a severe headache (a thunderclap headache). SAH is considered a form of stroke, despite technically being extra-axial. Confirmed spontaneous SAH requires further investigations as to the source of the bleeding, as the bleeding may recur without intervention. = Epidural hematoma = Epidural hematoma (EDH) is a rapidly accumulating hematoma between the dura mater and the cranium. These patients have a history of head trauma with loss of consciousness, then a lucid period, followed by loss of consciousness. Clinical onset occurs over minutes to hours. Many of these injuries are associated with lacerations of the middle meningeal artery. A \\"lenticular\\", or convex, lens-shaped extracerebral hemorrhage that does not cross suture lines will likely be visible on a CT scan of the head. Although death is a potential complication, the prognosis is good when this injury is recognized and treated. = Subdural hematoma = Subdural hematoma occurs when there is tearing of the bridging vein between the cerebral cortex and a draining venous sinus. At times they may be caused by arterial lacerations on the brain surface. Acute subdural hematoma are usually associated with cerebral cortex injury as well and hence the prognosis is not as good as extra dural hematoma. Clinical features depend on the site of injury and severity of injury. Patients may have a history of loss of consciousness but they recover and do not relapse. Clinical onset occurs over hours. A crescent shaped hemorrhage compressing the brain that does cross suture lines will be noted on CT of the head. Craniotomy and surgical evacuation is required if there is significant pressure effect on the brain. Complications include focal neurologic deficits depending on the site of hematoma and brain injury, increased intracranial pressure leading to herniation of brain and ischemia due to reduced blood supply and seizures. =Subarachnoid hemorrhage= A subarachnoid hemorrhage is bleeding into the subarachnoid space—the area between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater surrounding the brain. Besides from head injury, it may occur spontaneously, usually from a ruptured cerebral aneurysm. Symptoms of SAH include a severe headache with a rapid onset (thunderclap headache), vomiting, confusion or a lowered level of consciousness, and sometimes seizures. The diagnosis is generally confirmed with a CT scan of the head, or occasionally by lumbar puncture. Treatment is by prompt neurosurgery or radiologically guided interventions with medications and other treatments to help prevent recurrence of the bleeding and complications. Since the 1990s, many aneurysms are treated by a minimal invasive procedure known as endovascular coiling, which is carried out by instrumentation through large blood vessels. However, this procedure has higher recurrence rates than the more invasive craniotomy with clipping. Prognosis It may be relatively safe to restart blood thinners after an ICH.

The Supreme Commander is the agency head of the Swedish Armed Forces and formally reports to the Government of Sweden, though normally through the Minister for Defence. The primary responsibilities and duties of the Supreme Commander (and the charter for the Armed Forces) are prescribed in an ordinance issued by the Government. The Supreme Commander is, apart from the honorary ranks held by the King of Sweden and in the past other members of the Swedish Royal Family, by unwritten convention normally the only professional military officer on active duty to hold the highest rank (a four- star General or Admiral). An exception was made 2009-2014 when Håkan Syrén was chairman of the European Union Military Committee. The present Supreme Commander, General Micael Bydén, took office on 1 October 2015. Historical background Before the modern era, the King was expected to command the forces himself; not seldom on location during war campaigns as shown by Gustavus Adolphus, Charles X, Charles XI and Charles XII. This remained the case formally until the 20th century. From the late 19th century onwards, there were no service chiefs of the Army or Navy; all senior service commanders reported directly to the King in Council. Apart from a single Minister for Defence created in 1919 by merging the position of ministers of the land forces and naval forces, no joint command structure existed. In 1936, a Supreme Commander was intended to be appointed in war-time-only, and on 1 December 1939, during World War II, the first Supreme Commander, General Olof Thörnell, was appointed. In 1942 it was decided to keep this office even after the end of the war. The Supreme Commander would in wartime formally report to the King in Council until the enactment of the new Instrument of Government in 1974, and after 1 January 1975 to the Government. Heraldry The command flag of the Supreme Commander is drawn by Brita Grep and embroidered by hand by the Kedja studio, Heraldica. Blazon: \\"Fessed in blue and yellow; on blue three open yellow crowns placed two and one, on yellow two blue batons of command with sets of open yellow crowns placed two and one in saltire.\\" The coat of arms of the Supreme Commander was used from 1991 to 1993. It has since 1993 been used by the Swedish Armed Forces and was used from 1994 to 2001 by the Swedish Armed Forces Headquarters.

Some feel that some kind of rotational system would be appropriate. In actuality, most Supreme Commanders have come from the Army, and only one, Håkan Syrén, from the Navy. Because he is a General of the Amphibious Corps, there has to this day not been a single Admiral to hold the office. List of Deputy Supreme Commanders Until 30 June 1994, the Chief of the Defence Staff was the second most senior member of the Swedish Armed Forces. When the Swedish Armed Forces was reorganized on 1 July 1994, the Chief of the Defence Staff position was abolished. Lieutenant General Percurt Green became the first Deputy Supreme Commander who took office on 1 July 1994. He also held the post of head of the Joint Operations Command (Operationsledningen, OpL). In conjunction with the Swedish Armed Forces Headquarters reorganization in 1998, a special position was created as Deputy Supreme Commander to relieve the Supreme Commander. The Deputy Supreme Commander led the Headquarters work through coordination of the operations. He also exercised employer responsibility for the staff in the Headquarters. In order to coordinate the operations he had a Coordination Department. The Deputy Supreme Commander also acted as the Deputy Agency Executive (Ställföreträdande myndighetschef). A formal position of head of the Swedish Armed Forces Headquarters was established in 2002.

Sports Illustrated magazine named their first meeting, the Liston–Clay fight (Ali had not yet changed his name from Cassius Clay), as the fourth greatest sports moment of the twentieth century. The first bout was held on February 25, 1964 in Miami Beach, Florida. Clay, who was a 71 underdog, won in a major upset, when Liston gave up at the opening of the seventh round (after being clearly dominated in the sixth). Their second fight was in May 1965 in Lewiston, Maine, which Ali won with a first-round knockout. Liston vs. Clay I =Background= Liston was the World Heavyweight Champion at the time of the first Liston–Clay fight in Miami Beach on February 25, 1964, having demolished former champion Floyd Patterson by a first-round knockout in September 1962. Ten months later, Liston and Patterson met again with the same result—Patterson was knocked out in the first round. Liston was the most intimidating fighter of his day, and considered by some, at the time of the Clay fight, to be among the best heavyweights of all time. Many were reluctant to meet him in the ring. Henry Cooper, the British champion, said he would be interested in a title fight if Clay won, but he was not going to get in the ring with Liston. Cooper's manager, Jim Wicks, said, \\"We don't even want to meet Liston walking down the same street.\\" Boxing promoter Harold Conrad said, \\"People talked about [Mike] Tyson before he got beat, but Liston was more ferocious, more indestructible. ... When Sonny gave you the evil eye—I don't care who you were—you shrunk [sic] to two feet tall.\\"Muhammad Ali: His Life and Times, Thomas Hauser Tex Maule wrote in Sports Illustrated: \\"Liston's arms are massively muscled, the left jab is more than a jab. It hits with true shock power. It never occurred to Liston that he might lose a fight.\\" Johnny Tocco, a trainer who worked with George Foreman and Mike Tyson as well as Liston, said Liston was the hardest hitter of the three.quoted in Sonny Liston, Paul Gallender Several boxing writers actually thought Liston could be damaging to the sport because he could not be beaten.Sonny Liston, Paul Gallender Liston's ominous, glowering demeanor was so central to his image that Esquire magazine caused a controversy by posing him in a Santa Claus hat for its December 1963 cover. Liston learned to box in the Missouri State Penitentiary while serving time for armed robbery. Later, he was re-incarcerated for assaulting a police officer. For much of his career, his contract was majority owned by Frankie Carbo, a one-time mob hit man and senior member of the Lucchese crime family, who ran boxing interests for the Mafia. The mob was deeply engaged in boxing at every level at the time, and Liston was never able to escape being labeled as the personification of everything that was unseemly and criminal in the sport, despite the fact that his criminality had been in the past. He distrusted boxing writers, and they paid him back, often depicting him as little more than an ignorant thug and a bully. He was typically described in thinly veiled racist terms—a \\"gorilla\\" and \\"hands like big bananas\\". Author James Baldwin understood Liston perhaps better than anyone in the press and sympathized with him and liked him, unlike boxing writers. He said, \\"Liston was the big Negro in every white man's hallway.\\" He was a man who, according to Ali biographer David Remnick, \\"had never gotten a break and was never going to give one\\". On the other hand, Clay was a glib, fast-talking 22-year-old challenger who enjoyed the spotlight. Known as \\"The Louisville Lip\\", he had won the light heavyweight gold medal at the 1960 Olympics in Rome, Italy. He had great hand and foot speed and lightning fast reflexes, not to mention a limitless supply of braggadocio. However, Clay had been knocked down by journeyman Sonny Banks early in his career, and, in his previous two fights, had eked out a controversial decision against Doug Jones and—more seriously—was knocked down by a left hook at the end of round four against the cut-prone converted southpaw Henry Cooper. Clay was clearly \\"out on his feet\\" in his corner between rounds, and his trainer, Angelo Dundee, stalled for time to allow Clay to recover. Although Clay rallied to win the fight in the next round, it seemed clear to many that he would be no match against the daunting Liston, who seemed a more complete boxer in every way than Cooper. The brash Clay was equally disliked by reporters and his chances were widely dismissed. Lester Bromberg's forecast in the New York World-Telegram was typical, predicting, \\"It will last longer than the Patterson fight—almost the entire first round.\\" The Los Angeles Times Jim Murray observed, \\"The only thing at which Clay can beat Liston is reading the dictionary,\\" adding that the face- off between the two unlikeable athletes would be \\"the most popular fight since Hitler and Stalin--180 million Americans rooting for a double knockout.\\"Random House for High School Teachers  Catalog  King of the World by David Remnick The New York Times regular boxing writer Joe Nichols declined to cover the fight, assuming that it would be a mismatch. By fight time, Clay was a seven- to-one betting underdog. Of the 46 sportswriters at ringside, 43 had picked Liston to win by knockout. Liston, however, brought weaknesses into the Clay fight that were not fully apparent at the time. He claimed to be 32 years old at the time of the bout, but many believed that his true age was closer to 40, perhaps even older. Liston had been suffering from bursitis in his shoulders for close to a year and had been receiving cortisone shots. In training for the Clay fight, he re-injured his left shoulder and was supposedly in pain striking the heavy bag. He secretly resorted to heavy icing and ultrasound therapy after each training session. And, ironically, because of his dominance, Liston had actually logged little ring time in the past three years. Between March 1961 and the Clay fight, Liston had fought three times and won each bout with first-round knockouts—meaning that he had fought a total of just over six minutes during a 35-month stretch. One of the reasons that Clay's chances were dismissed is that his boxing style seemed ill-suited to the heavyweight division. He was widely viewed as a fast but light puncher lacking the ability to take a punch or to fight inside. The signatures of Clay's style and later greatness—the tendency to keep his hands low and lean away from punches (often leaving his opponent hitting air, off balance, and exposed to counter punches), his constant movement and reluctance to set (making him extremely difficult to hit)—were viewed as fundamental technical flaws that would be quickly exploited by an experienced, hard-hitting heavyweight like Liston. New York Journal-American columnist Jimmy Cannon summarized this view when he wrote: \\"Clay doesn't fight like the valid heavyweight he is. He seldom sets and misses a lot. In a way, Clay is a freak. He is a bantamweight who weighs more than 200 pounds [91kg].\\" Liston trained minimally for the bout, convinced that he would dispose of Clay within the first two rounds. He typically ran just one mile a day instead of his usual five, reportedly ate hot dogs and drank beer, and was rumored to have been furnished with prostitutes in training camp.Gallender, op cit =Pre-fight publicity= The television series I've Got a Secret did multiple segments about the title fight. Panelists Bill Cullen, Henry Morgan and Betsy Palmer predicted that Liston would win in the third, second, and first rounds, respectively. Host Garry Moore was even more pessimistic about Clay's chances, estimating a Liston knockout \\"in the very early moments of round one,\\" adding, \\"if I were Cassius, I would catch a cab and leave town.\\" Actor Hal March went a step further: \\"I think the fight will end in the dressing room. I think [Clay] is going to faint before he comes out.\\" The night before the first fight, on February 24, 1964, the show featured Clay and Liston's sparring partners as guests.Harvey Jones and Jesse Bowdry appearance on CBS' I've Got a Secret, February 24, 1964. Rebroadcast on Game Show Network on March 24, 2008. Harvey Jones brought with him a lengthy rhyming boast from Cassius Clay: Clay also presented that poem on The Jack Paar Show with Liberace giving improvised piano harmony. Jesse Bowdry brought a much terser written message from Sonny Liston: The following week, I've Got a Secret brought on two sportswriters whose secret was that they had been the only writers to correctly predict Clay's victory. =Baiting the bear= Clay began taunting and provoking Liston almost immediately after the two agreed to fight. He purchased a bus and had it emblazoned with the words \\"Liston Must Go In Eight.\\" On the day of the contract signing, he drove it to Liston's home in Denver, waking the champion (with the press in tow) at 3:00 a.m. shouting, \\"Come on out of there. I'm gonna whip you now.\\" Liston had just moved into a white neighborhood and was furious at the attention this caused. Clay took to driving his entourage in the bus to the site in Surfside, Florida where Liston (nicknamed the \\"Big Bear\\") was training, and repeatedly called Liston the \\"big, ugly bear\\". Liston grew increasingly irritated as the motor-mouthed Clay continued hurling insults (\\"After the fight, I'm gonna build myself a pretty home and use him as a bearskin rug. Liston even smells like a bear. I'm gonna give him to the local zoo after I whup him ... if Sonny Liston whups me, I'll kiss his feet in the ring, crawl out of the ring on my knees, tell him he's the greatest, and catch the next jet out of the country.\\"). Clay insisted to a skeptical press that he would knock out Liston in eight rounds (Former Light Heavyweight Champion José Torres, in his 1971 biography of Ali, Sting Like a Bee, said that as of 1963, Ali's prophetic poems had correctly predicted the exact round he would stop an opponent 12 times). Clay's brashness did not endear him to white Americans, and, in fact, even made Liston a more sympathetic character. In The New Republic, the editor Murray Kempton wrote, \\"Liston used to be a hoodlum; now he is our cop; he was the big Negro we pay to keep sassy Negroes in line.\\" It has been widely stated that Clay's antics were a deliberate form of psychological warfare designed to unsettle Liston by stoking his anger, encouraging his overconfidence and even fueling uncertainty about Clay's sanity. As Clay himself said, \\"If Liston wasn't thinking nothing but killing me, he wasn't thinking fighting. You got to think to fight.\\" Former World Heavyweight Champion Joe Louis said, \\"Liston is an angry man, and he can't afford to be angry fighting Clay.\\" Clay's outbursts also fed Liston's belief that Clay was terrified (something Clay's camp did little to disavow). Clay said later, \\"I knew that Liston, overconfident that he was, was never going to train to fight more than two rounds. He couldn't see nothing to me at all but mouth.\\" In contrast, Clay prepared hard for the fight, studying films of Liston's prior bouts and even detecting that Liston telegraphed his punches with eye movement.Paul Gallender, op cit =The Nation of Islam= Several weeks before the fight, the Miami Herald published an article quoting Cassius Clay Sr. as saying that his son had joined the Black Muslims when he was 18. \\"They have been hammering at him ever since,\\" Clay Sr. said. \\"He's so confused now that he doesn't even know where he's at.\\" He said his youngest son, Rudy Clay, had also joined. \\"They ruined my two boys,\\" Clay Sr. said. \\"Muslims tell my boys to hate white people; to hate women; to hate their mother.\\" Clay Jr. responded by saying, \\"I don't care what my father said. ... I'm here training for a fight, and that's all I'm going to say.\\" As the story began to spread, promoters became increasingly uneasy. Bill MacDonald, the main promoter, threatened to cancel the fight unless Clay publicly disavowed the Nation of Islam [the NOI]. Clay refused. A compromise was reached when Malcolm X, at the time a companion of Clay's as well as a feared and incendiary spokesperson for the Nation of Islam (though Malcolm X had, by that time, been censured by the NOI—banned from speaking to the press and suspended from all official NOI roles and duties—and would soon officially break with the Nation), agreed to keep a low profile, save for the night of the fight when he would rejoin Clay's entourage as spiritual advisor and view the fight from a ringside seat. While Clay would not definitively link himself with the Nation of Islam and its leader, Elijah Muhammad, until the day after the fight—at the annual NOI Savior's Day celebration—his association with the Nation, seen by many as a hate group due in part to its strict anti-integrationist stance, further complicated his relations with the press and the white public, further deprived the fight of the \\"good guy/bad guy\\" narrative, and negatively impacted the gate. MacDonald would ultimately lose $300,000 on the bout.Hauser, Muhammad Ali According to Malcolm X, Muhammad Ali had converted to Islam and joined the Nation of Islam several years prior to the fight, but had kept his religion and affiliation a secret up until the fight. =The weigh-in= Clay's outbursts reached their peak at the pre-fight weigh- in/physical the morning of the event. Championship bout weigh-ins, before this, had been predictable and boring. Clay entered the room where the weigh- in would be held wearing a denim jacket with the words \\"Bear Huntin'\\" on the back and carrying an African walking stick. He began waving the stick, screaming, \\"I'm the champ! Tell Sonny I'm here. Bring that big ugly bear on.\\" When Liston appeared, Clay went wild. \\"Someone is going to die at ringside tonight!\\" he shouted. \\"You're scared, chump!\\" He was restrained by members of his entourage. Writer Mort Sharnik thought Clay was having a seizure. Robert Lipsyte, the New York Times writer, likened the scene to a \\"police action, with an enormous amount of movement and noise exploding in a densely packed room.\\" Amidst the pandemonium, he was fined $2,500 by the commission for his behavior. Clay worked himself into such a frenzy that his heart rate registered 120 beats per minute, more than twice its normal rate, and his blood pressure was 200/100. Dr. Alexander Robbins, the chief physician of the Miami Boxing Commission, determined that he was \\"emotionally unbalanced, scared to death, and liable to crack up before he enters the ring.\\" He said if Clay's blood pressure didn't return to normal, the fight would be canceled.The Fight of the Century\\" Ali vs. Frazier, March 8, 1971, Michael Arkush Many others also took Clay's antics to mean that he was terrified. In fact, a local radio station later reported a rumor that he had been spotted at the airport buying a ticket to leave the country.Muhammad Ali: His Life and Times, Thomas Hauser A second examination conducted an hour later revealed Clay's blood pressure and pulse had returned to normal. It had all been an act. Clay later said, \\"Liston's not afraid of me, but he's afraid of a nut.\\" =The fight= Clay weighed in at while Liston was several pounds over his prime fighting weight at . Many of those watching were surprised during the referee's instructions to see that Clay was considerably taller than Liston. While receiving instructions, Liston glowered at Clay, while Clay stared back and stood on his toes to appear even taller. Clay later said of the moment: \\"I won't lie, I was scared ... It frightened me, just knowing how hard he hit. But I didn't have no choice but to go out and fight.\\" At the opening bell, an angry Liston charged Clay, looking to end the fight quickly and decisively. However, Clay's superior speed and movement were immediately evident, as he slipped most of Liston's lunging punches, making the champion look awkward. Clay clearly gained confidence as the round progressed. He hit Liston with a combination that electrified the crowd with about 30 seconds left in the round and began scoring repeatedly with his left jab (the round lasted an extra 8.5 seconds because referee Barney Felix didn't hear the bell). Clay had been hit hard by a right to the stomach, but he said later, \\"I felt good because I knew I could survive.\\" Milt Bailey, one of Liston's cornermen, recalled, \\"In the first round Sonny couldn't catch up with Clay, and I thought we might have some trouble.\\"Hauser, op cit Indeed, it was perhaps the worst round of Liston's career. Between rounds, sitting on his stool, Clay turned to the press contingent at ringside and opened his mouth as if yawning or making a mute roar. Liston settled down somewhat in round two. At one point, he cornered Clay against the ropes and hit him with a hard left hook. Clay later confessed that he was hurt by the punch, but Liston failed to press his advantage. Two of the official scorers awarded the round to Liston and the other had it even. In the third round, Clay began to take control of the fight. At about 30 seconds into the round, he hit Liston with several combinations, causing a bruise under Liston's right eye and a cut under his left, which eventually required eight stitches to close. It was the first time in his career that Liston had been cut. At one point in this attack, Liston was rocked as he was driven to the ropes. Les Keiter, broadcasting at ringside, shouted, \\"This could be the upset of the century!\\" Mort Sharnik described the moment: \\"Cassius hit Liston with a one-two combination; a jab followed by a straight right. Cassius pulled the jab back and there was a mouse underneath Sonny's right eye. Then he pulled the right back and there was a gash underneath the other eye. ... It was like the armor plate of a battleship being pierced. I said to myself, 'My God, Cassius Clay is winning this fight!Muhammad Ali, Thomas Hauser A clearly angered Liston rallied at the end of the round, as Clay seemed tired, and delivered punishing shots to Clay's body. It was probably Liston's best moment in the entire fight. But as the round ended, Clay shouted to him, \\"you big sucka, I got you now\\".interview with Alex Haley in Muhammad Ali by Thomas Hauser, Sitting on his stool between rounds, Liston was breathing heavily as his cornermen worked on his cut. During the fourth round, Clay coasted, keeping his distance and Liston appeared dominant. Joe Louis commenting on TV at ringside said \\"It's looking good for Sonny Liston\\". However, when Clay returned to his corner, he started complaining that there was something burning in his eyes and he could not see. \\"I didn't know what the heck was going on,\\" Angelo Dundee, Clay's trainer, recalled on an NBC special 25 years later. \\"He said, 'cut the gloves off. I want to prove to the world there's dirty work afoot.' And I said, 'whoa, whoa, back up baby. C'mon now, this is for the title, this is the big apple. What are you doing? Sit down!' So I get him down, I get the sponge and I pour the water into his eyes trying to cleanse whatever's there, but before I did that I put my pinkie in his eye and I put it into my eye. It burned like hell. There was something caustic in both eyes.\\" The commotion wasn't lost on referee Barney Felix, who was walking toward Clay's corner. Felix said Clay was seconds from being disqualified. The challenger, his arms held high in surrender, was demanding that the fight be stopped and Dundee, fearing the fight might indeed be halted, gave his charge a one-word order: \\"Run!\\" Clay later said he could only see a faint shadow of Liston during most of the round, but by circling and moving he managed to avoid Liston and somehow survive. By the sixth round, Clay's sight had cleared, and he began landing combinations almost at will. \\"I got back to my stool at the end of the sixth round, and under me I could hear the press like they had gone wild,\\" Clay later said. \\"I twisted round and hollered down at the reporters, 'I'm gonna upset the world. Remnick, King of the World There are two basic narratives about what occurred next in Liston's corner. According to Ali biographer David Remnick, Liston told his cornermen, \\"That's it.\\" This supposedly rallied Liston's handlers, who thought he meant he was finally angry enough to win, but Liston really meant that he was through fighting, which he indicated by spitting out his mouth guard. However, Liston biographer Paul Gallender's take is that Liston's shoulder was essentially paralyzed by the end of round six, and his corner made the decision to end the fight, despite Liston's protests. Liston spit out his mouth guard in disgust, still not believing that Clay was the superior fighter. As the bell sounded for the seventh round, Clay was the first to notice that Liston had spat out his mouth guard. Clay moved to the middle of the ring with his arms raised, dancing the jig that would become known as the \\"Ali Shuffle\\" while Howard Cosell, broadcasting at ringside, shouted \\"wait a minute! Wait a minute! Sonny Liston is not coming out!\\" Liston failed to answer the bell for the seventh round, and Clay was declared the winner by technical knockout. Liston became the first World Champion since Jess Willard in 1919 to retire in his stool during a Heavyweight title fight. At that point the bout was level on the official scorecards of the referee and two judges.Tosches, Nick (2000). The Devil And Sonny Liston. Boston: Little, Brown. .https://sports.ha.com/itm/boxing-collectibles/memorabilia/1964-clay- vs-liston-judges-scorecards-from-miami-beach-bout/a/7115-80073.s Sensing that he had made history, Clay quickly ran to the ropes amidst the commotion in the ring and shouted at sportswriters, \\"Eat your words!\\" In a scene that has been rebroadcast countless times over the ensuing decades, Clay repeatedly yelled \\"I'm the greatest!\\" and \\"I shook up the world.\\" Clay had to be persuaded to hold the traditional post-fight press conference. He called the writers \\"hypocrites\\" and said, \\"Look at me. Not a mark on me. I could never be an underdog. I am too great. Hail the champion!\\"Bob Mee, Ali and Liston On February 27, 1964, Clay announced that he was a member of the Nation of Islam. His membership in the group was first disclosed the previous night at the group's annual national convention in Chicago by Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad. \\"I began worshiping this way five years ago when I heard a fellow named Elijah Muhammad on the radio talking about the virtues of the Islam religion,\\" Clay said. \\"I also listened to his ministers. No one could prove him or them wrong, so I decided to join.\\" Clay started going by the name Cassius X, as members of the organization adopt the last name X because they no longer want to bear names handed down by former slave-owning families. On March 6, 1964, Elijah Muhammad announced in a recorded statement played over the radio that Clay would be renamed Muhammad Ali. Muhammad means \\"worthy of all praises\\", and Ali means \\"most high\\". On March 1, 1964, Ed Sullivan would state on his show: \\"I saw the Liston-Clay fight. This was a stinker of all- time. I swear The Beatles could beat the two of 'em! No kidding!\\" The Beatles had been on The Ed Sullivan Show twice in February. During their second appearance, which aired February 16 from Miami, Sullivan actually had Liston and Joe Louis—who were in the audience—stand up for applause; the group also visited Clay's training center later in the week. =Did Liston's corner deliberately blind Clay?= Many theorized that a substance used on Liston's cuts by Joe Pollino, his cutman, may have inadvertently caused the irritation that blinded Clay in round five. \\"Joe Pollino had used Monsel's Solution on that cut,\\" Angelo Dundee said. \\"Now what had happened was that probably the kid put his forehead leaning in on the guy—because Liston was starting to wear in with those body shots—and my kid, sweating profusely, it went into both eyes.\\" Two days after the fight, heavyweight contender Eddie Machen said he believed that Liston's handlers made deliberate use of illegal medication to temporarily blind Clay. \\"The same thing happened to me when I fought Liston in 1960,\\" Machen said. \\"I thought my eyes would burn out of my head, and Liston seemed to know it would happen.\\" He theorized that Liston's handlers would rub medication on his shoulders, which would then be transferred to his opponent's forehead during clinches and drip into the eyes. \\"Clay did the worst thing when he started screaming and let Liston know it had worked,\\" Machen said. \\"Clay panicked. I didn't do that. I'm more of a seasoned pro, and I hid it from Liston.\\" It is noteworthy that Machen did not mention the eye burning problem immediately after his fight with Liston, citing an injury to his arm as contributing to his defeat.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2209&dat;=19600908&id;=7KsrAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=Rv0FAAAAIBAJ&pg;=7195,633490&hl;=en =Shoulder injury= Liston said he quit the fight because of a shoulder injury, and there has been speculation since about whether the injury was severe enough to actually prevent him from continuing. Immediately after the fight, Liston told broadcasters that he hurt the shoulder in the first round. Dr. Alexander Robbins, chief physician for the Miami Beach Boxing Commission, diagnosed Liston with a torn tendon in his left shoulder. For his book, King of the World: Muhammad Ali and the Rise of an American Hero, David Remnick spoke with one of Liston's cornermen, who told him that Liston could have continued: \\"[The shoulder] was all BS. We had no return bout clause with Clay, and if you say your guy just quit, who is gonna get a return bout. We cooked up that shoulder thing on the spot.\\"David Remnick, King of the World, pg. 202 Sports Illustrated writer Tex Maule wrote that Liston's shoulder injury was legitimate. He cited Liston's inability to lift his arm: \\"There is no doubt that Liston's arm was damaged. In the sixth round, he carried it at belt level so that it was of no help in warding off the right crosses with which Clay probed at the cut under his left eye.\\" He also cited medical evidence: \\"A team of eight doctors inspected Liston's arm at St. Francis Hospital in Miami Beach and agreed that it was too badly damaged for Liston to continue fighting. The torn tendon had bled down into the mass of the biceps, swelling and numbing the arm.\\" Those findings were confirmed in a formal investigation immediately after the fight by Florida State Attorney Richard Gerstein, who also noted that there was little doubt that Liston went into the fight with a sore or lame shoulder.Gallender, Sonny Liston, op cit Despite Liston carrying an injury and being undertrained, Ali stated in 1975 that his first fight with Liston was the toughest of his career.https://www.ibtimes.com/muhammad-alis- toughest-fight-wasnt-against-joe-frazier-2905211 =Allegations of a fix= There were allegations of a fix as soon as the fight ended. Arthur Daley of the New York Times did not believe the claim. He wrote: :When a fight ends in the fashion this one did, with the unbeatable monster remaining in his corner, suspicions of larceny are immediately aroused. They are not helped by the fact that Liston, an ex-convict, was sponsored by mobsters at the start of his career. For the larceny theory to be valid, however, there would have to be an overwhelming reason for it. The prospects of a betting coup can be dismissed because the 8-to-1 odds in Liston's favor never varied more than a point. If there had been a rush of smart money on the underdog, the odds would have plummeted. This is an unfailing barometer of hanky-panky. What would Liston have gained by throwing the fight? The heavyweight championship is the most valuable commodity in the world of sports and not even a man of Liston's criminal background would willingly toss it away. It also brought him an aura of respectability such as he never had known before. After a month-long investigation, Florida State Attorney Richard E. Gerstein said there was no evidence to support the claim of a fix, and a United States Senate subcommittee conducted hearings three months later and also found no evidence of a fix. Documents were released to the Washington Times in 2014 under the Freedom of Information Act which show the FBI suspected the fight may have been fixed by Ash Resnick, a Las Vegas figure tied to organized crime and to Liston. The documents show no evidence that Ali was in on the scheme or even knew about it, and nothing suggests the bureau ever corroborated the suspicions it investigated. The memos were addressed directly to Director J. Edgar Hoover. A memo dated May 24, 1966, which the Washington Times called \\"the most tantalizing evidence,\\" details an interview with a Houston gambler named Barnett Magids, who described to agents his discussions with Resnick before the first Clay-Liston fight. The Washington Times reported: :\\"On one occasion, Resnick introduced Magids to Sonny Liston at the Thunderbird, [one of the Las Vegas hotels organized crime controlled],\\" the memo states. \\"About a week before the Liston and Clay fight in Miami, Resnick called and invited Magids and his wife for two weeks in Florida on Resnick. Magids' wife was not interested in going, but Magids decided to go along, and Resnick was going to send him a ticket. :\\"Two or three days before the fight, Magids called Resnick at the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami to say he could not come,\\" the memo states. \\"On this call, he asked Resnick who he liked in the fight, and Resnick said that Liston would knock Clay out in the second round. Resnick suggested he wait until just before the fight to place any bets because the odds may come down. :\\"At about noon on the day of the fight, [Magids] reached Resnick again by phone, and at this time, Resnick said for him to not make any bets, but just go watch the fight on pay TV and he would know why and that he could not talk further at that time. :\\"Magids did go see the fight on TV and immediately realized that Resnick knew that Liston was going to lose,\\" the document states. \\"A week later, there was an article in Sports Illustrated writing up Resnick as a big loser because of his backing of Liston. Later people 'in the know' in Las Vegas told Magids that Resnick and Liston both reportedly made over $1 million betting against Liston on the fight and that the magazine article was a cover for this.\\" Ron Kantowski of the Las Vegas Review-Journal wrote that the Washington Times article \\"had more holes than the left side of the Cubs' infield.\\" He continued: :Here, then, is the most titillating part of the Washington Times story: \\"At about noon on the day of the fight, (Barnett Magids) reached Resnick again by phone, and at this time, Resnick said for him to not make any bets, but just go watch the fight on pay TV, and he would know why ...\\" :This was after the weigh-in, when Ali went berserk and Sonny just burped up a couple of ... hot dogs. :Is it possible this is why Ash Resnick might have told Barnett Magids—according to Magids—not to make any bets on Liston? :According to a Sports Illustrated story, Resnick lost a lot of money betting on Liston. ... The Washington Times' story suggested ... the magazine story may have been a cover-up, quoting \\"people in the know.\\" :Sometimes in boxing, a guy trains on hot dogs and beer, and then maybe he injures his shoulder. A guy everybody expects to win, doesn't win. And then there are FBI files and conspiracy theories, and then \\"people in the know\\" want to put a guy like Sonny Liston on the grassy knoll with a smoking gun in his hand. Ali vs. Liston II =Background= Following Clay's upset victory over Liston, both fighters were almost immediately embroiled in controversy that was considered detrimental to the sport of boxing. A couple of days after the fight, Clay publicly announced that he had joined the \\"Black Muslims\\"—which was widely viewed as a hate group against white people—and started going by the name Cassius X. The following month, he was renamed Muhammad Ali by Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad. This evoked widespread public condemnation. Martin Luther King Jr. said, \\"When Cassius Clay joined the Black Muslims and started calling himself Cassius X, he became a champion of racial segregation.\\" As for Liston, he was arrested on March 12 and charged with speeding, careless and reckless driving, driving without an operator's license and carrying a concealed weapon. The arresting officer said the former champion was driving between 76 and 80 mph (122–128 kmh) in a residential zone. Liston had a loaded .22 caliber revolver in his coat pocket and there were empty bottles of vodka in the car. A young woman was in the car with Liston, but she was not arrested. In short, at a time when Congress was investigating corruption and organized crime influence in boxing, neither fighter was seen as a poster child for the sport. In the view of some, the unexpected ending of the bout took on suspicious overtones when it was discovered that the two fighters had a contract which contained a rematch clause. Many argued that Liston had more to gain financially from losing the bout and fighting a rematch than he did from winning. The contract gave Inter- Continental Promotions, Inc., a firm organized to promote Liston's fights, the right to promote Ali's first fight as champion—if he should beat Liston—and pick his opponent (Liston, of course). This was in a second contract, kept secret and not part of the main fight contract. It was phrased as it was because the World Boxing Association did not allow fight contracts with rematch clauses. Gordon B. Davidson, an attorney for the group sponsoring Ali, said, \\"We felt we would be better advised not to have a guaranteed rematch clause. We felt this was more in the spirit of the WBA rules than a direct rematch which was clearly outlawed.\\" He agreed that it was \\"subterfuge.\\" When Ali and Liston signed to fight a rematch, the WBA voted unanimously to strip Ali of the title and drop Liston from its rankings. However, the World Boxing Council, the New York State Athletic Commission and The Ring magazine continued to recognize Ali as champion. Pressed by the WBA—which included every U.S. state except California, Nevada and New York—state boxing commissions throughout the nation were reluctant to license a rematch between the two controversial fighters, and it was difficult to find a venue. Ultimately, Massachusetts agreed to host the bout, which resulted in the suspension of the Massachusetts Boxing Commission by the WBA. The fight was set for November 16, 1964, at the Boston Garden. Liston was immediately established as a 13-5 favorite, making Ali a greater betting underdog than Floyd Patterson in his two fights against Liston. This time, Liston trained hard, preparing himself for a 15-round bout. In fact, Time magazine said that Liston had worked himself into the best shape of his career.quoted in Gallender, op cit Ali, for his part, continued to taunt Liston, dragging a bear trap to the pre-fight physical and announcing that he might begin manufacturing the \\"Sonny Liston Sit-Down Stool.\\" However, the Boston fight would never occur. Three days before the scheduled bout (Friday the 13th), Ali needed emergency surgery for a strangulated hernia. The bout would need to be delayed by six months. The new date was set for May 25, 1965. But as it approached, Liston was involved in yet another arrest and there were fears that the promoters were tied to organized crime. Massachusetts officials, most notably Suffolk County District Attorney Garrett H. Byrne, began to have second thoughts. Byrne sought an injunction blocking the fight in Boston because Inter-Continental Promotions was promoting the fight without a Massachusetts license. Inter-Continental said local veteran Sam Silverman was the promoter. On May 7, backers of the rematch ended the court battle by pulling the fight out of Boston. =Lewiston, Maine= The Androscoggin Bank Colisée, in Lewiston, Maine The promoters needed a new location quickly, whatever the size, to rescue their closed circuit television commitment around the country. Governor John H. Reed of Maine stepped forward, and within a few hours, the promoters had a new site: Lewiston, Maine, a mill town with a population of about 41,000 located north of Boston. Inter-Continental obtained a permit and made an arrangement to work with local promoter Sam Michael. The venue selected was the Central Maine Youth Center (now called Androscoggin Bank Colisée), a junior hockey rink. Lewiston was the smallest city to host a heavyweight title bout since Jack Dempsey fought Tom Gibbons in Shelby, Montana (population 3,000) in 1923. It remains the only heavyweight title fight held in the state of Maine. The fight was embraced by the Pine Tree State. Governor Reed announced to the press, \\"This is one of the greatest things to happen in Maine.\\" Nevertheless, it would go down in history as a debacle. The atmosphere surrounding the fight was tense and sometimes ugly, largely due to the repercussions of Ali's public embrace of Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam. Malcolm X, who had a public and bitter falling out with Elijah Muhammad, had been assassinated several months before the fight, and the men arrested for the slaying were members of the Nation of Islam. Rumors circulated that Ali, who had publicly snubbed Malcolm after his break with Elijah Muhammad, might be killed by Malcolm's supporters in retaliation. The FBI took the threats seriously enough to post a 12-man, 24-hour guard around Ali. Liston's camp, in turn, claimed he had received a death threat from the Nation of Islam. The Fruit of Islam—the omnipresent, bow-tied paramilitary wing of the Nation of Islam—surrounding Ali only added to the sense of foreboding and hostility. Security for the fight was, for that time, unprecedented. =The phantom/anchor punch= The ending of the second Ali- Liston fight remains one of the most controversial in boxing history. Midway through the first round, Liston threw a left jab and Ali supposedly went over it with a fast right, knocking the former champion down. Liston went down on his back. He rolled over, got to his right knee and then fell on his back again. Many in attendance did not see Ali deliver the punch. The fight quickly descended into disarray. Referee Jersey Joe Walcott, a former World Heavyweight Champion himself, had a hard time getting Ali to go to a neutral corner. Ali initially stood over his fallen opponent, gesturing and yelling at him, \\"Get up and fight, sucker!\\" and \\"Nobody will believe this!\\"Tosches, Nick (2000). The Devil And Sonny Liston. Boston: Little, Brown. The moment was captured by ringside photographer Neil Leifer in what became one of the most iconic images in sport, chosen as the cover of the Sports Illustrated special issue, \\"The Century's Greatest Sports Photos.\\" Ali then began prancing around the ring with his arms raised in victory. When Walcott got back to Liston and looked at the knockdown timekeeper, Francis McDonough, to pick up the count, Liston had fallen back on the canvas. Walcott never did pick up the count. He said he could not hear McDonough, who did not have a microphone. Also, McDonough did not bang on the canvas or motion a number count with his fingers. McDonough, however, claimed Walcott was looking at the crowd and never at him. After Liston arose, Walcott wiped off his gloves. He then left the fighters to go over to McDonough. \\"The timekeeper was waving both hands and saying, 'I counted him out—the fight is over,'\\" Walcott said after the fight. \\"Nat Fleischer [editor of The Ring] was seated beside McDonough and he was waving his hands, too, saying it was over.\\" Walcott then rushed back to the fighters, who had resumed boxing, and stopped the fight—awarding Ali a first-round knockout victory. The fight ranks as one of the shortest heavyweight title bouts in history. Many in the small crowd had not even settled in their seats when the fight was stopped. The official time of the stoppage was announced as 1:00 into the first round, which was wrong. Liston went down at 1:44, got up at 1:56, and Walcott stopped the fight at 2:12. McDonough and Fleischer were also wrong in their interpretation of how the rules applied. Under the rules, the timekeeper is supposed to start the count at the time of a knockdown. The referee's duty is to get the boxer scoring the knockdown to a neutral corner, pick up the count from the timekeeper and continue it aloud for the knocked down boxer. Under the rules of the Maine Commission, the referee was authorized to stop his count if a boxer refused to go to the proper corner. \\"It might have been better if Walcott had stopped the count (by the knockdown timekeeper) until Clay went to the neutral corner and then started again,\\" said Duncan MacDonald, a commission member. \\"I did my job,\\" Walcott said. \\"He [Ali] looked like a man in a different world. I didn't know what he might do. I thought he might stomp him or pick him up and belt him again.\\" \\"If that bum Clay had gone to a neutral corner instead of running around like a maniac, all the trouble would have been avoided,\\" McDonough said. He acknowledged that Walcott could have asked him to start the count again \\"after he got that wild man—Clay—back to a neutral corner, but he didn't, so that was that.\\" =Was the fight fixed?= When the fight ended, numerous fans booed and started yelling, \\"Fix!\\" Skeptics called the knockout blow \\"the phantom punch.\\" Ali called it \\"the anchor punch.\\" He said it was taught to him by comedian and film actor Stepin Fetchit, who learned it from Jack Johnson. However, Ali was unsure immediately after the fight as to whether or not the punch connected, as footage from the event shows Ali in the ring asking his entourage, \\"Did I hit him?\\" Ali told Nation of Islam minister Abdul Rahman that Liston \\"laid down\\" and Rahman replied, \\"No, you hit him.\\" Rahman later said, \\"Ali hit him so fast, Ali didn't really know he hit him. ... and It took a long time before even he saw the punch he hit Sonny with.\\"HBO Documentary Sonny Liston: The Mysterious Life and Death of a Champion Tellingly, Ali never threw the 'anchor punch' again nor did he subsequently refer to it. After the fight, George Chuvalo climbed through the ropes and shoved Ali, yelling, \\"Fix!\\" He was restrained, but later he said that he had seen Liston's eyes while the challenger was on the floor, and he knew that he was not in bad shape. \\"His eyes were darting from side to side like this,\\" he said, darting his eyes from side to side. \\"When a fighter is hurt his eyes roll up.\\" However, Dr. Carroll L. Witten, former Kentucky State Boxing Commissioner, who had studied the reactions of knocked out fighters, said, \\"Chuvalo is wrong. The side-to-side movement of eyes is commonly associated with temporary unconsciousness and is one of the first things you look for. It is called nystagmus.\\" There were some at ringside who believed the fight was legitimate. Larry Merchant, who was a critic of Liston as a person throughout his career,http://www.boxing.com/little_larry_merchant.htmlhttps://www.si.com/vault/1991/02/04/123527/o-unlucky- man-fortune-never-smiled-on-sonny-liston-even-when-he-was-champ wrote 50 years later, \\"I saw the actual punch land on the actual chin, as did others in my area of the press section. It was a quick right hand that caught Liston as he was coming forward ... According to ringside doctors I've spoken to, that is a classic example of a medulla-oblongata K.O.\\" World Light Heavyweight Champion José Torres said, \\"It was a perfect punch.\\" Jim Murray of the Los Angeles Times wrote that it was \\"no phantom punch.\\" Tex Maule of Sports Illustrated wrote, \\"The blow had so much force it lifted Liston's left foot, upon which most of his weight was resting, well off the canvas.\\" \\"Many people in the arena did not see [the punch], understandably\\", Merchant wrote: \\"Or they couldn't believe that it had the force to knock out the seemingly indestructible former champion\\". He described the belief that the fight was rigged as \\"the apparently unkillable myth ... many people believe that the moon landings were staged, probably right there in Lewiston\\". Slow motion examination of the fight recording shows that the 'punch' that landed was a short grazing right to Liston's cheek and of apparently limited power. Hall of Fame announcer Don Dunphy was one of many who didn't believe the fight was on the level. \\"If that was a punch, I'll eat it,\\" he said. \\"Here was a guy who was in prison and the guards use to beat him over the head with clubs and couldn't knock him down.\\" But others contend that he wasn't the same Liston. Dave Anderson of the New York Times said Liston \\"looked awful\\" in his last workout before the fight. Liston's handlers secretly paid sparring partner Amos Lincoln an extra $100 to take it easy on him. Arthur Daley of the New York Times wrote that Liston's handlers knew he \\"didn't have it anymore.\\" These statements don't accord with the fact that three years later Liston easily knocked out Lincoln within two rounds.http://boxrec.com/media/index.php/Sonny_Liston_vs._Amos_Lincoln One ringside observer, former World Heavyweight Champion James J. Braddock, said the suspect Ali right hand merely finished up what an earlier punch had begun. \\"I have a feeling that this guy (Ali) is a lot better than any of us gave him credit for,\\" Braddock said. \\"It isn't the knockout punch that sticks in my mind as much as a punch he let go (earlier). ... It was a right to Liston's jaw and it shook him to his shoetops. For all we know, it could have been the one that set up the knockout.\\" Another former champion, Rocky Marciano, changed his view about the knockout punch after seeing videotape the next day. \\"I didn't think it was a powerful punch when I saw the fight from ringside,\\" Marciano said. \\"Now (after seeing video) I think Clay, seeing the opening, snapped the punch the last six inches.\\" He added that he still didn't think it was a knockout punch. Dave Anderson said he saw Liston in Las Vegas in 1967 and asked him what happened. \\"It wasn't that hard a punch, but it partially caught me off balance and when I got knocked down, I got mixed up because the referee never gave me a count,\\" Liston said. \\"I was listening for a count. That's the first thing you do, but I never heard a count because Clay never went to a neutral corner.\\" Jerry Izenberg of the Newark Star-Ledger said Liston told him that he lost simply because \\"the timekeeper couldn't count.\\" Mark Kram of Sports Illustrated said Liston told him: \\"That guy [Ali] was crazy. I didn't want anything to do with him. And the Muslims were coming up. Who needed that? So I went down. I wasn't hit.\\" Wilfred Sheed offered his opinion in his 1975 book, Muhammad Ali: A Portrait in Words and Photographs, writing that Liston was going to throw the fight going in and, when he suffered a legitimate flash knockdown in round one, decided on the spot to seize the opportunity and end the fight. It was Walcott's confusion and Ali's behavior that forced Liston to feign disorientation for far longer than a knockdown of that type would have caused. During a 1995 HBO documentary about Liston, Johnny Tocco, who owned a boxing gym in Las Vegas, said he spoke with mobster John Vitale before the rematch and was told not to pay any attention to what he heard about the fight. He also told Tocco that he should be glad that he wasn't going to Lewiston. When Tocco asked why, Vitale told him that the fight was going to end in the first round. During the same documentary, former FBI agent William F. Roemer Jr. said, \\"We learned that there very definitely had been a fix in that fight.\\" He said Bernie Glickman, a boxing manager from Chicago with mob ties, claimed that while he was conversing with Liston and his wife before the fight, Liston's wife told the ex-champion that as long as he had to lose the fight, he should go down early to avoid any chance of getting hurt. In the wake of the controversial fight, there was an outcry by press and politicians for the abolition of boxing. Bills to ban the sport were planned in several state legislatures. A promoter in San Antonio apologized to his theater TV customers and, on the basis that they had been defrauded by a \\"shameful spectacle,\\" donated his take to boys' clubs. The California legislature, in session, received a resolution calling for an investigation by the state attorney general to determine if its closed-circuit viewers had been fraudulently duped out of their money. For those who believe that Liston took a dive, there are a number of theories as to why, including: (1) The Mafia forced Liston to throw the fight as part of a betting coup. (2) Liston bet against himself and took a dive because he owed money to the Mafia. (3) A couple of members of the Nation of Islam visited Liston's training camp and told Liston they would kill him if he won the rematch. (4) Author Paul Gallender claims that members of the Nation of Islam kidnapped Liston's wife, Geraldine, and Liston's son, Bobby. Liston was told to lose the fight to Ali or he would never see his family again. (5) Liston was afraid that he would be accidentally shot by followers of Malcolm X as they tried to kill Ali in the ring. There were also claims attributed to Liston and others that he threw the fight in return for a share of the more marketable Ali's future purses.Shaun Assael. The Murder of Sonny Liston: A Story of Fame, Heroin, Boxing & Las Vegas Pan publisher; 2017. () Credence to these claims is provided by the fact that after his last fight, with Chuck Wepner, Liston seemed more preoccupied in supporting the proposed Ali-Frazier bout and Ali's claims to the title than about his own career.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1873&dat;=19700701&id;=m4gfAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=lcsEAAAAIBAJ&pg;=991,129720&hl;=en In the final analysis, it remains inconclusive whether the blow in Lewiston was a genuine knockout punch.Andrew Vachss, Only Child, p.89, Vintage, 2003. Vachss further explains the way such a fix would have been engineered in Two Trains Running, pp.160–165, 233, Pantheon, 2005. The fact that Liston didn't complain about the clear breach of boxing rules (being declared knocked out without a count) and Ali's obvious state of bewilderment, shouting at Liston \\"Nobody will believe this\\" and asking his handlers \\"Did I hit him?\\" confirmed most people's belief that Liston took a dive.https://sports.ndtv.com/boxing/fifty-years-later-the-mystery-of-muhammad- ali-s-phantom-punch-1500057 Legacy The two bouts launched one man and ruined the other. For Ali, this was the beginning of the Ali mystique: the people's hero confronting seeming impossible odds and insurmountable foes (both inside and outside the ring) only to triumph through his wit, integrity, courage and talent. For Liston, the fights left his reputation in tatters. In just a little over one year, he went from being considered one of the most fearsome heavyweights of all-time to an overrated champion. \\"[After the two Ali fights] Liston would never again intimidate a world-class fighter,\\" wrote Bob Mee, \\"and therefore would never again be the fighter he used to be.\\" Worse, the mysterious circumstances surrounding the end of the second fight probably linked Liston forever to all that was corrupt and suspect in boxing. In reality most of the top ranked heavyweights subsequently avoided the still formidable Liston, using the Lewiston debacle as a welcome excuse to not have to face him. He was still a top ranked fighter by the time of his death, having won 15 of his last 16 bouts, 14 by knockout.The Devil And Sonny Liston. Boston: Little, Brown. Recent attempts to introduce more balance and fairness in understanding Liston's career and life have faced a stiff challenge posed by the final 30 seconds of the second fight in Lewiston, Maine, in 1965. However Ring Magazine ranked Liston as the tenth greatest heavyweight of all time, while boxing writer Herb Goldman ranked him second and Sports Illustrated placed him third.http://m-baer.narod.ru/top/goldmane.htmhttps://www.si.com/more- sports/photos/2009/11/18-1top-10-all-time-greatest-heavyweights Alfie Potts Harmer in The Sportster ranked him the sixth greatest ever boxer at any weight.https://www.thesportster.com/entertainment/top-25-greatest-boxers-of- all-time/ In his book, The Gods of War, Springs Toledo argued that Liston, when at his peak in the late 1950s and early 1960s, could be favored to beat just about every heavyweight champion in the modern era with the possible exception of Muhammad Ali.http://www.boxing.com/book_review_the_gods_of_war_by_springs_toledo.html This view is shared by boxing writer Frank Lotierzo who ranks Liston as one of the top 5 heavyweights of all time and possibly the best.https://tss.ib.tv/boxing/featured-boxing-articles-boxing-news-videos- rankings-and-results/15122-lotierzos-lowdown-sonny-liston-the-most-underrated- heavyweight-champ-in-history Liston and Ali were both inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame. Ali vs. Liston in popular culture Calypsonian Lord Melody recorded a song entitled \\"Clay Vs Liston\\", which was released as a single in 1965. The song's lyrics deal with the first fight between the two. The song appeared on the 1994 CD compilation Precious Melodies. Ali, a movie by director Michael Mann, was released in 2001. Will Smith was nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for his portrayal of Ali. Former boxer Michael Bentt played Liston. Robert Townsend directed a 2008 movie about Liston entitled Phantom Punch. Ving Rhames starred as Liston, and Andrew Hinkson portrayed Ali. A wax model of Liston appears in the front row of the iconic sleeve cover of The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. He is seen in the far left part of the row, wearing a white and gold robe, standing beside the original-look Beatle wax figures.The Art of the Beatles, Mike Evans, Ed. Anthony Blond (Muller, Blond & White), United Kingdom, 1984, , p. 69-70. As a homage to Sonny Liston, a bronze copy of a marble statue made by Alfred Hrdlicka in 1963/64 was put up in 2008 between Old Castle and Karlsplatz in downtown Stuttgart, Germany.Stuttgarter Amtsblatt No. 9, 1 March 2018, p. 8 In NCIS, director Leon Vance, a former boxer, has a framed photo in his office of Ali gloating over the floored Liston at the end of the second fight. In \\"Last Man Standing\\", he discusses the photo with Gibbs and mentions the fixing allegations. A play entitled One Night In Miami opened in 2013. It tells the story of the night Ali—then Cassius Clay—beat Liston to take the World Heavyweight Championship. It takes place in a hotel room after the fight where Clay, Jim Brown, Sam Cooke and Malcolm X talk about their lives and their hopes for the future. The Mad Men episode \\"The Suitcase\\" from Season 4 revolves around the second fight. The outcome actually inspires Don Draper to create a commercial inspired by the famous photo from the fight.

Plot introduction Kate Telman is a 'level 3' executive in the Business, a vast business empire. During her sabbatical year, she comes to suspect that some of her colleagues are stealing from the organisation, and investigates. Plot summary The book starts with a 4:37 a.m. phone call from Mike Daniels to Kathryn (Kate) Telman. He has been drugged, and about half of his teeth randomly and expertly extracted, just before an important meeting in Japan. The Business is a powerful (yet democratic) multinational commercial organisation, secretive (but not too sinisterly so), and very long-lived. It predates the Roman Catholic Church, and descends from a consortium of merchants in the Roman Empire which it even owned for sixty-six days (it hired a man to become emperor, but he lasted less than a month before being assassinated; a reference to the Emperor Didius Julianus). It is now considering taking over a country in order to gain a seat at the United Nations. The story follows the heroine, Kate Telman, who is 38 and lusts after Stephen Buzetski, who is married. Starting from poverty, she has risen through the Business under the tutelage of her mentor, who adopted her at an early age, and her 'uncle Freddy', the man who invented the portable milk container (named the \\"chilp\\"). She is investigating a possible case of someone stealing from the company, starting with strange happenings at a silicon chip manufacturing plant. Although she discovers evidence of wrongdoing at a high level in the Business, she continues to believe in what they are doing as an organisation. She travels the world, at one point being summoned by a weapon- collecting higher-up in Nebraska to talk his nephew out of writing an incendiary anti-Islamic screenplay. A scene of the book takes place on a ship on its way to be broken up at a shipyard in Sonmiani Bay. She has several telephone conversations with her therapy-damaged friend Luce in California, who provides a cynical, suspicious, foul-mouthed counterpoint to Kate's goodheartedness. She is given a DVD of Stephen's wife having extramarital sex in an attempt to influence her. She also becomes involved in the acquisition of the small Himalayan country of Thulahn. Small and underdeveloped, bleak and vulnerable, the football pitch doubles as the airport, \\"the royal palace is heated by yak dung\\" and the \\"national sport is emigration\\". It resembles an exaggerated version of Bhutan. Under the Business's plan, Thulahn would be utterly changed, if not destroyed, and its people thrust into the modern world. Kate is given the job of negotiating with Thulahn's Crown Prince Suvinder Dzung, who when he last met her had fallen in love with her. Literary significance and criticism The Business has been described as a science fiction book set in the present day. Part of Kate's job is to keep up to date with current technological developments, and Banks mentions many contemporary gadgets. Cars in particular (Freddy has a fine collection of vintage ones), and technology in general, are celebrated and described in detail here. References to DVD technology and flying on Concorde combine to date this book to a very narrow period. (In this it is like Dead Air.) At one point, Telman tortures a Ferrari 355's engine to force a villain to confess, and he rents an Audi A3. Kate's gradual falling in love with the place she is tasked to change beyond recognition is reminiscent of the 1983 film Local Hero.

History  Like the main UP party, the UJP was severely persecuted by the agents of drug lords, paramilitaries and rogue elements inside the Colombian military during the 1980s. Many left-wing groups in Colombia have denounced the extermination of the UP and the UJP as part of a politically motivated strategy emanating from powerful sectors of Colombian society, including drug lords and some members of the traditional socioeconomic elites, which would have counted with the passive or active collaboration of several officers within the Colombian military and allegedly the indifference or tacit approval from contemporary administrations, in particular that of Virgilio Barco Vargas. No proven direct links between the murders of UP members and high- ranking Colombian officials have been uncovered, though there is some documented evidence of the existence of organized meetings concerning the subject of the UP between drug lords, paramilitaries and lower-to-medium ranking military individuals at the time. Several drug mafia or paramilitary hitmen and lower-ranking military officials which directly cooperated with illegal death squads at the time were prosecuted for some of the killings, though the vast majority of the cases have remained unresolved. Among the few intellectual co-authors of the extermination campaign which have been identified with a relatively clear degree of certainty are drug lords (such as José Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha) and paramilitary leaders (such as Carlos Castaño Gil, by his own admission).

The castle was built by the knight Dirc Loef van Horne (hence \\"Loef's stein\\" (stone) house) between 1357 and 1397. Until World War II Loevestein Castle was part of the Hollandic Water Line, the main Dutch defense line that was based on flooding an area of land south and east of the western provinces. Currently the castle is used as a medieval museum and function centre. History Aerial view of Loevestein Castle. Loevestein is a water castle that was built between 1357 and 1368. It was built in a strategic location in the middle of the Netherlands, where the Maas and Waal rivers come together (just west of current day villages of Poederoijen and Brakel, in the municipality of Zaltbommel, in Gelderland). At first it was a simple square brick building, used to charge toll from trading vessels using the rivers. By 1372, the castle was under control of the Counts of Holland. In the 16th century (around 1575, orders given by William the Silent) it was expanded to a larger fortress surrounded by earthen fortifications with two (later three) stone bastions on the northern side, two moats, an arsenal, and housing for a commander and soldiers. The Castle was also part of the Hollandic Water Line. It changed hands twice between the Northern Dutch and the Spanish during the Eighty Years' War: on December 9, 1570, it was taken by the Geuzen; ten days later by the Spanish again; and on June 25, 1572, it was retaken by the Dutch. From 1619 the castle became a prison for political prisoners. One famous inmate was the eminent lawyer, poet and politician Hugo de Groot (Hugo Grotius) often presented as the \\"father of modern international law\\", who was serving a controversially imposed life sentence from 1619. In 1621, his wife Maria van Reigersberch, who was also staying at the castle, hid with him in a book chest that was regularly brought for them. He subsequently became the Swedish Ambassador to France for 10 years. Another high-profile inmate was the English Vice-Admiral George Ayscue. In literature In Alexandre Dumas, père's novel La Tulipe Noire, the main character Cornelius Van Baerle is imprisoned at Loevestein.

Set Computer fan control Fan control is the management of the rotational speed of an electric fan. In computers, various types of computer fans are used to provide adequate cooling, and different fan control mechanisms balance their cooling capacities and noise they generate. This is commonly accomplished by the motherboards having hardware monitoring circuitry, which can be configured by the end-user through BIOS or other software to perform fan control.  Need for fan control  As modern PCs grow more powerful so do their requirements for electrical power. Computers emit this electrical power as heat generated by all major components. Heat production varies with system load, where periods of compute-intensive activity generate much more heat than the idle time does. Processors in most early x86-based computers, up to some of the early 486s, did not need active ventilation. Power supplies needed forced cooling, and power supply fans also circulated cooling air through the rest of the PC with the ATX standard. The byproduct of increased heat generation is that the fan(s) need to move increasing amounts of air and thus need to be more powerful. Since they must move more air through the same area of space, fans will become more noisy. Fans installed in a PC case can produce noise levels of up to 70 dB. Since fan noise increases with the fifth power of the fan rotation speed, reducing revolutions per minute (RPM) by a small amount potentially means a large reduction in fan noise. This must be done cautiously, as excessive reduction in speed may cause components to overheat and be damaged. If done properly fan noise can be drastically reduced.  Fan connectors  The common cooling fans used in computers use standardized connectors with two to four pins. The first two pins are always used to deliver power to the fan motor, while the rest can be optional, depending on fan design and type: * Ground common ground * Vcc (Power) nominally a +12 V supply, though it may be variable depending on fan type and desired fan rotation speed * Sense (or tachometer) output from fan outputs a signal that pulses twice for each revolution of the fan as a pulse train, with the signal frequency proportional to the fan speed * Control input a pulse-width modulation (PWM) input signal, used when the cooling fan assembly has an internal motor driver circuit. Fan assemblies with this control input provide the ability to adjust the rotational speed of the fan without changing the input voltage delivered to the cooling fan assembly. A variable rotation speed allows the cooling rate to be adjusted to meet demand, quietening the fan and saving energy when full speed is not required. The color of the wires connected to these pins varies depending on the number of connectors, but the role of each pin is standardized and guaranteed to be the same on any system. Cooling fans equipped with either two- or three-pin connectors are usually designed to accept a wide range of input voltages, which directly affects the rotation speed of the blades.  Types of control  = Thermostatic = In this style of fan control, the fan is either on or off. Temperature inside the chassis is checked, and if an outside-of-range temperature is detected, fans are set to their maximum speed. When the temperature drops below a threshold again, the fans are turned back off. This control method reduces noise issues and power requirements during periods of low usage, but when the system is operating at capacity, the fan noise can become a problem again. = Linear voltage regulation = A standard cooling fan is essentially a bladed DC motor. By varying the voltage input across the acceptable range for a fan, the speed of the fan will increase (to added voltage) and decrease (to reduced voltage); a faster fan means more air moved and thus a higher heat exchange rate. There are a few ways to perform this regulation, as described below.  Resistors  Resistors in series with a fan's power pin are the simplest method of reducing fan noise, but they add to the heat generated inside the computer case. Since the voltage drop is proportional to the current, the fan may not start. They need to be of the appropriate power rating. For variable fan control, potentiometers could be used along with a transistor such as a MOSFET whose output voltage is controlled by the potentiometer. It is possible to use a rheostat instead.  Diodes  A diode in series with the fan will reduce the voltage being output to the fan. A silicon diode provides a relatively constant voltage drop of about 0.7 V per diode; data sheets for a specific diode specify its voltage drop, for example the 1N4001 silicon diode's voltage drop varies from approximately 0.7 to 0.9 V as the current varies from 0.01 to 1 A.http://www.diodes.com/datasheets/ds28002.pdf The power rating should be noted and some diodes may require cooling to operate at their rated current. The voltage drop across the diode will fall with temperature, causing the fan to speed up. Like other series regulators, the diode will dissipate power equal to its voltage drop times the current passing through it.  Voltage modification (\\"volt modding\\")  The voltage a computer cooling fan receives is defined by the difference between the voltage wire (+12 V) and the ground wire (+0 V). By connecting one or both wires to a different voltage, the voltage the fan receives will be different from the default 12 V the fan was designed for. Increasing the voltageOverspin Your Fans over the default 12 V can be achieved by e.g. connecting the −12 V or −5 V power line instead of the ground wire in the fan connector, and by connecting the 5 V power line in the +12 V input of the fan connector. Through this procedure, 10, 17 and 24 V voltages can be achieved, with voltages exceeding 12 V being potentially damaging to the computer fans rated at 12 V. However, the combination of modern power supplies no longer being required to provide a −5 V power line and the limited power delivery capability of the −12 V line (usually less than 1 A of current) reduces the total capacity for volt modded fans in modern systems. The safest method of volt modding is connecting the +5 V power line to the +12 V input of the fan, which reduces the voltage the fan receives to +5 V. Some fans will not work at such low voltage at all, while some other fans may run at +5 V once they have started rotating at a reasonable speed. Another method of reducing the fan speedGet 12V, 7V or 5V for your Fans is by moving the 5 V wire in the classical Molex power connector in the place of the Ground wire going to the fan, thereby delivering +7 V (12 V − 5 V = 7 V) to the fan. However, this is a potentially risky method, because +5 V PSU line is intended to source current only, not sink it, so the PSU is likely to get damaged in case of load on 5 V PSU line being below the load generated by 7 V fans (e.g. when PC enters idle/sleep state). Also, the components inside the computer using +5 V power might be exposed to over 5 V in case of a short circuit in the fan.  Integrated or discrete linear regulators  SMSC EMC2102 rotational-speed-based fan controller with hardware thermal shutdown Common voltage regulator ICs like the popular LM78xx series are sometimes used to provide variable or constant voltage to fans. When thermally bonded to the computer's chassis, one of these ICs can provide up to 1 A of current at a voltage of 6, 8, 9 or 10 V for the LM7806, LM7808, LM7809 and LM7810, respectively. Adjustable versions like the popular LM317 also exist; when combined with a potentiometer, these adjustable regulators allow the user to vary the fan speed of several fans at currents far in excess of what a standard potentiometer could handle. For higher currents, discrete linear regulators are relatively simple to construct using a power transistor or MOSFET and a small signal transistor or a Zener diode as a voltage reference. While discrete regulators require additional components (a minimum of two transistors, three resistors and a small capacitor), they allow for arbitrarily high currents, allowing for the regulation of additional fans and accessories. As with other linear regulators, the waste heat that is produced will be roughly . = Pulse-width modulation = Pulse-width modulation (PWM) is a common method of controlling computer fans. A PWM-capable fan is usually connected to a 4-pin connector (pinout: Ground, +12 V, sense, control). The sense pin is used to relay the rotation speed of the fan and the control pin is an open-drain or open-collector output, which requires a pull-up to 5 V or 3.3 V in the fan. Unlike linear voltage regulation, where the fan voltage is proportional to the speed, the fan is driven with a constant supply voltage; the speed control is performed by the fan based on the control signal. The control signal is a square wave operating at 25 kHz, with the duty cycle determining the fan speed. 25kHz is used to raise the sound of the signal above the range of human hearing; use of a lower frequency could produce an audible hum or whine. Typically a fan can be driven between about 30% and 100% of the rated fan speed, using a signal with up to 100% duty cycle. The exact speed behavior (linear, off until a threshold value, or a minimum speed until a threshold) at low control levels is manufacturer dependent. Many motherboards feature firmware and software that regulates these fans based on processor and computer case temperatures. = Fan speed controllers = A fan controller with LEDs indicating fan status and potentiometers and switches to control fan speeds Another method, popular with gamers, is the manual fan speed controller. They can be mounted in an expansion slot or a 5.25\\" or 3.5\\" drive bay or come built into a computer's case. Using switches or knobs, attached fans can have their speeds adjusted by one of the above methods.  Hardware  Most modern motherboards feature hardware monitoring chips, which are capable of performing fan control, usually through the PWM method as described above. These chips can be configured through BIOS, or by using specialised software once the operating system has booted. Processors produce varying levels of heat depending on system load, thus it makes sense to reduce the speed of the fans during idle to decrease the noise produced by fans running full speed, until the load does goes up, at which point fan speed must be adjusted promptly to avoid overheating. Modern hardware monitor chips, once configured, are capable of independently running this monitoring loop without any need for a functioning BIOS or an operating system. This automatic control offered by some chips may be called Thermal Cruise mode for maintaining a thermal envelope, as well as Fan Speed Cruise mode for maintaining a specific fan speed automatically. However, not all software is capable of accessing these advanced configuration parameters provided by some chips, and it is very common that the generic software implements only the most basic interfacing with the chips, namely, an explicit setting for the duty cycle for each fan control setting, subsequently performing the duty cycle adjustments itself in software, and thus requiring that both the operating system, as well as this third-party software itself to continue running on the main CPU to perform the monitoring loop. This may not be a problem until the system or the utility crashes, at which point the system may overheat due to the failure of the fans to maintain adequate cooling whilst running at reduced voltage and speed.  Software  The method by which the software physically controls the fan is usually PWM (see above). Many companies now provide software to control fan speeds on their motherboards under Microsoft Windows or Mac OS X/MacOS. * AOpen motherboards can use \\"SilentTEK\\". * ASUS motherboards can use \\"Fan Xpert\\" or \\"Thermal Radar\\" * MSI motherboards can use \\"Core Center\\". * Universal abit motherboards can use \\"μGuru\\". * Gigabyte motherboards can use \\"EasyTune 6\\". * Intel desktop boards (older socket 478, etc.) use \\"Active Monitor\\" and \\"Desktop Control Centre\\". * Intel desktop boards (newer socket 775, etc.) use \\"Desktop Utilities\\". * Dell laptops can use \\"i8kutils\\". * Lenovo ThinkPad notebooks can use the freeware \\"TPFanControl\\". * Lenovo ThinkPads running FreeBSD can use the \`fan_level\` sysctl of the \`acpi_ibm\` driver. * Lenovo ThinkPads running DragonFly BSD can use the \`fan_level\` sysctl of the \`acpi_thinkpad\` driver. * Macintosh computers can use Fan Control. * Computers running Linux can use lm_sensors. * Computers running OpenBSD or DragonFly BSD with hw.sensors patch for fan-control applied.

The serial was written by Liverpudlian playwright Alan Bleasdale, as a sequel to a television play titled The Black Stuff. The British Film Institute described it as a \\"seminal drama series... a warm, humorous but ultimately tragic look at the way economics affect ordinary people… TV's most complete dramatic response to the Thatcher era and as a lament to the end of a male, working class British culture.\\"  The Black Stuff  The television play The Black Stuff was originally written by Bleasdale and directed by Jim Goddard for BBC1's Play for Today anthology series in 1978. After filming however, the play was not transmitted until 2 January 1980.The Black Stuff (1980) (TV) – Release dates It concerned a group of Liverpudlian tarmac layers (hence the slang for tarmac: 'the black stuff') on a job near Middlesbrough. The acclaim that The Black Stuff received on its eventual transmission led to the commissioning of the sequel serial, of which Bleasdale had already written a considerable amount.  Boys from the Blackstuff  Bernard Hill as Yosser Hughes The series Boys from the Blackstuff follows the stories of the five now-unemployed men who lost their jobs following the events of the original play The Black Stuff. Set in Bleasdale's home city of Liverpool, and reflecting many of his own experiences of life in the city, each episode focuses on a different member of the group. The series was highly acclaimed for its powerful and emotional depiction of the desperation wrought by high unemployment and a subsequent lack of social support. Although Bleasdale wrote most of the episodes before Margaret Thatcher came to power, the series was noted by many reviewers as a critique of the Thatcher era, which was seen as being responsible for the fate of many of the unemployed working-class, particularly in the North of England. By early 1982, unemployment had reached 3,000,000 people (some one-eighth of the workforce) as a result of economic recession and restructuring of industry. The character of Yosser Hughes was widely discussed. He was a man driven to the edge of his sanity by the loss of his job, his wife, the authorities' continued attempts to take his children away from him and his constant attempts at salvaging his male pride (often being the main give-away of his insecurity). His catchphrases, \\"Gizza' job!\\" (\\"give us a job\\") and \\"I can do that!\\" became part of the popular consciousness of the Eighties, summing up the mood of many who sought desperately for work during the era. Hughes was played by Bernard Hill, who uses his Mancunian accent, with slight Scouse vocal mannerisms. The serial also helped to establish the career of Julie Walters, who played the most prominent female role as Angie, the wife of Chrissie, played by Michael Angelis. The serial was made by the English Regions Drama department based at BBC Birmingham and was shot on location in Liverpool. The producer was Michael Wearing, who was based at Birmingham with a specific remit to make \\"regional drama\\", and who would later be instrumental in bringing the BBC's drama serials Edge of Darkness (1985) and Our Friends in the North (1996) to the screens. The writer Alan Bleasdale went on to write the scripts for The Monocled Mutineer (BBC1, 1986) and G.B.H. (Channel 4, 1991)  Reception  The series was so successful upon its original broadcast that only nine weeks after it had finished transmission, it was re-shown on the higher-profile BBC1. It was also transmitted again on BBC2 as part of that station's twenty- fifth anniversary season in 1989. In 1983 it won the British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Serial, and in 2000 was placed seventh in a British Film Institute poll of industry professionals on the best television programmes of the 20th century. It was also named as one of the forty greatest television shows in a 2003 list compiled by the Radio Times magazine's chief television writer Alison Graham. In March 2007, Channel 4 broadcast a \\"Top 50 Dramas\\" programme, based on input from industry professionals rather than the public, which had Boys from the Blackstuff at number two.  Episodes  =The Black Stuff= The Black Stuff was the original television play directed by Jim Goddard and is the precursor to the 1982 Boys from the Blackstuff series. The main characters Yosser, Loggo, Chrissie, George, Dixie and his son, Kevin, were introduced in it. It follows the group as they set off from Liverpool to undertake a casual tarmac laying job on a new housing development in Middlesbrough. The episode was produced in 1978 but was not broadcast until 1980. Along the way at a motorway service station, the group encounter a female student (Janine Duvitski) who hitch-hikes a lift to Leeds. Part of the group (particularly Yosser) mocks her, but Yosser's insecurity and unwillingness to be dominated by women is especially manifested after she taunts him when she is dropped off. In Middlesbrough, the group are approached by two Irish gypsies, Brendan and Dominic, who offer them the chance of a side job, claiming that they had been laid off. Although initially uneasy with the idea of working with them, the group (except group leader, Dixie and his son, Kevin), spurred by Yosser's dream of fleecing the gypsies and starting their own tarmac laying business, agree to invest vast amounts of their own savings to undertake the 'foreign' job. The group manager, McKenna, later discovers this and fires them all. However, despite being convinced that they had made the right decision, the group are nonetheless outsmarted by the gypsies who pretend they have been given a cheque (when in fact they had been paid cash) and claiming they would get the cheque cashed at a bank. Chrissie agrees to accompany Brendan in Brendan's van (who later manages to lose Chrissie by tricking him into pushing the van so as to jump-start it after pretending it had broken down), while Yosser decides to hold Dominic hostage until they return. Yosser soon discovers that cash had in fact been handed over, but Dominic manages to escape to Brendan who is waiting for him – Loggo tripping and tumbling over as he gave chase through a farmer's field. Yosser speeds off in the group's own van and gives chase to Brendan and Dominic, who attempts to puncture Yosser's tyres by smashing empty milk bottles on the road from the back of the van. Yosser swerves and avoids them, but runs out of petrol, shouting and venting his anger by bashing his head on the steering wheel. He finds a can of petrol in the back of the van, partly refuels and sets off in vain to find the pair, before giving up on a roundabout, bringing traffic on it to a halt and breaking down in tears, ignoring the tailback and horns being blown behind him. He returns to the group after stopping by where he had abandoned a number of items from the van, headbutting a man he believes to be an Irish gypsy and kicking his companion to the ground, who protests he is neither a gypsy nor Irish and was \\"just hitching a lift\\". Yosser is clearly distressed upon his return to the group and begins to smash the tarmac they had laid with a pickaxe, but is restrained by Loggo and Chrissie before knocking Chrissie to the ground for his optimistic outlook despite what has happened. Yosser launches an emotional monologue about wanting to be rich, noticed and seen, and is clearly close to breaking point, to the extent that Loggo and George continue to restrain him from further attacking Chrissie who is on the floor with a bleeding nose. George reassures Yosser and gently advises him to grow up, but Yosser is unconvinced and kicks the grille of the van. The episode ends with the group, almost penniless, arriving at the Tees Transporter Bridge. A man whom they met earlier is on his way to Shetland to undertake a casual job there, and Loggo promptly chooses to join him. The episode finishes with a long-distance shot of the Tees Transporter Bridge and the opening theme song, sung by the cast, is played over the end credits. =The Muscle Market= Shown in 1981 as a standalone between the initial drama and the subsequent series, it centres on Danny Duggan (played by Pete Postlethwaite), the building boss who employs people cheaply by being complicit in the social security fraud of his employees and therefore guilty of a crime himself. =Jobs for the Boys= Featuring most of the characters from the initial drama. They take a cash-in-hand job on a building site whilst still claiming unemployment benefit. Typical of the show's humour, it is later revealed that the building being renovated is going to be used by the Department of Employment. They are followed by the authorities and Snowy Malone, a plasterer, falls to his death trying to flee during a subsequent raid by the \\"sniffers\\" (social security officers working undercover). =Moonlighter= Follows Dixie Dean (Tom Georgeson) in his new position as a security guard, where he is strongarmed into accepting bribes for allowing the removal of goods under his charge in a docked ship. Apart from Dixie's son Kevin this episode also features Chrissie, Loggo and George, the other members of the original gang, during a scene prior to Snowy Malone's (Chris Darwin) funeral. =Shop Thy Neighbour= Concentrates on Chrissie (Michael Angelis) and the domestic pressure that unemployment and the attentions of the benefit fraud officers place on him and his wife (Julie Walters). It also features his closest friend, Loggo (Alan Igbon), who is least affected by the social climate. At the end of the episode, in an act of desperation, lacking money and food, Chrissie is driven to strangle and shoot his geese in an attempt to provide dinner. He also worries about his children's rabbits. = Yosser's Story = This is the most widely discussed episode of the series, following Yosser's struggle to avoid losing his children (who are played by Alan Bleasdale's own children) to the authorities as his mental health disintegrates. It is also the only one of the series shot on 16mm film, as opposed to videotape, although the original play was also shot on this format. Graeme Souness and Sammy Lee, then of Liverpool F.C. make cameo appearances in this episode. The episode contains the often repeated scene in which Yosser goes to confession looking for help, and tells the priest he is desperate. The priest, trying to comfort Yosser, tells him \\"Call me Dan – Dan\\"; to which Yosser replies \\"I'm desperate, Dan\\". = George's Last Ride = This episode reveals something of George's (Peter Kerrigan) politically active past. His trip (Chrissie wheeling him in his chair through the docks) leads him to reminisce about his younger days, the contrast between his recalled hopeful youth with the abandoned industrial infrastructure around him is marked. The death of George causes the main characters to be reunited if, in some cases, only briefly. The episode concludes with a surreal scene at the Green Man pub in Liverpool.  DVD release  The series, including the original play The Black Stuff but without the episode The Muscle Market, was released on DVD as a three-disc set by BBC Worldwide in 2003. A counterpart for the series is the book Boys from the Blackstuff, the making of TV drama, by Bob Millington and Robin Nelson.

It debuted in 1974 and was originally based on the engineering concept of the Volkswagen Golf Mk1, and is applicable to either front- or four-wheel drive vehicles, using only front- mounted transverse engines. Volkswagens based on this platform have been referred to by generation number, i.e. the first Golf version would be referred to as an \\"A1 Golf\\". Often \\"\\" () is substituted for \\"A*\\", but this can be For example, the Sciroccos are both based on the A1 platform. Under Volkswagen's revised platform naming system, the \\"A4\\" platform is now known as the PQ34 platform, and what would have been called the A5 platform is officially the PQ35 platform. The new nomenclature is derived as follows: *P indicates a passenger car platform *Q (quer) indicates a transverse engine *3 indicates the platform size or class *5 indicates the evolution or generation The A platforms have been replaced by the MQB platform. A1 The A1 platform debuted on the MK1 Golf on its launch in 1974, and continued into the early 1990s, when the last remaining models using the platform - the Scirocco and Caddy - were axed.

The Volkswagen Passat B3 was based on a stretched A2 platform. The Volkswagen Corrado VR6, while being an A2 platform car, uses some components from the A3 platform, notably the rear suspension assembly and some front suspension parts.

JB Hi-Fi has since relocated to level 4. Macquarie Centre is a large shopping centre in the suburb of Macquarie Park in the Northern Suburbs of Sydney and is located opposite the main campus of Macquarie University.  Transport  The Metro North West Line offer frequent services to Macquarie University station directly next to Macquarie Centre with trains running from Tallawong to Chatswood. Macquarie Centre has bus connections to the Sydney CBD, North Shore and Northern Sydney, as well as local surrounding suburbs. It is served by State Transit, Transit Systems, Transdev NSW and Hillsbus. The majority of its bus services are located in Herring Road in front of the shopping centre's main entrance. Macquarie Centre also has multi level car parks with 4,900 spaces. History In the 1968 Grace Bros. purchased 16 acres of land in North Ryde with plans to build a $12 million shopping centre. Rival department store David Jones had shown interest in the area and developed plans with Hooker Investment Corporation (now LJ Hooker) to build their own shopping centre known as Garden City at Epping Road, Macquarie Park on what was industrial land. David Jones had difficulty seeking approval with the plans rejected by Ryde Municipal Council and they were forced to lodge their plans with the State Planning Authority. Garden City was designed by Donald Crone, one of the leading architects who had designed the Sydney Tower. The plans included 80 speciality stores, an office tower and a distribution centre which would replace the one at Alexandria. The initial development application made by Grace Bros was not approved by council and instead lodged with SPA which was later rejected. Grace Bros unturned submitted a further appeal with the support of three town planners. In 1969 Grace Bros purchased further land and by November 1969, the State Government approved the Grace Bros proposal while David Jones proposal on zoning grounds was rejected. Throughout the 1970s Grace Bros barely opened a store with the Macquarie store set to be their first full-line store in over a decade. Work began in March 1979 on the 9.4 hectare site adjoining the university when the AMP Society agreed to become the majority shareholder and provide greater share of the finance for the $80 million shopping centre. Throughout the construction period the centre had faced industrial disputes with the Industrial Commission awarding $24 over their awards in November 1979 as major site allowance. After further problems arose workers were offered $1000 in shopping vouchers depending on their qualification level. Further disputes continued with the demand for an additional $40 a week increase which was rejected and by July 1981 only a third of the required workforce were on the job. Macquarie Centre had originally planned to open in Easter 1981 however it was delayed to September and then delayed again to November. The delays had a devastating impact on small retailers who had stocked up for opening deadlines. Macquarie Centre officially opened on 17 November 1981 by then premier of New South Wales Neville Wran. The centre featured an Olympic sized ice rink, Grace Bros (rebranded to Myer in 2004), Big W, Target, Woolworths and 130 speciality stores. Macquarie Centre was the third centre in Sydney to facilitate an \\"incline mall\\" design (after Westfield Burwood and Westfield Hurstville) and was built on a spiral staircase around the sundial water fountain. This meant that it is a gently-ascending grade and that the levels were connected via a system of ramps, stairs and escalators. Franklins Big Fresh was added to the centre in 1992 and was renamed to Franklins in 2001 and operated until its closure in 2012. Macquarie Ice Rink is home to Sydney Bears and Sydney Ice Dogs ice hockey teams. The ice rink is used for ice skating, ice dance, speed skating and ice hockey. Macquarie Centre is the only shopping centre in Sydney to provide a full size Olympic rink (60m x 30m) with seating for approximately 2000 people. Macquarie Ice Rink was used for the 1991 World short track speed skating Championships.Smart, G. & Bradbury, S., Steven Bradbury: Last Man Standing, , 2005. There were plans for a cinema complex to open in the centre in 1981 however it had fallen through and it was not until September 1994 when the eight screen Greater Union multiplex and leisure precinct opened on the rooftop level. In 2000 the 'Escape' and 'Loft' areas were opened, which included a major facelift in 1999 to the centre's entrances, extra parking and new retail stores. These included Borders (second store in Australia), BaySwiss, Dick Smith Powerhouse, Freedom and Wheel & Barrow. The Loft was designed as a home wares precinct. This development also included new food outlets and an expansion of the Greater Union cinema complex, from 8 to 16 cinemas. Greater Union was renamed to Event Cinemas in 2009. In 2010, Fitness First opened on the space vacated by Freedom and JB Hi- Fi moved from the location on level 2 to the space vacated by Borders on level 4. AMP Wholesale Shopping Centre Fund No. 2 wholly owns the centre after an ownership agreement was reached with former co-owner Westfield Management Limited in 2012.  Recent development  In late 2012, AMP Capital Shopping Centres began work on the $440 million redevelopment. Stage 1 of the redevelopment was completed in 17 July 2014 with the opening of Coles, Aldi and the fresh food market. Stage 2 of the redevelopment was completed in October 2014, adding an entire new wing to the existing centre. Stage 2 consisted of: * A full line David Jones * A new 2 level mall linking the new David Jones with the existing centre and Myer * Approximately 130 new retail stores (including Sydney's first H&M;, Zara, Uniqlo and Sephora) * Additional 1,050 car spaces As a result, Macquarie Centre is now the largest Sydney suburban shopping centre. It is expected to reach $6 billion in spending by 2021, and can support trade for 337,770 people.  Future  Plans for the $1 billion redevelopment which included towers have been given approval. The plans would include 1000 new apartments in four tower blocks, 5000sqm of dedicated community space, including a library and public creative hub. The towers will range in height from 26–33 storeys, and adding another 2175 car parking spaces. A new station plaza between Macquarie University station and the centre is also part of the plan. The development will unfold in stages over several years and future applications will be developed. This mixed use development has been approved on 15 November 2016. As part of Stage 2 planning being approved, it was announced on 16 January 2019 that Macquarie Ice Rink would close on 31 January 2020 for demolition to make way for the new retail and residential towers.Macquarie Ice Rink set for demolition to make way for Macquarie Centre upgrade Northern District Times 23 January 2019 In February 2019, AMP Capital Shopping Centres, which owns Macquarie Centre, announced it had decided to preserve the ice rink.Macquarie Centre to keep Olympic-sized rink as developer caves in Sydney Morning Herald 1 February 2019 This was largely due to the large public outcry regarding the removal of the iconic rink.

Incidents  * On 5 June 2007 a 40-year-old women was stabbed and a man had self-inflicted knife wounds after a domestic incident at the centre carpark. The man was later arrested after he allegedly drove at a police officer and crashed into a parked car as he attempted to leave the scene. * Between February and June 2017, 16 vehicles, including luxury cars, had an acid-like substance poured on them. The attack was believed to be racially motivated and a man has been charged. * On 3 July 2017 a police officer was kicked in the face by a group of youths causing him to fall and hit his head. Police were called to the scene after 10pm after a group of youths assaulted two security guards nearby. The 16 year old youth was later charged. * On 16 April 2018 a 13-year-old boy was bitten in the cheek during an attempted robbery at the centre at around 11:40am. He was walking with a friend when they were approached by two men, who threatened the boy and tried to steal his sneakers. * On 17 May 2018 a brawl erupted in the ice rink which involved the chairman of CBR Brave, who started arguing with players from Sydney Bears. The Chairman poured beer down on one of the players before a member of the crowd threw a bin at him, sparking an all-in shoving match between the fans.

Examples are chutneys and the North American relish, a pickled cucumber jam eaten with hot dogs or hamburgers. In North America, the word \\"relish\\" is frequently used to describe a single variety of finely-chopped pickled cucumber relish, such as pickle, dill and sweet relishes.  Overview  Kyopolou (Кьопоолу), a relish from the Balkans made from red bell peppers, eggplant and garlic Relish generally consists of discernible vegetable or fruit pieces in a sauce, although the sauce is subordinate in character to the vegetable or fruit pieces. Herbs may also be used, and some relishes, such as chermoula, are prepared entirely using herbs and spices. Relish can consist of a single type or a combination of vegetables and fruit, which may be coarsely or finely chopped; its texture will vary depending on the slicing style used for these solid ingredients, but generally a relish is not as smooth as a sauce-type condiment such as ketchup. Relish typically has a strong flavor that complements or adds to the primary food item with which it is served. History The English word \\"chutney\\" originated in India.

(page 567) British piccalilli contains various vegetables—invariably cauliflower, onion, and gherkin—and seasonings of mustard and turmeric. A more finely chopped variety \\"sandwich piccalilli\\" is also available from major British supermarkets. It is used as an accompaniment to foods such as sausages, bacon, eggs, toast, cheese, and tomatoes. It is usually used to accompany a dish on a plate rather than as a bread spread. It is popular as a relish with cold meats such as ham and brawn, and with a ploughman's lunch. It is produced both commercially and domestically, being a traditional mainstay of Women's Institute and farmhouse product stalls. Cypriot piccalilli An unsweetened variation of British piccalilli is found in Cyprus (including northern Cyprus). It is without baby onions, with a milder mustard sauce, and with the addition of carrot pieces. Piccalilli is known in Cyprus as πίκλα (pikla) – in Greek, and bıkla – in Turkish. It is served as a condiment, and occasionally as a meze dish. American piccalilli In the Northeastern United States, commercial piccalillis are made with a base of sweet peppers or green tomatoes. This style is somewhat similar to sweet pepper relish, with the piccalilli being distinguished by having a darker red or green color and, like British piccalilli, the chunks are larger and it is slightly sweeter.Piccalilli – The Boston Globe. Boston.com (2011-08-31). Retrieved on 2013-09-20. It is a popular topping on such foods as hamburgers and hot dogs. Traditional, British-style yellow piccalilli is also available.

This style is sometimes called \\"neon relish\\". In the Southern United States, piccalilli is not commonly served.Piccalilli – Definition and Cooking Information. RecipeTips.com.

Piccalilli is uncommon in the Western United States. Surinamese piccalilli A far spicier variant of piccalilli comes from the former Dutch colony of Suriname, where traditional British piccalilli is mixed with a sambal made of garlic and yellow Madame Jeanette peppers. This piccalilli is often homemade but can also be bought in jars in Dutch corner shops. Whilst Surinamese piccalilli is similar in appearance to ordinary piccalilli, the taste is much spicier. Media references As a term for a mixed collection, piccalilli lends its name to several books of poems, for example, Piccalilli: A Mixture, by Gilbert Percy (1862),Gilbert Percy, Piccalilli: a mixture, Publisher: S.

(at Internet Archive) and Dilly Dilly Piccalilli: Poems for the Very Young (1989), by Myra Cohn Livingston.Myra Cohn Livingston, Dilly dilly piccalilli: poems for the very young, Illustrated by Eileen Christelow, Publisher: M.K.

The semi- autobiographical book Vet In Harness (published in North America as All Things Bright And Beautiful) by James Herriot includes an amusing anecdote in which Herriot uses a particularly spicy piccalilli to help make an unsavory meal more palatable and avoid offending his well-meaning hosts. This story was also published by Reader's Digest magazine (and several Herriot compilations) under the title \\"The Piccalilli Saves My Bacon\\". Piccalilli receives an honorable mention in the Harry Champion song, \\"A Little Bit of Cucumber\\". The song \\"Lily the Pink\\", recorded in 1968 by UK comedy group The Scaffold, includes a humorous reference to piccalilli when describing Lily's eventual demise, in the lyric \\"...and despite her medicinal compound, sadly Picca-Lily died\\". The song was based on an earlier folk song \\"the Ballad of Lydia Pinkham\\", which celebrated a herbal remedy invented by the eponymous heroine, marketed from 1876 as \\"Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound\\". The connection between piccalilli and the vegetable compound is in name only, as the recipes differ completely. Arthur Rackham illustrated the old English story \\"Mr. and Mrs. Vinegar\\" and their home is labelled 'Piccalilli Cottage.'

In Thomas Malory's 1485 book Le Morte d'Arthur, in an account taken from the Vulgate Queste del Saint Graal,Norris, Ralph C. Malory's Library: The Sources of the Morte Darthur (D.S. Brewer, 2008), p. 114. the newly knighted Sir Galahad takes the seat in Camelot on Whitsunday, 454 years after the death of Jesus. The Siege Perilous is so strictly reserved that it is fatal to anyone else who sits in it. Another version of this story is related in Alfred Tennyson's Idylls of the King.Tennyson, A., Idylls of the King, 1856: \\"And Merlin called it 'The Siege perilous'\\"(forgottenbooks.org 2007 edition at Google Books) Originally, this motif about the seat and the grail belonged to Perceval, but the Lancelot-Grail Cycle transferred it to the new Cistercian- based hero Galahad. It appears, for example, in the earlier De Boron Didot Perceval, where Perceval occupies the seat at Arthur's court at Carduel. According to many scholars, the motif of the dangerous seat can be further traced to Welsh, Cornish, and Breton mythology, whence the bulk of the Arthurian legend was derived. According to this theory, the Siege Perilous was a half-remembered version of a Celtic kingship ritual that has parallels in the Irish Lia Fáil.R. S. Loomis.

When the protagonists discover their aircraft is being used by government agents to smuggle heroin, they must avoid being framed as the drug-smugglers. The plot of the film is adapted from Christopher Robbins' 1979 non-fiction book, chronicling the CIA-financed airline to transport weapons and supplies in Cambodia, Laos and South Vietnam during the Vietnam War.Hamilton-Merritt 1999, p. 8. The publicity for the film, advertised as a light-hearted buddy movie, implied a tone that differs greatly from the actual film, which includes such serious themes as an anti-war message, focus on the opium trade, and a negative portrayal of Royal Laotian General Vang Pao (played by actor Burt Kwouk as \\"General Lu Soong\\"). Plot In late 1969, Billy Covington (Robert Downey Jr.) works as a helicopter traffic pilot for a Los Angeles radio station. When he breaks several safety regulations by flying low, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration suspends his pilot's license. However, his piloting skills, bravery and disregard for the law are noticed by a mysterious government agent, who tells Billy that he can get his license back if he accepts a job in Laos, working for a \\"strictly civilian\\" company called Air America. It is readily apparent that Air America is a front for CIA operations in Laos. Unemployed and unable to find work, Billy takes the job. In Laos, he is introduced to Air America's unorthodox pilots and aircraft, being taken under the wing of Gene Ryack (Mel Gibson), a cynical and eccentric pilot and an arms dealer who uses official flights to buy black market weapons for his private cache. His dream, which he refers to as his \\"retirement plan\\", is to make a sale big enough so that he can afford to quit his job at Air America. The next day, Senator Davenport (Lane Smith) arrives in Laos on a \\"fact finding mission\\", to investigate rumors about Air America transporting drugs on behalf of Laotian forces. Major Lemond (Ken Jenkins) and Rob Diehl (David Marshall Grant), CIA leaders of Air America, show the Senator around refugee camps, shrines, temples, and major cities in a careful deception to hide from him that Air America is indeed transporting drugs. While airdropping livestock into rural villages in their C-123 cargo aircraft, Billy and Jack Neely (Art LaFleur) are shot down. The Pilatus PC-6 of General Soong (Burt Kwouk) arrives at the crash site and his soldiers load bags of opium on board, but leave Billy and Jack behind with Communist forces moving in. Gene and another pilot arrive and rescue them; Billy boards Gene's helicopter while the rest of the crew escape in another aircraft. Billy and Gene's helicopter is shot down on the way back, and they are captured by a rural tribe. Gene notices that the tribe is using obsolete and unreliable guns and strikes a deal to supply them with better weapons. Allowed to go free, Billy and Gene retreat to Gene's house, where Billy is surprised to discover that Gene has a wife and children. Already disillusioned with US actions in Laos, Gene convinces Billy to quit his job with Air America, but Billy wants to get even with General Soong for betraying him when he crashed. Meanwhile, Senator Davenport is losing patience with Lemond and Diehl, and demands to know who is smuggling heroin. Soon after their return to base, the pilots learn that during his search for Billy and Gene, Jack was killed and Lemond and Diehl claim that he was the ring leader behind the drug trafficking. Enraged, Billy purchases grenades on the black market and uses them to blow up the heroin factory, but guards see him running away. Davenport is still unsatisfied and demands more concrete evidence. The next day, Gene finds a buyer for his arsenal, allowing him to leave gunrunning, quit Air America, and take his family out of the country. Meanwhile, Billy accepts one more flight before he actually quits. With co- pilot Babo (Tim Thomerson), he is assigned to transport flour to a refugee camp but they are instructed to divert to a nearby airstrip for \\"routine inspection\\". Billy immediately suspects a set-up, and a search reveals several kilos of heroin hidden in the flour sacks. With his fuel gauge tampered with, Babo and Billy decide to crash-land on the same airstrip where Billy crashed a few days earlier, and use the wreckage of the previous crash to hide the smaller aircraft. Gene, on his way to make his final, largest weapons delivery, flies in to rescue Babo and Billy after wondering why Billy can't seem to keep anything in the air. Billy convinces him to respond to a distress call from a refugee camp caught in the crossfire between General Soong's men and local rebels. Gene tries to rescue the United States Agency for International Development official (Nancy Travis) in charge of the camp, however, she refuses to leave without the refugees. After some initial resistance, Gene dumps the weapons to make room for the refugees, blowing up the weapons cache to cover their escape. In the air, Gene and Billy come up with a scheme to sell the aircraft to give Gene his money back. Senator Davenport recognises the set up for what it was, and the Senator threatens to reveal Lemond and Diehl's operation to Washington.

Melnick hired screenwriter John Eskow to write a new script; and first hired director Bob Rafelson to work with Rush, but eventually hiring director Roger Spottiswoode. Mel Gibson was cast for a reported $7 million, for the role of Ryack, and Robert Downey Jr. took on the role of Covington. Nancy Travis was cast as Corinne Landroaux, replacing Ally Sheedy, and Michael Dudikoff was cast as General Lee.Clarkson 2004, p. 225. =Filming= The budget of Air America increased to $35 million as the production involved a 500-member crew shooting in 49 different locations between Thailand, London, and Los Angeles; operating between eight and 15 cameras at a time.

The producers rented 26 aircraft from the Thai military, although some of the stunt flyers refused to perform some of the stunts, with 60-year- old veterans being drafted for the more demanding turns. PepsiCo wanted the filmmakers to use a fictional soda rather than show opium being refined at their abandoned factory. Therefore, the producers added a line about wondering if Pepsi knew what was going on.

He is best known for his well-publicized investigation of the purportedly haunted Borley Rectory in Essex, England. Early life Although Price claimed his birth was in Shropshire he was actually born in London in Red Lion Square on the site of the South Place Ethical Society's Conway Hall.Harry Price: The Psychic detective by Richard Morris, Stroud, 2006Hall (1978) pp. 25–30 He was educated in New Cross, first at Waller Road Infants School and then Haberdashers' Aske's Hatcham Boys School.Morris (2006) At 15, Price founded the Carlton Dramatic SocietyTabori (1950) p. 22 and wrote plays, including a drama, about his early experience with a poltergeistThe Sceptic, performed 2 December 1898 at Amersham Hall which he said took place at a haunted manor house in Shropshire.Tabori (1950) p. 25 According to Richard Morris, in his recent biography Harry Price: The Psychic Detective Stroud, 2006, Price came to the attention of the press when he claimed an early interest in space-telegraphy. He set up a receiver and transmitter between Telegraph Hill, Hatcham and St Peter's Church Brockley and captured a spark on a photographic plate. This, though, was nothing more than Price writing a press release saying he had performed the experiment, as nothing was verified. The young Price also had an avid interest in coin collecting and wrote several articles for The Askean, the magazine for Haberdashers' School. In his autobiography, Search for Truth, written between 1941 and 1942, Price claimed he was involved with archaeological excavations in Greenwich Park, London, but, in earlier writings on Greenwich, he denied any such involvement.Hall (1978) pp. 102–113 From around May 1908 Price continued his interest in archaeology at Pulborough, Sussex, where he had moved prior to marrying Constance Mary Knight that August. As well as working as a salesman for paper merchants Edward Saunders & Sons, he wrote for two local Sussex newspapers: the West Sussex Gazette and the Southern Weekly News in which he related his remarkable propensity for discovering 'clean' antiquities. One of these, a 'silver' ingot (discovered by Richard Morris to be housed in Price's collection of artifacts at Senate House, University of London and made of base materials) was stamped around the time of the last Roman emperor Honorius. A few years later, another celebrated Sussex archaeologist, Charles Dawson, found a brick at Pevensey Fort in Sussex, which was purportedly made in Honorius' time. In 1910 Professor E. J Haverfield of Oxford University, the country's foremost expert on Roman history and a Fellow of the Royal Academy, declared the ingot to be a fake. A report for the Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries (number 23, pages 121–9) in the same year reported that: > '... the double axe type of silver ingot was well known and dated from late > Imperial times but the one recovered from Sussex was an inferior copy of one > found at the Tower of London, with alterations to give it an air of > authenticity. Both the shape and lettering betrayed its origin.' Interest in magic and conjuring In his autobiography, Search for Truth, Price said the \\"Great Sequah\\" in Shrewsbury was \\"entirely responsible for shaping much of my life's work\\",Tabori (1950) p. 21 and led to him acquiring the first volume of what would become the Harry Price Library, Price later became an expert amateur conjurer, joined the Magic Circle in 1922 and maintained a lifelong interest in stage magic and conjuring.Paul Tabori. (1974). Harry Price: The Biography of a Ghosthunter. Sphere Books. pp. 41-42. His expertise in sleight-of-hand and magic tricks stood him in good stead for what would become his all consuming passion, the investigation of paranormal phenomena. The psychical researcher Eric Dingwall and Price re-published an anonymous work written by a former medium entitled Revelations of a Spirit Medium (1922) which exposed the tricks of mediumship and the fraudulent methods of producing \\"spirit hands\\".Eric Dingwall, Harry Price. (1922). Revelations of a Spirit Medium. Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner & Co. Originally all the copies of the book were bought up by spiritualists and deliberately destroyed.Georgess McHargue. (1972).

Price's first major success in psychical research came in 1922 when he exposed the 'spirit' photographer William Hope.Leaves from a Psychist's Case Book by Harry Price, Page 213.Hall (1978) p. 222 In the same year he travelled to Germany together with Eric Dingwall and investigated Willi Schneider at the home of Baron Albert von Schrenck-Notzing in Munich.Hall (1978) pp. 136–153 In 1923, Price exposed the medium Jan Guzyk, according to Price the \\"man was clever, especially with his feet, which were almost as useful to him as his hands in producing phenomena.\\"Harry Price. (1942). Search for truth: My Life for Psychical Research. Collins p. 206 Price wrote that the photographs depicting the ectoplasm of the medium Eva Carrière taken with Schrenck-Notzing looked artificial and two-dimensional made from cardboard and newspaper portraits and that there were no scientific controls as both her hands were free. In 1920 Carrière was investigated by psychical researchers in London. An analysis of her ectoplasm revealed it to be made of chewed paper. She was also investigated in 1922 and the result of the tests were negative.Harry Price. (1939). Fifty Years of Psychical Research. Longmans, Green & Co. In 1925, Price investigated Maria Silbert and caught her using her feet and toes to move objects in the séance room.Lewis Spence. (1991). Encyclopedia of Occultism & Parapsychology. Gale Research Company. p. 1522 He also investigated the \\"direct voice\\" mediumship of George Valiantine in London. In the séance Valiantine claimed to have contacted the \\"spirit\\" of the composer Luigi Arditi , speaking in Italian. Price wrote down every word that was attributed to Arditi and they were found to be word-for-word matches in an Italian phrase-book.Harry Price. (1942).

Price paid mediums to test them-the SPR criticized Price and disagreed about paying mediums for testing.Jenny Hazelgrove. (2000). Spiritualism and British Society Between the Wars. Manchester University Press. p. 206. Price made a formal offer to the University of London to equip and endow a Department of Psychical Research, and to loan the equipment of the National Laboratory and its library. The University of London Board of Studies in Psychology responded positively to this proposal. In 1934, the National Laboratory of Psychical Research, which held Price's collection, was reconstituted as the University of London Council for Psychical Investigation with C. E. M. Joad as chairman and with Price as Honorary Secretary and editor, although it was not an official body of the University.Hall (1978) p. 169 In the meantime, in 1927 Price joined the Ghost Club, of which he remained a member until it (temporarily) closed in 1936. In 1927, Price claimed that he had come into possession of Joanna Southcott's box, and arranged to have it opened in the presence of one reluctant prelate (the Bishop of Grantham, not a diocesan bishop but a suffragan of the diocese of Lincoln): it was found to contain only a few oddments and unimportant papers, among them a lottery ticket and a horse-pistol. His claims to have had the true box have been disputed by historians and by followers of Southcott.Hall (1978) pp. 154–160 Price exposed Frederick Tansley Munnings, who claimed to produce the independent \\"spirit\\" voices of Julius Caesar, Dan Leno, Hawley Harvey Crippen and King Henry VIII. Price invented and used a piece of apparatus known as a voice control recorder and proved that all the voices were those of Munnings. In 1928, Munnings admitted fraud and sold his confessions to a Sunday newspaper.Paul Tabori. (1966). Harry Price: The Biography of a Ghosthunter.

He was also involved in the formation of the National Film Library (British Film Institute) becoming its first chairman (until 1941) and was a founding member of the Shakespeare Film Society. In 1936, Price broadcast from a supposedly haunted manor house in Meopham, Kent for the BBC and published The Confessions of a Ghost-Hunter and The Haunting of Cashen's Gap. This year also saw the transfer of Price's library on permanent loan to the University of London (see external links below), followed shortly by the laboratory and investigative equipment. In 1937, he conducted further televised experiments into fire-walking with Ahmed Hussain at Carshalton and Alexandra Palace, and also rented Borley Rectory for one year. The following year, Price re-established the Ghost Club, with himself as chairman, modernizing it and changing it from a spiritualist association to a group of more or less open-minded skeptics that gathered to discuss paranormal topics. He was also the first to admit women to the club. In the same year, Price conducted experiments with Rahman Bey who was \\"buried alive\\" in Carshalton. He also drafted a Bill for the regulation of psychic practitioners. In 1939, he organised a national telepathic test in the periodical John O'London's Weekly. During the 1940s, Price concentrated on writing and the works The Most Haunted House in England, Poltergeist Over England and The End of Borley Rectory were all published. Famous cases =William Hope= On 4 February 1922, Price with James Seymour, Eric Dingwall and William Marriott had proven the spirit photographer William Hope was a fraud during tests at the British College of Psychic Science. Price wrote in his SPR report \\"William Hope has been found guilty of deliberately substituting his own plates for those of a sitter ... It implies that the medium brings to the sitting a duplicate slide and faked plates for fraudulent purposes.\\" Price secretly marked Hope's photographic plates, and provided him with a packet of additional plates that had been covertly etched with the brand image of the Imperial Dry Plate Co. Ltd. in the knowledge that the logo would be transferred to any images created with them. Unaware that Price had tampered with his supplies, Hope then attempted to produce a number of Spirit photographs. Although Hope produced several images of spirits, none of his materials contained the Imperial Dry Plate Co. Ltd logo, or the marks that Price had put on Hope's original equipment, showing that he had exchanged prepared materials containing fake spirit images for the provided materials.Massimo Polidoro. (2001). Final Séance: The Strange Friendship Between Houdini and Conan Doyle. Prometheus Books. pp. 64–65. Price later re- published the Society's experiment in a pamphlet of his own called Cold Light on Spiritualistic \\"Phenomena\\" – An Experiment with the Crewe Circle. Due to the exposure of Hope and other fraudulent spiritualists, Arthur Conan Doyle led a mass resignation of eighty-four members of the Society for Psychical Research, as they believed the Society was opposed to spiritualism.G. K. Nelson. (2013). Spiritualism and Society. Routledge. p. 159. Doyle threatened to have Price evicted from his laboratory and claimed if he persisted to write \\"sewage\\" about spiritualists, he would meet the same fate as Houdini.William Kalush, Larry Ratso Sloman. (2006). The Secret Life of Houdini: The Making of America's First Superhero. Atria Books. pp. 419–420. Doyle and other spiritualists attacked Price and tried for years to have Price take his pamphlet out of circulation. Price wrote \\"Arthur Conan Doyle and his friends abused me for years for exposing Hope.\\"Massimo Polidoro. (2001). Final Séance: The Strange Friendship Between Houdini and Conan Doyle. Prometheus Books. p. 67. =Eileen Garrett= On 7 October 1930 it was claimed by spiritualists that Eileen J. Garrett made contact with the spirit of Herbert Carmichael Irwin at a séance held with Price at the National Laboratory of Psychical Research two days after the R101 disaster, while attempting to contact the then recently deceased Arthur Conan Doyle, and discussed possible causes of the accident.Melvin Harris. (2003). Investigating the Unexplained: Psychic Detectives, the Amityville Horror-mongers, Jack the Ripper, and Other Mysteries of the Paranormal. Prometheus Books. pp. 171–182. The event \\"attracted worldwide attention\\", thanks to the presence of a reporter. Major Oliver Villiers, a friend of Brancker, Scott, Irwin, Colmore and others aboard the airship, participated in further séances with Garrett, at which he claimed to have contacted both Irwin and other victims. Price did not come to any definite conclusion about Garrett and the séances: > It is not my intention to discuss if the medium were really controlled by > the discarnate entity of Irwin, or whether the utterances emanated from her > subconscious mind or those of the sitters. \\"Spirit\\" or \\"trance personality\\" > would be equally interesting explanations – and equally remarkable. There is > no real evidence for either hypothesis. But it is not my intention to > discuss hypotheses, but rather to put on record the detailed account of a > remarkably interesting and thought-provoking experiment.Harry Price. (1933). > Leaves from a Psychist's Case-book. Gollancz. p. 132 Garrett's claims have since been questioned. The magician John Booth analysed the mediumship of Garrett and the paranormal claims of R101 and considered her to be a fraud. According to Booth Garrett's notes and writings show she followed the building of the R101 and she may have been given aircraft blueprints by a technician from the airdrome.John Booth. (1986). Psychic Paradoxes. Prometheus Books. pp. 164–165. However, the researcher Melvin Harris who studied the case wrote no secret accomplice was needed as the information described in Garrett's séances were \\"either commonplace, easily absorbed bits and pieces, or plain gobbledegook. The so-called secret information just doesn't exist.\\" =Rudi Schneider= In the 1920s and early 1930s Price investigated the medium Rudi Schneider in a number of experiments conducted at the National Laboratory of Psychical Research.Lewis Spence. (2003). Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology. Kessinger Reprint Edition. p. 806 Schneider claimed he could levitate objects but according to Price a photograph taken on 28 April 1932 showed that Schneider had managed to free his arm to move a handkerchief from the table. After this, many scientists considered Schneider to be exposed as a fraud.Harry Price. (2003). Fifty Years of Psychical Research. Kessinger Publishing. (reprint) Price wrote that the findings of the other experiments should be revised due to the evidence showing how Schneider could free himself from the controls. After Price had exposed Schneider, various scientists, such as Karl Przibram and the magician Henry Evans, wrote to Price telling him that they agreed that Schneider would evade control during his séances and congratulated Price on the success of unmasking the fraud.Paul Tabori. (1966). Harry Price: The Biography of a Ghosthunter. Living Books. pp. 114–115 In opposition, SPR members who were highly critical of Price, supported Schneider's mediumship and promoted a conspiracy theory that Price had hoaxed the photograph.Hilary Evans. (1982). Intrusions: Society and the Paranormal. Routledge Kegan & Paul. p. 166. SPR member Anita Gregory claimed Price had deliberately faked the photograph to discredit SPR research and ruin Schneider's reputation.Gregory, A. (1977). Anatomy of a fraud: Harry Price and the medium Rudi Schneider. Annals of Science 34, 449–549. However, a photographic expert testified that the photograph was genuine.Harrison, V. (1979). Letter to the Editor. Journal of the Society for Psychical Research. 50: 45–46. SPR member John L. Randall reviewed the Price and Schneider case and came to the conclusion that the photograph was genuine and that Price had caught Schneider in fraud.John L. Randall. (2000). Harry Price: The Case for the Defence. Journal of the Society for Psychical Research (Vol. 64.3, No. 860). =Helen Duncan= Helen Duncan with a roll of cheesecloth. In 1931, the National Laboratory of Psychical Research took on its most illustrious case. £50 was paid to the medium Helen Duncan so that she could be examined under scientific conditions.Simeon Edmunds. (1966). Spiritualism: A Critical Survey. Aquarian Press. Price was sceptical of Duncan and had her perform a number of test séances. She was suspected of swallowing cheesecloth which was then regurgitated as \\"ectoplasm\\".Harry Price. (1931). Regurgitation and the Duncan Mediumship. (Bulletin I of the National Laboratory of Psychical Research, 120pp with 44 illustrations.) Price had proven through analysis of a sample of ectoplasm produced by Duncan, that it was made of cheesecloth.Marina Warner. (2008). Phantasmagoria: Spirit Visions, Metaphors, and Media into the Twenty-first Century. Oxford University Press. p. 299. Duncan reacted violently at attempts to X-ray her, running from the laboratory and making a scene in the street, where her husband had to restrain her, destroying the controlled nature of the test. Price wrote that Duncan had given her fake ectoplasm to her husband to hide.Paul Tabori. (1966). Harry Price: The Biography of a Ghosthunter. Living books. p. 136 The ectoplasm of Duncan in another test was analysed by psychical researchers and reported to be made from egg white. According to Price: > The sight of half-a-dozen men, each with a pair of scissors waiting for the > word, was amusing. It came and we all jumped. One of the doctors got hold of > the stuff and secured a piece. The medium screamed and the rest of the > \\"teleplasm\\" went down her throat. This time it wasn't cheese-cloth. It > proved to be paper, soaked in white of egg, and folded into a flattened tube > ... Could anything be more infantile than a group of grown-up men wasting > time, money, and energy on the antics of a fat female crook. Price wrote up the case in Leaves from a Psychist's Case Book (1933) in a chapter called \\"The Cheese-Cloth Worshippers\\".Harry Price. (1933). The Cheese- Cloth Worshippers in Leaves from a Psychist's Case Book. Gollancz. pp. 201–209. In his report Price published photographs of Duncan in his laboratory that revealed fake ectoplasm made from cheesecloth, rubber gloves and cut-out heads from magazine covers which she pretended to her audience were spirits.Paul Kurtz. (1985). A Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology. Prometheus Books. p. 599. Following the report written by Price, Duncan's former maid Mary McGinlay confessed in detail to having aided Duncan in her mediumship tricks, and Duncan's husband admitted the ectoplasm materialisations to be the result of regurgitation. Later Duncan was caught cheating again pretending to be a spirit in the séance room. During Duncan's famous trial in 1944, Price gave his results as evidence for the prosecution. This time Duncan and her travelling companions, Frances Brown, Ernest and Elizabeth Homer were prosecuted and convicted. Duncan was jailed for nine months, Brown for four months and the Homers were bound over.Helena Normanton. (1945). The Trial of Mrs. Duncan. Edited with a Foreword by C. E. Bechhofer Roberts. Jarrolds Publishers. =Brocken experiment= The Brocken experiment In 1932, Price travelled to Mount Brocken in Germany with C. E. M. Joad and members of the National Laboratory to conduct a 'black magic' experiment in connection with the centenary of Goethe.Hall (1978) pp. 160–170 The \\"Bloksberg Tryst\\", involving the transformation of a goat into a young man by the invocation of a maiden, Ura Bohn (better known as the film actress Gloria Gordon, 1881–1962), produced a great deal of publicity but not the magical transformation. Price claimed he carried out the experiment \\"if only to prove the fallacy of transcendental magic.\\"Paul Tabori. (1966). Harry Price: The Psychic detective by Richard Morris, Stroud, 2006Harry Price: The Biography of a Ghosthunter. Living Books. p. 227 =Gef= In July 1935 Price and his friend Richard Lambert went to the Isle of Man to investigate the alleged case of Gef the talking mongoose and produced the book The Haunting of Cashen's Gap (1936). In the book they avoided saying that they believed the story but were careful to report it as though with an open mind. The book reports how a hair from the alleged mongoose was sent to Julian Huxley who then sent it to naturalist F. Martin Duncan who identified it as a dog hair. Price suspected the hair belonged to the Irving's sheepdog, Mona.Richard Wiseman. (2011). Paranormality: Why we see what isn't there. London, UK: Pan Macmillan. p. 185. Price asked Reginald Pocock of the Natural History Museum to evaluate pawprints allegedly made by Gef in plasticine together with an impression of his supposed tooth marks. Pocock could not match them to any known animal, though he conceded that one of them might have been \\"conceivably made by a dog\\". He did state that none of the markings had been made by a mongoose. Price visited the Irvings and observed double walls of wooden panelling covering the interior rooms of the old stone farmhouse which featured considerable interior air space between stone and wood walls that \\"makes the whole house one great speaking-tube, with walls like soundingboards. By speaking into one of the many apertures in the panels, it should be possible to convey the voice to various parts of the house.\\" According to Richard Wiseman \\"Price and Lambert were less than enthusiastic about the case, concluding that only the most credulous of individuals would be impressed with the evidence for Gef.\\" The diaries of James Irving, along with reports about the case, are in Harry Price's archives in the Senate House Library, University of London.Raymond Buckland. (2009). The Weiser Field Guide to Ghosts. Weiser Books . p. 26. =Borley Rectory= Borley Rectory in 1892 Price was most famous for his investigation into the Borley Rectory, Essex. The building became known as \\"the most haunted house in England\\" after Price published a book about it in 1940. He documented a series of alleged hauntings from the time the rectory was built in 1863. He lived in the rectory from May 1937 to May 1938 and wrote of his experiences in the book.Terence Hines. (2003). Pseudoscience and the Paranormal. Prometheus Books. pp. 94–95. The psychical researcher John L. Randall wrote there was direct evidence of \\"dirty tricks\\" played upon Price by members of the SPR. On 9 October 1931, a past president of the SPR William Henry Salter visited the Borley Rectory in an attempt to persuade the Rector Lionel Foyster, to sever his links with Price and work with the SPR instead.Ivan Banks. (1996). The Enigma of Borley Rectory. London: Foulsham. p. 92. After Price's death in 1948 Eric Dingwall, Kathleen M. Goldney, and Trevor H. Hall, three members of the Society for Psychical Research, two of whom had been Price's most loyal associates, investigated his claims about Borley. Their findings were published in a 1956 book, The Haunting of Borley Rectory, which concluded Price had fraudulently produced some of the phenomena.Dingwall, E. J.; Goldney, K. M.; Hall, T. H. (1956). The Haunting of Borley Rectory. Duckworth. The \\"Borley Report\\", as the SPR study has become known, stated that many of the phenomena were either faked or due to natural causes such as rats and the strange acoustics attributed to the odd shape of the house. In their conclusion, Dingwall, Goldney, and Hall wrote \\"when analysed, the evidence for haunting and poltergeist activity for each and every period appears to diminish in force and finally to vanish away.\\" Terence Hines wrote \\"Mrs. Marianne Foyster, wife of the Rev. Lionel Foyster who lived at the rectory from 1930 to 1935, was actively engaged in fraudulently creating [haunted] phenomena. Price himself \\"salted the mine\\" and faked several phenomena while he was at the rectory.\\" Robert Hastings was one of the few SPR researchers to defend Price.Hastings, R. J. (1969). An Examination of the 'Borley Report. Journal of the Society for Psychical Research 55: 66–175. Price's literary executor Paul Tabori and Peter Underwood have also defended Price against accusations of fraud. A similar approach was made by Ivan Banks in 1996.Paul Tabori, Peter Underwood. (1973). Ghosts of Borley: Annals of the Haunted Rectory. David & Charles. Ivan Banks. (1996). The Enigma of Borley Rectory. Foulsham & Co Ltd. Michael Coleman in an SPR report in 1997 wrote Price's defenders are unable to rebut the criticisms convincingly.Michael Coleman. (1997). The Flying Bricks of Borley. Journal of the Society for Psychical Research. Volume. 61, No. 847. Price's investigation of Borley was the subject of a 2013 best selling novel by Neil Spring, titled 'The Ghost Hunters.' This novel was subsequently adapted for television as 'Harry Price: Ghost Hunter,' starring Rafe Spall, Cara Theobold and Richie Campbell.Broadcast on ITV on 27 December 2015,http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-12-27/harry-price-ghost-hunter-is-a- frighteningly-good-festive-treat =Rosalie= Price claimed to have attended a private séance on 15 December 1937 in which a small six-year-old girl called Rosalie appeared. Price wrote he controlled the room by placing starch powder over the floor, locking the door and taping the windows before the séance. However, the identity of the sitters, or the locality where the séance was held was not revealed due to the alleged request of the mother of the child.Harry Price. (1939). Rosalie in Fifty Years of Psychical Research. Longmans, Green and Company. During the séance Price claimed a small girl emerged, she spoke and he took her pulse. Price was suspicious that the supposed spirit of the child was no different than a human being but after the séance had finished the starch powder was undisturbed and none of the seals had been removed on the window. Price was convinced no one had entered the room via door or window during the séance. Price's Fifty Years of Psychical Research (1939) describes his experiences at the sitting and includes a diagram of the séance room. Eric Dingwall and Trevor Hall wrote the Rosalie séance was fictitious and Price had lied about the whole affair but had based some of the details on the description of the house from a sitting he attended at a much earlier time in Brockley, South London where he used to live.Eric Dingwall, Trevor Hall. (1958). Four Modern Ghosts. Gerald Duckworth. K. M. Goldney who had criticized Price over his investigation into Borley Rectory wrote after the morning of the Rosalie sitting she found Price \\"shaken to the core by his experience.\\" Goldney believed Price had told the truth about the séance and informed the Two Worlds spiritualist weekly newspaper that she believed the Rosalie sitting to be genuine.Philip Paul. (1985). Some Unseen Power: Diary of a Ghost Hunter. Robert Hale Ltd. p. 36. In 1985, Peter Underwood published a photograph of part of an anonymous letter that was sent to the SPR member David Cohen in the 1960s which claimed to be from a séance sitter who attended the séance. The letter confessed to having impersonated the Rosalie child in the sitting by the request of the father who had owed the mother of the child money.Peter Underwood. (1985). The Ghost Hunters: Who They Are and What They Do. Robert Hale Ltd. In 2017, Paul Adams published details of the location of the Rosalie seance and identities of the family involved.Adams, Paul (2017). The Enigma of Rosalie. White Crow Books Reception Psychologist and sceptic Richard Wiseman has praised Price for his work in debunking fraudulent mediums and investigating paranormal claims. According to Wiseman \\"Price devoted the scientific study to weird stuff ... that both delighted the world's media and infuriated believers and sceptics alike.\\"Richard Wiseman. (2011). Paranormality: Why we see what isn't there. London, UK: Pan Macmillan. p. 183. The stage magician and scientific sceptic James Randi wrote Price accomplished some valuable and genuine research but lived \\"a strange mixture of fact and fraud.\\"Randi, James. (1997). Harry Price. In An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural. St. Martin's Griffin. Psychical researcher Renée Haynes described Price as \\"one of the most fascinating and storm-provoking figures in psychical research.\\"Renée Haynes. (1982). The Society for Psychical Research 1882–1982: A History. London: MacDonald & Co. p. 146. Science writer Mary Roach in her book Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife (2010) favourably mentioned Price's methods and research in debunking the fraudulent medium Helen Duncan.Mary Roach. (2010). Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife. Canongate Books Ltd. pp. 122–130. Several biographies have been written about Price. Paul Tabori's biography (1974) is generally sympathetic. Historian Trevor H. Hall's (1978) is much more critical.Hall, Trevor H. (1978). Search for Harry Price. Ducksworth. The latest biography by Richard Morris (2006) is also critical, concluding that Price should best be remembered as a \\"supreme bluffer, a hedonistic con man, a terrific raconteur, a great conjuror, a gifted writer and a wonderful eccentric.\\"Morris, Richard. (2006). Harry Price: The Psychic Detective. Sutton Publishing. Death and legacy Price suffered a massive heart attack at his home in Pulborough, West Sussex and died almost instantly on 29 March 1948. His archives were deposited with the University of London between 1976 and 1978 by his widow. They include his correspondence, drafts of his publications, papers relating to libel cases, reports on his investigations, press cuttings and photographs.Collection description of the Harry Price archive His collection of magic books and periodicals is held at Senate House Library, part of the University of London and is called the Harry Price Library of Magical Literature.

It is distributed in Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands.Murraya. Flora of China. The center of diversity is in southern China and Southeast Asia.But, P. P., et al. (1986). A chemotaxonomic study of Murraya (Rutaceae) in China. Acta Phytotax. Sin 24(3), 186-92. Description Plants in the genus Murraya are shrubs or trees with pinnate arranged alternately, usually glandular, aromatic, and leathery to membranous in texture. The leaflets vary in shape and have smooth or toothed edges.Murraya. FloraBase. Western Australian Herbarium. The inflorescence is a panicle, cyme, or small raceme of flowers growing at the ends of branches or in the leaf axils; some flowers are solitary. The fragrant flowers have 4 or 5 sepals and white petals and up to 10 straight stamens. The fruit is a fleshy berry with pulp but without the juice vesicles present in some related fruits. It is up to 1.3 centimeters long and orange, red, or black. Taxonomy The genus Murraya was first formally described in 1771 by Carl Linnaeus in Mantissa Plantarum Altera from an unpublished description by Johann Gerhard König. The genus name commemorates the 18th-century German-Swedish herbal doctor Johan Andreas Murray, a student of Linnaeus.Missouri Botanical Garden This genus is in the subfamily Aurantioideae, which also includes genus Citrus. It is in the subtribe Clauseninae, which are known technically as the remote citroid fruit trees.Swingle, W. T., rev. P. C. Reece. Chapter 3: The Botany of Citrus and its Wild Relatives.

Species have been used in traditional medicine, with various parts of the plants used to treat fever, pain, and dysentery. M. paniculata has been used to induce labor. It has been used in Cuba for painful inflammatory conditions.Casado Martín, C. M., et al. (2011). Acercamiento al género Murraya (Rutaceae) ya la especie Murraya paniculata (L.) Jack. Revista Cubana de Plantas Medicinales 16(4), 408-18. (Spanish) Curry tree (M. koenigii) in particular has a number of uses. It is cultivated in India and Sri Lanka. The aromatic foliage, powdered leaves, and essential oil are used in Sri Lankan Cuisine and Indian cuisine as a flavoring for curries and meat, fish, and egg dishes. In Myanmar, thanaka is a traditional cosmetic face cream made from Murraya. Chemistry Compounds isolated from Murraya include many types of coumarins and alkaloids. The novel alkaloid yuehchukene was found in M. paniculata, and it has since been isolated from other Murraya. It is found in red-fruited species with larger petals, but not in black-fruited species with smaller petals. Some species also contain the carbazole girinimbine. M. koenigii has yielded a vast array of compounds, including carbazoles and carotenoids. The leaves alone have been found to contain such compounds as koenimbine, koenigine, koenine, koenidine, koenimbidine, murrayacine, murrayanine, murrayazoline, and murrayazolidine.

The movie Telefon, starring Charles Bronson, was inspired by his novel of the same name. His book 58 Minutes was adapted into Die Hard 2, starring Bruce Willis. Education and career Walter Wager was born in The Bronx, New York City, the son of a doctor and a nurse who had emigrated from the Russian Empire. A 1944 graduate of Columbia College, where he was a member of the Philolexian Society, he went on to a Harvard Law School degree three years later. Passing the bar exams but choosing not to practice, he went on to receive a master's degree in aviation law from Chicago's Northwestern University in 1949, while also serving as an editor of the Journal of Air Law and Commerce, then based in that city. Afterward, he spent a year at the Sorbonne, in Paris, as a Fulbright Fellow. He spent a year in Israel as an aviation-law consultant for the Israeli Department of Civil Aviation, helping to negotiate a treaty on air space and working out of Lydda Airport in Tel Aviv. In 1952, he returned to New York City, where he worked for the United Nations, editing documents. Shortly afterward, Wager segued into writing and producing radio and television documentaries for CBS and NBC, and the United States Information Agency, while also beginning a side career as a freelance writer for magazines including Playbill and Show. Under the pseudonym John Tiger, he wrote the paperback original Death Hits the Jackpot (Avon #605) for Avon Books, the fifth publisher he contacted; published in 1954, it paid him $3,000. He recalled in 2000, \\"I had a friend at a paperback publishing house. I like mystery stories so I thought I could sell this kind of prose.\\" For several years he worked as a freelance writer. Two years later, he published a second Avon paperback, Operation Intrigue, under the name Walter Herman. From 1963 to 1996, Wager was editor-in-chief of Playbill magazine, and from 1966 to 1978 as editor of ASCAP Today, the magazine of the music-licensing organization the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers; he later became ASCAP's public-relations director. He held a similar position at the University of Bridgeport in Connecticut in the early 1990s, until his retirement in 1993. He also did public relations for organizations including the Juilliard School, the Mann Music Center, and the Eugene O'Neill Theatre Center. Wager was a member of the board of directors of the Mystery Writers of America, and its secretary beginning in 2001. Personal life Wager married Sylvia Leonard (d. 1989), a fellow American student he met at the Sorbonne, in 1951 in Paris. The two had a daughter, Lisa, before the marriage ended in divorce. He married second wife Winifred McIvor Wage in 1975. A resident of Manhattan's Upper West Side, he died of complications of brain cancer in 2004, at the assisted-living facility Amsterdam House in Manhattan. Books Wager was best known as an author of crime and espionage thrillers. His novel Viper Three (Macmillan, 1971) was released as Twilight's Last Gleaming, with Burt Lancaster and Richard Widmark, in 1977. That same year, his spy novel Telefon (Macmillan, 1975) was adapted as the same-name movie starring Charles Bronson and Lee Remick. Wager's airport-based thriller 58 Minutes (1987) became the basis for the 1990 action film Die Hard 2, starring Bruce Willis.

Qalqilya serves as the administrative center of the Qalqilya Governorate. In the official 2007 census the city had a population of 41,739. Qalqilya is surrounded by the Israeli West Bank barrier with a narrow gap in the east controlled by the Israeli military and a tunnel to Hableh.United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs Qalqiliya Closures map for December 2011 The city is known for growing many oranges. Etymology Qalqilya was known as Calecailes in the Roman period, and Calcelie in the Frankish sources from the early Medieval times. The word \\"Qalqilya\\" might be derived from a Canaanite term which means \\"rounded stones or hills\\". According to E.H. Palmer, the name came from \\"a type of pomegranate\\", or \\"gurgling of water\\". History Martyrs' monument The vicinity of Qalqilya has been populated since prehistoric times, as attested to by the discovery of prehistoric flint tools. =Ottoman era= In 1596, Qalqilya appeared in Ottoman tax registers (transliterated as Qalqili) as a village in the nahiya (subdistrict) of Bani Sa'b in the Liwa of Nablus. It had a population of 13 Muslim households and paid taxes on wheat, barley, summer crops, olives, and goats or beehives; a total of 3,910 akçe.Hütteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 140 In 1838, Robinson noted Kulakilieh as a village in Beni Sa'ab district, west of Nablus.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, Appendix 2, p. 127 In 1870, Victor Guérin found it to be a village with 200 inhabitants.Guérin, 1875, p. 356-357 In 1882, Qalqilya was described as \\"A large somewhat straggling village, with cisterns to the north and a pool on the south-west. The houses are badly built.\\"Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II, p. 165 In 1883 some moved to there from nearby Baqat al-Hatab, and in 1909 a municipal council to administer Qalqilya was established. =British Mandate era= Qalqilya 1927 In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Qalqilya had a population of 2,803 (2,794 Muslims and 9 Christians),Barron, 1923, Table IX, Sub-district of Tulkarem, p. 27 increasing in the 1931 census to 3,867 (3,855 Muslims and 12 Christians), in a total of 796 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 56 In the 1945 statistics the population of Qalqilya was 5,850; 5,840 Muslims and 10 Christians,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics, 1945, p. 21 who owned 27,915 dunams of land according to an official land and population survey.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics.

Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 177 Qalqilya 1942 1:20,000 Qalqilya 1945 1:250,000 =1948 War= In the wake of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, and after the 1949 Armistice Agreements, Qalqilya came under Jordanian rule. During the war, many inhabitants from nearby villages, including Kafr Saba, Abu Kishk, Miska, Biyar 'Adas and Shaykh Muwannis fled to Qalqilya as refugees. Following the battle of the nearby Arab village of Kafr Saba, the residents of Qalqilya fled and later returned with the arrival of the Jordanian Arab Legion and the Iraqi expeditionary force, although the return was partial, as some 2,000 residents did not return. Those were upper class residents who moved to Nablus. The main reason for the partial return was the difficult economic situation in the front-line town and the inability to access the crop fields.Yoav Gelber, Independence Versus Nakba; Kinneret–Zmora-Bitan–Dvir Publishing, 2004, , p.236 =Jordanian era= The area was annexed by Jordan in 1950. On the night of 10 October 1956 the Israeli army launched a raid against Qalqilya police station in response to a Jordanian attack on Israeli bus, amongst other incidents. The attack was ordered by Moshe Dayan and involved several thousand soldiers. During the fighting a paratroop company was surrounded by Jordanian troops and the survivors only escaped under close air-cover from four Israeli Air Force aircraft. Eighteen Israelis and between 70 and 90 Jordanians were killed in the operation.Morris, 1993, pp. 397–399. In 1961, the population of Qalqilya was 11,401.Government of Jordan, Department of Statistics, 1964, p. 8 =Post 1967= United Nations map of the area, showing the Israeli occupation arrangements. Since the Six-Day War in 1967, Qalqilya has been under Israeli occupation. Later that year, dozens of its inhabitants were evicted by Israel to Jordan, and at least 850 buildings were razed.Masalha, 2007, 1967: Why Did the Palestinians Leave? In his memoirs, Moshe Dayan described the destruction as a \\"punishment\\" that was designed to chase the inhabitants away contrary to the government policy. The villagers were eventually allowed to return and the reconstruction of damaged houses was financed by the military authorities. In September 1967, a census found 8,922 persons, of whom 1,837 were originally from Israeli territory.Joel Perlmann. The 1967 Census of the West Bank and Gaza Strip: A Digitized Version.

As part of the 1993 Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), control of Qalqilya was transferred to the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) on 17 December 1995. In 2003, the Israeli West Bank barrier was built, encircling the town and separating it from agricultural lands on the other side of the wall.The Wall (Qalqilya) 2003 Relief Web, Retrieved 10th Dec 2009 In November 2015, Israel arrested what it alleged to be a network of 24 Hamas militants active in the city.Zitun, Yoav. Hamas network exposed by IDF and Shin Bet in Qalqiliya. Ynet News. 2015-11-10. On October 20, 2017, the Palestinian city of Qalqilya named a street after Saddam Hussein and erected a memorial with his likeness, according to an Israeli newspaper. The monument was unveiled at a ceremony attended by the Qalqilya District Governor Rafi Rawajba and two other Palestinian officials. It bears the slogan “Saddam Hussein – The Master of the Martyrs in Our Age,” as well as “Arab Palestine from the River to the Sea,” a slogan often used by Hussein that refers to the Palestinian liberation movement. Geography Qalqilya is located in the northwestern West Bank, straddling the border with Israel. It is 16 kilometers southwest of the Palestinian city of Tulkarm, and the nearest localities are the Arab-Israeli city of Tira and the Palestinian hamlet of 'Arab al-Ramadin al-Shamali to the northeast, the Palestinian village of Nabi Ilyas to the east, the Palestinian hamlets 'Arab Abu Farda and 'Arab ar-Ramadin al-Janubi and the Israeli settlement of Alfei Menashe to the southwest, and the Palestinian village Habla and Arab-Israeli town of Jaljuliya to the south. Qalqilya has an average elevation of 57 meters above sea level. The average annual rainfall 587.4 millimeters and the average annual temperature is 19 degrees Celsius. Demographics The 1997 census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) recorded Qalqilya's population to be 22,168. The majority of the inhabitants (69.8%) were Palestinian refugees or their descendants.. 1997 Census. Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS). 1999. In the 2007 census, Qalqilya's population grew to 41,739 (50.9% male and (49.1% female). The number of registered households was 7,866. Among the largest families in Qalqilya are the Nazzal, Shreim, Dawood, Zeid, Sabawi and Al Qar'an. In the 2017 census, Qalqiliya's population grew to 51,683.http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Downloads/book2364.pdf page 71 Government Hamas won the 2006 municipal elections in Qalqiliya and one of its members, Wajih Qawas, became mayor, although he was incarcerated by Israel for much of his term. On 12 September 2009, the PNA dismissed Qawas for allowing Qalqiliya's debt to grow unchecked, failing to attract international funding for city projects and ignoring orders by the Palestinian government. Qawas, however, viewed his dismissal as a result of the ongoing feud between Hamas, which dominates the PNA in the Gaza Strip and Fatah, which dominates the PNA in the West Bank. Human rights groups criticized Qawas's dismissal, condemning the intervention by the central Palestinian authorities in the affairs of an elected official. During the 2012 municipal elections, Fatah member Othman Dawood was elected mayor. Economy Route of separation fence around Qalqilya and Hableh Between 1967 and 1995 almost 80 percent of Qalqilya's labor force worked for Israeli companies or industries in the construction and agriculture sectors. The remaining 20% engaged in trade and commerce, marketing across the Green Line. According to a field survey taken by the Applied Research Institute-Jerusalem (ARIJ), 45% of Qalqilya's working population was employed by government, 25% worked in agriculture, 15% worked in trade and commerce, 10% worked in industry and 5% worked in Israeli labor. In 2012, the unemployment rate was 22%, with those most affected formerly employed in agriculture, trade and services. The city is particularly known for its citrus crop and 17.6% of its lands are planted with citrus trees. Other major crops are olives and vegetables. As of 2012, there were 145 grocery stores, 35 produce stores, 18 bakeries, 18 butcheries, 133 service- oriented businesses, 80 various professional workshops, six hardware stores and ten stonemasons operating in Qalqilya. Qalqilya Zoo, established in 1986, is the largest zoo in the West Bank and according to its owner, is the city's single-largest employer. It serves as one of Qalqilya's main attractions. The zoo houses 170 animals and works closely with zoologists from the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo and the Ramat Gan Safari.Splish, splash, new Kalkiya's hippo's takin' a bath, Haaretz =Land usage and the barrier= Of the city's total area of 10,252 dunams, 3,027 were built-up areas, 266 were used for industrial purposes, 2,894 were planted with permanent crops, 419 were used for greenhouses, 274 for livestock ranges, 2,343 were classified as arable, and 283 dunams were occupied by the West Bank barrier. Nearly all of Qalqilya's urban area is under Palestinian civil jurisdiction and Israeli military control (Area B), while 64.7% of the city's municipal territory, mostly agricultural lands and open spaces, is under Israeli civil and military control (Area C). Israel's construction of the barrier began in 2002 and isolates Qalqilya from the north, west, south, and half of its eastern side, leaving a corridor in the east connecting it with smaller Palestinian villages and hamlets. Israel states its construction of the wall is for security purposes, particularly to prevent infiltration by Palestinian militants into Israel as had occurred during the Second Intifada. The Palestinians state that the barrier is meant to annex Palestinian lands (since the wall often juts deep into Palestinian territory) and control the movement of Palestinians. The barrier has negatively affected Qalqilya's economy, particularly the commercial and trade sectors, because it has separated the city from nearby Palestinian localities and bordering Arab towns in Israel, which contributed about 40% of the city's income prior to the barrier's completion. The barrier has also separated 1,836 dunams of mostly agricultural lands and open spaces within Qalqilya's jurisdiction from the city proper. Social relations between Qalqilya's inhabitants and those of other Palestinian cities have also been hindered by the barrier. Education According to the 2007 PCBS census, 95.3% of the inhabitants over the age of 10 were literate. About 75% of the illiterate population were women. The town has 21 public schools, four private schools, three schools managed by UNRWA and 13 kindergartens. All schools are overseen by the Palestinian Ministry of Higher Education. As of 2012, there were 12,286 residents enrolled in school, with 660 teaching staff. In 2007, 10.5% of the population had graduated from an institution of higher education, while 15.7% had completed secondary education, 27.5% preparatory education, 27.4% elementary education and 13.8% had no formal education. There are two colleges in the city: the Ad Da'wa Islamic College established in 1978 and a campus of the Al-Quds Open University established in 1998.

She is the divine mother, called \\"The Bearer of the Greens\\". It is said that in times of famine, the Goddess Parvati comes down as Shakambhari and gives vegan food to the hungry. Shakambhari Devi is a wonderful form of Mother Adishakti Maa Parvati. They are also depicted as having octagonal arms on four sides and elsewhere. Mother is Bhuvaneshwari Parvati, the Adhishwari of the entire geosphere. This mother is called Vaishno, Chamunda, Kangra Wali, Jwala, Chintapurni, Kamakhya, Chandi, Bala Sundari, Mansa, Naina and Shatakshi. Maa Shakambhari is Raktadantika, Chinnamastika, Bhima, Bhramari and Sri Durga. There are many Siddha Peethas in the country of Mother Shri Shakambhari. In which Sakraypeeth and Sambhar Peeth are in Rajasthan and Saharanpur Peeth is in Uttar Pradesh. Maa Sri Shakambhari Bhagwati's very holy ancient proven Shaktipeeth is on the banks of a rainy river in the jungles of the Shivalik ranges. The description of which is found in the Puranas like Skanda Purana, Markandeya Purana, Bhagavata etc. This Shaktipeeth of Mother is the continual place of Goddess. It is said that Mother appeared in a self- proclaimed form here. According to public opinion, the first darshan of this Dham of Jagdamba parvati was done by a shepherd. The samadhi of which still remains in the temple premises. There is a law to see Bhuradev, the exclusive devotee of the Goddess here, before seeing the mother.  Etymology  The word śākaṃbharī means 'she who bears vegetables'. The word is derived from two words- śāka (Sanskrit: शाक) which means 'vegetable/vegan food' and bharī (Sanskrit: भरी) which means 'holder/bearer/wearer' which is ultimately derived from the root word bhṛ (Sanskrit: भृ) which means 'to bear/to wear/to nourish'.  Story  In old times, there was a great demon named Durgamasur he was very cruel. He, the son of Ruru, was born in the family of Hiranyaksha. Once he thought that he must attain the Vedas - the four books of worldly knowledge from the Gods and sages and he must get his fair share from fire sacrifices. Thus, he went to the Himalayas to perform penance. He meditated upon Brahma, and lived only on air. He practiced hard penance for one thousand years and the Gods and the demons and all the worlds were agitated by the power of his Tejas (fiery luster). Then the Lord, the four-faced Brahma, became pleased with him and mounted on his carrier, the Swan came to grant Durgamaasur the boon. Brahma said that he was pleased with Durgamaasur's penance and would grant his desired boon. Hearing this, the Demon got up from his penance and worshipping Him duly, asked Brahma to give him all the four books of Vedas. Hearing this, the Lord Brahma, the author of the four Vedas, granted the boon and went away. From that time, the sages forgot all about the Vedas. So bathing, twilights, daily rituals, faith, sacrifices, and Japam and other rites and performances, all became extinct. Then a cry of universal distress arose on the surface of this wide earth; the sages began to wonder how they forgot the Vedas and wondered where they went. Thus when great calamities befell on the earth, the Gods became gradually weaker and weaker, not getting their share of the sacrificial offerings. At this time, that demon invaded the city of heaven. And the Gods, not being able to fight with the demon fled in various directions. They took refuge in the caves of the mountain Sumeru and the inaccessible passes of the mountain and began to meditate on the Highest Force, the Great Goddess. When oblations of clarified butter are offered to the Fire, those get transferred to the Sun and get transformed as rains. So when the Homa ceremonies disappeared, there was the scarcity of rain. The earth became quite dry and not a drop of water was found anywhere. The wells, tanks, pools, rivers all were dried up. And this state of \\"no rains\\" lasted one hundred years. Countless people, hundreds and thousands of cows, buffaloes and other beasts went to the jaws of death. The dead bodies of persons remained in heaps in every house; persons would not be found to perform their burning ceremonies. When such calamities were seen, the calm and quiet body of the saints, in their earnestness to worship the Supreme Goddess, went to the Himalayas. They with their whole heart and without taking any food began to worship the Goddess daily with their penance, meditation and worship. The body of the saints thus praised and chanted the hymns of Maheshwari. There, Goddess Parvati went to Shivalik Hills(at present Shakambhari range Saharanpur) where Gods were praying to her. Gods informed her about the droughtful condition over the earth. Seeing the dreadful condition of the earth, she created innumerable eyes within Her body and became visible. Her colour was dark-blue (colour of the fourth dimension, space) like heaps of collyrium (eye-paint); eyes like the blue lotuses and expanded; breasts hard, regularly elevated round and so fleshy that they touched each other; two handed. She was the Essence of all Beauty, lovely, luminous like the thousand Suns, and the ocean of mercy. That Upholder of the Universe, showed Her form and began to shed waters from Her eyes. For nine nights continuously, the heavy rains poured down out of the waters flowing from Her eyes. Seeing the misery of all the people, out of pity, She showered incessantly tears from Her eyes; and all the people and medicines were satisfied. What more than this, out of those tears, the rivers began to flow. The Gods that remained hidden in the Shivalik mountain caves, now came out. Then the sages, united with the Gods, began to praise and sing hymns to the Goddess. Then, Shatakshi Devi transformed her appearance into a wonderful form, her eight hands held foods like grains, cereals, vegetables, greens, fruits and other herbs, she wore a beautiful garment, this new form of Goddess is known as Shakambhari. Hearing these words of the Gods and the saints, the Auspicious One gave them the vegetables, delicious fruits and roots to them that were on Her Hand, for their eating. After She was prayed, She gave to men sufficient quantity of various articles of juicy food and to the beasts, grass, etc., until new crops came out. From that day She became famous by the name of Shakambhari (because she nourished all by vegetables, etc.) Parvati got to know about Durgamasur's evil intentions, so she sent a lady messenger to make him to give the Vedas back to Brahma and also to give back the heaven to Indra. Durgamasur didn't want to, Parvati's messenger was angry and forced him to make preparations for his death. Great tumult arose and the demon Durgamasur heard all from the emissaries and started out to fight with his weapons and army. He took one thousand Aksauhini armies with him (one Aksauhini army equals large army consisting of 21,870 chariots, as many elephants, 65,610 horses, and 109,350 foot) and, shooting arrows, he came quickly before Parvati and invested Her and the God army and the saints. At this, a great tumultuous uproar arose and the Gods and the saints united exclaimed to Parvati to save them. Parvati then, for the safety of the Gods and the saints created round them a luminous circle and she herself remained outside. Goddess Parvati transformed her appearance. Now she looked ferocious in her new appearance. She was well equipped with all sorts of lethal weapons and was mounted on a lion. She thundered loudly and challenged Durgamasur. The terrible fight, then, ensued between the Goddess and the demons. The Sun was covered with their incessant hurling of arrows; and the shooters could not shoot accurately on account of the darkness that then prevailed. Then by the collision of the arrows of both the parties, the arrows caught fire and the battlefield again became filled with light. The quarters on all aides resounded with harsh bow sounds and nothing could be heard. At this moment, came out of the body of the Devi, the principal Shaktis (forces incarnate) named Kali, Tarini, Tripura Sundari, Bhuvaneshwari, Bhairavi, Chinnamasta, Dhumavati, Bagalamukhi, Matangi and Kamalatmika. The Navadurgas Shailaputri, Brahmacharini, Chandraghanta, Kushmanda, Skandamata, Katyayani, Kaalratri, Mahagauri, Siddhidatri and Matrikas Brahmani, Vaishnavi, Maheshwar, Kaumari, Indrani , Varahi, Narasimohi, Shivadooti, Chamundai also came out of the Goddess. Then Parameshwari, Gauri, Jagadamba, Bhagawati, Chandamari, Bhadrakali, Chandika, Kaushiki, Mahakali, Tridevi, Mahadevi, Ambika, Jagatjanani, Mateshwari, Uma, Narayani, Singhavahini, Aparajita, Vyaghravahini, Bhavani, Yudhadevi, Yogmaya, Mahamaya, Sherawali, Vindhyavasini, Raj Rajeshwari, Kalika, Gayatri, Shaambhavi, Bhramari, Jumadi, Akhilandeshwari, Kamakshi, Mahadurga, Prathyangira, Meenakshi, Ramchandi, Ishwari, Gatral, Bahuchara, Hingalaj, Nagbai, Varaki, Dhavdi, Sadhi, Hadkai, Vihat, Vaishnodevi, Mogal, Pithad, Meldi, Umiya, Momai, Amba, Khodiyar, Jagadhatri, Modheshwari, Guhyakali, Shitala and Raktachamunda came out from mother Parvati and joined in the war against Durgamasur. Jambhini, Mohini, Tripur and Shodashi came out the Goddess too. Some Yoginis named Aditi, Agneyei, Ajita, Aparna, Bhayankari, Bhimachandi, Chandi, Damani, Dhriti, Gandhari, Ganga (yogini), Jaya, Kapalini, Kauberi, Medha, Rati, Raudri, Rudrani, Saraswati (yogini), Sarvamangala, Shankari, Shanti, Siddhida, Swaha, Swadha, Varuni, Vijaya, Vrishaba Vahana and Yakshini came out from the Goddess as well. Also Mahasaraswati, Chandavigrah, Savitri and Trishi came out. Some other Goddesses named Mrityu Devi, Saranyu, Vayu Devi and Ganeshi came out of the Goddess successfully. When the Shaktis destroyed one hundred Aksauhini forces, Mridangas, conch-shells, lutes and other musical instruments were sounded in the battle-field. At this time, the enemy of the Gods, Durgamasur, came in front and first fought with the Shaktis. The fight grew to such a terrible extent that, within ten days, all the Aksauhini troops were destroyed. So much so as the blood of the dead soldiers began to flow in torrents like rivers. When the fatal eleventh day arrive the demon, wearing red clothes on his waist, red garlands on his neck and anointing his body all over with red sandal paste, celebrated a very grand festivity and mounted on his chariot and went out to fight. All the Shaktis of Goddess Parvati all merged into her body altogether. Then a terrible fight ensued for two Praharas (six hours). The hearts of all shivered with horror. At this time, the Goddess shot fifteen very awful arrows at the demon. His four horses were pierced by Her four arrows; the charioteer was pierced by one arrow; his two eyes were pierced by two arrows; his arms by two arrows, his flag by one arrow and his heart was pierced by five arrows. He then left his body before the Goddess, vomiting blood. The vital spirit, the luminous counterpart, emitting from his body, merged in the space-like body of the Goddess. The three worlds, then, assumed a peaceful appearance when that greatly powerful demon was killed. Then Hari, Hara, Brahma and the other Devas began to praise and chant hymns to the World Mother with great devotion and in voices, choked with feelings. Thus when Brahma, Vishnu, Hara and the other Gods praised and chanted various hymns to the Devi and worshipped Her with various excellent articles, she became instantly pleased. Then the Devi, graciously pleased, handed over the Vedas to the sages. At last, She, the Cuckoo-voiced, made a special address to them. She enlightened them all about the Vedas and advised them to read the excellent deeds of the Supreme Goddess, she will be pleased and will appear in any form and will destroy all dangers. Her name is Durga, because she has killed the wicked demon Durgamasur. Thus giving pleasures to the Gods by these words, the Devi of the nature of Existence, Intelligence and Bliss disappeared before them. Shakambari Mata, Sakarai, Rajasthan  Worship practices  There are many dhams like mother goddess Shakambhari. But the shade of Siddha Bhawan, which sits in the wild hills of Saharanpur, is somewhat unique. At the foot of the hill is the temple of Mother. After climbing fifteen steps, the mother's wonderful form is seen. The mother is seated with her four forms and child Ganesha on a marble platform on which silver is mounted. The beautiful costumes of the four forms of Mother are embellished with gold and silver apparitions. Bhima and Bhramari to the right of Mother and to the left and Shatakshi Devi are distinguished. This is the only temple in the country where four forms of Durga are seen together. Before seeing the mother, people have to see Bhura Dev Baba. Those who joined the Dewasur Sangram sacrificed their lives. Mata Jagadamba was pleased and gave a boon to Bhuradev that whoever comes to worship me will worship the first Bhuradev. Maa Shri Shakambhari Devi Ji is Sakshat Lakshmi Swaroopa. Shakambhari Devi appeared in a self-proclaimed form on the divine hills of Shivalik at the behest of Lord Vishnu. A detailed description of the form of Mata Shakambhari is found in the Murti Rahasya chapter of Durga Saptashati. The ancient temple of the goddess Shakambari is situated at Sakarai about 15 km from Udaipur Wati, which is about 29 km from Sikar(Rajasthan). There is also one same sakambhari mata temple at Pakaur (Jharkhand)as same in sakarai Rajasthan 150 km from Kolkata Two JAGRAN Night one in chaitra saptami night and one in durga puja saptami night every year, Also there are three temples of Mata Shakambari in Kolkata. Since tears rolled out from the eyes of the goddess continuously for 9 days and nights the biggest worship practice is the celebration of Navratra Mahotasav, held in the months of Chaitra and Aasoj for nine days each. Two more Navratras are also celebrated but they are known as \\"Gupt Navratras.\\" Every year in Vijayawada Durga Temple they celebrate Shakambari Utsavs for three days. On these days the goddess is decorated with vegetables and fruits. Major temples Shakambari Mandir Mumbai Shakumbhari Temple Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh The major temples of Shakambari include Shakambari Temple in Sakarai, Rajasthan,Sakambhari Mata Temple same as in Sakarai Rajasthan now at Pakaur (jharkhand) 150 km from Kolkatta, and Shakambari dham cuttack (cuttack, odissa) 30 km from Bhubneswar, Banashankari Amma Temple in Badami and in Bangalore, both in Karnataka state. There are many more temples to Shakambari in other parts of India, such as in Nagewadi, Maharashtra; near Satara; in Shakambari Devi near Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh, and in Sambhar in Rajasthan. According to a legend, the Sambhar Salt Lake was given to the people of that area some 2,500 years ago by the Goddess Shakambari. A small white temple in her honour stands under a rocky outcrop jutting into the lake.Sambhar Lake (Sambhar) This temple is more than 200 years old.In some regions Maa Shakambari Devi is worshipped for nine festive nights with utmost devotion. In Vijayawada Kanaka Durga Temple, Bhadrakali Temple in Warangal Andhra Pradesh Shakambari Navratras are celebrated jubilantly. Ashada Navratri are celebrated as Guhya Navratri in Himachal Pradesh.  Main Shaktipeeth Shakumbhari devi Shakti Peeth Shakumbhri, meaning the abode of Shakti Goddess Shakambari or Shakambari, is situated in the Jasmour village area, at a distance of 40 km to the north of Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh state of Northern India. Perched in the midst of the Shivalik mountain range, this temple is believed to have been Renovations during the rule of the Marathas.But this temple was built before the Maratha period . Some scholars consider it a temple of the Mahabharat time. Although the temple is very ancient This is the ancient source of all the temples of Shakambhari Devi. Twice a year, in the Ashwin and Chaitra months of the Hindu calendar (during the days of Navratra), the famous Shakumbhri Mela is organised. About one kilometer east of Shakumbari lies the Bhura Dev (BHAIRAV) temple which is considered to be the guard of Shakumbari Devi. Because of this all the devotees to Shakambari Devi first visit Bhura- Dev temple and then proceed to the temple of the goddess.This temple is main Shaktipeeth of Goddess Shakambhari. Another Shakumbhri Devi temple was built in 2013 on the sacred banks of river Ganga in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh. This temple is built inside the larger Anandeshwar Temple complex. The temple contains two idols as present in the main temple at Sakrai, Rajasthan, seated on a white marble platform. Members of the Shakumbhari Parivar at Kanpur look after the temple and organize various functions and festivals from time to time. The temple was built by the descendants of Late Mr. Bahadurmal Agarwal who worship Shakumbhari as their family deity. Shakambari temple is also located in Aurangabad. Various Puja are conducted in both the Navratri.

A typical highlighter is fluorescent yellow, coloured with pyranine. Different compounds, such as rhodamines (Rhodamine 6GD, Rhodamine B) are used for other colours. History A highlighter is a marker filled with transparent fluorescent ink instead of black or opaque ink. The first highlighter was invented by Dr. Frank Honn in 1962 and produced by Carter's Ink Company, using the trademarked name HI-LITER. Avery Dennison Corporation now owns the brand, having acquired Carter's Ink Company in 1975. Styles A pair of highlighters Many highlighters come in bright, often fluorescent and vibrant colors. Being fluorescent, highlighter ink glows under black light.Highlighter Ink Glowing Under a Black Light The most common color for highlighters is yellow, but they are also found in orange, red, pink, purple, blue, and green varieties. Some yellow highlighters may look greenish in colour to the naked eye. Yellow is the preferred color to use when making a photocopy as it will not produce a shadow on the copy. Yet, the use of different colour highlighters simultaneously can systematically make information even more organized and readable and in high contrast. Highlighters are available in multiple forms, including some that have a retractable felt tip or an eraser on the end opposite the felt. Other types of highlighters include the trilighter, a triangularly-shaped pen with a different-coloured tip at each corner, and ones that are stackable. There are also some forms of highlighters that have a wax-like quality similar to an oil pastel. \\"Dry highlighters\\" (occasionally called \\"dry line highlighters\\") have an applicator that applies a thin strip of highlighter tape (physically similar to audio tape) instead of a felt tip. Unlike standard highlighters, they are easily erasable. They are different from \\"dry mark highlighters\\", which are sometimes advertised as being useful for highlighting books with thin pages. \\"Gel highlighters\\" contain a gel stick rather than a felt tip. The gel does not bleed through paper or become dried out in the pen as other highlighters' inks may. \\"Liquid Highlighters\\" in a range of colours are also available, and because they put more ink on a page when highlighting, make words stand out more than with non- liquid types. Also the fact that more highlighting ink is put on the page with liquid highlighters means that the highlighting ink is much more resistive to fading with age. \\"Pastel Highlighters\\" uses pastel dyes instead of fluosent dyes.

Its leaves are used in many dishes in the Indian subcontinent. Often used in curries, the leaves are generally called by the name \\"curry leaves\\", although they are also actually \\"sweet neem leaves\\" in most Indian languages. Etymology and common names The species' generic name, Murraya koenigii, derives from Johann Andreas Murray (1740-1791), who studied botany under Carl Linnaeus and became a professor of medicine with an interest in herbalism at the University of Göttingen, Germany. Curry tree is also called curry leaf tree or curry bush, among numerous local names, depending on country.  Description  The small flowers are white and fragrant. Ripe and unripe fruits It is a small tree, growing 4–6 m (13–20 feet) tall, with a trunk up to diameter. The aromatic leaves are pinnate, with 11–21 leaflets, each leaflet long and broad. The plant produces small white flowers which can self-pollinate to produce small shiny-black drupes containing a single, large viable seed. The berry pulp is edible, with a sweet flavor.  Distribution and habitat  The tree is native to the Indian subcontinent. Commercial plantations have been established in India, and more recently Australia. It grows best in well-drained soils in areas with full sun or partial shade, preferably away from the wind. Growth is more robust when temperatures are at least 18°C (65°F).  Uses  The fresh leaves are an indispensable part of Indian cuisine and Indian traditional medicines. They are most widely used in southern and west coast Indian cooking, usually fried along with vegetable oil, mustard seeds and chopped onions in the first stage of the preparation. They are also used to make thoran, vada, rasam and kadhi.Chemical structure of girinimbine. The fresh leaves are valued as seasoning in the cuisines of South and Southeast Asia. In Cambodia, the leaves are called Sloek kontroap (ស្លឹកកត្រូប),http://angkorchef.com the leaves are roasted and used as an ingredient in a soup, maju krueng. In Java, the leaves are often stewed to flavor gulai. Though available dried, the aroma and flavor is greatly inferior. The oil can be extracted and used to make scented soaps. The leaves of Murraya koenigii are also used as a herb in Ayurvedic and Siddha medicine in which they are believed to possess anti-disease properties, but there is no high-quality clinical evidence for such effects.  Propagation  Seeds must be ripe and fresh to plant; dried or shriveled fruits are not viable. One can plant the whole fruit, but it is best to remove the pulp before planting in potting mix that is kept moist but not wet. Stem cuttings can be also used for propagation.  Chemical constituents  Compounds found in curry tree leaves, stems, bark, and seeds include cinnamaldehyde, and numerous carbazole alkaloids, including mahanimbine, girinimbine, and mahanine.

In physical geography, a channel is a type of landform consisting of the outline of a path of relatively shallow and narrow body of fluid, most commonly the confine of a river, river delta or strait. The word is cognate to canal, and sometimes takes this form, e.g. the Hood Canal. Formation Channel initiation refers to the site on a mountain slope where water begins to flow between identifiable banks.Bierman, R. B, David R. Montgomery (2014). Key Concepts in Geomorphology. W. H. Freeman and Company Publishers. United States. This site is referred to as the channel head and it marks an important boundary between hillslope processes and fluvial processes. The channel head is the most upslope part of a channel network and is defined by flowing water between defined identifiable banks. A channel head forms as overland flow and/or subsurface flow accumulate to a point where shear stress can overcome erosion resistance of the ground surface. Channel heads are often associated with colluvium, hollows and landslides. Overland flow is a primary factor in channel initiation where saturation overland flow deepens to increase shear stress and begin channel incision. Overland flows converge in topographical depressions where channel initiation begins. Soil composition, vegetation, precipitation, and topography dictate the amount and rate of overland flow. The composition of a soil determines how quickly saturation occurs and cohesive strength retards the entrainment of material from overland flows. Vegetation slows infiltration rates during precipitation events and plant roots anchor soil on hillslopes. Subsurface flow destabilizes soil and resurfaces on hillslopes where channel heads are often formed. This often results in abrupt channel heads and landslides. Hollows form due to concentrated subsurface flows where concentrations of colluvium are in a constant flux. Channel heads associated with hollows in steep terrain frequently migrate up and down hillslopes depending on sediment supply and precipitation. Natural channels Natural channels are formed by fluvial process and are found across the Earth. These are mostly formed by flowing water from the hydrological cycle, though can also be formed by other fluids such as flowing lava can form lava channels. Channels also describe the deeper course through a reef, sand bar, bay, or any shallow body of water. An example of a river running through a sand bar is the Columbia Bar--the mouth of the Columbia river. A stream channel is the physical confine of a stream (river) consisting of a bed and stream banks. Stream channels exist in a variety of geometries. Stream channel development is controlled by both water and sediment movement. There is a difference between low gradient streams (less than a couple of percent in gradient or slightly sloped) and high gradient streams (steeply sloped). A wide variety of stream channel types can be distinguished (e.g. braided rivers, wandering rivers, single-thread sinuous rivers etc.). During floods, water flow may exceed the capacity of the channel and flood waters will spill out of the channel and across the valley bottom, floodplain or drainage area. Examples of rivers that are trapped in their channels: Grand Canyon and Black Canyon of the Gunnison. In a larger nautical context, as a geographical place name, the term channel is another word for strait, which is defined as a relatively narrow body of water that connects two larger bodies of water. In this nautical context, the terms strait, channel, sound, and passage are synonymous and usually interchangeable. For example, in an archipelago, the water between islands is typically called a channel or passage. The English Channel is the strait between England and France. Waterflow channels The channel form is described in terms of geometry (plan, cross-sections, profile) enclosed by the materials of its bed and banks. This form is under influence of two major forces: water discharge and sediment supply. For erodible channels the mutual dependence of its parameters may be qualitatively described by Lane's Principle (also known as Lane's relationship):Lane, E.W. \\"The importance of fluvial morphology in hydraulic engineering\\", Proc. American Society of Civil Engineers, 1955, vol. 81, paper 745, pp. 533–551. the product of the sediment load and bed grain size is proportional to the product of discharge and channel slope. Nautical channels Lake George from the St. Johns River in Florida. It is especially used as a nautical term to mean the dredged and marked lane of safe travel which a cognizant governmental entity guarantees to have a minimum depth across its specified minimum width to all vessels transiting a body of water (see Buoy). The term not only includes the deep-dredged ship-navigable parts of an estuary or river leading to port facilities, but also to lesser channels accessing boat port-facilities such as marinas. When dredged channels traverse bay mud or sandy bottoms, repeated dredging is often necessary because of the unstable subsequent movement of benthic soils.History of the Waterways of the Atlantic Coast of the United States , USACE, January 1983 Responsibility for monitoring navigability conditions of navigation channels to various port facilities varies, and the actual maintenance work is frequently performed by a third party. Storms, sea-states, flooding, and seasonal sedimentation adversely affect navigability. In the U.S., navigation channels are monitored and maintained by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), although dredging operations are often carried out by private contractors (under USACE supervision). USACE also monitors water quality and some remediation. This was first established under the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 and modified under acts of 1913, 1935, and 1938. For example, the USACE developed the Intracoastal Waterway, and has the Mississippi Valley Division responsible for the Mississippi River from the Gulf to Cairo, Illinois, the North Atlantic Division for New York Harbor and Port of Boston, and the South Pacific Division for Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach. Waterways policing as well as some emergency spill response falls under United States Coast Guard jurisdiction, including inland channels serving ports like Saint Louis hundreds of miles from any coast. The various state or local governments maintain lesser channels, for example former Erie Canal. Extraterrestrial channels Extraterrestrial natural channels are found elsewhere in the Solar System than the Earth and the longest and widest of which are the outflow channels on Mars and the channels of Venus many of which are tens of kilometres wide (the network of channels flowing from Argyre Planitia on Mars for example is 8000 km in length and the Baltis Vallis Venus is 7000 km compared to the 6,650 km Nile, the largest active channel on Earth). The exact formation of these large ancient channels is unknown although it is theorised that those on Mars may have been formed due to catastrophic flooding and on Venus by lava flow. In planetary science the term \\"rille\\" is sometimes used for similar formations found on The Moon and Mercury that are of inconclusive origin. Channels have also been recently discovered on Titan. The Saturnian moon has the only known permanently active channels in the Solar System other than Earth, the largest known of which is 400 km in length.O'Neill, Ian.

The process involves the simultaneous delivery of all documents necessary to give effect to a transfer of securities in exchange for the receipt of the stipulated payment amount. Alternatively, it may involve transfers of two securities in such a way as to ensure that delivery of one security occurs if and only if the corresponding delivery of the other security occurs. This is done to avoid settlement risk such as where one party fails to deliver the security when the other party has already delivered the cash when settling a securities trade. History The market crash of October 1987 drew global attention to potential weaknesses in the standards applied for clearance and settlement. Numerous studies resulted, among which was one from the Group of Thirty which pioneered standards for providers of securities settlement services. The report included nine recommendations, one of which was that \\"Delivery versus payment (DvP) should be the method for settling all securities transactions with systems in place by 1992.\\" In December 1990, the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS), consisting of representatives from the major central banks, initiated further study of DVP. Its report in September 1992 found three ways of achieving DvP: # Transfer of securities and funds done on a trade-by-trade basis, with final transfer of securities occurring at the same time as the final transfer of funds; # Transfer of securities on a gross basis, with final transfer of securities occurring throughout the day, but funds transfer on a net basis at the end of the day; # Transfer of both securities and funds on a net basis, with final transfers occurring at the end of the day. Operational perspective From an operational perspective DVP is a sale transaction of negotiable securities (in exchange for cash payment) that can be instructed to a settlement agent using SWIFT Message Type MT 543 (in the ISO15022 standard). Use of such standard message types is intended to reduce risk in the settlement of a financial transaction, and enable automatic processing. Ideally, title to an asset and payment are exchanged simultaneously. This may be possible in many cases such as in a central depository system such as the United States Depository Trust Corporation. Non-DvP Non-DvP settlement processes typically expose the parties to settlement risk. They are known by a variety of names, including free delivery, free of payment or FOPhttp://www.vps.no/pub/stp-dvp-fop-what- does-it-mean/?lang=en delivery, or in the United States, delivery versus free.https://www.fanniemae.com/content/fact_sheet/dvp-dvf-comparison.pdf FOP settlement involves delivery of the securities without a simultaneous transfer of funds – hence 'free of payment'. Funds may either be remitted by other, mutually agreed means, or payment may not be made at all. This is the case in the transfer of securities gifted or inherited, or, in a country retaining paper securities certificates, in the dematerialisation of such securities, by transfer FOP into the name of the electronic custodian, with beneficial ownership retained by the transferor.

Version 2 (FFT2) covers battles from 1946 through 2010, while version 3 (FFT3) covers combined arms combat from 1915 to 2010. The latest edition is A Fistful of TOWs 3, published in print and e-book format in 2011. History Beard designed FFT to be faster and less focused on minutiae than existing modern wargames like Combined Arms by Game Designers' Workshop. Beard decided to design his own game after an eight-hour game of Combined Arms that resolved only four turns before a draw was declared so that the players could go home. Beard’s design process focused on the idea that there is a finite amount of detail before a game becomes unplayable. He designed FFT by rationing the amount of detail and abstracting anything not critical to the game. The result was that the vehicle combat system of FFT is fairly detailed, while the rules for artillery fire are abstract. He also focused design effort streamlining the game's subsystems to improve speed of play. Future planned additions to the series are FFT:2030, covering the hypothetical wars of the mid-21st century, and Railgun: 2100, covering science fiction armored combat. Design FFT is nominally a 1/285 or 1/300 scale game with a ground scale of 1\\":100 meters. Units are represented by stands of four to six vehicles or guns, or one platoon or squad of infantry, with an option to play with one stand representing one vehicle. Each turn represent four to six minutes of combat. Turns in FFT take about 10 minutes to play, and the design accommodates multiple players on a side to allow for larger battles to be played in the same amount of time as a two-player battle. A two-player battle between a US battalion task force and a Soviet regiment takes about one to three hours.

The Moscow Stoglav ('Hundred Chapters') Church Council of 1551 (Ph.D. diss., University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 1978). The book is shaped in the form of answers to some 100 questions posed by Ivan IV of Russia. A constant theme running through the chapters is the Byzantine symphonia (harmony) between the 'priesthood' and the 'kingdom'. The Book of Hundred Chapters canonized the native Muscovite rituals and practices at the expense of those accepted in Greece and other Orthodox countries. As a result this church code was never accepted by the Russian monks residing on Mount Athos.Steven Runciman. The Great Church in Captivity. Cambridge University Press, 1985. Page 329. In the mid-17th century, the Old Believers championed the Stoglav in order to undermine Patriarch Nikon's authority and his ecclesiastical reforms. The church council of 1667 condemned The Stoglav and its practices as heretical and banned the book from usage for 200 years. Cambridge History of Christianity: Volume 5, Eastern Christianity. Cambridge University Press, 2006. Page 320. This contributed to a great schism of the Russian church known as the Raskol. There are at least 100 manuscripts of the Stoglav, all of them produced by the Old Believers.

DVP stands for delivery versus payment. A party to a transaction pays for something when it is delivered. When there is a delivery from A to B, delivery is made by A, receipt is had by B. B, the party that receives, is obliged to make a payment. The issue revolves around: # the timing of the transaction # the value of the transaction, and # the trustworthiness of A and B. The ideal situation is timing is matched for delivery/receipt and payment without any lag or deferral. If A and B had previous dealings and are completely trustworthy, then they may not mind delay of one or two working days. Whereas if trust has not been established, delay of one hour means the transaction is non-DVP. In terms of value, the larger the value, the greater the urgency for everything to be completely wrapped up.

Henry Christopher McCook He spent his summers studying the behavior of ants and spiders. He published his observations and discoveries in a number of journals and books, as well as in a series of well-received illustrated children's books that explained the insects characteristics and traits in language and drawings for young minds. Many of McCook's books used illustrations drawn by Daniel Carter Beard, the founder of the Boy Scouts of America. In the summer of 1877, he travelled to Texas to study agricultural ants. Two years later, McCook wrote The Natural History of the Agricultural Ant of Texas. In 1889–93, he published his most ambitious work, American Spiders and Their Spinning Work, in three illustrated volumes. He also wrote a book on his ancestors in the Whiskey Rebellion, and delivered a number of papers on Civil War history at meetings of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States veterans organization. McCook was Vice President of both the American Entomological Society and the Academy of Natural Sciences. In 1880, Lafayette College conferred the degree of Doctor of Divinity to McCook. In 1895, he designed the official flag of the city of Philadelphia. He again served as an Army Chaplain during the Spanish–American War in 1898.

Santschi is known for his pioneering work on the navigational abilities of ants. In one experiment, he investigated the way harvester ants used the sky to navigate. He found that as long as even a small patch of sky was visible, the ants could return directly to the nest after gathering food. However, when the sky was completely hidden, they lost their sense of direction and began moving haphazardly. Some seventy years later it was shown that ants are guided by the polarization of light.

The Age of the Storytellers, The British Library and Oak Knoll Press, p. 196. 2006. though the first issue was on sale well before Christmas 1890. Its immediate popularity is evidenced by an initial sale of nearly 300,000. Sales increased in the early months, before settling down to a circulation of almost 500,000 copies a month, which lasted well into the 1930s. It was edited by Herbert Greenhough Smith from 1891 to 1930. The magazine's original offices were on Burleigh Street off The Strand, London. It was revived in 1998 as a quarterly magazine. Publication history The Strand Magazine was founded by George Newnes in 1890, and its first edition was dated January 1891. The magazine's original offices were located on Burleigh Street, off the Strand, London. The first editor was Herbert Greenhough Smith, who remained the editor until 1930. The magazine published factual articles in addition to fictional short stories and series. It was targeted at a mass market readership. The initial price of an issue was sixpence, about half the typical rate for comparable titles at the time. Initial sales were around 300,000, and circulation soon rose to half a million.Smith (2014), p. 153. The magazine also published a United States edition from February 1891 through February 1916. In its early years, the contents of the US edition were identical with those of the UK edition, though usually with a one-month time lag. As the years went on there were some differences in the contents of the two editions, reflecting fiction for which The Strand did not hold the US rights (such as The Return of Sherlock Holmes, which was commissioned by Collier's magazine) and non-fiction that would not interest most US readers (such as articles about personalities in the House of Commons). The circulation of the US edition was minimal in the early 1890s but was reported at 150,000 by 1898. The US edition was discontinued in 1916 due to logistical difficulties arising from World War I.See Philip G.

The American edition was edited by J. Walter Smith. The magazine format changed to the smaller digest size in October 1941.Ashley, p. 205. The Strand Magazine ceased publication in March 1950, forced out of the market by declining circulation and rising costs. Its last editor was Macdonald Hastings, distinguished war correspondent and later TV reporter and contributor to the Eagle boys' comic. In 1961 the magazine was briefly revived as The New Strand under the editorship of Noni Jabavu.Gcina Ntsaluba, \\"Call to restore Noni Jabavu legacy\\", Daily Dispatch, 31 January 2013; via PressReader.\\"New Strand Editor: Pick South African woman to revive Britain's 'most popular' magazine\\", Ebony, April 1962, pp. 81, 85. It was normally bound as six-monthly volumes, from January to June and July to December, but from the mid-1930s this varied, and the final volumes in the late 1940s ran from October to March and April to September, the final volume CXVIII (118) running from October 1949 to March 1950. The magazine was revived in 1998 in the USSmith (2014), p. 154. (see below). Fiction The Sherlock Holmes short stories by Arthur Conan Doyle were first published in The Strand in the UK. Some of the stories were previously or simultaneously published in US magazines,Smith (2014), p. 28. For examples, see pp. 178–179 (\\"The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax\\" and \\"The Adventure of the Dying Detective\\"). while several were first published in the United States in the US edition of The Strand Magazine a month after being published in the UK edition.Smith (2014), p. 28. For examples, see pp. 44–45 (\\"The Red-Headed League\\" and \\"A Case of Identity\\"). 38 of the Sherlock Holmes stories, including The Hound of the Baskervilles, were illustrated by Sidney Paget in The Strand. Paget's illustrations helped form the popular image of Holmes. With the serialisation of Doyle's The Hound of the Baskervilles, sales reached their peak. Readers lined up outside the magazine's offices, waiting to get the next installment. Doyle also wrote other stories that were published in The Strand Magazine. A number of short stories by Agatha Christie were first published in The Strand in the UK, such as the Hercule Poirot stories collected in The Labours of Hercules. Many short stories by P. G. Wodehouse, including most of Wodehouse's Jeeves short stories, were first published in The Strand in the UK (some were published earlier or in the same month in US magazines). Other contributors included E. W. Hornung, Graham Greene, Rudyard Kipling, W. Somerset Maugham, E. Nesbit, Dorothy L. Sayers, Georges Simenon, Leo Tolstoy, and H. G. Wells, as well as Grant Allen, Margery Allingham, J. E. Preston Muddock, E. C. Bentley, Mary Angela Dickens, C. B. Fry, Walter Goodman, W. W. Jacobs, Arthur Morrison, Edgar Wallace, Max Beerbohm, and Dornford Yates. Puzzles and non-fiction In addition to the many fiction pieces and illustrations, The Strand has been also known for some time as the source of ground-breaking brain teasers, under a column called \\"Perplexities\\", first written by Henry Dudeney. Dudeney introduced many new concepts to the puzzle world, including the first known crossnumber puzzle, in 1926. In that same year, Dudeney produced an article, \\"The Psychology of Puzzle Crazes\\", reflecting and analysing the demand for such works. He edited Perplexities from 1910 until he died in 1930. G. H. Savage became the column's editor, soon to be joined by William Thomas Williams (as W. T. Williams), who in 1935 authored the best-known cross-figure puzzle of today. The puzzle goes by many names, the original being \\"The Little Pigley Farm\\". It has also been known as \\"Dog's Mead\\", \\"Little Pigley\\", \\"Little Piggly Farm\\", \\"Little Pigsby\\", \\"Pilgrims’ Plot\\", and \\"Dog Days\\". Some articles by Winston Churchill were published in the magazine. Once a sketch drawn by Queen Victoria of one of her children appeared with her permission. Cover The magazine's iconic cover, an illustration looking eastwards down London's Strand towards St Mary-le- Strand, with the title suspended on telegraph wires, was the work of Victorian artist and designer George Charles Haité. The initial cover featured a corner plaque showing the name of Burleigh Street, home to the magazine's original offices. The lettering on the plaque in Haité's design was later changed when Newnes moved to the adjacent address of Southampton Street. A variation of the same design was featured on the cover of a sister title, The Strand Musical Magazine. 1998 revival The Strand was brought back into publication in 1998 as a quarterly magazine, now based in Birmingham, Michigan. It has published fiction by many well-known writers including John Mortimer, Ray Bradbury, Alexander McCall Smith, Ruth Rendell, Colin Dexter, Edward Hoch, James Grippando, and Tennessee Williams. The magazine also features stories from emerging crime and mystery writers in addition to stories by established writers.Smith (2014), p. 154.

They released two studio albums, The Smiler with a Knife (1989) and Sensory (1990), before disbanding in early 1992. They subsequently reformed in 1998, 2005 and 2016.  History  Toys Went Berserk were formed in Sydney in December 1985 by Lesley-Anne \\"Coo\\" Bennett on lead vocals and piano (ex- Lavender Disaster), Andy Jarvis on guitar (ex-Dusk Furrow), Mark Nicholson on drums (ex-Happy Hate Me Nots), Bill Quarry on bass guitar (ex-Box of Fish), and Steve Turbit on guitar. Lavender Disaster were a Perth-based band with Coo Bennett on lead vocals, Brett Ford on drums, Peter Hartley on guitar and Danny Vervest on bass. Both Ford and Hartley were later members of the Kryptonics and Lubricated Goat. Bruce Griffiths told Steve Gardner of Noise for Heroes that the group, \\"sounded like a 'tough Blondie'.\\" According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, Toys Went Berserk \\"derived [their] moniker from a lyric line in the Siouxsie and the Banshees song 'Spellbound'.\\" They provided energetic live performances and their music (comparable to bands such as Skeletal Family, Siouxsie and the Banshees and Xmal Deutschland), which was quite distinctive in the Sydney scene of the time. Gardner opined, \\"They aren't like the standard Sydney band, influenced by Detroit music, 'Burn My Eye' T-shirt on back, stacks of Marshalls behind them. They have other influences. As opposed to big distorted power chords or strong leads, the guitar tends to be more in the way of textured, treated chords; very echo-ey. The drumming is inventive yet driving, with many interesting touches to add spice to standard beats. The bass tends to be mixed back, while Coo's vocal provide a large part of the character and melody to the songs.\\" The group's first recorded track, \\"One Day (My Head Is Going to Explode)\\", appeared on a various artists' four-track extended play, Trousers in Action No. 2 (August 1986), via Aberrant Records. It was previously performed by Lavender Disaster and was written by Coo's brother Phil Bennett; Note: For additional work user may have to select 'Search again' and then 'Enter a title:' or 'Performer:' it was recorded at Sound Barrier studios in June with Jonathan Summers as audio engineer. This was followed by their debut single, \\"Guns at My Head\\" (October), which had been recorded at the same session as \\"One Day\\" and in early 1987 by an 8 song double 12\\" EP \\"Pieces\\", also recorded at Sound Barrier. In June 1987 Turbit was replaced on guitar by Carolyn Polley. Toys Went Berserk issued their debut studio album, The Smiler with a Knife, on 7 November 1989 with Rob Younger (Died Pretty, Dubrovniks, The Plunderers) producing at Trafalgar Studios in June and July of that year. Gardner felt, \\"[it] features the sort of clear and solid sound that he's becoming famous for. Yet the band had a lot of misgivings about using him at first; they are not at all interested in the Detroit sound, and they associated Younger with that through his Birdman past. And although the new lp certainly isn't a Detroit metal record, there's no question it has a tougher, more immediate sound.\\" Before the album appeared Polley had left to join indie rockers Big Heavy Stuff – Toys Went Berserk continued as a four-piece. They released numerous records, including six singles and three albums (two on vinyl and one CD), and toured in the United States and Australia. Their goth-influenced version of Led Zeppelin's \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" was featured on Andrew Denton's ABC-TV program, The Money or the Gun, and was later released on a various artists' compilation album, Stairways to Heaven (1993). The band recorded their second studio album, Sensory(1990), at Fort Apache Studios, near Boston, with Gary Smith (Throwing Muses, Pixies, the Chills) in August. They returned to the US in the following year to tour. They have supported international acts the Cramps, the Sugarcubes, the Fall, Dinosaur Jr. and the Selector during their six-year lifetime. Toys Went Berserk split in early 1992.  Afterwards  Following the break-up of Toys Went Berserk, Bennett and Jarvis, who were domestic partners, moved to England and started new bands, Feast (1993–98) and then Houdini (1998–2001). In late 2003 they returned to Perth to start their own record label, Trickster Music and released an album as Houdini Twins. Toys Went Berserk have regrouped for reunion shows: firstly in 1998, then in 2005, to promote the release of a new compilation double album, The Bitter & the Sweet: Best and Rarest. It includes most of their studio releases, plus selected demos and live recordings. In 2016 the band performed a joint 30th anniversary show in Sydney, with contemporaries, Ratcat. Bennett and Jarvis continued in other Perth-based outfits, Rocket to Memphis (RTM) and Catzilla. RTM released four CDs of swamp, rockabilly and garage rock n roll music, Swampwater Shuffle (2007), Hip-Shakin' Voodoo (2009), \\"Jungle Juice\\" (2011) and \\"Do the Crawl\\" (2013) and two vinyl singles, \\"I'm Bad\\" (2011) and \\"Go Go\\" (2013), whilst also touring in Japan and the United Kingdom. Catzilla play garage rock n roll, featuring Bennett on vocals and keyboards and Jarvis on guitar. They released a vinyl EP, Going Wild (2016), a self-titled album in 2017 and have also toured in Japan.

He became known for his work Die Heiden von Kummerow (The Heathens of Kummerow) and used Thomas Trimm as a pseudonym. Life Welk was born as the son of a farmer in Biesenbrow (now part of Angermünde), Brandenburg. After frequenting the village school, the 16-year-old moved away from home, completed a commercial education, worked on the sea and as a journalist for several papers, e.g. in Brunswick for the Braunschweiger Allgemeiner Anzeiger, whose editor-in-chief he was from 1910 on to 1919. Afterwards, he worked for the Braunschweiger Morgenzeitung. During these times, Welk experienced the German Revolution in Brunswick. His experiences later built the background for the novel Im Morgennebel, that describes true Brunswick events and people of these times in a not much encrypted way. This novel's manuscript, that employed Welk for a long time, was already finished in 1940 but not published until 1953 in East Germany In 1922 Welk traveled to the United States and Latin America. One year later, he went back to Weimar Germany and worked as a writer and journalist, mainly in Berlin and neighbourhood. Two revolutionary dramas, Gewitter über Gotland (1926) and Kreuzabnahme (1927), caused scandals and had to be taken out of the theatres' repertoires – despite their popular success. In 1934, one year after Hitler's Machtergreifung, Welk, under the pseudonym Thomas Trimm, wrote an open letter in the Grüne Post titled Auf ein Wort, Herr Minister, in which he criticised Nazi press censorship under Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels. The writer was then arrested and imprisoned in KZ Oranienburg for a short while. After his discharge (that was mainly due to protests by foreign journalists), he was banned from his profession. In 1935, Welk settled in the Spreewald with his wife Agathe Lindner, who was also a writer; she is known for her novel Juliane Wied and was together with Welk from 1924 until his death. Despite the ban, Welk began writing again, but only wrote – seemingly – \\"unpolitical books\\". In this era, his successful novels Die Heiden von Kummerow (1937), Die Lebensuhr des Gottlieb Grambauer (1938), and Die Gerechten von Kummerow (1943) were born. These novels described life in northern Germany's villages in a humorous way. It is supposed today that the character Martin Grambauer wears autobiographical traces of his author, while Gottlieb Grambauer is a tribute to the author's father. After 1945, Welk ceased his literary work for a few years. He stayed in East Germany and founded six Volkshochschulen (adult education centres) in Mecklenburg. In 1946, he became director of a Volkshochschule in Schwerin. In 1950, Welk moved to Bad Doberan and began with writing again. He received several awards of the GDR (e.g. the Nationalpreis in 1954), and became an honorary citizen of the towns Bad Doberan and Angermünde. At the University of Greifswald, he became an honorary doctor in 1956 and professor of the philosophy faculty in 1964. Welk died in 1966 in Bad Doberan. Censorship Before World War II Welk was often compared with the \\"hunger priest\\" Wilhelm Raabe and with Gustav Freytag. In the GDR Die Heiden von Kummerow and Die Gerechten von Kummerow were his most popular works; they were seen as a German pendant to Guareschi's narrations about Don Camillo and Peppone. The film Die Heiden von Kummerow und ihre lustigen Streiche was, in 1967, one of the rare co-productions of the GDR and West Germany. DEFA made another movie of the book in 1982. The rest of Welk's works were republished by the GDR after his death, but some of them were modified deeply. It is not clear whether Welk wanted to remove Nazi- adopted text or censored himself because of being influenced by upcoming new dictatorship or GDR editors made modifications. Compared to the first edition of Die Heiden von Kummerow, for instance, later releases were anti-military in nature. Several words (\\"König\\" instead of \\"General\\", \\"hottentotisch\\" instead of \\"polnisch\\") were changed, as were contents and motives. Christian and biblical elements were replaced by belief in revolution and class conflict. For instance, Krischan's humbleness when he is banished from the village is not Christian anymore, but self-accusing- he accuses himself of not having supported the revolt of the seamen.

Royal Society of Arts, 1970. p. 445 possibly the historical Alexandria on the Oxus (), possibly later named Eucratidia, Εὐκρατίδεια) was one of the primary cities of the Greco- Bactrian Kingdom from circa 280 BCE, and of the Indo-Greek kings when they ruled both in Bactria and northwestern India, from the time of Demetrius I (200-190 BCE) to the time of Eucratides (170–145 BCE). Previous scholars have argued that Ai Khanoum was founded in the late 4th century BC, following the conquests of Alexander the Great. Recent analysis now strongly suggests that the city was founded c. 280 BC by the Seleucid emperor Antiochus I Soter. The city is located in Takhar Province, northern Afghanistan, at the confluence of the Panj River and the Kokcha River, both tributaries of the Amu Darya, historically known as the Oxus, and at the doorstep of South Asia. Ai-Khanoum was one of the focal points of Hellenism in the East for nearly two centuries until its annihilation by nomadic invaders around 145 BCE about the time of the death of Eucratides I.Bernard, P.

Harmatta, János, ed., 1994. Paris: UNESCO Publishing. , p. 103.  Discovery  On a hunting trip in the 1960s, the Afghan Khan Gholam Serwar Nasher discovered ancient artefacts of Ai Khanom and invited Princeton archaeologist Daniel Schlumberger with his team to examine Ai- Khanoum.https://www.persee.fr/doc/crai_0065-0536_2001_num_145_2_16315 It was soon found to be the historical Alexandria on the Oxus, also possibly later named اروکرتیه Arukratiya or Eucratidia), one of the primary cities of the Greco-Bactrian kingdom. Some of those artefects were displayed in Europe and USA museums in 2004. The site was subsequently excavated through archaeological work by a French Archaeological Delegation in Afghanistan (DAFA) mission under between 1964 and 1978, as well as Soviet scientists. The work had to be abandoned with the onset of the Soviet–Afghan War, during which the site was looted and used as a battleground, leaving very little of the original material. In 2013, the film-maker David Adams produced a six-part documentary mini-series about the ancient city entitled Alexander's Lost World.  Strategic location  Ai-Khanoum was located at the extreme east of Bactria, at the doorstep of the Maurya Empire in India. The choice of this site for the foundation of a city was probably guided by several factors. The region, irrigated by the Oxus, had a rich agricultural potential. Mineral resources were abundant in the back country towards the Hindu Kush, especially the famous so-called \\"rubies\\" (actually, spinel) from Badakshan, and gold. Its location at the junction between Bactrian territory and nomad territories to the north, ultimately allowed access to commerce with the Chinese empire. Lastly, Ai-Khanoum was located at the very doorstep of Ancient India, allowing it to interact directly with the Indian subcontinent.  Greek city in Bactria  Plan of Ai-Khanoum Numerous artefacts and structures were found, pointing to a high Hellenistic culture, combined with Eastern influences. \\"It has all the hallmarks of a Hellenistic city, with a Greek theatre, gymnasium and some Greek houses with colonnaded courtyards\\" (Boardman). Overall, Aï-Khanoum was an extremely important Greek city (1.5 sq kilometer), characteristic of the Seleucid Empire and then the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom. It seems the city was destroyed, never to be rebuilt, about the time of the death of the Greco- Bactrian king Eucratides around 145 BC. Ai-Khanoum may have been the city in which Eucratides was besieged by Demetrius, before he successfully managed to escape to ultimately conquer India (Justin). = Architecture = Corinthian capital, found at Ai-Khanoum in the citadel by the troops of Commander Massoud, 2nd century BC. The mission unearthed various structures, some of them perfectly Hellenistic, some other integrating elements of Persian architecture: *Two-miles long ramparts, circling the city *A citadel with powerful towers (20 × 11 metres at the base, 10 meters in height) and ramparts, established on top of the 60 meters-high hill in the middle of the city *A Classical theater, 84 meters in diameter with 35 rows of seats, that could sit 4,000-6,000 people, equipped with three loges for the rulers of the city. Its size was considerable by Classical standards, larger than the theater at Babylon, but slightly smaller than the theater at Epidaurus. *A huge palace in Greco-Bactrian architecture, somehow reminiscent of formal Persian palatial architecture *A gymnasium (100 × 100m), one of the largest of Antiquity. A dedication in Greek to Hermes and Herakles was found engraved on one of the pillars. The dedication was made by two men with Greek names (Triballos and Strato, son of Strato). *Various temples, in and outside the city. The largest temple in the city apparently contained a monumental statue of a seated Zeus, but was built on the Zoroastrian model (massive, closed walls instead of the open column-circled structure of Greek temples). *A mosaic representing the Macedonian sun, acanthus leaves and various animals (crabs, dolphins etc...) *Numerous remains of Classical Corinthian columns File:AntefixSharp.jpgArchitectural antefixae with Hellenistic \\"Flame palmette\\" design, Ai-Khanoum. File:SunDialAiKhanoum.jpgSun dial within two sculpted lion feet. File:Ai Khanum Antefix from the administrative palace.jpgWinged antefix, a type only known from Ai-Khanoum. File:Ai-Khanoum mosaic.jpgAi-Khanoum mosaic. = Sculptural remains = High-relief of a naked man in contrapposto, wearing a chlamys. Ai-Khanoum, 2nd century BC. Various sculptural fragments were also found, in a rather conventional, classical style, rather impervious to the Hellenizing innovations occurring at the same time in the Mediterranean world. Of special notice, a huge foot fragment in excellent Hellenistic style was recovered, which is estimated to have belonged to a 5-6 meter tall statue (which had to be seated to fit within the height of the columns supporting the Temple). Since the sandal of the foot fragment bears the symbolic depiction of Zeus' thunderbolt, the statue is thought to have been a smaller version of the Statue of Zeus at Olympia. Also found among the sculptural remains were: *A statue of a standing female in a rather archaic chiton *The face of a man, sculpted in stucco *An unfinished statue of a young naked man with wreath *A gargoyle head representing the Greek cook-slave *A frieze of a naked man, possibly the god Hermes, wearing a chlamys *A hermaic sculpture of an old man thought to be a master of the gymnasium, where it was found. He used to hold a long stick in his left hand, symbol of his function. Due to the lack of proper stones for sculptural work in the area of Ai-Khanoum, unbaked clay and stucco modeled on a wooden frame were often used, a technique which would become widespread in Central Asia and the East, especially in Buddhist art. In some cases, only the hands and feet would be made in marble. File:Ai Khanoum Portrait of a man, found in the administrative palace.jpgthumb200pxStucco face found in the administrative palace.

Ai-Khanoum, 2nd century BC. =Epigraphic remains= Various inscriptions in Classical, non- barbarized, Greek have been found in Ai-Khanoum. *On a Herõon (funerary monument), identified in Greek as the tomb of Kineas (also described as the oikistes (founder) of the Greek settlement) and dated to 300-250 BC, an inscription has been found describing Delphic maxims: Stone block with the inscriptions of Kineas. Ai-Khanoum, 2nd century BC. :παῖς ὢν κόσμιος γίνου, :ἡβῶν ἐγκρατής, :μέσος δίκαιος, :πρεσβύτης εὔβουλος, :τελευτῶν ἄλυπος.Greek Culture in Afghanistan and India: Old Evidence and New Discoveries, Shane Wallace, 2016, p.215 :\\"Païs ôn kosmios ginou (As children, learn good manners) :hèbôn enkratès, (as young men, learn to control the passions) :mesos dikaios (in middle age, be just) :presbutès euboulos (in old age, give good advice) :teleutôn alupos. (then die, without regret.)\\" The precepts were placed by a Greek named Clearchos, who may or may not have been Clearchus of Soli the disciple of Aristotle,Greek Culture in Afghanistan and India: Old Evidence and New Discoveries, Shane Wallace, 2016, p.217 who, according to the same inscription, had copied them from Delphi: :ἀνδρῶν τοι σοφὰ ταῦτα παλαιοτέρων ἀνάκει[τα]ι :ῥήματα ἀριγνώτων Πυθοὶ ἐν ἠγαθέαι· :ἔνθεν ταῦτ[α] Κλέαρχος ἐπιφραδέως ἀναγράψας :εἵσατο τηλαυγῆ Κινέου ἐν τεμένει. :\\"These wise commandments of men of old :- Words of well-known thinkers - stand dedicated :In the most holy Pythian shrine :From there Klearchos, having copied them carefully, set them up, shining from afar, in the sanctuary of Kineas\\" Inscription on one of the vases from the Ai-Khanoum treasury. *Remains of some papyrus manuscripts, the imprint of which were left in the thin earth of brick walls, containing unknown philosophical dialogues on the theory of ideas, thought to be the only surviving remain of an Aristotelian dialogue, possibly the Sophist, where Xenocrates, another philosopher, present his theory of ideas.Claude Rapin, \\"De l'Indus à l'Oxus\\", . Also full description of the papyrii (French)original text and French translation *Various Greek inscriptions were also found in the Treasury of the palace, indicating the contents (money, imported olive oil...) of various vases, and names of the administrators in charge of them. The hierarchy of these administrators appears to be nearly identical to that in the Mediterranean Greek areas. From the names mentioned in these inscriptions, it appears that the directors of the Treasury were Greek, but that lower administrators had Bactrian names. Three signatories had Greek names (Kosmos, Isidora, Nikeratos), one a Macedonian or Thracian name (Lysanias), and two Bactrian names (Oxuboakes, Oxubazes). One of these economic inscriptions relates in Greek the deposit of olive oil jars in the treasury: :\\"In the year 24, on ....; :an olive oil (content); :the partially empty (vase) A (contains) oil transferred from :two jars by Hippias :the hemiolios; and did seal: :Molossos (?) for jar A, and Strato (?) for jar B (?)\\" The last of the dates on these jars has been computed to 147 BC, suggesting that Ai-Khanoum was destroyed soon after that date. =Artefacts= Plate depicting Cybele pulled by lions, a votive sacrifice and the Sun God. Ai-Khanoum, 2nd century BC. Numerous Greco-Bactrian coins were found, down to Eucratides, but none of them later. Ai-Khanoum also yielded unique Greco-Bactrian coins of Agathocles, consisting of six Indian- standard silver drachms depicting Hindu deities. These are the first known representations of Vedic deities on coins, and they display early Avatars of Vishnu: Balarama-Samkarshana and Vasudeva-Krishna, and are thought to correspond to the first Greco-Bactrian attempts at creating an Indian-standard coinage as they invaded northern India. Among other finds: *A round medallion plate describing the goddess Cybele on a chariot, in front of a fire altar, and under a depiction of Helios *A fully preserved bronze statue of Herakles *Various golden serpentine arm jewellery and earrings *Some Indian artefacts, found in the treasure room of the city, probably brought back by Eucratides from his campaigns *A toilet tray representing a seated Aphrodite *A mold representing a bearded and diademed middle-aged man Various artefacts of daily life are also clearly Hellenistic: sundials, ink wells, tableware. An almost life-sized dark green glass phallus with a small owl on the back side and other treasures are said to have been discovered at Ai-Khanoum, possibly along with a stone with an inscription, which was not recovered. The artefacts have now been returned to the Kabul Museum after several years in Switzerland by Paul Bucherer-Dietschi, Director of the Swiss Afghanistan Institute.Source, BBC News, Another article.

Trade with the Mediterranean The presence of olive oil jars at Ai-Khanoum indicates that this oil was imported from the Mediterranean, as its only possible source would have been the Aegean Basin or Syria. This suggests important trade contacts with the Mediterranean, through long and expensive land routes.Frölich, p.10 Contacts with India The Indian plate found in Ai- Khanoum, thought to represent the myth of Kunala (with reconstitution). Coin of Greco-Bactrian king Agathocles with Indian deities. Several Indian artefacts were found among the archaeological remains of Ai-Khanoum, especially a narrative plate made of shell inlaid with various materials and colors, thought to represent the Indian myth of Kuntala.\\"Afghanistan, tresors retrouves\\", p150 Also, numerous Indian punch-marked coins were found.Joe Cribb, Investigating the introduction of coinage in India, Journal of the Numismatic Society of India xlv Varanasi 1983 pp.89 The equatorial sun dial adjusted to the latitude of Ujjain, Ai-Khanoum, 3rd-2nd century BC. In Ai- Khanoum remarkable Greek coins were also found, of one of the last Greco- Bactrian kings, Agathocles of Bactria (ruled 190-180 BCE). They are Indian- standard square coins bearing the representations of Indian deities, which have been variously interpreted as Vishnu, Shiva, Vasudeva, Buddha or Balarama. Altogether, six such Indian-standard silver drachmas in the name of Agathocles were discovered at Ai-Khanoum in 1970.Alexander the Great and Bactria: The Formation of a Greek Frontier in Central Asia, Frank Lee Holt, Brill Archive, 1988, p.2Iconography of Balarāma, Nilakanth Purushottam Joshi, Abhinav Publications, 1979, p.22The Hellenistic World: Using Coins as Sources, Peter Thonemann, Cambridge University Press, 2016, p.101 Some other coins by Agathocles are also thought to represent the Buddhist lion and the Indian goddess Lakshmi. =Influence on Indian art= One of the Hellenistic-inspired \\"flame palmettes\\" and lotus designs, which may have been transmitted through Ai-Khanoum. Rampurva bull capital, India, circa 250 BCE. According to John Boardman, Ai-Khanoum may have been one of the conduits for some art influence into ancient India, though these influences and their sources are \\"not always properly identified or yet identifiable\\". There are three competing scholarly views: one originated by early scholars such as Percy Brown where Indian architecture was due to immigration of western craftsmen, second by later scholars such as John Irwin who favor mostly indigenous inspiration and third such as S.P. Gupta who favor a combination. Persia, states Boardman, did not have a stone tradition of its own that can be traced, but there is evidence that \\"Persian bases of a plain half round torus\\" combined with Corinthian capitals existed there, and there is evidence that India had an intricate wooden architecture tradition about the same time. It is possible that Ai- Khanoum, a Greek city of Bactria in 3rd-century BCE, could have provided the conduit to connect the Hellenistic and Indian artists. However, Persepolis fell about 80 years before the first Buddhist stone architecture appeared, which leaves the question whether knowledge was preserved over the generations between Persepolis to the west of Ai-Khanoum and the Mauryans to its east.John Boardman (1998), \\"The Origins of Indian Stone Architecture\\", Bulletin of the Asia Institute, p.13-22 Numismatics Gold stater of the Seleucid king Antiochus I Soter minted at Ai-Khanoum, c. 275 BCE. Obverse: Diademed head of Antiochus. Reverse: Nude Apollo seated on omphalos, leaning on bow and holding two arrows. Greek legend: ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ ΑΝΤΙΟΧΟΥ (of King Antiochos). Δ monogram of Ai-Khanoum in left field. The symbol found on a brick in Ai-Khanoum. Many Seleucid and Bactrian coins were found at Ai-Khanoum, as were ten blank planchets, indicating that there was a mint in the city.Brian Kritt: Seleucid Coins of Bactria, p. 22. Ai-Khanoum apparently had a city symbol (a triangle within a circle, with various variations), which was found imprinted on bricks coming from the oldest buildings of the city. The same symbol was used on various Seleucid eastern coins, suggesting that they were probably minted in Ai-Khanoum. Numerous Seleucid coins were thus reattributed to the Ai-Khanoum mint rather recently, with the conclusion that Ai-Khanoum was probably a larger minting center than even Bactra.\\"Seleucid coins of Bactria\\", Brian Kritt The coins found in Ai-Khanoum start with those of Seleucus, but end abruptly with those of Eucratides, suggesting that the city was conquered at the end of his rule. Nomadic invasions The invading Indo-European nomads from the north (the Scythians and then the Yuezhi) crossed the Oxus and subdued Bactria about 135 BC. It is likely that the city itself fell during a major siege, due to the presence of arrowheads in the city walls alongside a colossal stone projectile in the main cathedral, suggesting that the invaders had the means of constructing siege weaponry. It seems the city was totally abandoned between 140 and 120 BC following the Yuezhi invasion. There is evidence of huge fires in all the major buildings of the city, however there remains evidence that the city was temporarily re-inhabited following the fire prior to being totally abandoned. Ai-Khanoum was likely affected as many nomadic invasions passed through across through the Hindu Kush passes. In 1838 a Lieutenant Wood heard local people refer to the site as \\"Barbarrah\\".Llewelyn Morgan, \\"Greeks on the Edge\\" (review of Rachel Mairs, The Hellenistic Far East: archaeology, language and identity in Greek Central Asia), Times Literary Supplement 11 September 2015 page 25. As with other archaeological sites such as Begram or Hadda, the Ai-Khanoum site has been pillaged during the long phase of war in Afghanistan since the fall of the Communist government. Significance Ai-Khanoum was located at the very doorstep of India. Indian Emperor Ashoka addressed the Greeks of the region circa 258 BC in the Kandahar Edict of Ashoka, a bilingual inscription in Greek and Aramaic. Kabul Museum. The findings are of considerable importance, as no remains of the Greco-Bactrian and Indo-Greek civilizations had been uncovered in the East (beyond the abundant coinage) until this discovery, which led some to speak of a \\"Bactrian mirage.\\" Ai-Khanoum was a center of Hellenistic culture at the doorstep of India, and there was a strong reciprocal awareness between the two areas. A few years after the foundation of the city, around 258 BC, the Indian Emperor Ashoka was carving a rock inscription in Greek and Aramaic addressed to the Greeks in the region, the Kandahar Edict of Ashoka, in the nearby city of Kandahar. The discovery of Ai-Khanoum also gives a new perspective on the influence of Greek culture in the East, and reaffirms the influence of the Greeks on the development of Greco-Buddhist art.

Derived from Chrysler's L-cars, the Plymouth Horizon and Dodge Omni, the platform was developed just as the company faltered in the market, at first underpinning a modest range of compact/mid- size sedans and wagons—and eventually underpinning nearly fifty different models, including all-wheel drive variants—and playing a vital role in the company's subsequent resurgence. Common platforms Use of a common platform is a widely used practice for reducing the number of parts and engineering time. Before creating the K platform, Chrysler was building vehicles from a small number of common platforms (e.g. F/L/J/M and R); however there were very few common parts among the different models. Chrysler CEO Lee Iacocca claimed that the huge number of parts in inventory and the complexity of building many completely different versions of vehicles was one reason Chrysler was losing money, and directed the engineers to focus on making a smaller number of common parts where they would not be visible to customers; this was already common practice in Japan and Germany and would help to make the K-cars profitable even at low prices.Iacocca, L:\\"Iacocca\\" Arriving on the brink of Chrysler's near certain financial collapse, the new platform had a dramatic effect, helping Chrysler report a profit in October 1980 of $10 million, its first profit in two years. A plethora of K-platform body styles and badge- engineered variants followed the original range, including the company's minivans and upscale Chrysler division models. The platform interchangeability saved production and purchasing costs, initially costing Chrysler $1 billion over three years to develop, but only costing $50 million to generate the second group of badge-engineered variants, the LeBaron and Dodge 400. Within two years, the K platform vehicles accounted for roughly 50% of Chrysler's operating profits. In 1984, The New York Times said the K platform not only \\"single-handedly save(d) Chrysler from certain death, (it) also provided the company with a (platform) that could be stretched, smoothed, poked, chopped and trimmed.\\" In 1984, David Lewis, auto industry historian and professor of business history at the University of Michigan said no platform \\"in the history of the automobile industry has so dramatically allowed a company to survive in such a substantial way. No company has been down so low, in such difficult straits, and then depended on practically a single product to bring it back.\\" Sales figures Following the 1973 oil crisis, compounded by the 1979 energy crisis, American consumers began to buy fuel-efficient, low-cost automobiles built in Japan. With the market for large V-8 engined automobiles declining, American domestic auto manufacturers found themselves trying to develop compact vehicles that could compete with the Japanese imports of Toyota, Honda, and Nissan in price and finish. Chrysler Corporation's answer to the import pressure was the K platform, which featured an economical 4-cylinder engine, front-wheel drive, and used many modern weight-reducing measures such as replacing metal styling parts with plastic interior and exterior components. The K-cars (Dodge Aries, Plymouth Reliant, Chrysler LeBaron, Dodge 400, and, in Mexico, Dodge Dart) sold over 2 million vehicles from 1981 to 1988, and around 100,000 in their final year, 1989. The manual transmission provided acceleration of in 10 seconds, while the automatic was between 13 and 14 seconds, similar to or better than most competitors, while fuel economy was rated by the EPA at city and highway with the manual transmission. All had a wheelbase. The overall length of the two- and four- door models was . The wagon was longer. The vehicles had an approximate fuel tank. The coupe and sedan had approximately of luggage space; the wagons, with the rear seat upright and about when folded down. Numerous improvements to the sound insulation and general feel were made for the model year 1983. In 1985, the Reliant, Aries, and LeBaron received a facelift, with a rounded front fascia, smoother hood, and bigger taillights. In 1986, the cars began using fuel injection on the 2.2-liter engine and a 2.5-liter engine replaced the arguably unreliable Mitsubishi 2.6 liter engine, which was notorious for leaking oil and attracted to the cars nicknames like \\"Mr. Squishy\\" or \\"Bitsumishi.\\" They were initially very profitable, and Iacocca credited them with allowing the company to pay off its bankruptcy loans early.Iacocca, L:\\"Iacocca\\" Derivatives Plymouth Reliant station wagon 1983-84 Chrysler LeBaron Town & Country convertible The K-derivatives offered a large variety of engines depending on year and model. Four-cylinder engines were initially equipped with carburetors; fuel injection was phased in beginning in 1986. Engine output ranged from to . Most vehicles had the or Chrysler four-cylinder engine; however, from 1981 to 1985, a four and from 1987 to 1995 a V6, both made by Mitsubishi, were offered. All had electronic ignition. * K mid-size cars ** 1981–1989 Dodge Aries (often referred to as the Aries K, owing to strong publicity for the K cars; 1981 models are badged as such.) ** 1981–1989 Plymouth Reliant (as above, also known as the Reliant K) ** 1982–1988 Chrysler LeBaron (coupes and convertibles were produced on this platform until 1986) ** 1982–1988 Chrysler LeBaron Town and Country ** 1982–1983 Dodge 400 ** 1982–1985 Dodge Dart K (Mexico only) ** 1982–1985 Valiant Volare K (2-door) (Mexico only) ** 1986–1988 Dart by Chrysler (2-door and wagon) (Mexico only) ** 1986–1988 Volare by Chrysler (2-door) (Mexico only) ** 1986–1987 Volare by Chrysler (4-door) (Mexico only) ** 1983–1988 Plymouth Caravelle coupe (Canada only) ** 1983–1986 Chrysler Executive limousine ** 1984–1986 Dodge 600 coupe and convertible ** 1984–1987 Dodge Magnum 400 and Dodge Magnum Turbo (Mexico only) ** 1985 Chrysler 600 (Mexico only) * E (Extended-wheelbase) mid-size cars ** 1983–1984 Chrysler E-Class ** 1983–1987 Chrysler New Yorker **1987 Chrysler New Yorker, an E Body1988 Chrysler New Yorker Turbo (For 1988, the non-turbo Chrysler New Yorker began using the larger C Platform (see below) but the Turbo did not) ** 1983–1988 Dodge 600 sedan ** 1985–1988 Plymouth Caravelle ** 1986–1989 Dart by Chrysler (4-door) (Mexico only) ** 1988–1989 Volare by Chrysler (4-door) (Mexico only) * G sports cars (designated as the AG platform from 1989) ** 1984–1986 Chrysler Laser ** 1984–1993 Dodge Daytona and Chrysler Daytona (Canada) * S minivans ** 1984–1990 Dodge Caravan ** 1984–1990 Plymouth Voyager ** 1990 Chrysler Town and Country * H mid-size cars ** 1985–1988 Chrysler LeBaron GTS ** 1985–1989 Dodge Lancer ** 1987 Shelby Lancer * P compact cars (designated as the AP platform from 1989) ** 1987–1994 Dodge Shadow ** 1987–1994 Plymouth Sundance and Duster ** 1987–1989 Shelby CSX * J sport cars (designated as the AJ platform from 1989) ** 1987–1995 Chrysler LeBaron coupe and convertible ** 1988–1994 Chrysler Phantom coupe only (Mexico only) * C mid-size cars (designated as the AC platform from 1989) ** 1988–1993 Chrysler New Yorker ** 1988–1993 Dodge Dynasty ** 1988–1993 Chrysler Dynasty (Canada only) * AA mid-size cars ** 1989–1994 Chrysler Saratoga (Europe only) ** 1989–1995 Dodge Spirit ** 1989–1995 Plymouth Acclaim ** 1990–1994 Chrysler LeBaron sedan ** 1990–1994 Chrysler New Yorker (Mexico only) * Q sports car ** 1989–1991 Chrysler TC by Maserati * Y luxury cars (a stretched variant of the C platform used for two top-line models, also designated as the AY platform) ** 1990–1993 Chrysler New Yorker Fifth Avenue ** 1990–1993 Chrysler Imperial * AS minivans ** 1991–1995 Chrysler Town and Country **1993 Chrysler Town & Country, an AS platform minivan1991–1995 Dodge Caravan ** 1991–1995 Plymouth Voyager See also * Metrication in the United States – First Chrysler car to be produced in the metric system with metric screw threads and components. References K Category:1981 introductions ","title":"Chrysler K platform"},{"id":"851906","text":"Serge Reggiani (2 May 1922 – 23 July 2004) was an Italian-French singer and actor. He was born in Reggio Emilia, Italy and moved to France with his parents at the age of eight. After studying acting at the Conservatoire des arts cinématographiques, he was discovered by Jean Cocteau and appeared in the wartime production of Les Parents terribles. He then left Paris to join the French Resistance. His first feature film was Les portes de la nuit (\\"Gates of the Night\\"), released in 1946. He went on to perform in 80 films in total, including Casque d'or, Les Misérables (1958),Tutti a casa, Le Doulos, Il Gattopardo, La terrazza, The Pianist (1998). Reggiani also triumphed in the theatre in 1959 with his performance in Jean-Paul Sartre’s play Les Séquestrés d'Altona. In 1961, Reggiani co-starred with Paul Newman and Sidney Poitier in the film Paris Blues filmed on location in Paris. In 1965, at the age of 43, he began a second career as a singer, with the help of Simone Signoret and her husband Yves Montand, and later with the assistance of the French singer Barbara. Reggiani became one of the most acclaimed performers of French chanson and although he was in his 40s, his rugged image made him popular with both younger and older listeners. His best-known songs include Les loups sont entrés dans Paris (\\"The Wolves Have Entered Paris\\") and Sarah (La femme qui est dans mon lit) (\\"The Woman Who Is In My Bed\\"), the latter written by Georges Moustaki. He regularly sang songs by Boris Vian (Le Déserteur, Arthur où t'as mis le corps, La Java des bombes atomiques). His new young fans identified with his left-wing ideals and anti-militarism, most notably during the student revolts in France in 1968. With age he became more and more acclaimed as one of the best interpreters of the chanson, and also for bringing the poems of Rimbaud, Apollinaire and Prévert to new audiences. From 1980, when his son died, Reggiani struggled with alcoholism and depression. In 1995, however, he made a comeback to singing, giving a few concerts despite his deteriorated health and personal distress, the last one being held as late as the spring of 2004. In later life, he became a painter and gave a number of exhibitions of his works. Serge Reggiani died in Paris of a heart attack at the age of 82, one day after the death of another well-known French singer, Sacha Distel. He is buried in Montparnasse Cemetery.

It has a population of 13,834 residents. Makarska is a tourist centre, located on a horseshoe shaped bay between the Biokovo mountains and the Adriatic Sea. The town is noted for its palm-fringed promenade, where cafes, bars and boutiques overlook the harbour. Adjacent to the beach are several large capacity hotels as well as a camping ground. The center of Makarska is an old town with narrow stone-paved streets, a main church square where there is a flower and fruit market, and a Franciscan monastery that houses a sea shell collection featuring a giant clam shell. Makarska is the center of the Makarska Riviera, a popular tourist destination under the Biokovo mountain. It stretches for between the towns of Brela and Gradac. Its former cathedral of Saint Mark was the see of the former Roman Catholic Diocese of Makarska which was merged in 1828 into the Diocese of Split-Makarska.  Demographics  According to the 2011 census, the total population of the town is 13,834, in the following settlements: * Makarska, population 13,426 * Veliko Brdo, population 408 History Battle of Lepanto in 1571. =Pre-history= Near present-day Makarska, there was a settlement as early as the middle of the 2nd millennium BC. It is thought that it was a point used by the Cretans on their way up to the Adriatic (the so-called \\"amber road\\"). However it was only one of the ports with links with the wider Mediterranean, as shown by a copper tablet with Cretan and Egyptian systems of measurement. A similar tablet was found in the Egyptian pyramids. In the Illyrian era this region was part of the broader alliance of tribes, led by the Ardaeans, founded in the third century BC in the Cetina area (Omiš) down to the River Vjosë in present-day Albania.Naklada Naprijed, The Croatian Adriatic Tourist Guide, pgs. 299-301, Zagreb (1999); =The Roman era= Although the Romans became rulers of the Adriatic by defeating the Ardiaei in 228, it took them two centuries to confirm their rule. The Romans sent their veteran soldiers to settle in Makarska. After the division of the Empire in 395, this part of the Adriatic became part of the Eastern Roman Empire and many people fled to Muccurum from the new wave of invaders. The town appears in the Tabula Peutingeriana as the port of Inaronia, but is mentioned as Muccurum, a larger settlement that grew up in the most inaccessible part of Biokovo mountain, probably at the very edge of the Roman civilisation. It appears as Macrum on the acts of the Salonan Synod of 4 May 533 AD held in Salona (533), when also the town's diocese was created. =Early Middle Ages= During the Migration Period, in 548, Muccurum was destroyed by the army of the Ostrogoth king Totila. The byzantine Emperor expelled the Eastern Goths (Ostrogoths). In the 7th century the region between the Cetina and Neretva was occupied by the Narentines, with Mokro, located in today's Makarska, as its administrative centre. The doge of Venice Pietro I Candiano, whose Venetian fleet aimed to punish the piratesque activities of the town's vessels, was defeated here on September 18, 877 and had to pay tribute to the Narentines for the free passage of its ships on the Adriatic. =Late Middle Ages= The principality was annexed to the Kingdom of Croatia in the 12th century, and was conquered by the Republic of Venice a century later. Making use of the rivalry between the Croatian leaders and their power struggles (1324–1326), the Bosnian Ban Stjepan II Kotromanić annexed the Makarska coastal area. There were many changes of rulers here: from the Croatian and Bosnian feudal lords, to those from Zahumlje (later Herzegovina). In the eventful 15th century the Ottomans conquered the Balkans. In order to protect his territory from the Turks, Duke Stjepan Vukčić Kosača handed the region to the Venetians in 1452. The Makarska coastal area fell to the Turks in 1499. =Under the Turks= Under the Ottoman rule, the town was surrounded with walls that had three towers. The name Makarska was cited for the first time in a 1502 document telling how nuns from Makarska were permitted to repair their church. The Turks had links with all parts of the Adriatic via Makarska and they therefore paid a great deal of attention to the maintenance of the port. In 1568 they built a fortress as defence against the Venetians. During Turkish rule the seat of the administrative and judicial authority was in Foča, Mostar, for a short time in Makarska itself and finally in Gabela on the River Neretva. During the Candian War between Venice and the Turks (1645–1669) the desire among the people of the area to be free of the Turks intensified, and in 1646 Venice recaptured the coastline. A period of dual leadership, marked with armed conflicts, destruction and reprisals, lasted until 1684, until the danger of the Turks ended in 1699. =Once more under the Venetians= In 1695 Makarska became the seat of a bishopric and commercial activity came to life, but it was a neglected area and little attention was given to the education of its inhabitants. At the time when the people were fighting against the Turks, and Venice paid more attention to the people's demands. According to Alberto Fortis in his travel chronicles (18th century), Makarska was the only town in the coastal area, and the only Dalmatian town where there were absolutely no historical remains. After the fall of the Venetian Republic, it was given to the Austrians by the Treaty of Campo Formio (1797). =From 1797 to 1813= With the fall of Venice, the Austrian army entered Makarska and remained there until Napoleon took the upper hand. The French arrived in Makarska on 8 March 1806 and remained until 1813. This was an age of prosperity, cultural, social and economic development. Under French rule all the people were equal, and education laws written, for the first time in many centuries, in the Croatian language were passed. Schools were opened. Makarska was at this time a small town with about 1580 inhabitants. =Under the Austrians (1813–1918)= As in Dalmatia as a whole, the Austrian authorities imposed a policy of Italianization, and the official language was Italian. The Makarska representatives in the Dalmatian assembly in Zadar and the Imperial Council in Vienna demanded the introduction of the Croatian language for use in public life, but the authorities steadfastly opposed the idea. One of the leaders of the National (pro- Croatian) Party was Mihovil Pavlinović of Podgora. Makarska was one of the first communities to introduce the Croatian language (1865). In the second half of the 19th century Makarska experienced a great boom and in 1900 it had about 1800 inhabitants. It became a trading point for agricultural products, not only from the coastal area, but also from the hinterland (Bosnia and Herzegovina) and had shipping links with Trieste, Rijeka and Split. The Congress of Vienna assigned Makarska to Austria-Hungary, under which it remained until 1918. =The 20th century= In the early 20th century agriculture, trade and fishing remained the mainstay of economy. In 1914, the first hotel was built, beginning the tourism tradition in the area. During World War II, Makarska was part of the Independent State of Croatia. It was a port for the nation's navy and served as the headquarters of the Central Adriatic Naval Command, until it was moved to Split.Nigel Thomas, K. Mikulan, Darko Pavlović. Axis Forces in Yugoslavia 1941-45, pg. 18, Osprey Publishing, 1995. After the war, during communist Yugoslavia, Makarska experienced a period of growth, and the population tripled. All the natural advantages of the region were used to create in Makarska one of the best known tourist areas on the Croatian Adriatic.

Richard Harlan (September 19, 1796 - September 30, 1843) was an American naturalist, zoologist, herpetologist, physicist, and paleontologist. He was the author of Fauna Americana, published in 1825, and American Herpetology. Harlan was born in Philadelphia, to Joshua Harlan, a wealthy Quaker merchant, and his wife Sarah, one of their ten children. He was three years older than his brother Josiah Harlan, who would become the first American to visit Afghanistan and who was the presumed inspiration for Rudyard Kipling's story \\"The Man Who Would Be King\\". He graduated in medicine from the University of Pennsylvania taking time off during his studies to spend a year at sea as a ship's surgeon for the British East India Company. In 1821 he was elected professor of comparative anatomy in the Philadelphia museum. One of his passions was the collection and study of human skulls. At its peak, his collection contained 275 skulls, the largest such collection in America. He died of apoplexy in New Orleans, Louisiana. In 1834, Harlan described and named Basilosaurus (\\"king lizard\\"), a genus of early whale, erroneously assuming he had found a Plesiosaurus-like dinosaur.

Known for his warm tone, he was one of the best- documented saxophonists of his generation, recording more than 100 albums. He was nicknamed the \\"Lone Wolf\\" by jazz critic Dan Morgenstern because of his relentless touring and devotion to jazz. Stitt was sometimes viewed as a Charlie Parker mimic, especially earlier in his career, but gradually came to develop his own sound and style, particularly when performing on tenor saxophone. Early life Edward Hammond Boatner, Jr. was born in Boston, Massachusetts and grew up in Saginaw, Michigan. He had a musical background: his father, Edward Boatner, was a baritone singer, composer, and college music professor; his brother was a classically trained pianist, and his mother was a piano teacher. He was given up for adoption in 1924 by his father and adopted by the Stitt family in Saginaw. He later began calling himself \\"Sonny\\". While in high school in Saginaw, he played in the Len Francke Band, a local popular swing band. In 1943, Stitt met Charlie Parker. As he often recalled, the two men had similar styles. Parker is alleged to have remarked, \\"Well, I'll be damned, you sound just like me\\", to which Stitt responded, \\"Well, I can't help the way I sound. It's the only way I know how to play.\\" Kenny Clarke said of Stitt, \\"Even if there had not been a Bird, there would have been a Sonny Stitt.\\" During the 1940s, he played alto saxophone as a member of Tiny Bradshaw's big band, Billy Eckstine's big band with Gene Ammons and Dexter Gordon, and Dizzy Gillespie's big band. Stitt was a leader of Bebop Boys and Galaxy in 1946 and 1948 respectively. Stitt, when playing tenor saxophone, seemed to break free from some of the criticism that he was imitating Parker's style, and he began to develop a far more distinctive sound on tenor. He played with other bop musicians including Horace Parlan, Bud Powell and Eddie \\"Lockjaw\\" Davis, a fellow tenor with a distinctly tough tone in comparison to Stitt, in the 1950s and recorded a number of sides for Prestige Records as well as albums for Argo, Verve, and Roost. Stitt experimented with Afro-Cuban jazz in the late 1950s, and the results can be heard on his recordings for Roost and Verve, on which he teamed up with Thad Jones and Chick Corea for Latin versions of such standards as \\"Autumn Leaves.\\" In 1952, Stitt had played with pianist Jimmy Jones and in 1953 performed orchestral music with Johnny Richards. In 1955, he played under Quincy Jones' guidance, playing uptempos and ballads such as \\"My Funny Valentine\\" and \\"Star Dust\\" and the same year performed \\"Afterwards\\" and \\"There Will Never Be Another You\\" with Hank Jones. In 1957, Stitt had joined Dolo Coker to perform \\"Blues for Yard\\" and \\"Blue Moon\\", before returning to Hank to perform \\"Cherokee\\". Stitt joined Miles Davis briefly in 1960, and recordings with Davis' quintet can be found only in live settings on the tour of 1960. Concerts in Manchester and Paris are available commercially and also a number of concerts (which include sets by the earlier quintet with John Coltrane) on the record Live at Stockholm (Dragon), all of which featured Wynton Kelly, Jimmy Cobb, and Paul Chambers. However, Miles fired Stitt due to the excessive drinking habit he had developed, and replaced him with Hank Mobley. Later in the 1960s, Stitt paid homage to Parker on the album Stitt Plays Bird, which features Jim Hall on guitar. Stitt recorded several times with his friend Gene Ammons, interrupted by Ammons' own imprisonment for narcotics possession. The records recorded by these two saxophonists are regarded by many as some of both Ammons and Stitt's best work, thus the Ammons/Stitt partnership went down in posterity as one of the best dueling partnerships in jazz, alongside Zoot Sims and Al Cohn, and Johnny Griffin with Eddie \\"Lockjaw\\" Davis. Stitt ventured into soul jazz, and he recorded with fellow tenor saxophonist Booker Ervin in 1964 on the Soul People album. Stitt also recorded with Duke Ellington alumnus Paul Gonsalves in 1963 for Impulse! on the Salt and Pepper album in 1964. Around that time he appeared regularly at Ronnie Scott's in London, a live 1964 encounter with Ronnie Scott, The Night Has a Thousand Eyes, eventually surfaced, and another in 1966 with resident guitarist Ernest Ranglin and British tenor saxophonist Dick Morrissey. Stitt was one of the first jazz musicians to experiment with the Selmer Varitone amplification system as heard on the albums What's New!!! in 1966 and Parallel-a-Stitt in 1967. Later life In the 1970s, Stitt slowed his recording output slightly, and in 1972, he produced another classic, Tune-Up!, which was and still is regarded by many jazz critics, such as Scott Yanow, as his definitive record. Indeed, his fiery and ebullient soloing was quite reminiscent of his earlier playing. In 1971 he managed to record four albums; Turn It On! with Leon Spencer, Melvin Sparks, Idris Muhammad, and Virgil Jones, You Talk That Talk! with Gene Ammons and George Freeman as new members of the group, Just The Way It Was - Live At The Left Bank with Don Patterson and Billy James, and Black Vibrations which featured the same group as in Turn It On!. Just The Way It Was - Live At The Left Bank which was released in 2000 also featured Stitt as an electric saxophone player, which was the first album which encompassed it. Stitt's productivity dropped in the 1970s due to alcoholism. Stitt had drunk heavily since giving up heroin in the late fifties and the abuse was beginning to take its toll. A series of alcohol-induced seizures caused Stitt to abstain and kick the habit for good. In 1975, Sonny had performed with Ron Burton, Major Holley an John Lewis at the Village Vanguard. Stitt joined the all-star group The Giants of Jazz (which also featured Art Blakey, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Kai Winding and bassist Al McKibbon) and made albums for Atlantic, Concord and EmArcy. His last recordings were made in Japan. A rejuvenated Stitt also toured with Red Holloway in the late 1970s, who noted a marked improvement in his playing. In 1981, Stitt had performed with George Duvivier and Jimmy Cobb, Six weeks before his death, Stitt had recorded two last consecutive sessions which were with George Duvivier, Jimmy Cobb, Bill Hardman and either with Junior Mance or Walter Davis Jr. on piano. In 1982, Stitt was diagnosed with cancer, and he died on July 22 in Washington, D.C.. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Sonny Stitt among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

Obscurantism and Obscurationism ( or ) describe the practice of deliberately presenting information in an imprecise, abstruse manner designed to limit further inquiry and understanding. There are two historical and intellectual denotations of Obscurantism: (1) the deliberate restriction of knowledge—opposition to disseminating knowledge; and (2) deliberate obscurity—a recondite literary or artistic style, characterized by deliberate vagueness.Webster's New Universal Unabridged Dictionary (1996) p. 1,337 The term obscurantism derives from the title of the 16th-century satire Epistolæ Obscurorum Virorum (Letters of Obscure Men, 1515–19), that was based upon the intellectual dispute between the German humanist Johann Reuchlin and the monk Johannes Pfefferkorn of the Dominican Order, about whether or not all Jewish books should be burned as un-Christian heresy. Earlier, in 1509, the monk Pfefferkorn had obtained permission from Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor (1486–1519), to burn all copies of the Talmud (Jewish law and Jewish ethics) known to be in the Holy Roman Empire (AD 926–1806); the Letters of Obscure Men satirized the Dominican arguments for burning \\"un-Christian\\" works. In the 18th century, Enlightenment philosophers applied the term obscurantist to any enemy of intellectual enlightenment and the liberal diffusion of knowledge. In the 19th century, in distinguishing the varieties of obscurantism found in metaphysics and theology from the \\"more subtle\\" obscurantism of the critical philosophy of Immanuel Kant, and of modern philosophical skepticism, Friedrich Nietzsche said: \\"The essential element in the black art of obscurantism is not that it wants to darken individual understanding, but that it wants to blacken our picture of the world, and darken our idea of existence.\\"Nietzsche, F. (1878) Human, All Too Human Vol. II, Part 1, 27. Cambridge University Press; 2 edition (kNovember 13, 1996).  Restricting knowledge  Marquis de Condorcet In restricting knowledge to an élite ruling class of \\"the few\\", obscurantism is fundamentally anti-democratic, because its component anti- intellectualism and elitism exclude the people as intellectually unworthy of knowing the facts and truth about the government of their City-State.Seymour M. Hersh, \\"Selective Intelligence\\", The New Yorker, 12 May 2003, accessed April 29, 2016. Brian Doherty, \\"Origin of the Specious: Why Do Neoconservatives Doubt Darwin?\\" , Reason Online July 1997, accessed 16 February 2007. In 18th century monarchic France, the Marquis de Condorcet, as a political scientist, documented the aristocracy's obscurantism about the social problems that provoked the French Revolution (1789–99) that deposed them and their King, Louis XVI of France. In the 19th century, the mathematician William Kingdon Clifford, an early proponent of Darwinism, devoted some writings to uprooting obscurantism in England, after hearing clerics—who privately agreed with him about evolution—publicly denounce evolution as un-Christian. Moreover, in the realm of organized religion, obscurantism is a distinct strain of thought independent of theologic allegiance. The distinction is that fundamentalism presupposes sincere religious belief, whereas obscurantism is based upon minority manipulation of the popular faith as political praxis; cf. Censorship.Syed, I. (2002) \\"Obscurantism\\". From: Intellectual Achievements of Muslims. New Delhi: Star Publications. Excerpt available online. Retrieved on: 4 August 2007. = Leo Strauss =  Political philosophy  In the 20th century, the American conservative political philosopher Leo Strauss, for whom philosophy and politics intertwined, and his Neo-conservative adherents adopted the notion of government by the enlightened few as political strategy. He noted that intellectuals, dating from Plato, confronted the dilemma of either an informed populace \\"interfering\\" with government, or if it were possible for good politicians to be truthful and still govern to maintain a stable society—hence the noble lie necessary in securing public acquiescence. In The City and Man (1964), he discusses the myths in The Republic that Plato proposes effective governing requires, among them, the belief that the country (land) ruled by the State belongs to it (despite some having been conquered from others), and that citizenship derives from more than the accident of birth in the City- State. Thus, in the New Yorker magazine article Selective Intelligence, Seymour Hersh observes that Strauss endorsed the \\"noble lie\\" concept: the myths politicians use in maintaining a cohesive society. Brian Doherty, \\"Origin of the Specious: Why Do Neoconservatives Doubt Darwin?\\" , Reason Online July 1997, accessed 16 February 2007. Shadia Drury criticized Strauss's acceptance of dissembling and deception of the populace as \\"the peculiar justice of the wise\\", whereas Plato proposed the Noble Lie as based upon moral good. In criticizing Natural Right and History (1953), she said that \\"Strauss thinks that the superiority of the ruling philosophers is an intellectual superiority and not a moral one ... [he] is the only interpreter who gives a sinister reading to Plato, and then celebrates him.\\"  Esoteric texts  Leo Strauss also was criticized for proposing the notion of \\"esoteric\\" meanings to ancient texts, obscure knowledge inaccessible to the \\"ordinary\\" intellect. In Persecution and the Art of Writing (1952), he proposes that some philosophers write esoterically to avert persecution by the political or religious authorities, and, per his knowledge of Maimonides, Al Farabi, and Plato, proposed that an esoteric writing style is proper for the philosophic text. Rather than explicitly presenting his thoughts, the philosopher's esoteric writing compels the reader to think independently of the text, and so learn. In the Phædrus, Socrates notes that writing does not reply to questions, but invites dialogue with the reader, thereby minimizing the problems of grasping the written word. Strauss noted that one of writing's political dangers is students' too-readily accepting dangerous ideas—as in the trial of Socrates, wherein the relationship with Alcibiades was used to prosecute him. For Leo Strauss, philosophers' texts offered the reader lucid \\"exoteric\\" (salutary) and obscure \\"esoteric\\" (true) teachings, which are concealed to the reader of ordinary intellect; emphasizing that writers often left contradictions and other errors to encourage the reader's more scrupulous (re-)reading of the text. In observing and maintaining the \\"exoteric – esoteric\\" dichotomy, Strauss was accused of obscurantism, and for writing esoterically. = Bill Joy = Bill Joy In the Wired magazine article, \\"Why the Future Doesn't Need Us\\" (April 2000), the computer scientist Bill Joy, then a Sun Microsystems chief scientist, in the sub-title proposed that: \\"Our most powerful twenty-first-century technologies—robotics, genetic engineering, and nanotech[nology]—are threatening to make humans an endangered species\\"; in the body, he posits that: :\\"The experiences of the atomic scientists clearly show the need to take personal responsibility, the danger that things will move too fast, and the way in which a process can take on a life of its own. We can, as they did, create insurmountable problems in almost no time flat. We must do more thinking up front if we are not to be similarly surprised and shocked by the consequences of our inventions.\\"Khushf, George (2004). \\"The Ethics of Nanotechnology: Vision and Values for a New Generation of Science and Engineering\\", Emerging Technologies and Ethical Issues in Engineering, National Academy of Engineering, pp. 31–32. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. . Joy's proposal for limiting the dissemination of \\"certain\\" knowledge, in behalf of preserving society, was quickly likened to obscurantism. A year later, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, in the Science and Technology Policy Yearbook 2001, published the article \\"A Response to Bill Joy and the Doom-and-Gloom Technofuturists\\", wherein the computer scientists John Seely Brown and Paul Duguid countered his proposal as technological tunnel vision, and the predicted technologically derived problems as infeasible, for disregarding the influence of non- scientists upon such societal problems.  Appeal to emotion  The economist Friedrich August von Hayek In the essay \\"Why I Am Not a Conservative\\" (1960), the economist Friedrich von Hayek said that political conservatism is ideologically unrealistic, because of the conservative person's inability to adapt to changing human realities and refusal to offer a positive political program that benefits everyone in a society. In that context, Hayek used the term obscurantism differently, to denote and describe the denial of the empirical truth of scientific theory, because of the disagreeable moral consequences that might arise from acceptance of fact.  Deliberate obscurity  The second sense of obscurantism denotes making knowledge abstruse, that is, difficult to grasp. In the 19th and 20th centuries obscurantism became a polemical term for accusing an author of deliberately writing obscurely, in order to hide his or her intellectual vacuousness. Philosophers who are neither empiricists nor positivists often are considered obscurantists when describing the abstract concepts of their disciplines. For philosophic reasons, such authors might modify or reject verifiability, falsifiability, and logical non-contradiction. From that perspective, obscure (clouded, vague, abstruse) writing does not necessarily indicate that the writer has a poor grasp of the subject, because unintelligible writing sometimes is purposeful and philosophically considered.Rorty, Richard (1989) Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, Ch. 6: \\"From Ironist Theory to Private Allusions: Derrida\\". . Aristotle = Aristotle = In contemporary discussions of virtue ethics, Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics (The Ethics) stands accused of ethical obscurantism, because of the technical, philosophic language and writing style, and their purpose being the education of a cultured governing elite.Lisa van Alstyne, \\"Aristotle's Alleged Ethical Obscurantism.\\" Philosophy, Vol. 73, No. 285 (July, 1998), pp. 429–452. = Kant = Immanuel Kant employed technical terms that were not commonly understood by the layman. Arthur Schopenhauer contended that post-Kantian philosophers such as Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel deliberately imitated the abstruse style of writing practiced by Kant.Schopenhauer, Manuscript Remains, Vol. 4, \\"Cogitata I,\\" § 107. = Hegel = G. W. F. Hegel G. W. F. Hegel's philosophy, and the philosophies of those he influenced, especially Karl Marx, have been accused of obscurantism. Analytic and positivistic philosophers, such as A. J. Ayer, Bertrand Russell, and the critical-rationalist Karl Popper, accused Hegel and Hegelianism of being obscure. About Hegel's philosophy, Schopenhauer wrote that it is: \\"... a colossal piece of mystification, which will yet provide posterity with an inexhaustible theme for laughter at our times, that it is a pseudo-philosophy paralyzing all mental powers, stifling all real thinking, and, by the most outrageous misuse of language, putting in its place the hollowest, most senseless, thoughtless, and, as is confirmed by its success, most stupefying verbiage. ...\\"Schopenhauer, Arthur (1965). On the Basis of Morality, trans. E.F.J. Payne. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, pp.15–16. Nevertheless, biographer Terry Pinkard notes \\"Hegel has refused to go away, even in analytic philosophy, itself.\\"Hegel: A Biography, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000, xii. Hegel was aware of his obscurantism, and perceived it as part of philosophical thinking: to accept and transcend the limitations of quotidian (everyday) thought and its concepts. In the essay \\"Who Thinks Abstractly?\\", he said that it is not the philosopher who thinks abstractly, but the layman, who uses concepts as givens that are immutable, without context. It is the philosopher who thinks concretely, because he transcends the limits of quotidian concepts, in order to understand their broader context. This makes philosophical thought and language appear obscure, esoteric, and mysterious to the layman. = Marx = Karl Marx in 1861 In his early works,See his The German Ideology (1844), The Poverty of Philosophy (1845), and The Holy Family (1847). Karl Marx criticized German and French philosophy, especially German Idealism, for its traditions of German irrationalism and ideologically motivated obscurantism.See, Dallmayr, Fred R., \\"The Discourse of Modernity: Hegel, Nietzsche, Heidegger (and Habermas)\\", PRAXIS International (4/1988), pp. 377–404. Later thinkers whom he influenced, such as the philosopher György Lukács and social theorist Jürgen Habermas, followed with similar arguments of their own.György Lukács's The Destruction of Reason; Jürgen Habermas's The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity However, philosophers such as Karl Popper and Friedrich Hayek in turn criticized Marx and Marxist philosophy as obscurantist (however, see above for Hayek's particular interpretation of the term).Wright, E. O., Levine, A., & Sober, E. (1992). Reconstructing Marxism: essays on explanation and the theory of history. London: Verso, 107. = Heidegger = Martin Heidegger, and those influenced by him, such as Jacques Derrida and Emmanuel Levinas, have been labeled obscurantists by critics from analytic philosophy and the Frankfurt School of critical theory. Of Heidegger, Bertrand Russell wrote, \\"his philosophy is extremely obscure. One cannot help suspecting that language is here running riot. An interesting point in his speculations is the insistence that nothingness is something positive. As with much else in Existentialism, this is a psychological observation made to pass for logic.\\" That is Russell's complete entry on Heidegger, and it expresses the sentiments of many 20th-century analytic philosophers concerning Heidegger. = Derrida = In their obituaries, \\"Jacques Derrida, Abstruse Theorist, Dies at 74\\" (10 October 2004) and \\"Obituary of Jacques Derrida, French intellectual\\" (21 October 2004), The New York Times newspaper and The Economist magazine, described Derrida as a deliberately obscure philosopher. In Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity (1989), Richard Rorty proposed that in The Post Card: From Socrates to Freud and Beyond (1978), Jacques Derrida purposefully used undefinable words (e.g. Différance), and used defined words in contexts so diverse that they render the words unintelligible, hence, the reader is unable to establish a context for his literary self. In that way, the philosopher Derrida escapes metaphysical accounts of his work. Since the work ostensibly contains no metaphysics, Derrida has, consequently, escaped metaphysics. Derrida's philosophic work is especially controversial among American and British academics, as when the University of Cambridge awarded him an honorary doctorate, despite opposition from among the Cambridge philosophy faculty and analytical philosophers worldwide. In opposing the decision, philosophers including Barry Smith, W. V. O. Quine, David Armstrong, Ruth Barcan Marcus, René Thom, and twelve others, published a letter of protestation in The Times of London, arguing that \\"his works employ a written style that defies comprehension ... [thus] Academic status based on what seems to us to be little more than semi-intelligible attacks upon the values of reason, truth, and scholarship is not, we submit, sufficient grounds for the awarding of an honorary degree in a distinguished university.\\"Barry Smith et al., \\"Open letter against Derrida receiving an honorary doctorate from Cambridge University,\\" The Times [London], 9 May 1992. In the New York Review of Books article \\"An Exchange on Deconstruction\\" (February 1984), John Searle comments on Deconstruction: \\"... anyone who reads deconstructive texts with an open mind is likely to be struck by the same phenomena that initially surprised me: the low level of philosophical argumentation, the deliberate obscurantism of the prose, the wildly exaggerated claims, and the constant striving to give the appearance of profundity, by making claims that seem paradoxical, but under analysis often turn out to be silly or trivial.\\" = Lacan = Jacques Lacan was an intellectual who defended obscurantism to a degree. To his students' complaint about the deliberate obscurity of his lectures, he replied: \\"The less you understand, the better you listen.\\" In the 1973 seminar Encore, he said that his Écrits (Writings) were not to be understood, but would effect a meaning in the reader, like that induced by mystical texts. The obscurity is not in his writing style, but in the repeated allusions to Hegel, derived from Alexandre Kojève's lectures on Hegel, and similar theoretic divergences. = Sokal Affair = The Sokal Affair (1996) was a publishing hoax that the professor of physics Alan Sokal perpetrated on the editors and readers of Social Text, an academic journal of post-modern cultural studies that was not then a peer-reviewed publication. In 1996, as an experiment testing editorial integrity (fact-checking, verification, peer review, etc.), Sokal submitted \\"Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity\\", a pseudoscientific article proposing that physical reality is a social construct, in order to learn if Social Text would \\"publish an article liberally salted with nonsense if: (a) it sounded good, and, (b) it flattered the editors' ideological preconceptions\\". Sokal's fake article was published in the Spring/Summer 1996 issue of Social Text, which was dedicated to the Science Wars about the conceptual validity of scientific objectivity and the nature of scientific theory, among scientific realists and postmodern critics in American universities. Sokal's reason for publication of a false article was that postmodernist critics questioned the objectivity of science, by criticising the scientific method and the nature of knowledge, usually in the disciplines of cultural studies, cultural anthropology, feminist studies, comparative literature, media studies, and science and technology studies. Whereas the scientific realists countered that objective scientific knowledge exists, riposting that postmodernist critics almost knew nothing of the science they criticized. In the event, editorial deference to \\"Academic Authority\\" (the Author-Professor) prompted the editors of Social Text not to fact-check Sokal's manuscript by submitting it to peer review by a scientist. Concerning the lack of editorial integrity shown by the publication of his fake article in Social Text magazine, Sokal addressed the matter in the May 1996 edition of the Lingua Franca journal, in the article \\"A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies\\", in which he revealed that his transformative hermeneutics article was a parody, submitted \\"to test the prevailing intellectual standards\\", and concluded that, as an academic publication, Social Text ignored the requisite intellectual rigor of verification and \\"felt comfortable publishing an article on quantum physics without bothering to consult anyone knowledgeable in the subject\\". Moreover, as a public intellectual, Sokal said his hoax was an action protesting against the contemporary tendency towards obscurantism—abstruse, esoteric, and vague writing in the social sciences: > In short, my concern over the spread of subjectivist thinking is both > intellectual and political. Intellectually, the problem with such doctrines > is that they are false (when not simply meaningless). There is a real world; > its properties are not merely social constructions; facts and evidence do > matter. What sane person would contend otherwise? And yet, much contemporary > academic theorizing consists precisely of attempts to blur these obvious > truths—the utter absurdity of it all being concealed through obscure and > pretentious language. Moreover, independent of the hoax, as a pseudoscientific opus, the article \\"Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity\\" is described as an exemplar \\"pastiche of left-wing cant, fawning references, grandiose quotations, and outright nonsense, centered on the claim that physical reality is merely a social construct.\\" Similarly to whataboutism, obscurantism is used by elevating the readers prejudices to a grandiose value-laden assumption, belief, principle(s) or pseudoscience that does not deconstruct opposing claims and is stalling a priori and/or asserting confusing jargon or technical speak to describe events, which may deny the real world existence of physical properties.

The Missouri Bootheel is the southeasternmost part of the state of Missouri, extending south of 36°30′ north latitude, so called because its shape in relation to the rest of the state resembles the heel of a boot. Strictly speaking, it is composed of the counties of Dunklin, New Madrid, and Pemiscot. However, the term is locally used to refer to the entire southeastern lowlands of Missouri located within the Mississippi Embayment, which includes parts of Butler, Mississippi, Ripley, Scott, Stoddard and extreme southern portions of Cape Girardeau and Bollinger counties. The largest city in the region is Kennett. Until the 1920s the district was a wheat-growing area of family farms. Following the invasion of the boll weevil, which ruined the cotton crop in Arkansas, planters moved in. They bought up the land for conversion to cotton commodity crops, bringing along thousands of sharecroppers. After mechanization of agriculture and other changes in the 1930s, many black families left the area to go North in the Great Migration. These counties have predominantly white populations in the 21st century, although a few have significant minorities of blacks. History When Missouri was admitted to the Union, its original border was proposed as an extension of the 36°30′ parallel north that formed the border between Kentucky and Tennessee. That would have excluded the Bootheel. John Hardeman Walker, a pioneer planter in what is now Pemiscot County, argued that the area had more in common with the Mississippi River towns of Cape Girardeau, Ste. Genevieve and St. Louis in Missouri than with its proposed incorporation in the Arkansas Territory. The border was dropped about 50 miles to the 36th parallel north. It follows that parallel about 30 miles until intersecting the St. Francis River, then follows the river back up to about the 36°30′ parallel just west of Campbell, Missouri. According to an apocryphal story in various versions, the Bootheel was added to the state because of the request of some Missourian to remain in the state \\"as he had heard it was so sickly in Arkansas\\"; \\"...full of bears and panthers and copperhead snakes, so it ain't safe for civilized people to stay there over night even.\\" Another legend has the adaptation made by a lovestruck surveyor to spare the feelings of a widow living 50 miles south of the Missouri border, but unaware of it. At one time, the area was known locally as \\"Lapland, because it's the place where Missouri laps over into Arkansas\\". During the American Civil War, a number of battles took place in this area, most notably the Battle of Island No. 10. Until the early 20th century, the district was largely covered by wetlands and swamps, but otherwise was a wheat-growing area of family farms. Lumbering was important in the 1890s until the most valuable trees were taken. In 1905, the Little River Drainage District built an elaborate network of ditches, canals, and levees to drain the swamps, as people believed that the highest use was for agriculture. They did not understand about the important function of wetlands in modifying river flooding. From 1880 to 1930, the population in the area more than tripled as many workers were brought in. Cotton became the chief commodity crop. Meanwhile, the boll weevil ruined the cotton crop in Arkansas, and planters moved into the Bootheel, bought up the new lands or leased them from insurance companies that had invested in the area, and recruited thousands of black sharecroppers as workers. During the 1910s the Bootheel experienced a surge in racial violence between white tenant farmers and black workers who were imported by landowners from the South. This competition between white laborers and black laborers resulted in a period of extreme racial violence which took the form of lynchings in New Madrid, Charleston, and Caruthersville. In contrast to the other cotton-growing areas of the South, where blacks had been disfranchised around the turn of the century, they were allowed to vote in Missouri and played a political role in this area. In the main, political power was held by white power brokers, especially Democrat J. V. Conran from the 1930s to 1960s. He worked closely with blacks in the region. An ally of Senator and President Harry S. Truman, Conran packed the ballot boxes but did bring efficiency and government services, and helped improve economic and social conditions. During the Great Depression, the Farm Security Administration said that the Bootheel was a \\"paradox of rich land and poor people.\\" In 1935 three fourths of all farms were operated by tenants, most of them black. Radicals in the Southern Tenant Farmers Union organized protests by hundreds of sharecroppers in early 1939, alleging that landlords had evicted masses of tenants because they did not want to share federal AAA checks with them. The Farm Security Administration, a New Deal agency, responded by providing low-cost rental housing for 500 cropper families. It awarded $500,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) in grants to 11,000 families in 1939. The protest fizzled out as Communist and Socialist elements battled for control. Geography and geology Available samples from the Bootheel and most of the southeastern Missouri counties demonstrate late Tertiary (more than 1.8 mya) to Quaternary (1.8 mya to present) geology, much younger than neighboring highlands. The lowest point in the state is in southwestern Dunklin County along the St. Francis River near Arbyrd, at 230 feet above sea level. The bootheel area is notable for being the epicenter of the 1811–12 New Madrid earthquakes, some of the largest earthquakes ever felt in the United States. Swamp reclamation and flooding A typical Bootheel scene: the Mississippi floodplain in southern Pemiscot County As glaciers receded towards the end of the Ice Age and turned ice into liquid, the Mississippi River grew longer and wider. Over time, the silt deposits of the Mississippi created some of the most fertile soil in the world, ideal for agriculture. The areas around the Mississippi are composed of thick regolith that is around thick. The Bootheel lies in the flood plain between the Mississippi and St. Francis rivers; so the land is very flat. Since clearing and drainage of wetlands in the early 20th century, it has been predominantly developed for agricultural purposes. Prior to the 20th century, it was mostly unsettled swampy forestland. Between 1893 and 1989, developers cut about 85% of the native forests in the region; most clearing was done in the early decades of the 20th century. The entire landscape was transformed into farmland by extensive logging, draining of the watershed, channelization, and the construction of flood control structures. High levees along both river courses, an extensive system of drainage ditches and diversion channels, and controlled lakes, pumping stations and cutoffs protect the area from flooding. The soils are predominantly a rich and deep glacial loess, alluvial silt, and a sandy loam, well-suited for agricultural use. But the levees have changed the nature of the rivers, and cumulatively have aggravated flooding problems. They also prevent regular silt deposits, as they have increased the speed of the rivers. The reduction in wetlands has reduced important habitats for many species of migratory birds and a variety of fish and animals. Flooding is a major concern along the Mississippi River. With such a large river basin and the vast discharge of water, the river makes the towns along its banks highly susceptible to frequent flooding. The National Weather Service reported that from 1980 to 2002, nine floods in the United States had total losses exceeding one billion dollars. In terms of monetary loss and effects on society, the Great Flood of 1993 was the worst.. New Madrid fault zone Earthquakes have long been frequent in the area. The New Madrid Fault Zone (pronounced ) is named for the city of New Madrid in the Bootheel. This fault zone is entirely hidden beneath the deep alluvial deposits of the Mississippi embayment. Unlike the San Andreas Fault in California, it is not visible anywhere. This fault zone was responsible for an extremely powerful series of earthquakes that rocked the area in 1811 and 1812, known collectively as the New Madrid earthquake. It was reported to have been so powerful as to ring church bells along the East Coast. Subsidence formed Reelfoot Lake on the other side of the Mississippi River in West Tennessee. An eyewitness of the earthquakes of 1811 and 1812 noted: The states of Missouri, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, and Indiana felt the brunt of this quake, ruining lives and leaving residents in fear of aftershocks and possible larger quakes. To this day, the New Madrid Seismic Zone is still active and frequently produces small earthquakes. Scientists have estimated that a strong earthquake is inevitable and is overdue. Residents of the area are aware of the risk, but critics say they are not well prepared for a disaster. William Atkinson, author of The Next New Madrid Earthquake, writes: Given the population in the area, even a moderately sized earthquake would be disastrous. Culture and economy The Bootheel (pronounced Boothill in the region) is on the edge of the Mississippi Delta culture that produced the Delta blues. Its relatively large black population makes it distinct from the rest of rural Missouri. The area has a unique rural black culture reflected in its music, churches and other traditions. The black population ranges from about 26% in Pemiscot County, to 15% in New Madrid County, and about 9% in Dunklin County. The Bootheel once had a reputation for lawlessness. Remote settlements along the river banks, miles from paved roads, provided an ideal environment (and market) for moonshining and bootlegging. Culturally, the Bootheel is considered more Southern than Midwestern. It was settled largely by people from the South, both black and white. It is part of the Mid-South, a region centered on the Memphis metropolitan area. Definitions of the Mid-South vary but in general include west Tennessee and Kentucky, north Mississippi, northeast Arkansas, and the Missouri Bootheel.History of the National Weather Service: Memphis, Tennessee, National Weather Service The locations of the region's television stations reflect this: *CBS and Fox affiliates (KFVS-TV and KBSI, respectively) are located in Cape Girardeau *ABC affiliates include WSIL-TV in Harrisburg, Illinois, and KAIT in Jonesboro, Arkansas *NBC affiliate WPSD-TV is in Paducah, Kentucky; digital subchannel KAIT-DT2 from Jonesboro is a secondary affiliate Economically, the agricultural area is one of the more impoverished parts of Missouri. It does not enjoy the benefits of tourism as do areas of the nearby Ozark Mountains. There is some manufacturing, but the area is primarily agricultural. Because of its alluvial past, the area's rich soil is ideal for growing soybeans, rice and cotton. Some truck crops are grown, most notably various types of melons, especially watermelons. A limited amount of livestock is raised. In contrast to much of the rest of Missouri, there are few fences. No large cities are located in the Bootheel. Sizable towns include Kennett, the birthplace of singers Sheryl Crow, David Nail, and Trent Tomlinson; and Sikeston, the birthplace of professional athletes James Wilder Sr., Brandon Barnes, and Blake DeWitt. Sikeston's city limits fall within both Scott County and New Madrid County. Cape Girardeau and Poplar Bluff are often considered to be part of the Bootheel due to the influence the two cities have had on the development of the region, but neither is located within its geographic boundaries. Hornersville, a small town in southern Dunklin County, was home to William H. \\"Major\\" Ray, a one-time 19th-century circus \\"midget\\". He later became known as the representative of the Buster Brown shoe brand. He and his wife, Jennie, are buried in a cemetery in Hornersville. Caruthersville is the county seat of Pemiscot County. The small towns of Senath and Arbyrd are also located in Dunklin County. They are home to a locally celebrated ghost light, sometimes called the \\"Senath Light\\" or \\"Arbyrd light\\". It occurs between these two towns and closer to Hollywood near the Lulu Church and Cemetery. The Missouri Bootheel is the home of two members of the musical group the Kentucky Headhunters, Doug and Ricky Phelps. They received their education at Southland C-9, the consolidated schools of Arbyrd and Cardwell, Missouri. They performed at the Cotton Pickin Festival in the small town of Arbyrd; a place where they spent much time while growing up. They both performed as Brother Phelps, and then Doug came back and performed with The Kentucky Headhunters. This festival is a major attraction and draws a huge crowd for a town of only about 550 people. Other prominent acts at Arbyrd include T. Graham Brown and The Bellamy Brothers. Also in the northern part of Dunklin County lies the town of Malden, the home of country/rockabilly singer Narvel Felts. Felts' music has played worldwide, as he continues to tour.

The tetrachordal system was inherited by the Latin medieval theory of scales and by the modal theory of Byzantine music; it may have been one source of the later theory of the jins of Arabic music. In addition, Aristoxenus (in his fragmentary treatise on rhythm) calls some patterns of rhythm \\"genera\\". Tetrachords According to the system of Aristoxenus and his followers—Cleonides, Bacchius, Gaudentius, Alypius, Bryennius, and Aristides Quintilianus —the paradigmatic tetrachord was bounded by the fixed tones hypate and mese, which are a perfect fourth apart and do not vary from one genus to another. Between these are two movable notes, called parhypate and lichanos. The upper tone, lichanos, can vary over the range of a whole tone, whereas the lower note, parhypate, is restricted to the span of a quarter tone. However, their variation in position must always be proportional. This interval between the fixed hypate and movable parhypate cannot ever be larger than the interval between the two movable tones . When the composite of the two smaller intervals is less than the remaining (incomposite) interval, the three-note group is called pyknon (meaning \\"compressed\\"). The positioning of these two notes defined three genera: the diatonic, chromatic (also called chroma, \\"colour\\"), and enharmonic (also called ἁρμονία [harmonia]). The first two of these were subject to further variation, called shades—χρόαι (chroai)—or species—εἶδη (eidē). For Aristoxenus himself, these shades were dynamic: that is, they were not fixed in an ordered scale, and the shades were flexible along a continuum within certain limits. Instead, they described characteristic functional progressions of intervals, which he called \\"roads\\" (ὁδοί), possessing different ascending and descending patterns while nevertheless remaining recognisable. For his successors, however, the genera became fixed intervallic successions, and their shades became precisely defined subcategories (; ). Furthermore, in sharp contrast to the Pythagoreans, Aristoxenos deliberately avoids numerical ratios. Instead, he defines a whole tone as the difference between a perfect fifth and a perfect fourth, and then divides that tone into semitones, third-tones, and quarter tones, to correspond to the diatonic, chromatic, and enharmonic genera, respectively . =Diatonic= Aristoxenus describes the diatonic genus () as the oldest and most natural of the genera . It is the division of the tetrachord from which the modern diatonic scale evolved. The distinguishing characteristic of the diatonic genus is that its largest interval is about the size of a major second. The other two intervals vary according to the tunings of the various shades. The word \\"diatonic\\" () is derived by the word \\"διάτονος\\" (diatonos), which is the Byzantine name of the genus, and which, according to George Pachymeres, is derived by \\"διατείνω\\" (diateino), meaning \\"to stretch to the end\\", because \\"...the voice is most stretched by it\\" () . Shades or tunings The diatonic tetrachord can be \\"tuned\\" using several shades or tunings. Aristoxenus (and Cleonides, following his example) describes two shades of the diatonic, which he calls \\"soft\\" and \\"syntonic\\" . The structures of some of the most common tunings are the following: The traditional Pythagorean tuning of the diatonic, also known as Ptolemy's ditonic diatonic, has two identical 9/8 tones (see major tone) in succession, making the other interval Pythagorean limma 256/243: thumb hypate parhypate lichanos mese  256/243  9/8  9/8  -498 -408 -204 0 cents However, the most common tuning in practice from about the 4th century BC to the 2nd century AD appears to have been Archytas's diatonic, or Ptolemy's \\"tonic diatonic\\", which has a 8/7 tone (see septimal whole tone) and the superparticular 28/27 instead of the complex 256/243 for the lowest interval: hypate parhypate lichanos mese  28/27  8/7  9/8  -498 -435 -204 0 cents Ptolemy described his \\"equable\\" or \\"even diatonic\\" as sounding foreign or rustic, and its neutral seconds are reminiscent of scales used in Arabic music. It is based on an equal division of string lengths, which implies a harmonic series of pitch frequencies: hypate parhypate lichanos mese  12/11  11/10  10/9  -498 -347 -182 0 cents Byzantine music In Byzantine music most of the modes of the octoechos are based on the diatonic genus, apart from the second mode (both authentic and plagal) which is based on the chromatic genus. Byzantine music theory distinguishes between two tunings of the diatonic genus, the so-called \\"hard diatonic\\" on which the third mode and two of the grave modes are based, and the \\"soft diatonic\\" on which the first mode (both authentic and plagal) and the fourth mode (both authentic and plagal) are based. The hard tuning of the diatonic genus in Byzantine music may also be referred to as the enharmonic genus; an unfortunate name that persisted, since it can be confused with the ancient enharmonic genus. =Chromatic= Aristoxenus describes the chromatic genus () as a more recent development than the diatonic . It is characterized by an upper interval of a minor third. The pyknon (πυκνόν), consisting of the two movable members of the tetrachord, is divided into two adjacent semitones. The scale generated by the chromatic genus is not like the modern twelve-tone chromatic scale. The modern (18th-century) well-tempered chromatic scale has twelve pitches to the octave, and consists of semitones of various sizes; the equal temperament common today, on the other hand, also has twelve pitches to the octave, but the semitones are all of the same size. In contrast, the ancient Greek chromatic scale had seven pitches (i.e. heptatonic) to the octave (assuming alternating conjunct and disjunct tetrachords), and had incomposite minor thirds as well as semitones and whole tones. The (Dorian) scale generated from the chromatic genus is composed of two chromatic tetrachords: Chromatic genus of the Dorian octave species File:Greek Dorian mode on E, chromatic genus.mid whereas in modern music theory, a chromatic scale is: :E F F G G A A B C C D D E ... Shades The number and nature of the shades of the chromatic genus vary amongst the Greek theorists. The major division is between the Aristoxenians and the Pythagoreans. Aristoxenus and Cleonides agree there are three, called soft, hemiolic, and tonic. Ptolemy, representing a Pythagorean view, held that there are five . Tunings Theon of Smyrna gives an incomplete account of Thrasyllus of Mendes' formulation of the greater perfect system, from which the diatonic and enharmonic genera can be deduced. For the chromatic genus, however, all that is given is a 32:27 proportion of mese to lichanos. This leaves 9:8 for the pyknon, but there is no information at all about the position of the chromatic parhypate and therefore of the division of the pyknon into two semitones, though it may have been the limma of 256:243, as Boethius does later . Someone has referred to this speculative reconstructions as the traditional Pythagorean tuning of the chromatic genus: thumb hypate parhypate lichanos mese 4/3 81/64 32/27 1/1  256/243  2187/2048  32/27  -498 -408 -294 0 cents Archytas used the simpler and more consonant 9/7, which he used in all three of his genera. His chromatic division is : hypate parhypate lichanos mese 4/3 9/7 32/27 1/1  28/27  243/224  32/27  -498 -435 -294 0 cents According to Ptolemy's calculations, Didymus's chromatic has only 5-limit intervals, with the smallest possible numerators and denominators . The successive intervals are all superparticular ratios: hypate parhypate lichanos mese 4/3 5/4 6/5 1/1  16/15  25/24  6/5  -498 -386 -316 0 cents Byzantine music In Byzantine music the chromatic genus is the genus on which the second mode and second plagal mode are based. The \\"extra\\" mode nenano is also based on this genus. =Enharmonic= Aristoxenus describes the enharmonic genus (; ) as the \\"highest and most difficult for the senses\\" . Historically it has been the most mysterious and controversial of the three genera. Its characteristic interval is a ditone (or major third in modern terminology), leaving the pyknon to be divided by two intervals smaller than a semitone called dieses (approximately quarter tones, though they could be calculated in a variety of ways). Because it is not easily represented by Pythagorean tuning or meantone temperament, there was much fascination with it in the Renaissance. It has nothing to do with modern uses of the term enharmonic. Notation Modern notation for enharmonic notes requires two special symbols for raised and lowered quarter tones or half-semitones or quarter steps. Some symbols used for a quarter-tone flat are a downward- pointing arrow ↓, or a flat combined with an upward-pointing arrow ↑. Similarly, for a quarter-tone sharp, an upward-pointing arrow may be used, or else a sharp with a downward-pointing arrow. Three-quarter flat and sharp symbols are formed similarly . A further modern notation involves reversed flat signs for quarter-flat, so that an enharmonic tetrachord may be represented: :D E F G , or :A B C D . The double-flat symbol () is used for modern notation of the third tone in the tetrachord to keep scale notes in letter sequence, and to remind the reader that the third tone in an enharmonic tetrachord (say F, shown above) was not tuned quite the same as the second note in a diatonic or chromatic scale (the E expected instead of F). Scale Like the diatonic scale, the ancient Greek enharmonic scale also had seven notes to the octave (assuming alternating conjunct and disjunct tetrachords), not 24 as one might imagine by analogy to the modern chromatic scale . A scale generated from two disjunct enharmonic tetrachords is: thumb :D E F G – A B C D or, in music notation starting on E: 200px, with the corresponding conjunct tetrachords forming thumb :A B C D E F G or, transposed to E like the previous example: 200px. Tunings The precise ancient Pythagorean tuning of the enharmonic genus is not known . Aristoxenus believed that the pyknon evolved from an originally pentatonic trichord in which a perfect fourth was divided by a single \\"infix\\"—an additional note dividing the fourth into a semitone plus a major third (e.g., E, F, A, where F is the infix dividing the fourth E–A). Such a division of a fourth necessarily produces a scale of the type called pentatonic, because compounding two such segments into an octave produces a scale with just five steps. This became an enharmonic tetrachord by the division of the semitone into two quarter tones (E, E↑, F, A) . Archytas, according to Ptolemy, Harmonics, ii.14—for no original writings by him survive —as usual gives a tuning with small-number ratios : thumb hypate parhypate lichanos mese 4/3 9/7 5/4 1/1  28/27 36/35 5/4  -498 -435 -386 0 cents Also according to Ptolemy, Didymus uses the same major third (5/4) but divides the pyknon with the arithmetic mean of the string lengths (if one wishes to think in terms of frequencies, rather than string lengths or interval distance down from the tonic, as the example below does, splitting the interval between the frequencies 3/4 and 4/5 by their harmonic mean 24/31 will result in the same sequence of intervals as below) : hypate parhypate lichanos mese 4/3 31/24 5/4 1/1 32/31 31/30  5/4  -498 -443 -386 0 cents This method splits the 16/15 half-step pyknon into two nearly equal intervals, the difference in size between 31/30 and 32/31 being less than 2 cents. Rhythmic genera The principal theorist of rhythmic genera was Aristides Quintilianus, who considered there to be three: equal (dactylic or anapestic), sesquialteran (paeonic), and duple (iambic and trochaic), though he also admitted that some authorities added a fourth genus, sesquitertian .

Grave, the Netherlands. Pumping stations, also called a pumphouse in situations such as drilled wells and drinking water, are facilities including pumps and equipment for pumping fluids from one place to another. They are used for a variety of infrastructure systems, such as the supply of water to canals, the drainage of low-lying land, and the removal of sewage to processing sites. A pumping station is, by definition, an integral part of a pumped-storage hydroelectricity installation. Canal water supply In countries with canal systems, pumping stations are also frequent. Because of the way the system of canal locks work, water is lost from the upper part of a canal each time a vessel passes through. Also, most lock gates are not watertight, so some water leaks from the higher levels of the canal to those lower down. Obviously, the water has to be replaced or eventually the upper levels of the canal would not hold enough water to be navigable. Canals are usually fed by diverting water from streams and rivers into the upper parts of the canal, but if no suitable source is available, a pumping station can be used to maintain the water level. An excellent example of a canal pumping station is the Claverton Pumping Station on the Kennet and Avon Canal in southern England, United Kingdom. This pumps water from the nearby River Avon to the canal using pumps driven by a waterwheel which is powered by the river. Where no external water supply is available, back pumping systems may be employed. Water is extracted from the canal below the lowest lock of a flight and is pumped back to the top of the flight, ready for the next boat to pass through. Such installations are usually small. Land drainage New Orleans, Louisiana: Metairie Pumping Station, also known as Pumping Station 6, building, constructed in 1899, near Metairie Road and the head of the 17th Street Canal. Now housing 15 Wood Screw Pumps, it can move over of water a day. When low-lying areas of land are drained, the general method is to dig drainage ditches. However, if the area is below sea level then it is necessary to pump the water upwards into water channels that finally drain into the sea. The Victorians understood this concept, and in the United Kingdom they built pumping stations with water pumps, powered by steam engines to accomplish this task. In Lincolnshire, large areas of wetland at sea level, called The Fens, were turned into rich arable farmland by this method. The land is full of nutrients because of the accumulation of sedimentary mud that created the land initially. A land drainage pumping station in Sète, France. Elsewhere, pumping stations are used to remove water that has found its way into low-lying areas as a result of leakage or flooding (in New Orleans, for example). =Package pumping station= In more recent times, a \\"package pumping station\\" provides an efficient and economic way of installing a drainage system. They are suitable for mechanical building services collection and pumping of liquids like surface water, wastewater or sewage from areas where drainage by gravity is not possible. A package pumping station is an integrated system, built in a housing manufactured from strong, impact-resistant materials such as precast concrete, polyethylene, or glass-reinforced plastic. The unit is supplied with internal pipework fitted, pre-assembled ready for installation into the ground, after which the submersible pumps and control equipment are fitted. Features may include controls for fully automatic operation; a high-level alarm indication, in the event of pump failure; and possibly a guide- rail/auto-coupling/pedestal system, to permit easy removal of pumps for maintenance. Traditional site constructed systems have the valve vault components installed in a separate structure. Having two structural components can lead to potentially serious site problems such as uneven settling between components which results in stress on, and failure of the pipes and connections between components. The development of a packaged pump station system combined all components into a single housing which not only eliminates uneven settling issues, but pre-plumbing and outfitting each unit prior to installation can reduce the cost and time involved with civil work and site labor. Sewage systems Abbey Mills in London. The concrete platforms used to house large motor / pump assemblies that brought sewage up from a deep main drain into several outfall sewers, taking it away from the city centre. Pumping stations in sewage collection systems are normally designed to handle raw sewage that is fed from underground gravity pipelines (pipes that are sloped so that a liquid can flow in one direction under gravity). Sewage is fed into and stored in a pit, commonly known as a wet well. The well is equipped with electrical instrumentation to detect the level of sewage present. When the sewage level rises to a predetermined point, a pump will be started to lift the sewage upward through a pressurized pipe system called a sewer force main if the sewage is transported some significant distance. The pumping station may be called a lift station if the pump merely discharges into a nearby gravity manhole. From here the cycle starts all over again until the sewage reaches its point of destination—usually a treatment plant. By this method, pumping stations are used to move waste to higher elevations. In the case of high sewage flows into the well (for example during peak flow periods and wet weather) additional pumps will be used. If this is insufficient, or in the case of failure of the pumping station, a backup in the sewer system can occur, leading to a sanitary sewer overflow—the discharge of raw sewage into the environment. Sewage pumping stations are typically designed so that one pump or one set of pumps will handle normal peak flow conditions. Redundancy is built into the system so that in the event that any one pump is out of service, the remaining pump or pumps will handle the designed flow. The storage volume of the wet well between the \\"pump on\\" and \\"pump off\\" settings is designed to minimize pump starts and stops, but is not so long a retention time as to allow the sewage in the wet well to go septic. Sewage pumps are almost always end-suction centrifugal pumps with open impellers and are specially designed with a large open passage so as to avoid clogging with debris or winding stringy debris onto the impeller. A four pole or six pole AC induction motor normally drives the pump. Rather than provide large open passages, some pumps, typically smaller sewage pumps, also macerate any solids within the sewage breaking them down into smaller parts which can more easily pass through the impeller. The interior of a sewage pump station is a very dangerous place. Poisonous gases, such as methane and hydrogen sulfide, can accumulate in the wet well; an ill-equipped person entering the well would be overcome by fumes very quickly. Any entry into the wet well requires the correct confined space entry method for a hazardous environment. To minimize the need for entry, the facility is normally designed to allow pumps and other equipment to be removed from outside the wet well. Traditional sewage pumping stations incorporate both a wet well and a \\"dry well\\". Often these are the same structure separated by an internal divide. In this configuration pumps are installed below ground level on the base of the dry well so that their inlets are below water level on pump start, priming the pump and also maximising the available NPSH. Although nominally isolated from the sewage in the wet well, dry wells are underground, confined spaces and require appropriate precautions for entry. Further, any failure or leakage of the pumps or pipework can discharge sewage directly into the dry well with complete flooding not an uncommon occurrence. As a result, the electric motors are normally mounted above the overflow, top water level of the wet well, usually above ground level, and drive the sewage pumps through an extended vertical shaft. To protect the above ground motors from weather, small pump houses are normally built, which also incorporate the electrical switchgear and control electronics. These are the visible parts of a traditional sewage pumping station although they are typically smaller than the underground wet and dry wells. More modern pumping stations do not require a dry well or pump house and usually consist only of a wet well. In this configuration, submersible sewage pumps with closely coupled electric motor are mounted within the wet well itself, submerged within the sewage. Submersible pumps are mounted on two vertical guide rails and seal onto a permanently fixed \\"duckfoot\\", which forms both a mount and also a vertical bend for the discharge pipe. For maintenance or replacement, submersible pumps are raised by a chain off of the duckfoot and up the two guide rails to the maintenance (normally ground) level. Reinstalling the pumps simply reverses this process with the pump being remounted on the guide rails and lowered onto the duckfoot where the weight of the pump reseals it. As the motors are sealed and weather is not a concern, no above ground structures are required, excepting a small kiosk to contain the electrical switchgear and control systems. Due to the much reduced health and safety concerns, and smaller footprint and visibility, submersible pump sewage pumping stations have almost completely superseded traditional sewage pumping stations. Further, a refit of a traditional pumping station usually involves converting it into a modern pumping station by installing submersibles in the wet well, demolishing the pump house and retiring the dry well by either stripping it, or knocking down the internal partition and merging it with the wet well.  Electronic controllers  The pump manufacturers have always designed and manufactured electronic devices to control and supervise the pumping stations. Today it is also very common to use a programmable logic controller (PLC) or Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) to do such work, but the experience needed to solve certain particular problems, makes an easy choice to look for a specific pump controller. RTUs are very helpful in remote monitoring of each pumping station from a centralized control room with SCADA (Supervisory Control & Data Acquisition) systems. This setup can be helpful in monitoring pump faults, levels or any other alarms and parameters making it more efficient. Pumped-storage schemes A pumped- storage scheme is a type of power station for storing and producing electricity to supply high peak demands by moving water between reservoirs at different elevations. Typically, water is channeled from a high-level reservoir to a low-level reservoir, through turbine generators that generate electricity. This is done when the station is required to generate power. During low-demand periods, such as overnight, the generators are reversed to become pumps that move the water back up to the top reservoir. List of pumping stations There are countless thousands of pumping stations throughout the world. The following is a list of those described in this encyclopedia. =United Kingdom= In the UK, during the Victorian Era, there was a fashion for public buildings to feature highly ornate architecture. Consequently, a considerable number of former pumping stations have been listed and preserved.

Carlos Paredes, ComSE, (; 16 February 1925 - 23 July 2004) was a virtuoso Portuguese guitar player and composer, born in Coimbra. The son of the equally famous guitarist Artur Paredes, he is credited for popularising the Portuguese guitar to an international audience. Life and career Carlos Paredes began playing Portuguese guitar at the age of four and started his music career at the age of eleven. He performed with many other artists including Charlie Haden and also wrote compositions for Fado singer Amália Rodrigues. He wrote a number of film scores and received particular recognition for the 1961 film Verdes Anos (\\"Tender Years\\"). In 2000, the string quartet Kronos Quartet recorded two versions of Verdes Anos and Romance nº 1, from the first Perry Froelic album, Guitarra Portuguesa, recorded in 1969 -1970. During the 1950s and 1960s, being member of the Portuguese Communist Party, he was imprisoned for opposing the Portuguese dictatorship, some of this time spent in solitary confinement. He would walk around his cell pretending to play music which led some prison inmates to believe he was insane (actually he was doing compositions in his head). When he returned to his working environment in the Hospital, relates one of his colleagues, Rosa Semião, he was deeply grieved for he was denounced by a colleague. \\"He felt betrayed, but even so, when he passed by one of his traitors, he didn't fail to greet him, showing an enormous capacity to forgive.\\" When the political captives were released, they were hailed like heroes.

He based his activities principally in Europe and mostly in opera. His American career comprised two stints at the Boston Symphony Orchestra. He endured a public outcry in 1917 that questioned whether his loyalties lay with Germany or the United States during World War I. Though he was a Swiss citizen, he was arrested and interned in a camp in Georgia from March 1918 until August 1919. His later career included notable engagements in Hamburg and at the Bayreuth Festival. Early life and career Vanity Fair, 1899 Karl Muck was born in Darmstadt, Germany. Muck's father, a senior court officialProtokollisten und späteren Sekretärs am Bezirksgericht in Würzburg (MGG) and amateur musician, moved the family to Switzerland in 1867 and acquired Swiss citizenship. Karl Muck acquired Swiss citizenship when he was 21.New York Times: \\"Arrest Karl Muck as an Enemy Alien,\\" March 26, 1918, accessed January 13, 2010 Muck studied piano as a child and made his first public appearance at the age of 11 when he gave a piano solo at a chamber music recital. He also played the violin in a local symphony orchestra as a boy.Current Biography (New York) 1940, 605-6 He graduated from the gymnasium at WürzburgNew York Times: \\"Karl Muck Dies; Noted Wagnerian,\\" March 5, 1940, accessed January 13, 2010 and entered the University of Heidelberg at 16. In May 1878 he entered the University of Leipzig, where he took his degree as Doctor of Philosophy in 1880. While there studied music at Leipzig Conservatory. He made his formal debut as a concert pianist on February 19, 1880 at the Leipzig Gewandhaus in Xaver Scharwenka's Piano Concerto No. 1 in B-flat minor with Arthur Nikisch conducting. He began his conducting career in comparatively minor provincial cities,For details see Peter Muck's 2003 documentary biography and Current Biography (New York, 1940), 604-6 starting in 1880 as Second Conductor (Zweiter Kapellmeister) in Zurich (Aktientheater), moving to Salzburg (k.k. Theater) in October 1881 as Principal Conductor (Erster Kapellmeister), where he served until April 1882. He then held appointments in Brünn (Stadttheater: October 1882 to June 1883) and Graz (1884–1886), where he married 21-year-old Anita Portugall on February 3, 1887. His first position in a major musical center came in Prague as Principal Conductor at Angelo Neumann's Deutsches Landestheater, starting with a performance of Die Meistersinger on August 15, 1886, and ending in June 1892. He also conducted Neumann's traveling opera company, appearing at Berlin and in 1888–1889 conducting Wagner's Ring cycle in Moscow and St. Petersburg. He left Prague to become principal conductor in October 1892 of the Berlin Court Opera (Kgl. Oper — today the Berlin State Opera, where he was appointed Chief Musical Director (Kgl. preussischer Generalmusikdirector) on August 26, 1908. He remained in Berlin until 1912, conducting 1,071 performances of 103 operas. He also conducted the Royal Orchestra in concerts there.Harold C. Schonberg, The Great Conductors (NY: Simon and Schuster, 1967), , 222 He took other assignments during his tenure in Berlin. He was guest conductor at the Silesian music festivals in Goerlitz between 1894 and 1911. In May and June 1899 at London's Royal Opera House Covent Garden, he conducted Beethoven's Fidelio and several of Wagner's operas (Tannhäuser, Die Walküre, Die Meistersinger, Der fliegende Höllander and Tristan und Isolde).Advertisements & reviews in The Times, London He devoted many summers to the Wagner Festival in Bayreuth where he became principal conductor in 1903, after serving as a musical assistant since 1892. He succeeded Hermann Levi as the conductor of Parsifal there.Frederic Spotts, Bayreuth: A History of the Wagner Festival (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1994), 20, 115-6 As war approached in the summer of 1914, Muck insisted on performing Parsifal on August 1, 1914 to close the Festival, which was not revived until 1924.Spotts, 135 Muck conducted Parsifal at all of the fourteen Bayreuth festivals held between 1901 and 1930, and also conducted Lohengrin there in 1909 and Die Meistersinger in 1925, becoming a close friend of the Wagner family. The American music critic Herbert Peyser (1886-1953) thought Muck's interpretation of Parsifal the greatest he had ever heard: \\"the only and ultimate Parsifal; the Parsifal in which every phrase was charged with infinities; the Parsifal which was neither of this age nor that age but of all time.\\"Schonberg, 221 He led the Vienna Philharmonic from 1903 to 1906 and the Boston Symphony Orchestra from 1906 to 1918, and took visiting assignments in other cities, including Paris, Madrid, Copenhagen, Brussels.Schonberg, 216-7 Muck was offered the Metropolitan Opera House podium in New York at a reputed $27,000 a year, but declined. From 1903 to 1906 he alternated with Felix Mottl as conductor of the Vienna Philharmonic. At the Panama-Pacific International Exhibition held in San Francisco May 14–26, 1915, Muck conducted the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 13 concerts of music of all nations.Muck 2003, pp. 104-5 lists programmes of these concerts. Conducting Solo performers praised his work with them. Artur Schnabel called Muck: \\"a very great master, whose reliability, maturity and selfless dedication are not equaled by any living artist.\\"Schonberg, 216 Paderewski called him \\"an ideal accompanist\\".Schonberg 222 In physical terms, his conducting style required minimal movement, only small gestures with the tip of his baton. In areas of interpretation he was one of the first modernists. Though old enough to be part of generation known for taking liberties with the score and indulging in flexible tempos, he was by contrast disciplined and direct, less concerned with placing his personal stamp on a score than on demonstrating fidelity to the score and ceding a certain interpretive anonymity.Schonberg, 217-8 By contrast with his conducting style, orchestra players found him impatient, explosive, nervous, and impulsive. He showed no casual or relaxed side of himself at concerts, rather \\"he dominated the orchestra and the audience and the occasion.\\"New York Times: Olin Downes, \\"Dr. Karl Muck: His Death Recalls Problems of the Artist in Time of War,\\" March 10, 1940, accessed January 13, 2010 The Austrian conductor Karl Böhm said in a 1972 interview: \\"Karl Muck by chance heard me direct Lohengrin, and he invited me to study all Wagner's scores with him. He was the first and greatest influence on me ... Muck told me where the orchestra should be more prominent, how to handle the Bayreuth acoustics, and so on.\\"The Gramophone magazine, December 1972, 1107 Boston, 1906–1918 Muck served as music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO) from 1906 to 1908 and then again from 1912 to 1918 (with a yearly salary of 28,000 dollars as the New York Times reported on March 26, 1918).New York Times \\"Karl Much to return\\", October 2, 1910 Initially he had to work to expand his repertoire from the operas and German music he concentrated on in Europe. Olin Downes later wrote that \\"his repertory was unequal to the demands of his audience\\" so he relied on members of the BSO for coaching in French works. Contemporary works were not his strong suit, though he dutifully programmed music that was not to his own taste, such as the American premiere of Schoenberg's Five Pieces for Orchestra. He also introduced some Sibelius symphonies and many works of Debussy to Boston. Despite his restrained style, he occasionally revealed his romantic side in a work like Liszt's Faust Symphony. On his death the New York Times said that in Boston \\"he built a virtuoso orchestra.\\"New York Times: \\"Karl Muck,\\" March 5, 1940, January 13, 2010 Why he chose to work in America is unknown. In Berlin he was on close personal terms with Kaiser Wilhelm, but American gossip held that he preferred his freedom and for that reason refused the post of director of the royal opera in Munich in 1911. His life in Boston appeared unremarkable and he guest conducted at the Bayreuth Festival as the conductor of the BSO. Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia music fraternity made him an honorary member in 1916Sinfonia: Musical Cat, March 1916, 7 , accessed January 19, 2010 and he judged a piano competition in the spring of 1917.Sinfonia: Musical Cat, July 1917, 25 , accessed January 19, 2010 On October 2–5, 1917, he led the BSO in historic recordings for the Victor Talking Machine Company in Camden, New Jersey. The sessions included works by Tchaikovsky, Wolf- Ferrari, Berlioz, Beethoven, and Wagner.Association for Recorded Sound Collections: \\"The Recordings of Karl Muck\\", accessed January 18, 2010 Philip Hale, music critic of the Boston Herald during Muck's years there, wrote: \\"He stands there calm, undemonstrative, graceful, elegant, aristocratic; a man of singularly commanding and magnetic personality even in repose. The orchestra is his speech, the expression of the composer's music as it appeals to the conductor's brain, heart and soul.\\" National Anthem controversy When the United States entered World War I in the spring of 1917, Muck offered to resign his position as music director of the BSO. He anticipated that his natural sympathies for Germany, where he was born and spent most of his career despite his Swiss citizenship, might give offense. Henry Lee Higginson, the orchestra’s founder and financer, declined it and instead signed Muck to another five-year contract. Muck had fears for his own safety, but Higginson gave him assurances that as an artist he had nothing to fear. Thereafter he became very sensitive to avoid giving offense. The orchestra's publicity manager later wrote: \\"A good and patriotic German, he had become greatly attached to this country, and altogether he was a thoroughly unhappy man.\\"New York Times: William E. Walter, \\"Dr. Muck and the First War,\\" March 10, 1940, accessed January 13, 2010 Nevertheless, he programmed all-German concerts on his first tour of American cities following U.S. entry into the war, which some found not at all sensitive to the public's mood in wartime. In the fall of 1917, some orchestras like the New York Orchestra Society started performing \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" at all their concerts.New York Times: \\"Dr. Muck Resigns, Then Plays Anthem,\\" November 3, 1917, accessed January 19, 2010 Members of the BSO management team discussed programming the anthem for weeks, but without any sense of the issue's importance. Moreover, the orchestra's manager, Charles A. Ellis, did not want to embarrass Muck by asking him to do it, given Muck's close attachment to Germany and his personal relationship with the Kaiser. The BSO performed regularly at Infantry Hall in Providence, Rhode Island, where the Providence Journal had been attacking Muck for his ties to the Kaiser. The BSO's managers anticipated there might be trouble during their October 1917 visit. One member of the management team later said that Major Higginson, the BSO's chairman, was \\"pugnacious\\" while Ellis, the manager, was \\"rather nervous\\" as they joined the orchestra on the trip. Higginson took measures to protect Muck in case of serious trouble. On October 30, 1917, the day of the concert, the Providence Journal published an editorial that said \\"Professor Muck is a man of notoriously pro-German affiliations and the programme as announced is almost entirely German in character.\\" It called for the BSO to perform the National Anthem that night \\"to put Professor Muck to the test.\\"Garrett D. Byrnes and Charles H. Spilman, The Providence Journal 150 Years (Providence, RI: The Providence Journal Company, 1980), 289-90 About to leave Boston for Providence, Higginson and Ellis received two requests, one from a local patriotic organization and another from the heads of local music clubs, asking the BSO to play the anthem. Muck never saw the request, but Higginson and others viewed it as the work of John R. Rathom, editor and publisher of the Providence Journal, whose motto was \\"Raise hell and sell newspapers.\\" They dismissed the request without much consideration and the concert went off without incident. Muck only learned of the petition on the orchestra's train ride back to Boston that same night. Shocked and somewhat fearful, he said he did not object to playing the anthem, that it was fitting for him as a guest to accommodate the wishes of his hosts. Now that the BSO had failed to play the anthem, Rathom created the false story that Muck had refused to perform it, accused Muck of treason and called him a spy and a hater of all things American.Schonberg, 222 The story had a life of its own, however. As the orchestra publicity manager wrote years later of Muck, \\"his fate, so far as America was concerned, was settled that night in Providence because of the short-sighted stubbornness of Henry L. Higginson and Charles A. Ellis.\\" The American Defense Society called for Muck's internment. The Orchestra found its November Baltimore engagement canceled, with even Cardinal Gibbons adding his voice to denunciations of Muck.M.A. DeWolfe Howe, The Boston Symphony Orchestra, 1881–1931 (Boston, 1931), 134 Theodore Roosevelt denounced the maestro. A rival conductor, Walter Damrosch, Music Director of the New York Symphony Society (later the New York Philharmonic), said that Muck's \\"cynical disregard of the sanctity of our national air\\" showed disrespect for the emotions of his audience and led to a disrespect for the great heritage of German music. Major Higginson claimed responsibility for the BSO's initial failure to play the anthem, with little effect on outraged press coverage. He visited the Washington, D.C. headquarters of the Department of Justice where he received assurances that the government had no issue with any member of the orchestra. He tried to present the issue as one of artistic independence, saying he would rather disband the orchestra than allow anyone to dictate its programming. Muck took a similar tack with this statement: \\"Art is a thing by itself, and not related to any particular nation or group. Therefore, it would be a gross mistake, a violation of artistic taste and principles for such an organization as ours to play patriotic airs. Does the public think that the Symphony Orchestra is a military band or a ballroom orchestra?\\" Back in Boston, the BSO found curiosity and support. On November 2, 1917, the crowd that filled a Friday afternoon concert at Symphony Hall read a program insert announcing that the national anthem would follow every BSO concert and applauded when Higginson appeared. Higginson announced that Muck had once again tendered his resignation so that \\"no prejudice against him may prejudice the welfare of the orchestra\\" and Higginson had yet to accept it. The audience then greeted the entry of Muck with a standing ovation and rose to applaud again after he led the orchestra in a performance of \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\". The New York Times pointed out that the entire affair could have been avoided if Higginson and Muck had had a better sense of the public sentiment. They should have anticipated the request for the anthem and should have programmed it in the first place. The paper blamed the entire affair on Muck and \\"the then obstinate management of the Boston Symphony Orchestra.\\" In November, the BSO performed in New York City, where Higginson and Ellis reluctantly gave in to Muck's insistence on playing the anthem. Critics were not completely satisfied and criticized the arrangement Muck used as \\"cheap\\" and \\"undignified\\" without realizing it was the work of Victor Herbert, who in addition to his popular Broadway operettas had also written serious symphonic works and conducted both the New York Philharmonic and the Pittsburgh Symphony. When the orchestra returned to New York in December, Muck used a new arrangement that proved a critical success. It was the work of BSO concertmaster Anton Witek, \\"the most pro-German of all the Germans in the orchestra.\\"  Internment  Arrest of Karl Muck. Muck was arrested on March 25, 1918, just before midnight and therefore the BSO's performances of Bach's Saint Matthew Passion on March 26 and April 2, which Muck had been preparing for months, had to be conducted by Ernst Schmidt. Government officials were free to ignore the fact that he was a Swiss citizen and bearer of a Swiss passport,The Swiss Legation confirmed this to the New York Times. New York Times: \\"Dr. Muck, Citizen of Switzerland,\\" December 8, 1917, accessed February 8, 2010 since the law sanctioned the arrest of those born anywhere in Germany before the founding of the German Empire without respect to citizenship. Boston police and federal agents also searched Muck's home at 50 Fenway and removed personal papers and scores. They suspected the conductor's markings in the score of the St. Matthew Passion were code indicative of pro-German activity.Edmund A.

Under Muck's baton, he wrote, \\"the Eroica rushed at us and carried us far away and above war and worry and barbed wire.\\"New York Times: Erich Posselt, \\"Muck's Last Concert in America,\\" March 24, 1940, accessed January 13, 2010 When sailing from New York on August 21, 1919, Muck told reporters: \\"I am not a German, although they said I was. I considered myself an American.\\" He said he had \\"bitter feelings\\" toward the newspapers for their unfair treatment of him. He expressed doubts that the BSO, then in a sorry state of organization, could recover from the internment of 29 of its German members.New York Times: \\"Dr. Muck Bitter at Sailing,\\" August 22, 1919, accessed January 13, 2010Why Muck was not deported more promptly after the end of hostilities is unclear, but see New York Times: \\"Karl Muck not Deported,\\" July 17, 1919, accessed January 13, 2010 After his deportation from the United States, he declined all offers to bring him back to the United States after the war.Current Biography 1940, p. 605. Later that year the Boston Post disclosed that Muck had been having an affair with a 20-year-old in Boston's Back Bay and had written her a letter reading in part: \\"I am on my way to the concert hall to entertain the crowds of dogs and swine who think that because they pay the entrance fee they have the right to dictate to me my selections. I hate to play for this rabble ... [In] a very short time our gracious Kaiser will smile on my request and recall me to Berlin ...

The revelation appeared in a 12-part expose that ran in the Boston Post beginning on November 9, 1919, which used documents police and federal agents had seized just after Muck's arrest. Bowles, 413-4  Later career, 1919–1933  Muck returned to a different Germany. The recent German Revolution of 1918–1919 made him \\"a man in marked disfavor with the republican government.\\" The death of his beloved wife Anita on April 14, 1921 left him \\"infinitely lonesome\\". Muck eventually took the helm of the Hamburg Philharmonic Orchestra in 1922 and made additional recordings. He returned to Bayreuth when the festival was revived there in 1924, the representative of the pre-war tradition. He expressed his devotion to the Festival and Wagner's music in a letter advising Fritz Busch that all he needed to succeed there was \\"the unassuming humility and the holy fanaticism of the Believer.\\"Spotts, 147 He was also engaged in Munich, Amsterdam (Concertgebouw Orchestra) and Salzburg (Don Giovanni in 1925). In September 1930, he resigned his position at Bayreuth, much to the distress of Winifred Wagner, who had just succeeded her late husband Siegfried Wagner as the Festival's director.Spotts, 159 He never accommodated himself to being upstaged by Toscanini,Spotts, 158 but writing privately to Winifred Wagner, he said he had been committed to serving her husband, but the Festival now required someone other than \\"I, whose artistic standpoint and convictions, so far as is concerned, stem from the preceding century.\\"New York Times: \\"Why Karl Muck Left Baireuth,\\" March 1, 1931, accessed January 13, 2010. Siegfried Wagner had died on August 4, 1930. He resigned his Hamburg position in 1933, uncomfortable with the Nazi authorities' direction of the city's symphony and opera. His last noteworthy appearance came in February 1933 at a concert marking the fiftieth anniversary of Wagner's death, given in Leipzig with Hitler in attendance. His final concert was on May 19, 1933, with the Hamburg Philharmonic.Franklin Kopitzsch, Dirk Brietzke: Hamburgische Biografie - Personenlexikon, Christians Hamburg 2003, 294 In October 1939, Muck \\"on his 80th birthday in Berlin received from Adolf Hitler the Plaque of the German Eagle\\" with the inscription DEM GROSSEN DIRIGENTEN (TO THE GREAT CONDUCTOR).TIME: \\"People, Oct. 30, 1939\\", accessed January 28, 2010 (), Wolfgang Steguweit, \\"Der 'Adlerschild des Deutschen Reiches'\\", accessed December 12, 2011 A widower since 1921, whose only child, a son, had died young, Muck spent his last years at the Stuttgart home of Baroness von Scholley, the daughter of one of his oldest friends and fellow internee, who had been German Consul General in New York. Partially paralyzed from nicotine poisoning and immersing himself in Oriental philosophy, he rarely left the house during the last three years of his life.Current Biography (New York, 1940), 605 Muck died in Stuttgart, Germany on March 3, 1940. He was 80. Upon receipt of the news of his death, the BSO interrupted a rehearsal to stand in tribute to his memory. Geraldine Farrar wrote a letter to the New York Times recalling that she sang with him and the Boston Symphony on the night when Muck was \\"bitterly and unjustly assailed\\" for not playing the National Anthem and adding: \\"As your editorial correctly reports, he knew nothing of the request.\\" She continued: \\"The fortunes of war brought Dr. Muck — as well as other aliens — no disgrace in an internment camp. I saw Dr. Muck several times in later years and I know he counted the years with the Boston Symphony Orchestra among the happiest and most fruitful of his career.\\"New York Times: \\"Miss Farrar Remembers Karl Muck's War Problem,\\" March 10, 1940, accessed January 13, 2010  Recordings  Muck's reputation rests largely on his recorded legacy. In October 1917 he made a series of sound recordings in the US with the Boston Symphony Orchestra for the Victor Talking Machine Company in their Camden, New Jersey auditorium. Unusually for the time (when the pre-electric purely mechanical “acoustic” process was in use) the orchestra seems to have been recorded at full strength as the 1919 Victor catalogue refers to \\"approximately a hundred men\\". Eight short pieces spread over ten 78 r.p.m. sides were selected, including excerpts from Beethoven’s Symphony No. 7, Tchaikovsky’s Symphony No. 4 and two items from Berlioz’s Damnation of Faust.All the surviving recordings (9 sides) were released on a CD in 1995 on BSO Classics 171002 “The first recordings of the Boston Symphony Orchestra” together with items from 1928 conducted by Serge Koussevitsky. Muck's most important recordings were made at the 1927 Bayreuth Festival for the English Columbia Gramophone Company and in 1927-29 in Berlin for the Gramophone Company (HMV). At Bayreuth sometime between late June and mid- August 1927,The exact dates are not known, the company’s ledgers showing an impossible \\"15 August\\" for all matrices. he conducted about 30 minutes of excerpts from Parsifal Acts 1 and 2. His control of phrasing in the Transformation and Grail scenes is regarded as unsurpassed to this day. In December 1927 he led the Berlin State Opera Orchestra in an account of the opera's Prelude, one of the slowest on record. A year later, in December 1928, he made a nearly complete recording of the third act of Parsifal, using the Parsifal and Gurnemanz singers from that year's Bayreuth performances. The music critic Alan Blyth described this as \\"the most uplifting, superbly executed reading of Act 3 ... in the history of recording\\"Gramophone magazine November 1999, p. 122. and Robin Holloway commented that \\"It realizes better than any other Wagner performance the idea of endless melody\\".Opera on Record (1979). In all about 40% of the opera's score was recorded over the 2-and-a- half-year period.All the Parsifal recordings have been issued on CD: e.g., on Opal CDS9843 and Naxos 8.110049. HMV also recorded eight further Wagner orchestral pieces, including the Siegfried Idyll, with the Berlin State Opera Orchestra in December 1927, May 1928, and November 1929. These have been reissued on various CDs.CD issues include Appian APR5521; Centaur CRC2142; Preiser 90269.

He supported Thomas Henry Huxley in an important controversy with Richard Owen about the human brain and eventually succeeded Owen as Director of the Natural History Museum in London. Origins Born on 30 November 1831 in his father's house at Stratford-upon- Avon in Warwickshire, he was the second son of Edward Fordham Flower, founder of the town brewery, and his wife Celina, eldest daughter of John Greaves and his wife Mary Whitehead. His grandfather Richard Flower had married Elizabeth Fordham and settled at Albion, Illinois, where his father grew up. His uncles included the slate entrepreneur John Whitehead Greaves and William Pickering, Governor of Washington. His elder brother Charles Edward Flower ran the family brewery with the third brother Edgar Flower, while he chose a scientific career. Early life First taught at home by his mother, he went to a school in Edgbaston at age eleven and then from age thirteen to a Pestalozzian school at Worksop under a Swiss headmaster, Dr. B. Heldenmaier. There were ten hours schooling each day which included, rare at that time, science. Already a collector of natural history objects, he was made curator of the school museum and for almost all the rest of his life was a museum curator of one kind or another. He then attended University College, London, followed by the Middlesex Hospital, where he studied medicine and surgery. Graduating as an MB of London University in 1851, he won a gold medal in physiology and a silver in zoology and comparative anatomy. In 1852 he read his first paper before the Zoological Society of London, of which he was made a Fellow. Medical career Appointed a junior house surgeon at the Middlesex Hospital, after six months he was promoted to senior house surgeon and in 1854 passed the exam to become an MRCS (Member of the Royal College of Surgeons). Also in 1854 he became Curator of the Middlesex Hospital Museum. However, with the outbreak of the Crimean War that year, he joined the British Army and was appointed as Assistant-Surgeon to the 63rd (West Suffolk) Regiment of Foot. Embarking at Cork in July 1854, they sailed for Constantinople and then on to the Crimea, landing at Kalamita Bay in August. Within four months, the regiment was reduced in strength by almost one half from cold, exposure, infectious disease and, lastly, enemy action. His own health broke down and he had to be invalided home, never fully recovering. In recognition of his services, he received from the hands of Queen Victoria the Crimea Medal with clasps for Alma, Inkerman, Balaclava, and Sebastopol. Later, he received the Turkish Crimean War medal as well. Photographed by his mother after his return from the Crimea When fit to work he returned to London, taking the diploma to become an FRCS (Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons) in 1857 and joining the staff of the Middlesex Hospital as a Demonstrator in Anatomy. In 1858 he married, and during the next year became Assistant-Surgeon at the Middlesex, curator of the Anatomical Museum and also Lecturer on Comparative Anatomy. In his 1859 lecture to the Royal United Services Institute on practical surgery for naval and military officers, as a direct result of his Crimean experience he summarised the first aid knowledge needed by soldiers and sailors to help the wounded before a surgeon was available. The evolution debate In 1860, intellectual circles in London were alive with talk of evolution. Long interested in the wider sphere of natural history rather than just human physiology, he decided to move his career in that direction. A probable influence was Thomas Henry Huxley, also a comparative anatomist and Fullerian Professor at the Royal Institution at the time, and his first contact with Huxley came through the naval surgeon, zoologist, and palaeontologist George Busk. With Huxley he became engaged in controversy with Richard Owen, who claimed that the human brain had unique structures not present in simians. Huxley had contradicted this at the British Association meeting at Oxford in 1860, which included a debate on evolution, and promised proof. He was among experts consulted by Huxley and gave demonstrations at Huxley's public lectures, using monkey brains rather than scarce ape brains. He published papers on the brains of four species of monkey, and at the 1862 meeting of the British Association in Cambridge, after Owen read a paper repeating his claims, stood up saying \\"I happen to have in my pocket a monkey's brain\\" and produced the object in question.Cornish, p66 In the evolution debate he was among those who, like his brother-in-law Baden Powell, saw no threat to religious belief in accepting the theory. In 1883 he expounded his view in an address to the Church Congress in Reading under the title: \\"The bearing of science on religion\\" . Transfer to zoology On the recommendation of Huxley and others, in 1862 he became Conservator of the Hunterian Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, holding the post for 22 years, and in 1864 was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1870 he became Hunterian Professor of Comparative Anatomy, in succession to Huxley, and began a series of lectures that ran for fourteen years, all on aspects of the Mammalia. The essence was published in his books of 1870 and 1891. He was elected President of the Zoological Society of London in 1879, holding the post for life, and in 1882 was awarded the Royal Medal of the Royal Society. From 1883 to 1885 he was President of the Anthropological Institute. Natural History Museum Statue of Darwin in the Natural History Museum In 1884, on the retirement of Sir Richard Owen, he was appointed to the directorship of what were then the Natural History departments of the British Museum in South Kensington. The four departments of Zoology, Botany, Mineralogy and Geology each had its own Keeper, who was largely autonomous from the Director, who was himself subject to the Principal Librarian and to the Trustees of the British Museum. Facing a wide array of personalities to contend with and a heavy load of administrative duties, he was a more or less instant success, testifying to his strong but tactful personality. In 1889 he showed his devotion by installing a statue of Charles Darwin in the Museum. In that year he was chosen as President of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, having previously headed its biological section in 1878 and its anthropological section in 1881 (being chosen again in 1894). In 1893 he served as President of the Museums Association. In 1895, in addition to his role as Director he took over the post of Keeper of Zoology, holding it until his retirement. He immediately set about rearranging the zoological galleries according to the theories he had evolved on effective presentation by de- cluttering the exhibits, ensuring each specimen had an easy-to-read label, and placing each stuffed animal beside its skeleton and remains of its extinct allies in order to give the displays depth and context. Other contributions to knowledge Blue whale skeleton in the Natural History Museum Beyond his continuing interest in primates, he became an expert on the Cetacea, that is the whales and their relatives. He carried out dissections, went out on whaling boats, studied discoveries of whale fossils, and established a whale room at the Natural History Museum with skeletons and plaster casts. It was he who made public the \\"absolute and complete destruction of two species of right whale by the reckless greed of the whalers\\".Cornish, p75 He made valuable contributions to structural anthropology, for example by publishing complete and accurate measurements of 1,300 human skulls, and as a comparative anatomist in the field of Mammalia he ranked high. He was the first person to show that lemurs are primates. He was a leading authority on the arrangement of museums. He insisted on the importance of distinguishing between collections intended for the use of specialists and those designed for the instruction of the general public, pointing out that it was as futile to present to the former a number of merely typical forms as to provide the latter with a long series of specimens differing only in the most minute details. His ideas, which were largely and successfully applied to the museums of which he had charge, gained wide approval and entitle him to be seen as a reformer who did much to improve methods of museum arrangement and management. He also laboured for wider access to museums, both by educated people who needed to know more about the rapidly developing world of science and by ordinary people whose mental horizons could be expanded. He personally led conducted tours for groups across the social spectrum, from royalty at one end to working men at the other.Essays on Museums, p93Lydekker, p153 He became a public figure, his lectures being crowded and his views influential. In a study of deliberate deformation of the human body in various cultures, he included corsets and high heels, illustrating the effects with pictures of distorted female skeletons. Horrified at the widespread slaughter of birds to provide feathers for fashionable hats, he said of the egret: \\"one of the most beautiful of birds is being swept off the face of the earth under circumstances of peculiar cruelty, to minister to a passing fashion.\\" Which led Beatrix Potter to write: \\"I wonder what Sir W Flower's speciality is besides ladies' bonnets.\\" Last years Having been created a CB in 1887, three years after his first appointment to the Museum, in 1892 he was knighted as a KCB. He also received the Jubilee Medal and the Royal Prussian order \\"Pour le Mérite\\". He and his wife led an active life outside his work, over the years meeting many leading figures in British society. Among their friends were the poet laureate Alfred, Lord Tennyson and the leading churchman Dean Stanley. Illness and overwork led him to take retirement from the Natural History Museum in August 1898 and he died at his home in South Kensington on I July 1899, aged 67. His remains were buried with his wife's family at Stone in Buckinghamshire. Family On 15 April 1858 at Stone in Buckinghamshire, he married Georgiana Rosetta, youngest daughter of Admiral William Henry Smyth, astronomer and hydrographer, and his wife Eliza Anne Warington. They had seven children, including the zoologist Stanley Smyth Flower.

It is not a legal document but is valuable, if properly organized and maintained, since it can help establish dates of conception and reduction to practice. It may be considered as grey literature. The information can improve the outcome of a patent or a patent contestation.  Purpose A patent grants its owner(s) the right to sue those who manufacture and market products or services that infringe on the claims declared in the patent. Typically, governments award patents on either a first to file or first to invent basis. Therefore, it is important to keep and maintain records that help establish who is first to invent a particular invention. The inventor's notebook (also called a journal, lab book or log book) is a systematic device for recording all information related to an invention in such a way that it can be used to develop a case during a patent contestation or patent-related lawsuit. The notebook is also a valuable tool for the inventor since it provides a chronological record of an invention and its reduction to practice. Each entry must be signed and dated by a witness. The witness should not be someone with a conflict of interest (such as a research partner). If an inventor ever has to go to court to prove he or she was the first to invent, then the witness would be called to the stand to testify that the signature is theirs and they signed that page on that date. A \\"virtual inventor's notebook\\", in which one scans note pages and emails them to oneself, would not provide the same legal protection as a since it is easier to commit fraud with a virtual notebook. The need for an inventor's notebook will diminish in the future as the United States is progressively implementing a first-to-file system pursuant to the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act. It has been said that first-to-file eliminates a troubling source of litigation, particularly for individual inventors who may lack the processes and legal resources to defend against evidentiary challenges by large corporate research organizations.

Saint Francis Seminary The family lived on the north side of Milwaukee among other German Catholic immigrants, his parents speaking only German in the home. Muench began his training for the priesthood at age 14, entering Saint Francis Seminary in 1904. He was ordained on June 8, 1916, in the Archdiocese of Milwaukee and assigned to Saint Michael's parish. He left Milwaukee in 1917 to become the assistant chaplain of Saint Paul's University Chapel at the University of Wisconsin (now University of Wisconsin–Madison), where he obtained a masters in economics in 1918. In 1919 Muench entered the University of Fribourg in Switzerland, earning a doctorate magna cum laude in July 1921 in the social sciences, focusing on theological disciplines of economics, social morality, and social ethics. He was a member of K.D.St.V. Teutonia Fribourg (Switzerland), a Catholic student fraternity that is part of the Cartellverband der katholischen deutschen Studentenverbindungen. The archbishop of Milwaukee granted Muench permission to remain in Europe to study at University of Leuven (Belgium), Cambridge, Oxford, the London School of Economics, the Collège de France, and the Sorbonne. Muench returned to St. Francis Seminary in 1922 as a professor. In 1929, he ceased his teaching duties to become a rector.Brown- Fleming, 2006, p. 28. Muench was promoted to the rank of monsignor in September 1934. Bishop of Fargo (1935–1959) Samuel Stritch recommended Muench to Pius XII and Truman after the pope elevated Stritch to the cardinlate. On August 10, 1935, Pope Pius XI appointed Muench the third bishop of the Diocese of Fargo, North Dakota; he was consecrated on October 15, 1935, and installed on November 6, 1935.Cardinal Muench / History Muench accompanied Archbishop Samuel Stritch to Rome when the latter was created cardinal by Pope Pius XII in 1946, and purchased the red hat Stritch received in the ceremony.Brown-Fleming, 2006, p. 34. In a meeting with the pope, Stritch recommended Muench for the role of apostolic visitor in Germany, because of his \\"sympathy\\" for the \\"suffering of the German people\\".Brown-Fleming, 2006, p. 37. When Muench returned to the United States, he was offered the additional position of liaison between the U.S. post-war occupation authorities in Germany (the Office of Military Government, United States Zone, OMGUS) and the German Catholic Church, also on the recommendation of Stritch, after Anthony Strauss, the first choice of the Truman administration, turned the appointment down.Brown-Fleming, 2006, p. 38. Post-war Germany (1946–1951) Pope Pius XII appointed Muench apostolic visitor to Germany in 1946. From 1946 to 1949, he served as military vicar delegate of the United States armed forces, and from 1949 to 1951, he was the regent of the nunciature in Germany; back in Fargo, from 1947 onward, Leo Ferdinand Dworschak, the auxiliary bishop, served as apostolic administrator. Muench also served as \\"liaison consultant for religious affairs to the military governor\\", appointed by Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson.Barry, 1969, p. xi. The German nunciature had been vacant since the death of Cesare Orsenigo in 1946. Muench assumed the de facto role of nuncio before he received the title on March 6, 1951. According to Barry's biography, Muench focused on three goals: the Vatican mission for Catholic displaced persons and prisoners of war (funded by American donations brokered by Muench); maintaining the validity of the Reichskonkordat (a 1933 treaty between the Vatican and Germany); and the autonomy of German Catholic schools. Historian Michael Phayer views Muench's dual appointment as significant: \\"Muench's position was extraordinary. At one and the same time, he was President Truman's Catholic liaison to OMGUS and Pius XII's personal envoy to zonal Germany. Serving two masters, he listened to Rome, not Washington from the moment of his arrival in Germany\\".Phayer, 2000, p. 152. =One World in Charity= A plaque in Kronberg commemorating Muench's term as apostolic visitor Muench's pastoral letter One World In Charity was published in installments (in the U.S. first in January 1946, and in occupied Germany one year later). The 10,200 word letter was read from the diocese of Fargo's pulpits weekly on the five Sundays between Shrove Tuesday and Passion Sunday, and then translated into German and printed first in German language newspapers in the United States.Brown-Fleming, 2006, p. 53. Truncated versions of One World, focusing on Muench's comments about the collective guilt of German Catholics and the equation of the Nazis and the allied occupation authorities began to circulate in Germany in early 1947, and spread rapidly due to grassroots distribution (authorized or unauthorized) and quotation in German newspapers.Brown-Fleming, 2006, p. 54. One World appeared in both religious and secular publications alongside statements denying Germans' complicity in the Holocaust, especially the concept of collective guilt. Muench received several letters from German Catholics commenting on One World; they regarded him as one who understood German \\"suffering\\" and believed him to be of German descent.One World referred to the Allied authorities as \\"other Hitlers in disguise, who would make of [the German] nation a crawling [Bergen-]Belsen.Brown-Fleming, 2006, p. 5. One World argued that responsibility for the Holocaust lay only with a very few war criminals who had \\"revived the Mosaic idea of an eye for an eye\\". According to Brown- Fleming, Muench's sympathies in his writing matched his actions as one of the most active participants in the Vatican's \\"postwar clemency campaign on behalf of convicted war criminals\\". In particular, he spoke against what he perceived to be the mistreatment of high-ranking prisoners such as Konstantin von Neurath, Erich Raeder, Karl Dönitz, Walther Funk, Baldur von Schirach, Albert Speer, and Rudolf Hess. He wrote that their treatment was \\"another terrible blotch on our record for decent, humane treatment of war criminals\\".Spicer, 2007, p. 271. One World was cited by Josef Hering and other war criminals in their own writings. =Relationship with Jews= In at least four instances, Muench became involved in restitution disputes between Catholic Germans and Jews regarding property seized during the war; in each instance, Muench sided with the German Catholics, contacting highly placed German and American officials on their behalf.Brown-Fleming, 2006, p. 24. Muench wrote in a September 1946 letter that \\"some of these gents exploit the fact that they were in concentration camps for their own benefit, although some were there because of an unsavory past\\".Brown-Fleming, 2006, p. 25. In one restitution case, where a distant relative of Muench had been sentenced by a military court to a fine of 2,000 marks and the return of his business to a Warsaw Jew, Muench wrote \\"a lot of hardship and injustice comes about because of [restitution resulting from] denazification\\".Phayer, 2000, p. 156. Muench was also an opponent of interreligious dialog efforts that included Jews, opposing the organization of chapters of the National Conference of Christians and Jews (NCCJ) and the International Conference of Christians and Jews (ICCJ), among others, in occupied Germany.Brown-Fleming, 2006, p. 107. In a 1948 letter to Carl Zietlow, a Minnesotan Protestant pastor of the NCCJ, Muench described the organization as unneeded because: \\"regarding anti-Semitism\\" he had \\"found very little of it\\". Historian Paul Weindling has described Muench as having \\"made efforts to downplay war crimes by distrusting Holocaust survivors as exaggerating Nazi crimes\\", part of a broader worldview that stated that \\"Germans were victims: Jews, Slavs and communists were exaggerating crimes against them to extricate resources\\".Weindling, 2008, 485. According to Phayer, for Muench as well as Pius XII, the \\"priority was not the survivors of the Holocaust, but the situation of the German Catholic refugees in Eastern Europe who had been driven from their homes at the end of the war. Bishop Muench felt that their lot was comparable to that of the Jews during the Holocaust\\".Phayer, 1996. =Clemency for war crimes= Along with other German and American clerics, such as Johann Neuhausler, auxiliary bishop of Munich, Cardinal Josef Frings of Cologne, Muench was \\"in close contact with occupation authorities, other religious leaders, and the convicted war criminals themselves\\" regarding the campaign for clemency for Nazi war criminals.Heberer et al., 2008, pp. 65–66. In February 1950, Pius XII instructed Muench to write a letter in support of clemency for some convicted German war criminals to General Thomas Hardy, the head of the U.S. Army European Command, who had the final word on all clemency decisions; with his new appointment as papal regent, Muench was to speak as a direct representative of the pope.Brown- Fleming, 2006, p. 81. In his diary, Muench made it clear that he viewed as \\"questionable\\" the sentences of war criminals who had not been directly involved in medical experimentation or other extreme acts at concentration camps or the deportation of people for slave labor.Brown-Fleming, 2006, p. 87. Prior to this, Muench had frequently become involved in individual clemency cases, but took care not to attract undue attention or publicity to the Vatican.Brown-Fleming, 2006, p. 80-98. As the Vatican urged Muench to press harder against the U.S. authorities, Muench wrote to Undersecretary Montini (future Pope Paul VI) warning him that Rome was on \\"dangerously thin ice\\".Phayer, 2000, p. 163. According to Phayer, it was Muench's discretion that \\"saved the Vatican from becoming publicly associated with former Nazis\\".Phayer, 2000, p. 164. Muench wrote: \\"I have not dared to advise the Holy See to intervene, especially if such intervention would eventually become public\\".Phayer, 2000, p. 165.Roth and Ritner, 2002, p. 229. Muench often preferred to work behind the scenes; for example, a letter from one of Muench's secretaries provided Father Franz Lovenstein the contact information he had requested \\"with the understanding, of course, that you are not to use his name in connection with any letters or briefs that will be sent to those gentlemen\\".Brown-Fleming, 2006, p. 7. For example, in the case of Hans Eisele, former SS Dr convicted of experimentation on prisoners, there is some evidence that Muench's intervention with General Clay in the summer of 1948 resulted in the commutation of Eisele's execution (scheduled for June 1948) and Eisele's eventual release in 1952.Phayer, 2000, pp. 141–142. Nunciature (1951–1959) Muench's role as apostolic visitor was upgraded to nuncio when the Allied High Commission permitted the Federal Republic to form an independent foreign affairs ministry in March 1951.Brown-Fleming, 2006, p. 43. On March 9, 1951, Pope Pius XII appointed Bishop Muench papal nuncio to Germany with the title of archbishop. 1886 Muench viewed it as no small honor to hold the nunciature formerly occupied by Pius XII himself. On March 12, Pius XII moved the nunciature from Eichstätt to Bad Godesberg, outside of Bonn. By April 4, 1951, Muench was named dean of the German diplomatic corps, the first diplomat accredited by the Federal Republic. Relationship with Pius XII Muench met and corresponded frequently with Pope Pius XII, his predecessor as nuncio. There is much evidence of genuine camaraderie between Pius XII and Muench. He met Eugenio Pacelli (the future pope) for the first time while Pacelli was nuncio to Bavaria, when Muench visited Munich as a student representative of the Catholic Central Verein of America (CCVA). As pope, Pius XII received Muench in several audiences, and after their second audience on July 12, 1946, the two always conversed in German. Muench also wrote many reports on the events in Germany directly to Pius XII between 1946 and 1958, and there is some evidence that Pius XII read many of them personally, even in 1953 when his health began to deteriorate. The reports spoke not only of the immediate, material needs of German Catholics, but also of the spread of communism, a fear shared by Muench and Pius XII, and the subject of another 1954 audience between the two.Brown-Fleming, 2006, p. 11. Muench and Pius XII met in February 1947 and in the fall of 1948 and 1949; although initially Muench (in his letters to others) expressed satisfaction with Pius XII's grasp of the situation in Germany, he later stated that the pope was too reliant on his own, earlier experiences in Germany and did not \\"fully grasp\\" the implications of the occupation and increasing secularization. Muench wrote that Pius XII was continuing to interpret the events unfolding in Germany \\"according to this or that phrase of the Concordat\\".Dietrich, 2003, p. 89. In the 1953 dedication of the North American College in Rome, Pius XII stopped as he passed by Muench, expressed his gratitude that Muench could join him in Rome, and added \\"don't forget to see me before you leave\\". Muench was, according to Father Gerald Weber (in attendance), the only one of the many assembled bishops and cardinals whom Pius XII stopped and talked to. Muench mourned the death of Pius XII in October 1958, telling friends that the pope \\"treated him with the affection and love of a father to his son\\". The correspondence between Muench and Pius XII focused almost exclusively on the various opinions shared by the two men, often with great levity, but rarely touched on the issues of anti- Semitism, the Holocaust, the wartime relationship between the church and Nazi Germany, and the situation of the postwar Jewry. According to Brown-Fleming, in one private audience between the two in May 1957 Pius XII told Muench a joke about Hitler dying, going to Heaven, and meeting the Old Testament Prophet Moses, who forgives Hitler; Hitler then asks Moses if he set fire to the burning bush himself, a tongue-in-cheek reference to the Reichstag fire, which apparently elicited a \\"big laugh\\" from Pius XII.Brown-Fleming, 2006, p. 1. Cardinalate and death He was elevated to cardinal on December 14, 1959, by Pope John XXIII.The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church – Biographies – M Muench resigned as Bishop of Fargo on December 9, 1959, just before he became Cardinal. He died in Rome on February 15, 1962, and was buried in Fargo.Aloysius Joseph Cardinal Muench [Catholic-Hierarchy] Papers =Origins= Muench's papers from course of his work in Germany are well preserved. This makes them one of a very few collections of papers from German, American, or Vatican Catholic dignitaries of that time period that are \\"fully accessible to historians\\".Brown-Fleming, 2006, p. 19. According to Muench's biographer, Father Colman Barry, Muench took his papers with him to Rome when he retired as nuncio in December 1959 and the papers were returned to the diocesan archives in 1962 after his death. Altogether, the papers weigh over 2,500 pounds, including those Muench transferred directly from Bad Godesberg to Fargo prior to moving to Rome. As early as June 1956, Muench tasked his secretary, Father Gerard Weber, with the talk of sending his files, mostly composed of his personal correspondences, back to Fargo; Muench further directed four German nuns of the Saint Lioba convent in Freiburg/Breisgau to organize his German language correspondence. He continued sending records to Fargo until December 1959; in December 1960 he wrote a letter thanking an American friend bringing his personal diplomatic archives to the United States \\"without custom difficulties\\".Brown-Fleming, 2006, p. 20. After Muench died on February 15, 1962, the papers were found by Sister Ilga Braun, secretary to the Bonn nunciature since 1951, who was invited by his successor as Bishop of Fargo, Leo Dworschak to organize the papers, which she did until 1963. The papers were presented to The Catholic University of America in September 1972 by Bishop Justin Albert Driscoll, and indexed by 1976.Brown-Fleming, 2006, p. 21. =Contents= Among the papers are tens of thousands of letters (and Muench's replies) from German Catholics dated from 1946 to 1959, many from convicted Catholic war criminals seeking Muench's assistance in revising their denazification sentence, having their imprisonment commuted, or seeking emigration to the United States.Brown-Fleming, 2006, pp. 2–4. Muench's correspondence was vast, numbering approximately 15,000 letters in 1956 alone; but of those, only 300 addressed the Holocaust explicitly.Brown-Fleming, 2006, p. 4. In addition, Muench received approximately 100 letters from U.S. Catholics and military government officials speaking frankly on taboo topics, such as anti-Semitism, the Holocaust, and its survivors. For example, a 1947 letter from a German Catholic alleged that U.S. generals such as Lucius D. Clay and Walter Muller were Jews, that Roosevelt had been assassinated by Jews, and other Jewish conspiracy theories.Brown-Fleming, 2006, p. 9. Another letter from a Catholic Army major wrote that enlisted Jews sought promotions into positions where they could \\"control thought\\".Brown-Fleming, 2006, p. 10. =Diary= Muench kept a diary, which often recorded his recollections of conversations with important post-war leaders.Brown-Fleming, 2006, p. 6. For example, Muench wrote in his diary that former President Herbert Hoover had confided in Muench his belief that \\"no emigrés who were not citizens for at least twenty years should be permitted to shape and execute policies in Germany\\". He also reserved for his diary his description of Jewish Germans who had survived the war and resettled in the United States as \\"alien\\" and \\"recent\\" Americans, disloyal citizens, \\"in control\\" of American post-war policy in Germany, and harsh \\"avengers\\" against the Germans. For example, when Muench encountered difficulty in 1946 in easing travel restrictions on members of the clergy, he wrote in his diary that the problem was due to \\"Jews in control [of the] Public Safety [division]\\".Brown-Fleming, 2006, p. 100. Similarly, Muench referred to Franz Cueppers, a Frankfurt banker convicted of conducting illegal foreign exchange as a \\"victim of Jewish lawyers\\".Brown- Fleming, 2006, p. 101. A recurring point of interest for Muench were what he referred to as \\"Thirty-Niners\\": Jews who had fled Germany in 1933 or 1934, received United States citizenship in 1939, and then enlisted in the U.S. Armed Forces—Muench believed—\\"to wreak their vengeance in every way possible on the defeated foe\\". Muench's writings often characterized Jews generally, and Jewish displaced persons specifically, to be \\"greedy, wilfully destructive, sexual predators, thieves, and anarchists involved in leftist activities\\". Secondary sources =Barry's biography= Muench commissioned Father Coleman Barry—whom he had met in Munich in 1953—to write his biography in 1961. Muench was a long-time benefactor of Barry, ever since he had reviewed Barry's first book, The Catholic Church and the German Americans for the Catholic Historical Review. Barry interviewed Muench extensively in Fargo in the summer of 1961 and thereafter interviewed his family, friends, colleagues, and acquaintances in Milwaukee, Fargo, Germany, and Rome. Barry published American Nuncio; Cardinal Aloisius Muensch in 1969 and it remains the only biography of Muench. Barry's biography does not cover the letters between Muench, American Catholics, occupation authorities, and Vatican officials; nor does it address Muench's views of German guilt and collective responsibility for the Holocaust in much depth. Barry's biography was reviewed by the Journal of Ecumenical Studies and Church History as well as several Catholic journals and papers, which leveled very little criticism of the work, with the exception of the Journal of Ecumenical Studies. The reviewer, Prof. Franklin Littell of Temple University, argued that the work lacked objectivity. =Brown-Fleming's monograph= Suzanne Brown-Fleming, a fellow at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum's Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies, published her monograph of the Muench papers in 2006: The Holocaust and Catholic Conscience: Cardinal Aloisius Muench and the Guilt Question in Germany. Dr. Brown-Fleming holds a Ph.D. in Modern German History form the University of Maryland, College Park. The monograph has received positive reviews. Prof. Mark Edward Ruff of Saint Louis University calls the work \\"concise and clearly written\\", her use of primary sources \\"often convincing and damning\\", states Brown-Fleming \\"deserves kudos for bringing the work and values of Muench, a hitherto neglected figure, to the public eye\\".Ruff, 2007. Prof. Michael Ott of Grand Valley State University calls the work a \\"critical contribution to the growing research on the question of the Roman Catholic Church's policies and actions with regard to the Holocaust during World War II\\".Ott, 2007. Prof. Kevin Spicer of Stonehill College calls the work an \\"insightful and well-researched examination\\".Spicer, 2007b. Although Prof. John Conway of the University of British Columbia praises her use of the Muench papers, he notes that \\"her book suffers from the inaccessibility of the Vatican's records, since the papers for the reign of Pius XII are still- regrettably-closed\\".Conway, 2006.

In Old Church Slavonic, it represented a short (or \\"reduced\\") front vowel. As with its companion, the back yer , the vowel phoneme that it designated was later partly dropped and partly merged with other vowels. In the modern Slavic Cyrillic writing systems (all East Slavic languages and Bulgarian and Church Slavic), it does not represent an individual sound but indicates palatalization of the preceding consonant. It was also used in the Soviet Union in the Latinized Karelian alphabet, made official in 1931 and used until re-Cyrillicization of Karelian in 1937.  Uses and meanings  = Palatalization sign = The soft sign is normally written after a consonant and indicates its softening (palatalization). Less commonly, the soft sign just has a grammatically determined usage with no phonetic meaning (like 'fanfare' and тушь 'India ink', both pronounced but different in grammatical gender and declension). In East Slavic languages and some other Slavic languages (such as Bulgarian), there are some consonants that do not have phonetically different palatalized forms but corresponding letters still admit the affixing soft sign. The Serbian Cyrillic alphabet has had no soft sign as a distinct letter since the mid-19th century: palatalization is represented by special consonant letters instead of the sign (some of these letters, such as or , were designed as ligatures with the grapheme of the soft sign). The modern Macedonian alphabet, based on the Serbian Cyrillic variant, has had no soft sign since its creation, in 1944. = Before a vowel in East Slavic languages = Between a consonant and a vowel, the soft sign bears also a function of \\"iotation sign\\": in Russian, vowels after the soft sign are iotated (compare Russian льют '(they) pour/cast' and лют '(he is) fierce'). The feature, quite consistent with Russian orthography, promulgated a confusion between palatalization and iotation, especially because usually precedes so-called soft vowels. Combinations (ya), (ye), (yo) and (yu) give iotated vowels, like corresponding vowel letters in isolation (and word-initially), and unlike its use immediately after a consonant letter in which palatalization can occur but not iotation. In those cases, may be considered as a sign indicating that a vowel after it is pronounced separately from the previous consonant, but that is the case neither for (yi) nor for (yo), because these vowels are not iotated in isolation. The latter case, though, is rarely used in Russian (only in loanwords such as ) and can be seen as a replacement of phonetically identical , which gets rid of an \\"inconvenient\\" letter . In Ukrainian and Bulgarian, the spelling indicates palatalization, not iotation. , an \\"unpalatalization sign\\", also denotes iotation, as in the case of , , and in Russian. Similarly, the soft sign may denote iotation in Belarusian and Ukrainian, but it is not used so extensively as in Russian. Ukrainian uses a quite different repertoire of vowel letters from those of Russian and Belarusian, and iotation is usually expressed by an apostrophe in Ukrainian. Still the soft sign is used in Ukrainian if the sound followed by an iotated vowel is palatized. = In Bulgarian = Among Slavic languages, the soft sign has the most limited use in Bulgarian: since 1945, the only possible position is one between consonants and (such as in names Жельо, Кръстьо, and Гьончо). = As a vowel in Slavistic = In Slavistic transcription, Ь and Ъ are used to denote Proto- Slavic extra-short sounds and respectively (slověnьskъ adj. 'Slavonic'), like Old Slavonic orthography. = As a vowel in Turkic languages = It is used in Janalif, the first Soviet-made Latin alphabet, to denote ɯ; its Cyrillic equivalent is ы. =Аь= The soft sign does not occur after vowels in Slavic languages, but the digraph for or was introduced to some non-Slavic Cyrillic- based alphabets such as Chechen, Ingush and various Dagestanian languages such as Tabasaran. Similarly, the digraph was introduced for or , and for , plus iotated forms such as and as required. This use of ь is similar to a trailing e as used in, for example, German, when umlauts are unavailable (cf. Goethe). There were proposals to use the same for Turkic languages, as a replacement to Cyrillic Schwa (Ә) for or . Unlike Schwa, which is not represented in many Cyrillic character repertoires such as Windows-1251, both and are readily available as letters of the basic modern Russian alphabet. =As a modifier letter= Along with the hard sign and the palochka, the soft sign is a modifier letter in Caucasian languages and Crimean Tatar. Its function is to create a new sound, such as i.e. гь, which is used in Avar, Archi, and Tabasaran to denote /h/.  Representations  Under normal orthographic rules, it has no uppercase form, as no word begins with the letter. However, Cyrillic type fonts normally provide an uppercase form for setting type in all caps or for using it as an element of various serial numbers (like series of Soviet banknotes) and indices (for example, there was once a model of old Russian steam locomotives marked \\"Ь\\" – :ru:Паровоз Ь). In the romanization of Cyrillic, the soft sign is typically replaced with a modifier prime symbol (&#697;). Occasionally, an apostrophe is used, or the soft sign can even be ignored if it is in a position that it does not denote iotation: Тверь=Tver, Обь=Ob.

He was the only son of former British Prime Minister Clement Attlee. Early life Attlee suffered badly from dyslexia, and was a poor student as a child.

Construction on the dam began in 1958 and was completed in 1964. The reservoir stores of water when measured at an elevation of above sea-level (maximum). Location The reservoir is mainly in southwest Wyoming and partially in northeastern Utah. The northern tip of the reservoir is southeast of Green River, Wyoming, southwest of Rock Springs, Wyoming, and the Southern tip is approximately north of Vernal, Utah. The lake straddles the Utah-Wyoming border. The nearby town of Dutch John, Utah, was built to serve as a base camp during construction of the dam, and as an administrative site afterwards. Aerial view of Flaming Gorge Reservoir in Wyoming Geology The foundation of the reservoir is a steep-sided narrow canyon composed of siliceous sandstone and hard quartzites inter-bedded with softer shales, siltstones, and argillites. About east of the dam, a road cut has revealed a fault scarp on the southbound side with about of slippage. Recreation Visitors enjoy hiking, boating, fishing, windsurfing, camping, backpacking, cross-country skiing, and snowmobiling within Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area, which is operated by Ashley National Forest. Camp sites can be found close to the dam and along Highway 191 for a fee, as well as free throughout the area. Campgrounds operated by the U.S. Forest Service close in the winter months, with the exception of Dripping Springs near Dutch John. There are also public camp sites at Buck Board and Lucerne Marinas, along Highway 530 on the west side of the reservoir. The many available fish species in the reservoir and surrounding lakes are Colorado River Cutthroat trout, Brown trout, Rainbow trout , Lake trout, Kokanee salmon, Smallmouth bass, Burbot and Common carp. The Green River is a popular spot for fishing, mainly below the dam. The river's ice cold water and beautiful structure make it a world class, world-renowned fly fishing stream.

The four on the right are provided with Tamisier ball grooves for aerodynamic stability. James H. Burton's Minié ball design from the Harpers Ferry Armory The Minié ball, or Minni ball, is a type of muzzle-loading spin-stabilized bullet for rifled muskets named after its developer, Claude-Étienne Minié, inventor of the French Minié rifle. It came to prominence in the Crimean War and American Civil War. Rifling, the addition of spiral grooves inside a gun barrel, imparts a spin to a bullet, greatly increasing the range and accuracy of a gun. Prior to the Minié ball, balls had to be jammed down the rifle barrel, sometimes with a mallet, and after a relatively small number of shots, gunpowder residue built up in the spiral grooves, which then had to be cleaned out.McPherson, James M. (1988) Battle Cry of Freedon: The Civil War Era Oxford University Press. p.474 The development of the Minié ball was significant, because it was the first projectile that was small enough to be easily put down the barrel of a rifled long gun. Both the American Springfield Model 1861 and the British Pattern 1853 Enfield rifled muskets, the most common weapons used during the American Civil War, used the Minié ball.Keegan, John (2009) The American Civil War: A Military History New York; Knopf. p.55  Designs  The Minié ball is a conical bullet with three exterior grease-filled grooves and a conical hollow in its base. The bullet was designed by Minié with a small iron plug and a lead skirting. Its intended purpose was to expand under the pressure of the powder deflagration, pressing the skirt out to grip the rifling, and secondarily to obturate the barrel and increase muzzle velocity. The precursor to the Minié ball was created in the 1830s by the French Army captains Montgomery and Henri-Gustave Delvigne. Their design was made to allow rapid muzzle loading of rifles, an innovation that brought about the widespread use of the rifle rather than the smoothbore musket as a mass battlefield weapon. Delvigne had invented a ball that could expand upon ramming to fit the grooves of a rifle in 1826. The design of the ball had been proposed in 1832 as the cylindro-conoidal bullet by Captain John Norton, but had not been adopted. Captain James H. Burton, an armorer at the Harpers Ferry Armory, developed an improvement on Minié's design when he added a deep cavity at the base of the ball, which filled up with gas and expanded the bullet's rim upon firing. The result was not only better range, but also a cheaper bullet, which was used in the Crimean War and then the American Civil War. Burton's version of the ball weighed 1.14 ounces.Keegan, John (2009) The American Civil War: A Military History New York; Knopf. pp.314-15  Use  The bullet could be quickly removed from the paper cartridge with the gunpowder poured down the barrel and the bullet pressed past the muzzle rifling and any detritus from prior shots. It was then rammed down the barrel with the ramrod, which ensured that the charge was packed and the hollow base was filled with powder. When the rifle was fired, the expanding gas pushed forcibly on the base of the bullet, deforming the skirt to engage the rifling. This provided spin for accuracy, a better seal for consistent velocity and longer range, and cleaning of barrel detritus.  Effects  Wounds inflicted by the conical Minié ball were different from those caused by the round balls from smoothbore muskets, since the conical ball had a higher muzzle velocity and greater mass, and easily penetrated the human body. Round balls tended to remain lodged in the flesh, and they were often observed to take a winding path through the body. Flexed muscles and tendons, as well as bone, could cause the round ball to deviate from a straight path. The Minié ball tended to cut a straight path and usually went all the way through the injured part; the ball seldom remained lodged in the body. If a Minié ball struck a bone, it usually caused the bone to shatter. The damage to bones and resulting compound fractures were usually severe enough to necessitate amputation. A hit on a major blood vessel could also have serious and often lethal consequences. One of the more infamous documented cases involving Minié ball injuries concerned a Confederate soldier wounded during Jubal Early's raid on Washington, D.C. on July 12, 1864. The soldier, a private in the 53rd North Carolina Infantry, was hit in the side of the head by a .58 caliber Minié ball, which shattered his skull and lodged in the right hemisphere of the brain. He went into convulsions and became paralyzed on one side of his body, but started recovering within eight days of being hospitalized. However, within three more days, his condition deteriorated and he eventually lost consciousness and died, having survived with his wound for 16 days. An autopsy of the soldier found that the right hemisphere of the brain was extensively damaged and large areas of it had necrosed. The brain was removed, preserved in formaldehyde and donated to the Army Museum in Washington. The primary cause of death had been infection caused by both the initial injury and subsequent necrosis of brain tissue.\\"Medical and Surgical Reporter\\", 1865 Vol XIII  See also  *Cap gun *Caplock mechanism *Gun barrel *Gunpowder *Internal ballistics *Muzzleloader *Nessler ball *Projectile *Rifling *Tubes and primers for ammunition  References  =Notes= =Bibliography=  External links  *Weaponry: The Rifle-Musket and the Minié Ball- Allan W.

In all, it consists of 18 municipalities, and except parts of Ballerup, Greve (of former Roskilde County), Ishøj, former Søllerød and former Værløse, mentioned with (the part of) their population included from 2007. Ishøj and Greve Strand are included for the first time since 1999. As of 1 January 2016, this area had a population of 1,280,371. Statistics Denmark states that the definition of the urban area is based on UN's 200m definition.1.2 Statistiske begreber List of municipalities According to Danmarks Statistik, since January 1, 2007 Hovedstadsområdet (English: the Capital area) comprises the following municipalities () (population, as of 01Jan 2018, mentioned if only part of the municipality belongs to the urban area) : * Copenhagen (a large area of western Amager is unpopulated) - 613,288 * Frederiksberg - 104,410 * Albertslund - 27,743 * Ballerup - 48,295 * Brøndby - 35,538 * Furesø (former Farum and Værløse) - 40,911 * Gentofte - 75,803 * Gladsaxe - 69,484 * Glostrup - 22,663 * Greve Strand - 49,974 * Herlev - 28,572 * Hvidovre - 53,282 * Ishøj - 22,988 * Lyngby-Taarbæk - 55,472 * Rødovre - 39,343 * Rudersdal (former Søllerød) - 55,989 * Taastrup - 50.686 * Tårnby (a very large area of western Amager and the Saltholm (2 inhabitants (2020)) and Peberholm (nature habitat) islands are unpopulated) - 43,063 * Vallensbæk - 16,280 Hovedstadsområdet vs. urban area of Copenhagen However Hovedstadsområdet () isn't a definition for the urban area of Copenhagen. The area doesn't follow the recommendations of the United Nations regarding urban definitions (i.e. 200 meters between buildings as the required minimum) and is used for statistic issues only. The main difference between \\"Hovedstadsområdet\\" and common urban area definition (or city limits) involves the islands of Amager, Saltholm and Peberholm, and primarily the municipality of Tårnby. Amager island land use \\"Hovedstadsområdet\\" contains the entire Copenhagen and Tårnby municipalities, although the latter contains large areas without buildings and inhabitants. This also applies to a smaller part of Copenhagen on Amager island. The western part of Amager is an enlargement from a shallow part of the Øresund sea, gained from the sea during the 1930s to 1950s. This extended part of Amager is split between Copenhagen and Tårnby municipalities, and is only built-up on two minor areas. It also includes along the harbour and around Bella Center (which hosted the climate meeting COP 15 in December 2009). Apart from these smaller areas and an allotment-garden cottage area, the vast majority of western Amager is unplanned, with few buildings (like a shooting range). The cause for this creation was mainly to give shelter to the southern part of Copenhagen harbour. Since the area is now filled out with big stones, sand from the sea, plaster, wastes and unknown items, building in the area is expensive. Not even agriculture is possible due to bad soil. (However the southern part of Amager has agricultural areas and even a small forest, \\"Kongelunden\\" (\\"King Grove\\"). These areas belong to a third municipality of Amager island, Dragør.) Some of the unused area belongs to Copenhagen municipality, but the Tårnby municipality part is far larger. Also the almost unpopulated islands of \\"Saltholm\\" (3 inhabitants in 2010) and \\"Peberholm\\" (unpopulated) belongs to Tårnby, and so does the taxi and runway system of Copenhagen Airport (with three long runways). In all, most of Tårnby and a minor part of Copenhagen municipalities on Amager island cannot be regarded as an urban area. Consequently, \\"Hovedstadsområdet\\" does not equal an urban area of Copenhagen. Neither the Danish statistic authority \\"Danmarks Statistik\\" (which presents information regarding \\"Hovedstadsområdet\\") or the Danish geographical institute \\"Kort og Matrikelstyrelsen\\" (which determines the borders of \\"Hovedstadsområdet\\") states that \\"Hovedstadsområdet\\" is an urban area of Copenhagen. For internal Danish matters this is of no importance. But when comparing Copenhagen with other cities, the unpopulated non-urban areas of Amager, Saltholm and Peberholm do make a difference in f.i. terms of population density. , Copenhagen lacks official urban borders for comparison with other cities. \\"Hovedstadsområdet\\" is an area invented primarily for statistical matters. It's rarely used in conversation (as a defined area). Sometimes in media the word \\"Hovedstadsområdet\\" represents a metropolitan area from Køge in the south to Elsinore in the north and Roskilde in the west. For instance, a regional television channel called \\"Hovedstads-TV\\" covers this larger area. But even in nationwide public service television news, the word \\"Hovedstadsområdet\\" may refer to either what the Danish statistic institute defines as \\"Hovedstadsområdet\\" or the metropolitan area. Another similar area is \\"Storkøbenhavn\\" (eng. \\"Greater Copenhagen\\"). This is used by \\"Vejdirektoratet\\" (\\"the road authority\\") only. Just \\"Copenhagen\\" may refer either to the municipality, which has quite stingy borders (and totally surrounds Frederiksberg municipality), or the entire city, which doesn't have defined borders. Until the 1970s, the city region of Copenhagen () was stated as the three municipalities Copenhagen, Frederiksberg and Gentofte. A better description of the city core (excluding all suburbs) would be south of the Dyrehaven forest in the north, the area east of the motorway called \\"motorring 3\\" and north of the motorway across Amager island which continues towards Sweden. This area includes Copenhagen (with Frederiksberg), Gentofte, most of Gladsaxe, Rødovre, Hvidovre and a part of Tårnby municipalitiesgoogle maps earth mode This area has around 900.000 to 950.000 inhabitants.tally of population of the mentioned municipalities, including some reductions for the parts outside the described area Urban Copenhagen and this city region are statistical abstracts only and have no political and/or administrative implications.

Among them are several familiar garden plants belonging to the genera Campanula (bellflower), Lobelia, and Platycodon (balloonflower). Campanula rapunculus (rampion or r. bellflower) and Codonopsis lanceolata are eaten as vegetables. Lobelia inflata (indian tobacco), L. siphilitica and L. tupa (devil's tobacco) and others have been used as medicinal plants. Campanula rapunculoides (creeping bellflower) may be a troublesome weed, particularly in gardens, while Legousia spp. may occur in arable fields. Most current classifications include the segregate family Lobeliaceae in Campanulaceae as subfamily Lobelioideae. A third subfamily, Cyphioideae, includes the genus Cyphia, and sometimes also the genera Cyphocarpus, Nemacladus, Parishella and Pseudonemacladus. Alternatively, the last three genera are placed in Nemacladoideae, while Cyphocarpus is placed in its own subfamily, Cyphocarpoideae. This family is almost cosmopolitan, occurring on all continents except Antarctica. In addition, species of the family are native to many remote oceanic islands and archipelagos. Hawaii is particularly rich, with well over 100 endemic species. Continental areas with high diversity are South Africa, California and the northern Andes. Habitats range from extreme deserts to rainforests and lakes, from the tropics to the high Arctic (Campanula uniflora), and from sea cliffs to high alpine habitats. Description Although most Campanulaceae are perennial herbs (sometimes climbing, as in Codonopsis), there is also a large number of annuals e.g. species of Legousia. Isotoma hypocrateriformis is a succulent annual from Australia's dry interior. There are also biennials, e.g. the commonly cultivated ornamental Campanula medium (Canterbury bells). Many perennial campanuloids grow in rock-crevices, such as Musschia aurea (Madeira) and Petromarula pinnata (Crete). Some lobelioids also grow on rocks, e.g. the peculiar perennial stem succulent Brighamia rockii in Hawaii. Insular and tropical montane species in particular are often more or less woody and may bear the leaves in a dense rosette. When, in addition, the plant is unbranched, the result may be a palm- or treefern-like habit, as in species of the hawaiian genus Cyanea, which comprises the tallest of Campanulaceae, C. leptostegia (up to 14 m). Lysipomia are minute cushion plants of the high Andes, while gigant rosette-forming lobelias (e.g., Lobelia deckenii) are a characteristic component of the vegetation in the alpine zone on the tropical African volcanoes. In the Himalaya Campanula modesta and Cyananthus microphyllus reach even higher, probably setting the altitudinal record for the family at 4800 m. Several species are associated with freshwater, such as Lobelia dortmanna, an isoetid common in oligotrophic lakes in the boreal zone of North America and Europe, and Howellia aquatilis, an elodeid growing in ponds in SW North America. There is usually abundant, white latex, but occasionally the exudate is clear and/or very sparse, as in Jasione. Tubers occur in several genera, e.g. Cyphia. Leaves are often alternate, more rarely opposite (e. g. Codonopsis) or whorled (Ostrowskia). They are simple (Petromarula one of very few exceptions) entire (repeatedly divided in spp. of Cyanea), but often with dentate margin. Stipules are absent. Inflorescences are quite diverse, including both cymose and racemose types. In Jasione they are strongly condensed and resemble asteraceous capitula. In a few species, e. g. Cyananthus lobatus, flowers are solitary. Flowers are bisexual (dioecious in Dialypetalum) and protandrous. Petals are fused into a corolla with 3 to 8 lobes. It may be bell- or star-shaped in subfamily Campanuloideae, while tubular and bilaterally symmetric in most Lobelioideae. Blue of various shades is the most common petal colour, but purple, red, pink, orange, yellow, white, and green also occur. The corolla may be down to 1 mm wide and long in some species of Wahlenbergia. At the other extreme, it reaches a width of 15 cm in Ostrowskia. Stamens are equal in number to, and alternating with the petals. Anthers may be fused into a tube, as in all species of Lobelioideae and some Campanuloideae (e.g. Symphyandra) Within the family pollen grains are often tricolporate, less commonly triporate, tricolpate, or pantoporate. Carpel number is usually 2, 3 or 5 (8 in Ostrowskia), and corresponds to the number of stigmatic lobes. The style is in various ways involved in the \\"presentation\\" of the pollen, as in several other families of the order Asterales. In Lobelioideae, pollen is, already in the bud stage, released into the tube formed by the anthers. During flowering, it is pushed up by the elongating style and \\"presented\\" to visiting pollinators at the apex of the tube, a mechanism described as a pollen pump. The style eventually protrudes through the anther tube, and becomes receptive to pollen. In Campanuloideae, the pollen is instead packed between hairs on the style, gradually being released as the hairs invaginate. Subsequently, the stigmatic lobes unfold, and become receptive. Bees and birds (particularly hummingbirds and hawaiian honeycreepers) are probably the most common pollinators of Campanulaceae. A few confirmed and many probable cases of bat-pollination are known, particularly in the genus Burmeistera. Brighamia and Hippobroma have pale or white flowers with a long-tubed corolla, and are pollinated by hawkmoths. Pollination by lizards has been reported for Musschia aurea and Nesocodon mauritianus. The ovary is usually inferior or, in some species, semi-inferior. Very rarely is it completely superior (e.g. Cyananthus). In Campanumoea javanica, calyx and corolla diverge from the ovary at different levels. Berries are a common fruit-type in Lobelioideae (Burmeistera, Clermontia, Centropogon, Cyanea etc.), whilst rare in Campanuloideae (Canarina being one of few examples). Capsules, with very varying modes of dehiscence, are otherwise the predominating fruit type in the family. Seeds are mostly small (<2 mm) and numerous.

Throughout history, there has been many various psychological learning theories. Some take on a more behaviorist approach which focuses on inputs and reinforcements. Other approaches, such as theories related to neuroscience and social cognition, focus more on the brain's organization and structure to define learning. Some psychological approaches, such as social constructivism, focus more on one's interaction with the environment and with others. Other theories, such as those related to motivation, like the growth mindset, focus more on the individual. Psychology of learning is also very applicable today. There has been extensive research in recent years that looks closely at how students are learning both inside and outside the classroom. This information is then used to present new and more cooperative approaches to homework, tests and the student's ability to learn. Theories related to the psychology of learning can also help explain and improve student performance, motivation, and investment in their learning. History This section lays out the history of the psychology of learning from its early stages to modern times. = Early approaches = Prior to the 1950s, much of the psychological learning theories existed independently throughout various geographic areas. In Germany, there was the concept of gestalt psychology which viewed psychological concepts holistically such as the human's mind and behavior. An emphasis was placed on trying to understand the overarching phenomena of a psychological concept and how it connects with other ideas. This also led to a focus on problem-solving as a learning theory to be explored in the 1920s and 1930s. In America, a strong focus was on behaviorism which focused on exploring observable psychological concepts. Many concepts explored learning mechanisms that could be tested on animals. Russia, or the Soviet Union at the time, provided a cultural-historical approach towards psychology which described learning in the context of one's environment. This perspective viewed learning as a concept that can be directed and supported in institutions like schools. Another significant theory is Jean Piaget's constructivism which described learning as a way learners can construct their knowledge by expanding and changing their ideas based on the information they received. Sigmund Freud's work on psychoanalysis and John Dewey's theories on schooling and learning were also major contributions during this time. = 1950s–60s = After the second world war, two major strands of learning psychological theories became very prominent. One was the rise of extreme behaviorism which stemmed from the work by B. F. Skinner. Skinner viewed human behavior as determined by the individual's interactions with one's environment. He argued that humans are controlled by external factors such that human learning is predicated on the environmental information one receives from one's surroundings. Therefore, more humanistic qualities such as identity, hope, love, care, and so forth were neglected in his work. However, from the 1960s, due to the rise of cognitive science, much of the different types of learning beyond behaviorism were expanded. Psychologists started to consider more complicated forms of learning such as Albert Bandura's concept of social learning and Dane Thomas Nissen's learning theory of culmination which could not be explained adequately through behaviorism. Hence, although behaviorism grew after the second world war, the field started to move away from behaviorism in the 1960s. In addition to behaviorism, a more humanistic view of psychology, lead by psychologists Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow, grew. In 1951, Rogers introduced the concepts of client-based therapy and introduced related terms such as \\"student-centered teacher\\" and \\"significant learning.\\" Maslow's hierarchy of needs model influenced the psychology of learning as well as it describes how people need to meet their basic physical, social, and mental needs before they can address their more cognitive needs such as learning. Other psychologists, such as Kurt Lewin and Erik Erikson, played a major role too. Lewin brought about field theory which contributed much to group psychology and learning. Erikson's work on identity development furthered the understanding of youth learning and scholars from the Frankfurt school furthered understandings about authoritarianism. = 1970s–= During the 1970s, different theories and dispositions towards learning started to occur. Learning began to be viewed as an integral part of life and the world as it started to be seen as a part of personal and social enrichment. Concepts such as lifelong learning and adult education started to appear as people began to view learning as a daily process throughout life. Learning also started to be connected with liberation and emancipation. Scholars such as Charles Wright Mills and Paulo Freire applied learning as a way to understand and eventually reform the systemic power conditions that exists in society. Jack Mezirow created transformational learning where learning can transform the habits and perspectives of individuals in order to fundamentally transform. In essence, learning theory was broadened to include the social contexts surrounding the learning process. The Russian cultural-historical approach started to be adopted. This approach viewed learning as interacting with incentives in the environment. For instance, Ute Holzkamp-Osterkamp viewed motivation as being interconnected with learning. Lev Vygotsky's zone of proximal development influenced educators to view learning activities in relation to the students' proximal zone of development. This cultural-historical approach shifted educators' approach to consider the backgrounds and interests of their students when crafting their lessons. Learning ideas also started to have a more social approach. Kenneth Gergen brought out the social constructionism approach which claims that individuals were psychologically composed by the social connections they have with others. Hence, although learning can happen individually, it can only be evaluated in a social context. Jean Lave and Étienne Wenger, through their book Situated Learning, claimed that learning occurs in certain situations and that the environmental context influences the learning outcomes too. Other learning psychological learning theories were developed during the 1980s and beyond. Experiential learning, modeled by David Kolb, is a learning theory that describe learning as an iterative process of experience, reflection, conceptualization, and experimentation. Robert Kegan created a constructive-developmental approach which expands upon Piaget's stages of child development into a lifelong process which includes adulthood. Also, in 1991, the American psychologist Howard Gardner wrote The Unschooled Mind which focused on three different types of learning: intuitive learning, school learning, and expert learning. Intuitive learning is the most natural which occurs most in the preschool years; school learning is the learning forced upon children during the school years, and the intuitive-expert learning is the type of learning Gardner argues everyone should strive towards.  Psychologists and learning theorists  This section is a list of psychologists whose findings and theories are important to the development of the Psychology of Learning. Each of their contributions furthered our knowledge of this new and noteworthy theoretical science. =Socrates= Socrates (469-399 B.C.) introduced a method of learning known as piloting, through which one arrives at one's own answers through power of reasoning. Socrates, in dialogue with Meno, taught this method, by teaching a slave boy, who knew nothing about the Euclidean geometry, the Pythagorean theorem. He did so by asking questions or rephrasing them until the correct answer was found. Socrates strongly influenced the idea that knowledge is innate and can be found from within, it is also known as anamnesis. =Hermann Ebbinghaus= Hermann Ebbinghaus (1850—1909) examined learning, by studying rote memory and forgetting. With himself as his own experimental subject, he used meaningless syllables form lists that read several times until he could restated them with high accuracy. Additionally, he attempted to recall the same lists with certain delay (e.g., a few days or months later) and then recorded his discoveries as learning curves and the forgetting curves. =Edward Thorndike= Edward Thorndike (1874–1949) presented his theory of the \\"Law of Effect\\" in 1898. According to this theory, humans and other animals learn behaviors through trial-and-error methods. Once a functioning solution is found, these behaviors are likely to be repeated during the same or similar task. It was his work on learning theory that resulted in operant conditioning within behaviorism. His theory of operant conditioning is learning from the consequences of our actions and behavior. =Ivan Pavlov= Ivan Petrovich Pavlov (1849–1936) was a Russian physiologist, who contributed to research on learning. Knowing that a hungry dog salivates when food is present, he performed a series of experiments and trained dogs to salivate through an arbitrary external stimuli. This was done by pairing natural stimuli (such as food) with a new stimulus (e.g., a metronome) to provoke the desired response in dogs. That proved his thesis that he could make a dog salivate by just the presentation of the sound of a bell. Pavlov's approach to learning was behavioristic and later known as classical conditioning.[9] = John Broadus Watson = John Broadus Watson (1878–1958) also used this method of learning (e.g., he caused a young child, not previously afraid of furry animals, to become frightened of them) and argued that it was sufficient for the science of psychology, specifically behaviorism. Watson is often referred to as being the founder of the school of behaviorism. From 1920-1960, this school influenced a great deal of North American psychology. =Burrhus F. Skinner= Burrhus F. Skinner (1904-1990) developed operant conditioning, in which specific behaviors resulted from stimuli, which caused them to appear more or less frequently. By the 1920s, John B. Watson's ideas had become popular and influential in the world of psychology and classical conditioning was being explored by other behaviorists. Skinner's was one of these behaviorists. He thought that in order to understand behavior we needed to look at the causes of an action and its consequences. He called this operant conditioning. Skinner is referred to as the father of operant conditioning but his theory stems from the works presented by Edward Thorndike. =Jean Piaget= Jean Piaget is known for his theory of cognitive development that describes how children create a mental model of the world around them. His theory is important because it is one of the first theories that disagreed with the idea that intelligence was a steadfast trait. His theory sees cognitive development as something that happens because of biological maturation and one's interaction with their surrounding environment. Piaget did not want to measure a child's knowledge, like an I.Q. score, instead he focused on how children did with fundamental concepts. Piaget's theory has four stages. The sensorimotor stage which is birth to 18–24 months. The preoperational stage is toddler ages (18–24 months) to early childhood, age 7. The concrete operational stage, ages 7 to 12. Then the formal operation stage which is adolescence to adulthood. Before Piaget's theory it was believed that children were just less competent thinkers but this theory and his stages helped to show that children think in significantly differently ways than adults do. =Lev Vygotsky= Lev Vygotsky is best known for his theory in cognitive development known as social development theory. Vygotsky was developing his theories of cognitive development around the same time that Jean Piaget was developing his theories. Vygotsky believed that social interaction plays a critical role in cognitive development. He places a large emphasis on culture and how it affects cognitive development. He also sees the importance of adults in cognitive development in children. Vygotsky says that development cannot be understood without referring back to the social and also the cultural context in which it is embedded. Vygotsky claimed that learning occurs via skillful interaction in which the child is with someone who models behaviors or gives instructions for the child to follow, most likely a parent or a teacher. The child tries to understand the instructions or actions provided and then stores the information so they can use it to guide their future performances. Piaget's theory says that a child's development must follow their learning, Vygotsky disagreed with this. He believed that social learning tends to come before development.  Psychology of learning theories  Learning theories are attempts to better understand and explain learning processes. There are several different theories that account for learning. = Neuroscience = The neuroscience of learning focuses on the relationships among the central nervous system, learning, and behavior. This central nervous system (CNS) is composed of the brain and spinal cord which are responsible for controlling behavior. This differs from the autonomic nervous system which relates with more autonomous functions such as respiration and digestion. Within the CNS, there are neurons, which send messages within and from the brain to the rest of body through electrical and chemical signals. The CNS also has glial cells which assist neurons in the communication process. These neurons communicate and form connections, also called consolidation, to form a person's cognition. Hence, learning, from a neuroscience perspective, focuses on how the organization of this neural network changes through the use and reception of information. Neuroscience has an explanation for the acquisition of memory. In the brain, there are two types of memory called working memory (WM) and long-term memory (LTM). WM is memory of immediate thoughts; it is a memory that collects, organizes, and retains sensory information for a short time. Information in WM needs to be repeated in order to be retained. LTM, also called permanent memory, is memory that is retained for the long-term. Hence, a concept is considered \\"learned\\" when information from WM enters and gets stored into LTM. Neuroscience also plays a role in related areas such as motivation and self-regulation. Motivation, a psychological component related to learning, also has an explanation through neuroscience. Overall, the brain has a disposition towards rewards and outcomes related to pleasure. In fact, it bring out certain chemical and opiates that give a natural high increasing a person's motivation. Self-regulation, which plays a significant factor into learning, are also represented by the brain's synaptic connections. These particular connections between self-regulatory activities and tasks help people to regulate their learning. = Behaviorism = Behaviorism views knowledge as a collection of behavioral responses towards different stimuli in the environment. In behaviorism, learning is promoted by positive reinforcement and reiteration. Throughout the history of psychology, there have been many different behaviorist learning theories. All these theories relate stimulus with response such that a person or animal learns and changes its behavior based upon the stimulus it receives. One significant theory proposed by B.F, Skinner is operant conditioning. This theory claims that the consequences from behaviors will determine future behavior. Consequences to behavior that are positive, and therefore reinforcing, will increase the corresponding behavior. However, consequences that are punishing will decrease behavior. In a behaviorist perspective, motivation is due to the consequences of behavior and hence completely external. If a consequence is positive, that will further increase one's motivation and eventually one's behavior. On the other hand, if a consequence is negative, one's motivation and behavior will decrease. Behaviorism exists in many current models for learning such as rewards and consequences in classrooms and other incentives like having content mastery goals. However, it does not account for all aspects of learning. Memory, for instance, is not addressed as behaviorism does not consider internal processes. Nevertheless, learning surrounding behaviorism is still very prevalent today. = Social cognitive theory = Social cognitive theory proposes that much of human learning occurs through the social environment. Many ideas surrounding social cognitive theory were proposed by Albert Bandura, a clinical psychologist. Unlike behaviorism, which argues that learning is caused through the reinforcement of actions and routines, social cognitive theory provides a cognitive component for learning. For instance, learning can occur purely through observation, where a person can gain knowledge of a concept or acquire an understanding of a rule, attitude, beliefs, without actually acting out any of these respective ideas. Models also play a significant great role in learning according to social cognitive theory. For instance, a person can gain useful knowledge and understanding through information gained from the model. However, solely observing models does not guarantee one will master the concepts represented in the model. Instead, these models provide information about possible outcomes and inform how the observer should act. Hence, while learning can occur without actually partaking in any enactive learning (learning by doing), the social cognitive theory learning is most effective when it is done enactively and vicariously (learning through observation). Social cognitive theory describes human behavior as agentic meaning that humans have intentions and agendas that drive their behavior. This perspective explains lot of human learning behavior such as setting goals and regulating one's thoughts, emotions, and behavior for the purpose of learning. = Information processing theories = Information processing theories focus on the ways information is collected, analyzed, and stored in the human brain. While there is no single information processing theory, there are several theories that can be categorized about information processing theory. One model, proposed by many information processing theorists, is the two-store memory model. Also called the dual memory model, the two-store memory model describes learning as storing information and knowledge from one's environment into one's short-term memory (STM) and eventually into one's long-term memory (LTM). To elaborate, information about your environment is collected through your senses. This information is then entered into your STM, also called working memory (WM). From the STM, some of this information is rehearsed and eventually encoded into the LTM where it is then stored permanently. Alternate models have been proposed in regards to how information is processed. For instance, some argue that there is one type of memory in the brain which has different levels of processing within it. Nevertheless, the classical model poses memory as dual memory (short-term and long-term) model. Another related theory is the dual-code theory which splits the brain processes into two systems: an imaginal system and a verbal system. The imaginal system primarily stores concrete events and objects while the verbal system stores more abstract information from language. This theory also allows for knowledge transfer within both systems as images, expressed through verbal language, can be encoded and placed into the imaginal system. While these theories can be traced back to gestalt psychology, much of the these theories were influenced by the rise of technology, neuroscience, and communications. = Constructivism = Constructivism is a philosophical perspective which argues that much of what one learns and understands about the world is constructed. Constructivists believe that knowledge is created within and reject the idea of pre-existing scientific knowledge waiting to be discovered. With that in mind, constructivists argue that learning needs to be structured so that they challenge students to make sense of new knowledge. Theories from two major psychologists, Piaget and Vygotsky, form the foundational ideas of constructivism: cognitive constructivism and social constructivism.  Cognitive constructivism  Cognitive constructivism, stemming from Jean Piaget's theories, sees learning as adding new information to cognitive structures that are already there. Piaget's theory claim that people cognitively develop by passing through several stages: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational. The sensorimotor stage, which occurs from birth to around age 2, is when children act spontaneously to make sense of their world. Much of these actions are sensory in nature (e.g. touching) and rooted in present action. The preoperational stage occurs between ages 2 to 7 and is categorized by children being able to reflect briefly on the past and imagine the future. However, in the preoperational stage, most of one's thinking in this stage is still grounded in one's experiences in the present. The concrete operational stage, which occurs between ages 7 to 11, is when children rapidly grow cognitively and drastically improve their basic skills and language. Here, children can demonstrate some abstract thinking although much of this thinking is still grounded by actions. The formal operational stage, which starts around age 11 and goes on to adulthood, is the last developmental stage in Piaget's theory. This stage expands upon the concrete operational stage by using higher levels of thinking such as hypothetical thinking, more developed abstract thinking, and idealistic thinking. Throughout these motivational stages, the mechanism in which the children and people learn, is through a concept called equilibrium. This mechanism is the process where an individual is able to resolve cognitive conflicts by either applying one's beliefs to one's experiences (a process called assimilation) or by changing one's beliefs to accommodate new experiences and information when encountering new situations or concepts.  Social constructivism  Social constructivism, like its name suggests, believes that knowledge and learning is gained within social situations. Lead by psychologist Lev Vygotsky, social constructivism has a more sociocultural approach. This approach argues that the social environment facilitates learning through certain tools such objects, language, and organizations. Through these tools, cognitive learning occurs when the people interact with these tools socially and internalize them. A major concept within social constructivism is the zone of proximal development (ZPD). ZPD represents the potential amount of learning a student can have given the right environmental conditions. This model suggests that the teacher and student work together to further the student's learning. Educational examples of this include instructional scaffolding and apprenticeships where the educator takes an invested and active role in furthering the knowledge of the student. = Motivation = Various motivational theories play a role in the psychology of learning. John William Atkinson's motivation theory argues that people are motivated to achieve their best. This motivation is in part moderated by two different sources: the desire to succeed as well as the fear of failure. Another motivational theory is Allan Wigfield's and Jacquelynne Eccles's expectancy-value theory which states that motivation is moderated by one's desire for success as well as the importance of the tasks one needs to do. Self-worth theory also plays a role in learning as students and individuals are motivated to learn and achieve because of their desire to maintain their perception of being high achieving. Goal theory is another related theory. Learners usually have two types of goals: learning mastery goals (e.g. learning a new concept) and performance goals (e.g. being first place). This theory suggests that mastery goals are more effective than performance goals as a motivator. This is because performance goals may cause people to do more social comparison, such as comparing oneself to others, which may ineffectively raise motivation. Mindsets related to learning also play into motivation. Psychologist Carol Dweck distinguished differences between the growth mindset, the idea that ability is malleable, and the fixed mindset, the idea that ability is fixed. People who incorporate a growth mindset on a certain task tend to have higher motivation. Attribution theory, which discusses how people perceive and attribute a certain behavior or outcome to a certain characteristic, also relates to motivation and learning. According to Bernie Weiner's attribution model, students attribute their academic achievement based on effort, ability, and luck. The way an individual attributes his or her academic performance will determine that person's level of motivation. Theories related to control also have a major impact to learning. When people begin to perceive that their performance outcomes are not related to their own effort, this can severely limit motivation. At the most extreme, this can lead to learned helplessness which is when a person is experiencing a negative cycle where one's negative beliefs interactions with one's academic failures and motivation. Various types of motivation also play a role particularly intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is an inherent type of motivation that one engages as an end to itself. Extrinsic motivation, on the other hand, is a motivation that is provided externally such as external awards or punishments. Research has shown that incentives which reward task engagement lowers intrinsic motivation as it is much like controlling behavior. However, rewards related to one's performance are more effective which can help further one's skill, motivation, and self- efficacy.

Origins  A collateral branch of the reigning House of Kalākaua (from Kauaʻi island) and descendants of chiefs of areas such as Waimea on Hawaiʻi island, the dynastic line was established by Prince David Kawānanakoa who was declared an heir to King David Kalākaua. He was the son of High Chief David Kahalepouli Piʻikoi and High Chiefess Victoria Kinoiki Kekaulike. Kawānanakoa was engaged to Princess Victoria Kaʻiulani on February 3, 1898, who would have become a monarch in her own right upon the death of Queen Liliʻuokalani had she not predeceased her. David Kawānanakoa's paternal ancestry comes from a cadet branch of the Kauaʻi royal family. His paternal grandmother High Chiefess Kekahili was a half-sister of High Chief Caesar Kapaʻakea, the father of Kalākaua, both being children of the Chiefess Kamokuiki. This made her an aunt of King Kalākaua and Queen Liliʻuokalani, which makes the Kawānanakoas the closest surviving collateral relatives of the formerly reigning Kalākaua house. The said grandmother descended, besides from the ancient line of chiefs of Kauaʻi, also from the chief of Kaʻū, a great-uncle of King Kamehameha I. However, the higher ranking ancestry of David Kawānanakoa actually is that through his mother. His maternal grandmother High Chiefess Kekaulike Kinoiki was the daughter of the last king of Kauaʻi and Niʻihau Kaumualiʻi. She was the granddaughter of Kaneoneo, who attempted to take Oʻahu back from Kahekili II in rebellion. She descended from the lines of high chiefs of Niʻihau, Koloa, Oʻahu, Kauaʻi and Maui. High Chief Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole the maternal grandfather Kanekoa, on his part, was a descendant of several districts of the island of Hawaiʻi (such as Waimea, Kona and Hilo) and descended directly from the chief of Waimea. Kanekoa was the half-uncle of King Kamehameha I who himself was originally a chief of Kona. The House of Kawānanakoa survives today and is believed to be heirs to the throne by a number of genealogists. Members of the family are sometimes called prince and princess, as a matter of tradition and respect of their status as aliʻi or chiefs of native Hawaiians, being lines of ancient ancestry. The House of Kawānanakoa in contemporary Hawaiian politics is closely aligned with the Hawaii Republican Party, a political party it helped organize since the creation of the Territory of Hawaiʻi. Its matriarch, Abigail Kawānanakoa, became a national party leader in the early years of the twentieth century. While many historians, members of the government of Hawaiʻi (as a matter of opinion and not policy), and some Hawaiʻi residents consider the House of Kawānanakoa the rightful heirs to the throne, smaller factions of native Hawaiians with objections to the family's ties to the Hawaiʻi Republican Party have chosen instead to support various other branches of aliʻi lines, such as descendants of collateral branches of the extended House of Kamehameha (to which both the Kalākaua and Kawānanakoa dynasties are distantly related, too) as having rights to the throne.

Means was active in international issues of indigenous peoples, including working with groups in Central and South America and with the United Nations for recognition of their rights. He was active in politics at his native Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and at the state and national level. Beginning an acting career in 1992, he appeared on numerous television series and in several films, including The Last of the Mohicans and released his own music CD. He published his autobiography Where White Men Fear to Tread in 1995. Early life Means was born in Porcupine, South Dakota, on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, to Theodora Louise Feather and Walter \\"Hank\\" Means. His mother was a Yankton Dakota from Greenwood, South Dakota and his father, an Oglala Lakota. As well as Russell, the family had two other boys (William \\"Bill\\" and Warren) and three girls (Madonna, Mabel Ann and Phyllis). He was given the name Wanbli Ohitika by his mother, which means 'Brave Eagle' in the Lakota language. In 1942, the Means family resettled in the San Francisco Bay Area, seeking to escape the poverty and problems of the reservation. His father worked at the shipyard in Vallejo. Means grew up in the Bay Area, graduating in 1958 from San Leandro High School in San Leandro, California. He attended four colleges but did not graduate from any of them. In his 1995 autobiography, Means recounted a harsh childhood; his father was alcoholic and he himself fell into years of \\"truancy, crime and drugs\\" before finding purpose in the American Indian Movement in Minneapolis, Minnesota. His father died in 1967 and, in his 20s, Means lived in several Indian reservations throughout the United States while searching for work. While at the Rosebud Indian Reservation in south-central South Dakota, he developed severe vertigo. Physicians at the reservation clinic believed that he had been brought in inebriated. After they refused to examine him for several days, Means was finally diagnosed with a concussion due to a presumed fight in a saloon. A visiting specialist later discovered that the reservation doctors had overlooked a common ear infection, which cost Means the hearing in one ear. After recovering from the infection, Means worked for a year in the Office of Economic Opportunity, where he came to know several legal activists who were managing legal action on behalf of the Lakota people. After a dispute with his supervisor, Means left Rosebud for Cleveland, Ohio. In Cleveland, he worked with Native American community leaders against the backdrop of the American Civil Rights Movement. Means was previously an accountant and a ballroom dance instructor. Involvement with the American Indian Movement In 1968, Means joined the American Indian Movement (AIM), where he rose to become a prominent leader. In 1970, Means was appointed AIM's first national director, and the organization began a period of increasing protests and activism. =Activism= Means participated in the 1969 Alcatraz occupation. He had been there once before, to occupy it for 24 hours under the lead of his father, Walter \\"Hank\\" Means, and a few other Lakota men in March 1964. (Means' father died in January 1967). On Thanksgiving Day 1970, Means and other AIM activists staged their first protest in Boston: they seized the Mayflower II, a replica ship of the Mayflower, to protest the Puritans' and United States' mistreatment of Native Americans. In 1971 Means was one of the leaders of AIM's takeover of Mount Rushmore, a federal monument. Rushmore is within the Black Hills, an area sacred to the Lakota tribe. In November 1972, he participated in AIM's occupation of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) headquarters in Washington, D.C. to protest abuses. Many records were taken or destroyed, and more than $2 million in damage was done to the building. In 1973, Dennis Banks and Carter Camp led AIM's occupation of Wounded Knee, which became the group's best-known action. Means appeared as a spokesman and prominent leader. The armed standoff of more than 300 Lakota and AIM activists with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and state law enforcement lasted for 71 days. A visiting Cherokee from North Carolina and an Oglala Lakota activist from Pine Ridge Reservation were killed in April. =Native American politics= In 1974, Means resigned from AIM to run for the presidency of his native Oglala Sioux Tribe (OST) against the incumbent Richard Wilson. The official vote count showed Wilson winning by more than 200 votes. Residents complained of intimidation by Wilson's private militia. The report of a government investigation confirmed problems in the election, but in a related court challenge to the results of the election, a federal court upheld the results. In the late 1970s, Means turned to an international forum on issues of rights for indigenous peoples. He worked with Jimmie Durham, who established the offices of the International Indian Treaty Council to work with the United Nations in 1977. At the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, he assisted in the organization of community institutions, such as the KILI radio station and the Porcupine Health Clinic in Porcupine, South Dakota. =Splits in AIM= In the 1980s, AIM divided into several competing factions, in part over differences among members regarding support for the indigenous peoples in Nicaragua. Means supported the Miskito group MISURASATA (later known as YATAMA), which was allied with the Contras. He traveled to Nicaragua in 1985 and 1986 on fact-finding tours. He came to believe that the Miskito as a people were being targeted for elimination. Some AIM members supported the Sandinistas of the national government, although they had forced removal of thousands of Miskito from their traditional territory. At that time, the \\"Grand Governing Council\\" of AIM, based in Minnesota, asked Means to cease representing himself as a leader of AIM. Other chapters of AIM continued to support Means. On January 8, 1988, Means held a press conference to announce his retirement from AIM, saying it had achieved its goals.\\"Indian activist Russell Means says he's retiring from AIM\\", AP, Attachment 3, Articles on Means, AMERICAN INDIAN MOVEMENT GRAND GOVERNING COUNCIL That January, the \\"AIM Grand Governing Council\\", headed by the Bellecourt brothers, released a press release noting this was the sixth resignation by Means since 1974, and asking the press to \\"never again report either that he is a founder of the American Indian Movement, or [that] he is a leader of the American Indian Movement\\".

It had been under investigation both by the Denver police, as Aquash had been kidnapped from there, and by the FBI, as she had been taken across state lines and killed on the Pine Ridge Reservation. Both Branscombe and Means accused Vernon Bellecourt, a high-ranking leader of AIM, of having ordered her execution. Means said that Clyde Bellecourt, a founder of AIM, had ensured that it was carried out at the Pine Ridge Reservation. Means said that an AIM tribunal had banned the Bellecourt brothers but tried to keep the reason for the dissension internal to protect AIM. The Associated Press (AP) reporter Robert Weller noted that this was the first time that an AIM leader active at the time of Aquash's death had publicly implicated AIM in her murder.

Since the late 1970s, Means often supported libertarian political causes, in contrast with several other AIM leaders. In 1983 he agreed to become running mate to Larry Flynt in his unsuccessful run for U.S. President. In 1987, Means ran for nomination of President of the United States under the Libertarian Party, and attracted considerable support within the party, finishing 2nd (31.4%) at the 1987 Libertarian National Convention.\\"Freedom is for Everyone\\": Seattle Story; Mike Acree, Convention Reflections , Golden Gate Libertarian Newsletter , July 2000. He lost the nomination to Congressman Ron Paul. In 2001, Means began an independent candidacy for Governor of New Mexico. His campaign failed to satisfy procedural requirements and he was not selected for the ballot. In the 2004 and 2008 Presidential Elections, Means supported independent Ralph Nader. Nearly thirty years after his first candidacy, Means ran for president of the Oglala Sioux in 2004 with the help of Twila Lebeaux, losing to Cecilia Fire Thunder, the first woman elected president of the tribe. She also defeated the incumbent John Yellow Bird Steele.Sam Hurst, \\"Cecilia Fire Thunder a 'person of character'\\", Rapid City Journal, December 18, 2005.

In addition, Means noted that since treaties and other legal documents in relation to the United States government use \\"Indian\\", continuing use of the term could help today's American Indian people forestall any attempts by others to use legal loopholes in the struggle over land and treaty rights. In 2007, Means and 80 other protesters were arrested in Denver during a parade for Columbus Day which they stated was a \\"celebration of genocide\\". Following the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in September 2007, a group of American Indian activists presented a letter to the U.S. State Department, indicating they were withdrawing from all treaties with the U.S. Government on December 20. Means announced the withdrawal by a small group of Lakota people.\\"Descendants of Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse break away from U.S.\\", AFP: Agence France-Presse, December 21, 2007. Retrieved June 17, 2011 That same month, they began contacting foreign governments to solicit support for energy projects on the territory. Means and a delegation of activists declared the Republic of Lakotah a sovereign nation, with property rights over thousands of square miles in South Dakota, North Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming and Montana.Bill Harlan, \\"Lakota group secedes from U.S.\\", Rapid City Journal, December 20, 2007 Means said that his group does not \\"represent collaborators, the Vichy Indians and those tribal governments set up by the United States of America\\".Faith Bremner, \\"Lakota group pushes for new nation\\" , Argus Leader, Washington Bureau, December 20, 2007 On January 8, 2008 tribal leaders in the northern Great Plains, Rodney Bordeaux of the 25,000-member Rosebud Sioux Tribe, and Joseph Brings Plenty of the 8,500-member Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, said that Means and the group of his fellow activists would not speak for their members or for any elected Lakota tribal government. While acknowledging that Means has accurately portrayed the federal government’s broken promises to and treaties with America’s indigenous peoples, they opposed his plan to renounce treaties with the United States and proclaim independence. They said the issue instead was to enforce existing treaties.Gale Courey Toensing, \\"Withdrawal from U.S. treaties enjoys little support from tribal leaders\\", Indian Country Today, January 4, 2008 In January 2009, Means criticized the modern state of Israel and Zionism.https://www.counterpunch.org/2009/01/12/russell-means-breaks-the- silence-on-obama/#gsc.tab=0 In October 2009, Means was critical of Obama receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, and has also been critical when Al Gore and Henry Kissinger received theirs as well. He had also criticized the U.S. interventionist foreign policy, the War in Afghanistan, and had referred to Obama's presidency as \\"Bush's third term.\\" In January 2012, Means announced his endorsement of Ron Paul in his bid for President., January 26, 2012 Other activities =Acting= From 1992 to 2012, Means appeared as an actor in numerous films and television movies, first as the chief Chingachgook in The Last of the Mohicans.

Wolf. He recounted his own family's problems: his alcoholic father, and his own \\"fall into truancy, crime and drugs\\" before he discovered the American Indian Movement. The book drew criticism from a number of reviewers.Brent Staples, \\"Review: Russell Means, Where White Men Fear to Tread, New York Times Book Review, 15 October 1995Malcolm Brenner, \\"AIM seeks distance from Russell Means\\", The Gallup Independent, January 8, 1998Malcolm Brenner, \\"Where White Men Fear to Tread\\", Attachment 9, Collection of articles on Means, reproduced at AMERICAN INDIAN MOVEMENT GRAND GOVERNING COUNCIL.

But whatever conclusions one makes of Means' actions and intentions, his unremitting presence and undaunted outspokeness opened a dialogue that changed the course of American history.\\" =Music, art, and media= Russell Means recorded a CD entitled Electric Warrior with Sound of America Records, in 1993.Electric Warrior Songs include \\"Une Gente Indio\\", \\"Hey You, Hey Indian\\", \\"Wounded Knee Set Us Free\\", and \\"Indian Cars Go Far\\". This was followed in 2007 with his The Radical album. In 2013, he was recognized by the Native American Music Awards with a Hall of Fame award.Hall of Fame Means was an avid painter, with showings at various galleries around the country and the world. The American pop artist Andy Warhol painted 18 individual portraits of Russell Means in his 1976 American Indian Series. The Dayton Art Institute holds one of the Warhol portraits in its collection. Means appeared as a character in the adventure video game Under a Killing Moon, by Access Software, in 1994. Means is the focus of the 2014 documentary Conspiracy To Be Free by director Colter Johnson. In 2016 the artist Magneto Dayo and The Lakota Medicine Men did a tribute song dedicated to Russell Means and Richard Oakes called \\"The Journey\\" on the album Royalty of the UnderWorld. Personal life Means was married five times; the first four marriages ended in divorce. He was married to his fifth wife, Pearl Means, until his death. He had a total of ten children: seven biological children and three adopted children, who were \\"adopted in the Lakota way\\" (Sherry Means, March 4, 2014, based on probate papers of October 19, 2014), including Tatanka Means who is also an actor. As \\"a grandfather with twenty- two grandchildren\\", Russell Means divided his time \\"between Chinle, Navajo Nation, Arizona, and Porcupine, South Dakota.\\" Illness and death In August 2011, Means was diagnosed with esophageal cancer. His doctors told him his condition was inoperable. He told the Associated Press that he was rejecting \\"mainstream medical treatments in favor of traditional American Indian remedies and alternative treatments away from his home on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation\\". In late September, Means reported that through tomotherapy, the tumor had diminished greatly. Later, he said that his tumor was \\"95% gone.\\" On December 5 of that year, Means stated that he \\"beat cancer,\\" that he had beat \\"the death penalty.\\" The following year, however, his health continued to decline and he died on October 22, 2012, less than a month before his 73rd birthday. A family statement said, \\"Our dad and husband now walks among our ancestors.\\" ABC News said Means \\"spent a lifetime as a modern American Indian warrior [...], railed against broken treaties, fought for the return of stolen land and even took up arms against the federal government [...], called national attention to the plight of impoverished tribes and often lamented the waning of Indian culture.\\" Among the tributes were calls for \\"his face [to] have been on Mt. Rushmore.\\" The New York Times said Means \\"became as well-known a Native American as Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse.\\" His ashes were sprinkled throughout the Black Hills. Legal troubles On December 29, 1997, Means was arrested for assault and battery of his 56-year-old (then) father-in-law Leon Grant, a member of the Diné (Navajo) Nation. AIM Governing General Council issued a press release to reiterate its separation from Means.

Qahtani allegedly tried to enter the United States to take part in the September 11 attacks as the 20th hijacker and was due to be onboard Flight 93 along with the four other hijackers. He was refused entry due to suspicions that he was trying to illegally immigrate. He was later captured in Afghanistan in the battle of Tora Bora in December 2001. After military commissions were authorized by Congress, in February 2008, Qahtani was charged on numerous counts. In May, the charges were dropped without prejudice. New charges were filed against him in November 2008 and dropped in January 2009, as evidence had been obtained through torture and was inadmissible in court. This was the first time an official of the Bush administration had admitted any torture of detainees at Guantanamo. In a Washington Post interview in January 2009, Susan Crawford of the Department of Defense said \\"we tortured Qahtani\\", saying that the U.S. government had so abused Qahtani through isolation, sleep deprivation, forced nudity and exposure to cold that he was in a \\"life-threatening condition.\\" Early life Mohammed al-Qahtani was born on 19 November 1979 in Kharj, Saudi Arabia. He is a Saudi national from a large Sunni family. His father served as a police officer for 28 years. His mother remained at home to raise their twelve children. He has seven brothers and four sisters, who range in age from 14 to 42 years of age. Denied entry by US immigration On August 3, 2001, Qahtani at the age of 21 flew into Orlando, Florida, from Dubai. He was questioned by immigration agent José Meléndez-Pérez, who was dubious that he could support himself with only $2,800 cash to his name, and suspicious that he intended to become an illegal immigrant, as he was using a one-way ticket. He was sent back to Dubai, and subsequently returned to Saudi Arabia. Transfer to Guantanamo Captured in the Battle of Tora Bora in December 2001, Qahtani was shipped by the Americans with other detainees in June 2002 to the Guantanamo Bay detention camp set up five months prior at the United States Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. He continued giving a false name, and insisted he had been in the area solely to pursue an interest in falconry. After ten months, U.S. Border and Immigration Authorities took a fingerprint sample and discovered that he was the same person who had tried to enter the United States just before the September 11 attacks. Seizing the airport's CCTV surveillance recordings, the FBI claimed they were able to identify the car of Mohamed Atta at the airport, believed to be there to pick up Qahtani. Another military account stated that Qahtani was identified as someone who had previously been turned away due to visa problems – by fingerprints \\"taken in Southwest Asia\\". At that time, the military invited FBI interrogators to interview Qahtani. By the fall of 2002, they were frustrated by his resistance. DOD interrogators talked of using different techniques, based on a class they attended. Shortly after September 26, 2002, top administration political appointees: David Addington, the VP's chief of staff; Alberto Gonzales, then White House Counsel; John A. Rizzo of the CIA; William Haynes II, General Counsel of DOD; his legal assistant, Jack Goldsmith; and two Justice Department lawyers, Alice S. Fisher and Patrick F. Philbin, flew to Camp Delta to view Qahtani and talk with his interrogators. They were trying to develop ways to break down detainee resistance and had come up with a list of potential techniques to be used. Lieutenant Colonel Diane Beaver, the top legal adviser at Guantanamo, suggested to her command in Defense that acting with \\"pure intent\\" was important, and they might seek immunity from \\"command authorities\\" prior to using such harsh interrogation techniques. (In August 2002, the Office of Legal Counsel, Department of Justice, had provided legal opinions (later called the Torture Memos) to the CIA that narrowly defined torture and authorized the use of enhanced interrogation techniques, since commonly defined as torture). The political appointees went on to Charleston, South Carolina to view Jose Padilla, and finally to Norfolk, Virginia to view Yaser Esam Hamdi. These men were United States citizens. Like the foreign detainees in Guantanamo, they were held in solitary confinement, where most human contact was with their interrogators, according to a theory about how to develop dependence among prisoners, for long-term gathering of intelligence by interrogators. At this time, none of the detainees, including the American citizens, had access to counsel or federal courts. Qahtani had initially been interrogated by FBI agents, who used standard techniques based in police work. On December 2, 2002, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld authorized in writing the use of 17 enhanced interrogation techniques to be used against Qahtani (see next section). After details of Qahtani's status were leaked in 2004, the US Department of Defense issued a press release stating that Qahtani had admitted: *He had been sent to the US by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the lead architect of the 9/11 attack; *He had met Osama bin Laden on several occasions; *He had terrorist training at two al-Qaeda camps; *He had been in contact with many senior al-Qaeda leaders. Al-Qahtani is also said to have informed interrogators that he had received operational training in covert communications from Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, whom he identified as a courier for Osama bin Laden. This was an early lead at a time when the hunt for bin Laden by other means had ground to a halt, but, as the national security expert Peter Bergen has noted, it had to be combined with another eight years of work, relying on a wide variety of techniques of intelligence-gathering, to culminate in the US government's 2011 raid on the bin Laden compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan and killing of the al-Qaeda leader.Bergen, Peter. Manhunt: The Ten-Year Search for bin Laden from 9/11 to Abbottabad, 2012. pp. 98–99. Documented abuses while in Guantanamo At Guantánamo, Mohammed al- Qahtani was subjected to a regime of 17 aggressive interrogation techniques, known as the \\"First Special Interrogation Plan,\\" authorized in writing by US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld on December 2, 2002, and implemented under the supervision and guidance of Secretary Rumsfeld and the commander of Guantánamo, Major General Geoffrey Miller. After complaints from military investigators, the list of approved techniques was reduced. The special interrogation plan and techniques were not revealed until 2008 in testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee during its investigation of detainee treatment, and were reported by the FBI Inspector General, Glenn Fine. The authorized techniques were related to those described in the three August 2002 legal opinions, later known as the Torture Memos, drafted by John Yoo and signed by Jay S. Bybee of the Office of Legal Counsel, Department of Justice, issued to the CIA. Under these coercive techniques, Qahtani gave additional information, including naming 30 other prisoners as working directly for bin Laden. The military used this information as justification to hold the men as enemy combatants. But, because the material was extracted under torture, it was later considered inadmissible in court. Qahtani later recanted this testimony, saying he had given the names of other detainees only to stop the abuse. It was not until February 2008 that Qahtani was first charged before a military commission, and the prosecution dropped the charges in May of that year. He was charged again in November 2008, but on January 14, 2009, Susan J. Crawford, a senior Pentagon official of the Bush administration, stated that she would not proceed with his prosecution. She said that Qahtani's \\"treatment met the legal definition of torture.... The techniques they used were all authorized, but the manner in which they applied them was overly aggressive\\". As convening authority of the military commissions, Crawford was responsible for overseeing the Guantanamo military commissions. Her statement was the first time any top official of the Bush administration had said there was torture of detainees at Guantanamo. Gitanjali Gutierrez, a defense lawyer for al-Qahtani who works for the New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights, has said she thought Qahtani's torture constituted a war crime. =Interrogation log= On March 3, 2006, Time magazine published the secret log of 49 days of the 20-hour-per-day interrogation of Qahtani at Guantanamo Bay detention camp from late November 2002 to early January 2003. This had been leaked to the press. The log described Qahtani being forcibly administered intravenous fluids, drugs, and enemas, in order to keep his body functioning well enough for the interrogations to continue. The log, titled SECRET ORCON INTERROGATION LOG DETAINEE 063, offers a daily, detailed account of the enhanced interrogation techniques used from November 23, 2002, to January 11, 2003. These included the following: * Forced to submit to an enema * Beatings * Placed in stress positions for long periods of time in order to induce severe pain * Threats made against his family, including female members * Forced nudity, including in the presence of female personnel * Placed in tight restraints for many months on end, day and night * Lowering the temperature in the room, then throwing water on the detainee's face * Restraint on a swivel chair for long periods * Various humiliations, such as training the detainee to act as a dog, dance lessons, and forcing him to watch puppet shows depicting sexual acts between him and Osama bin Laden at his mock birthday party * Deprivation of sleep for long periods * Loud music and white noise played to prevent the detainee from sleeping * Forcing the detainee to pray to bin Laden * Various interrogation techniques described as \\"pride & ego down\\", \\"circumstantial evidence\\", \\"fear-up\\", or \\"Al Qaeda falling apart\\" * Threats of extraordinary rendition to countries that torture * Strip searches * Body searches * Prohibiting detainee from praying for prolonged times and during Ramadan * Threatening to desecrate the Koran in front of him * Forced to pick up trash with his hands cuffed, while being called \\"a pig\\" * Exposure to low temperatures for prolonged times * Forcible administration of IVs by medical staff during interrogation, which were described by Qahtani as \\"repetitive stabs\\" each day * Repeatedly screened a video of September 11 attacks * Pictures of 9/11 victims taped to his body * Forced to stand for U.S. national anthem and listen to interrogators and guards sing \\"God Bless America\\" The interrogation log does not record Qahtani admitting to being a member of al-Qaeda. The entry for January 1, 2003, relates that Qahtani blames Osama bin Laden for deceiving the 19 9/11 hijackers (\\"his friends\\"): > 2A0780 asked how one man, Bin Laden, convince 19 young men to kill > themselves, (detainee was starting to fade he was going in and out of > sleep.) The question was repeated, detainee stated that they were tricked, > that he distorted the picture if front of them, 2A0780 asked detainee if > this made him mad, detainee stated yes, (detainee did not realize that 2A780 > had not started putting detainee into the picture) 2A0780 asked detainee if > he was mad that his friends had been tricked, detainee said yes. 2A0780 > asked detainee if his friends knew about the plan, detainee said no, 2A0780 > asked if detainee knew about the plan, detainee stated that he didn't know. > 2A0780 asked detainee if it made him mad that he killed his friends, > detainee stated yes. 2A0780 asked detainee if he was glad that he didn't die > on the plane, detainee stated yes. 2A0780 asked detainee if his parents were > happy that he didn't die detainee stated yes. 2A0780 stated \\"he killed your > friends\\" detainee stated yes. When asked about his greatest sins in his life, Qahtani responded that he had not taken care of his parents properly, had not finished college, and had not been able to repay $20,000 he had borrowed from his aunt. Recanting On March 3, 2006, Qahtani's lawyer Gitanjali Gutierrez said that her client had recanted the accusations he had made against fellow detainees during earlier periods of interrogation under torture. He had told his lawyer that he was forced to falsely confess and name names, in order to get his \\"enhanced interrogation\\" to end. He had accused 30 other detainees of being former bodyguards of Osama bin Laden. Given the circumstances of how Qahtani's confessions were obtained, lawyers for the other detainees argued that his testimony should not be used by the military as justification to detain their clients. They used this argument in their petitions for habeas corpus challenges for their clients. The government argued that, under the Detainee Treatment Act (2005), detainees could not use the federal courts for habeas corpus except on appeal. In its decision in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld (2006), the Supreme Court ruled that the Detainee Treatment Act and the military commissions as established by the Department of Defense were unconstitutional for depriving detainees of habeas corpus and rights of due process, and that the military commissions had not been authorized by Congress. Military Commissions Act of 2006 In the fall of 2006, Congress quickly passed and the President signed the Military Commissions Act of 2006. It responded to the Court's concerns but mandated the restriction of detainees to the military commission system. On February 9, 2008, the New York Times reported that the Office of Military Commissions was close to laying charges against six of the high-value detainees at Guantanamo, including Qahtani. He was believed to have been the planned 20th hijacker for the 9/11 attacks. Qahtani and the other five were charged on February 11, 2008, with war crimes and murder, and faced the death penalty if convicted. Gitanjali Gutierrez, an attorney with the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), was representing Qahtani. Attorneys at CCR denounced the systematic use of torture against detainees and challenged the validity of the military commission. They said that evidence in Qahtani's death penalty case was obtained by torture. In their February 2008 press release, CCR said that \\"the military commissions at Guantanamo allow secret evidence, hearsay evidence, and evidence obtained through torture. They are unlawful, unconstitutional, and a perversion of justice.\\" =Suicide attempt= According to his lawyer, in early April 2008, al-Qahtani tried to kill himself after learning that he faced charges that could carry the death penalty. He cut himself at least three times, causing \\"profuse bleeding\\" that needed hospital treatment. =Charges dropped= On May 11, 2008, the government charges against al-Qahtani were dropped. Commander Jeffrey Gordon, a Pentagon spokesman, told reporters that it was possible for the charges to be re-instated, at a later date, because they had been dropped \\"without prejudice\\". =New charges announced= On November 18, 2008, Chief Prosecutor Lawrence Morris announced that he was filing new charges against Qahtani. When announcing the new charges, Morris stated that the new charges were based on \\"independent and reliable evidence\\". He stated: \\"His conduct is significant enough that he falls into the category of people who ought to be held accountable by being brought to trial.\\" =Crawford orders charges dropped= Susan Crawford, the senior official in charge of the Office of Military Commissions, has the final authority over whether charges were laid. On January 14, 2009, after a change in administrations, Crawford ruled that the prosecution would not proceed against Qahtani because he had been subjected to interrogation techniques in Guantanamo that rose to the level of torture. Bryan Whitman, a DOD spokesman, said that the techniques were legal at the time they were applied, according to Department of Justice legal opinions. Qahtani's habeas case reinstated Mohammed al-Qahtani's habeas corpus case was reinstated in July 2008 after the Supreme Court ruled in Boumediene v. Bush, stating that Guantanamo detainees have a constitutional right to habeas corpus and the right to petition federal courts. Joint Review Task Force When President Barack Obama took office in January 2009, he made a number of promises about the future of Guantanamo. He promised the use of torture would cease at the camp. He promised to institute a new review system, convening a task force to review material on detainees that was made up of officials from six agencies, whereas the OARDEC reviews were conducted entirely by the Department of Defense. Reporting back a year later, the Joint Review Task Force recommended release and repatriation of 53 detainees. It classified other individuals as too dangerous to be transferred from Guantanamo, although there was insufficient evidence to charge them with crimes. On April 9, 2013, that document was made public after a Freedom of Information Act request. Some 71 detainees were determined to be eligible for a Periodic Review Board assessment, similar to a parole board, to determine if they could be released. Mohammed al Qahtani was one of the 71 individuals deemed too innocent to charge, but too dangerous to release. Obama promised that those deemed too innocent to charge, but too dangerous to release would start to receive reviews from a Periodic Review Board. Qahtani was denied approval for transfer on July 18, 2016.http://www.prs.mil/Portals/60/Documents/ISN063/160718_U_ISN063_FINAL_DETERMINATION_PUBLIC.pdf Qahtani's 2014 federal appeals court order On 2 September 2014, a judicial panel for the Second US Circuit Court of Appeals in New York stated that pictures and videos of Qahtani, taken while in detention, should remain classified. The Center for Constitutional Rights, which represented Mohammed al-Qahtani for this federal lawsuit, had sought to disclose these audiovisual materials under the Freedom of Information Act. The judges decided that the release of these pictures and videos \\"could logically and plausibly harm national security because these images are uniquely susceptible to use by anti-American extremists as propaganda to incite violence against United States interests domestically and abroad\\". On March 9, 2015, the Supreme Court denied certiorari in his case. Representation in popular culture In a review of the drama film Zero Dark Thirty (2012) about the hunt for Osama bin Laden, Peter Bergen, a national security analyst, compared the character of Ammar and the issue of torture to the treatment of Qahtani in detention. In a controversial passage, Ammar is interrogated under torture in the film and gives up the name of a bin Laden courier. Bergen notes that although Qahtani gave a name under alleged torture, it took another eight years, with US analysts using every form of intelligence-gathering from high technology to 'people on the ground,' for the government to locate and kill Osama bin Laden. Other sources later suggested the character of Ammar was based on Ammar al- Baluchi. In the television documentary series The Path to 9/11, al-Qahtani is portrayed by Elie Gemael, who portrayed 9/11 hijacker Mohammed Atta in Zero Hour.

It offers bachelor's and associate degrees. Founded as a junior college in 1946, Florida College now draws its staff, faculty, and the majority of its students from non-institutional churches of Christ. The college is recognized among these churches and the community as a training center for ministers while also providing accredited programs in several high demand fields of study. Florida College has some unique characteristics as compared to other religious colleges and universities: the college accepts no monetary contributions from any congregation or organized religious bodies, and its board members serve as individuals rather than as official representatives of any such entity. These differences allow the college itself to remain an autonomous educational entity not beholden to any corporate religious body. The high emphasis Florida College places on its Christian roots is expressed in its traditional chapel services held Mon.-Fri. during the academic calendar year. All members of the board of directors and all faculty members are active members in a church of Christ as prescribed by the college charter. All students take biblical courses as part of their liberal arts undergraduate curriculum.  History  The campus is located in the heart of the city of Temple Terrace and sits astride the banks of the Hillsborough River (to the east) and is surrounded by the private golf course land of the Temple Terrace Golf and Country Club founded circa 1922. One of the oldest buildings in Temple Terrace, Sutton Hall, circa 1922, is on the campus, and was originally the clubhouse for the Temple Terrace Golf and Country Club. Another historic structure, the Student Center, which was originally the Club Morocco Nightclub and Casino, circa 1926, was razed in 2018. Florida College's Sutton Hall, formerly the Temple Terrace Golf and Country Club, 1920s postcard Noted Tampa architect M. Leo Elliott was the architect for both buildings which were part of the original Temple Terrace Estates, one of the first Mediterranean Revival golf course planned communities in the United States (1921). According to the 1988 Temple Terrace Historic Resources Survey, both buildings were eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. After the Florida economic collapse of 1926, in the late 1930s, the property and its buildings were acquired by the Florida Bible Institute from the City of Temple Terrace before being sold to the founders of today's Florida College. Billy Graham attended Florida Bible Institute, which owned the property now occupied by Florida College, in the late 1930s. In his autobiography he writes he received his calling \\"on the 18th green of the Temple Terrace Golf and Country Club\\". A Billy Graham Memorial Park is on the east side of the 18th green on the river. Known as Florida Christian College, the school's charter was drafted in 1944. The school opened in fall 1946 with 100 students. The college charter stipulates the Board of Directors be active in a local, generally non-institutional, Church of Christ. The first president of the school was L.R. Wilson, who served from 1946 to 1949. He was followed by James R. Cope, who remained in office from 1949 until 1982. During the 1950s, the Churches of Christ debated internally whether congregations should support missions or educational institutions. This resulted in a schism and the development of non- institutional Churches of Christ, which do not offer financing to educational institutions. Florida College was unique during these debates as the only college associated with the Churches of Christ which advocated non- institutionalism. Florida College continues to refuse donations from churches. The college supports itself entirely through the donations from individuals and the tuition paid by students. Throughout the 1950s, the majority of the students were older men who wished to become preachers; according to David Edwin Harrell, the school \\"became something of a training ground for a cadre of noninstitutional leaders\\".Harrell (2000), p. 304. In 1954 the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools granted Florida College full accreditation for the Associate of Arts degree. In the 1960s the school's recruitment policies changed, and students outside Churches of Christ were pursued. A vote by the students and staff resulted in dropping the word \\"Christian\\" from the school name in 1963. The name change was fueled in part by the controversy that the word Christian was only used as a noun and never as an adjective in the New Testament. By the 1970s the bulk of the student body were again members of Churches of Christ, although the students were younger and more traditional than those of the 1950s. In 1982, Bob F. Owen became president of Florida College, the position he held until 1991, when Charles G. \\"Colly\\" Caldwell, III, assumed office. At the beginning of the 2008 academic year, Caldwell announced his resignation as president of Florida College. He remains at Florida College as a tenured faculty member in the Biblical Studies department. After a nationwide search, Temple Terrace resident Harry E. \\"Buddy\\" Payne was named the fifth president of the college, effective May 22, 2009. Payne was the academic dean and vice president of the college prior to being appointed president. Florida College added its first accredited four- year degree program, the Bachelor of Arts in Biblical Studies, in 1996. It has since added bachelor's degrees in business, communication, elementary education, history, liberal studies and music. The school plans to add a nursing program beginning in the fall of 2021./  Campus  Florida College is located in Temple Terrace, Florida, approximately 20 minutes northeast of Tampa. About 20,000 people live in Temple Terrace, which covers an area of . The Hillsborough River marks the eastern edge of the main campus, which is bordered on the other three sides by the private golf course land of the Temple Terrace Golf and Country Club. Across the Hillsborough River, the college has Conn Gymnasium and its athletic fields. Immediately adjacent to the gym is an affiliated private pre-kindergarten through ninth grade school called Florida College Academy, and then a large physical plant warehouse. The main campus includes one of the oldest buildings in the city. Sutton Hall was originally built around 1922 to serve as the clubhouse for the Temple Terrace Golf and Country Club. The former Student Center, razed in 2018, was built around 1926, and served as the Club Morocco Nightclub and Casino. Tampa architect M. Leo Elliott designed both buildings. According to the 1988 Temple Terrace Historic Resources Survey, both buildings were eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. Economic collapse in 1926 forced their closure as recreational leisure facilities and the property passed to the Florida Bible Institute during the Great Depression. The land was then later purchased by the founders of Florida College. The Hutchinson Auditorium, one of the more striking Mid Century Modern buildings in Temple Terrace, cost $100,000 to build in 1961 and opened on March 5, 1961. The architect was Garry Boyle of Tampa and the structure was built by the Paul Smith Construction Co. of Tampa with financing largely provided by the Hutchinson family. Most materials for the auditorium were shipped from Chattanooga, Tennessee. Hutchinson Auditorium is central to Florida College as it serves as the meeting place for weekday morning chapel assemblies at 10:15 a.m. during the school year and as a theater for major productions on campus (e.g. plays, concerts, etc.). Two new residence halls were begun during the 2007–2008 school year and completed in the first half of the 2008–2009 academic year. Boswell Hall, which holds 320 beds, is five stories tall, and is said to be the tallest building in old Temple Terrace with a top floor view that looks out over the old city as well as the Hillsborough River. All on-campus men live in Boswell. Five-story Terrace Hall provides a new 90-bed residence hall for women. This supplements the other two residence halls for women, Hinely Hall and historic Sutton Hall. In 2013, a project was undertaken to renovate the condemned building known as \\"C Dorm\\", the primary male dorm before Boswell. The project was completed over the summer months of 2013 and dedicated on September 22 of that year. The newly renovated building, now known as \\"College Hall\\", houses women of junior and senior standing.  Academics  Florida College offers 17 Bachelor's degrees in the fields of biblical studies, business, communication, education, music, English, history, and liberal studies, as well as an Associate of Arts degree. The college is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. The student- to-faculty ratio is 11 to 1. Tuition, room and board for the 2013-14 academic year was $22,150. Eighty-two percent of the students receive financial aid.  Recruitment  Although the bulk of its students are members of churches of Christ, Florida College does not recruit through churches since the school is founded on the principles of the non-institutional churches of Christ, which per its doctrine does not engage in congregational support of colleges. Instead, the school gains name recognition by offering 21 one-week summer camps annually in locations across the United States. Approximately 4000 children attend the summer camps, with about 400 volunteers to teach and entertain them.  Student life  Approximately 558 students attend Florida College, representing 35 U.S. states and 6 foreign countries. Ninety percent of them are members of non-institutional Churches of Christ. More than 60% of the students are legacies with one or more of their parents or grandparents having previously attended the school. In many instances, both of a student's parents attended and met at Florida College. Students who do not finish four years at FC often will transfer to the University of South Florida (located in nearby Tampa) or Western Kentucky University (as FC has many attendees from the Commonwealth of Kentucky). Students are expected to adhere to a Moral Code of Conduct. As set forth in the 2015–2016 Student Handbook, the code includes among other policies: zero tolerance for \\"sexual activities outside of marriage,\\" \\"inappropriate physical contact that is affectionate in nature, whether on or off campus,\\" and meeting \\"a member of the opposite sex in any private place without permission from appropriate college personnel.\\" Students are expected to avoid \\"immoral environments\\" such as \\"restaurants known for the immodest dress of staff\\" and \\"any establishment that serves alcohol and checks for identifications at their door [sic].\\" Students are required to live on campus until they reach the age of 21 or have been in college for two years out of high school. In situations where an adult relative lives in the immediate vicinity this rule is sometimes relaxed. Residence halls are segregated by gender with each off limits to members of the opposite sex except in public lobbies. Approximately 90% of students live on campus, in one of four residence halls. These are: * Boswell Hall (houses all male students on campus) * Jennifer Hall (formerly Terrace Hall, was renamed in 2015) * Hinely Hall (built as an additional wing of Sutton Hall) * College Hall (formerly C-Dorm, was renovated in 2013) Sutton Hall (formerly the Temple Terrace Country Club) no longer houses residents as of the 2013 school year. Its old cafeteria and lobby are still used for evening devotionals and social activities. There are currently plans to renovate this historic building in the near future.  Athletics  Athletic teams participate in basketball, volleyball, soccer, track and field, and cross country. Although originally represented by a pelican, the school's current mascot is the Florida College Falcon. The school has a touring Public Relations band called the Friends, which is a reference to Florida College's original motto, \\"A Friend to Youth.\\" The school currently participates in the Southern States Athletic Conference of the NAIA.  Alumni  Florida College receives support from alumni across the United States. The college boasts one of the highest rates of alumni giving of any college or university in the country, something to which Florida College points to show how beloved the college is among those who have attended. For the period between 2011 and 2013, Florida College was ranked #1 by U.S. News & World Report for alumni giving, with 64.7% of alumni making financial donations to the school. There are twenty-eight alumni clubs, including some in states as removed as Minnesota and Oregon. The PR department under the leadership of Adam Olson created a branch of the Florida College family made specifically for the alumni to stay involved with the school. Called the \\"Hutchinson Bell\\", the program acts as an online network for alumni.  Academy  The college also administers Florida College Academy (FCA), a K–8 private school co-located on the Temple Terrace campus. FCA shares the athletic facilities, and participates in the Tampa Bay Christian Athletic League.

The lower the gravitational potential (the closer the clock is to the source of gravitation), the slower time passes, speeding up as the gravitational potential increases (the clock getting away from the source of gravitation). Albert Einstein originally predicted this effect in his theory of relativity and it has since been confirmed by tests of general relativity. This has been demonstrated by noting that atomic clocks at differing altitudes (and thus different gravitational potential) will eventually show different times. The effects detected in such Earth-bound experiments are extremely small, with differences being measured in nanoseconds. Relative to Earth's age in billions of years, Earth's core is effectively 2.5 years younger than its surface. Demonstrating larger effects would require greater distances from the Earth or a larger gravitational source. Gravitational time dilation was first described by Albert Einstein in 1907A. Einstein, \\"Über das Relativitätsprinzip und die aus demselben gezogenen Folgerungen\\", Jahrbuch der Radioaktivität und Elektronik 4, 411–462 (1907); English translation, in \\"On the relativity principle and the conclusions drawn from it\\", in \\"The Collected Papers\\", v.2, 433–484 (1989); also in H M Schwartz, \\"Einstein's comprehensive 1907 essay on relativity, part I\\", American Journal of Physics vol.45,no.6 (1977) pp.512–517; Part II in American Journal of Physics vol.45 no.9 (1977), pp.811–817; Part III in American Journal of Physics vol.45 no.10 (1977), pp.899–902, see parts I, II and III. as a consequence of special relativity in accelerated frames of reference. In general relativity, it is considered to be a difference in the passage of proper time at different positions as described by a metric tensor of space- time. The existence of gravitational time dilation was first confirmed directly by the Pound–Rebka experiment in 1959, and later refined by Gravity Probe A and other experiments. Definition Clocks that are far from massive bodies (or at higher gravitational potentials) run more quickly, and clocks close to massive bodies (or at lower gravitational potentials) run more slowly. For example, considered over the total time-span of Earth (4.6 billion years), a clock set in a geostationary position at an altitude of 9,000 meters above sea level, such as perhaps at the top of Mount Everest (prominence 8,848m), would be about 39 hours ahead of a clock set at sea level. Extract of page 433 Extract of page 118 This is because gravitational time dilation is manifested in accelerated frames of reference or, by virtue of the equivalence principle, in the gravitational field of massive objects.John A. Auping, Proceedings of the International Conference on Two Cosmological Models, Plaza y Valdes, According to general relativity, inertial mass and gravitational mass are the same, and all accelerated reference frames (such as a uniformly rotating reference frame with its proper time dilation) are physically equivalent to a gravitational field of the same strength.Johan F Prins, On Einstein's Non-Simultaneity, Length-Contraction and Time-Dilation Consider a family of observers along a straight \\"vertical\\" line, each of whom experiences a distinct constant g-force directed along this line (e.g., a long accelerating spacecraft Extract of page 120, a skyscraper, a shaft on a planet). Let g(h) be the dependence of g-force on \\"height\\", a coordinate along the aforementioned line. The equation with respect to a base observer at h=0 is : T_d(h) = \\\\exp\\\\left[\\\\frac{1}{c^2}\\\\int_0^h g(h') dh'\\\\right] where T_d(h) is the total time dilation at a distant position h, g(h) is the dependence of g-force on \\"height\\" h, c is the speed of light, and \\\\exp denotes exponentiation by e. For simplicity, in a Rindler's family of observers in a flat space-time, the dependence would be : g(h) = c^2/(H+h) with constant H, which yields : T_d(h) = e^{\\\\ln (H+h) - \\\\ln H} = \\\\tfrac{H+h}H. On the other hand, when g is nearly constant and gh is much smaller than c^2, the linear \\"weak field\\" approximation T_d = 1 + gh/c^2 can also be used. See Ehrenfest paradox for application of the same formula to a rotating reference frame in flat space-time. Outside a non-rotating sphere A common equation used to determine gravitational time dilation is derived from the Schwarzschild metric, which describes space-time in the vicinity of a non-rotating massive spherically symmetric object. The equation is :t_0 = t_f \\\\sqrt{1 - \\\\frac{2GM}{rc^2}} = t_f \\\\sqrt{1 - \\\\frac{r_s}{r}} = t_f \\\\sqrt{1 - \\\\frac{v_e^2}{c^2}} = t_f \\\\sqrt{1 - \\\\beta_e^2} where * t_0 is the proper time between two events for an observer close to the massive sphere, i.e. deep within the gravitational field * t_f is the coordinate time between the events for an observer at an arbitrarily large distance from the massive object (this assumes the far-away observer is using Schwarzschild coordinates, a coordinate system where a clock at infinite distance from the massive sphere would tick at one second per second of coordinate time, while closer clocks would tick at less than that rate), * G is the gravitational constant, * M is the mass of the object creating the gravitational field, * r is the radial coordinate of the observer within the gravitational field (this coordinate is analogous to the classical distance from the center of the object, but is actually a Schwarzschild coordinate; the equation in this form has real solutions for r > r_s), * c is the speed of light, * r_s = 2GM/c^2 is the Schwarzschild radius of M, * v_e = \\\\sqrt{ \\\\frac{2 G M}{r} } is the escape velocity, and * \\\\beta_e = v_e/c is the escape velocity, expressed as a fraction of the speed of light c. To illustrate then, without accounting for the effects of rotation, proximity to Earth's gravitational well will cause a clock on the planet's surface to accumulate around 0.0219 fewer seconds over a period of one year than would a distant observer's clock. In comparison, a clock on the surface of the sun will accumulate around 66.4 fewer seconds in one year. Circular orbits In the Schwarzschild metric, free-falling objects can be in circular orbits if the orbital radius is larger than \\\\tfrac{3}{2} r_s (the radius of the photon sphere). The formula for a clock at rest is given above; the formula below gives the general relativistic time dilation for a clock in a circular orbit: Extract of page 208 :t_0 = t_f \\\\sqrt{1 - \\\\frac{3}{2} \\\\\\\\! \\\\cdot \\\\\\\\! \\\\frac{r_s}{r}}\\\\, . Both dilations are shown in the figure below. Important features of gravitational time dilation * According to the general theory of relativity, gravitational time dilation is copresent with the existence of an accelerated reference frame. Additionally, all physical phenomena in similar circumstances undergo time dilation equally according to the equivalence principle used in the general theory of relativity. * The speed of light in a locale is always equal to c according to the observer who is there. That is, every infinitesimal region of space time may be assigned its own proper time and the speed of light according to the proper time at that region is always c. This is the case whether or not a given region is occupied by an observer. A time delay can be measured for photons which are emitted from Earth, bend near the Sun, travel to Venus, and then return to Earth along a similar path. There is no violation of the constancy of the speed of light here, as any observer observing the speed of photons in their region will find the speed of those photons to be c, while the speed at which we observe light travel finite distances in the vicinity of the Sun will differ from c. * If an observer is able to track the light in a remote, distant locale which intercepts a remote, time dilated observer nearer to a more massive body, that first observer tracks that both the remote light and that remote time dilated observer have a slower time clock than other light which is coming to the first observer at c, like all other light the first observer really can observe (at their own location). If the other, remote light eventually intercepts the first observer, it too will be measured at c by the first observer. * Gravitational time dilation T in a gravitational well is equal to the velocity time dilation for a speed that is needed to escape that gravitational well (given that the metric is of the form g=(dt/T(x))^2-g_{space}, i. e. it is time invariant and there are no \\"movement\\" terms dxdt). To show that, one can apply Noether's theorem to a body that freely falls into the well from infinity. Then the time invariance of the metric implies conservation of the quantity g(v,dt)=v^0/T^2, where v^0 is the time component of the 4-velocity v of the body. At the infinity g(v,dt)=1, so v^0=T^2, or, in coordinates adjusted to the local time dilation, v^0_{loc}=T; that is, time dilation due to acquired velocity (as measured at the falling body's position) equals to the gravitational time dilation in the well the body fell into. Applying this argument more generally one gets that (under the same assumptions on the metric) the relative gravitational time dilation between two points equals to the time dilation due to velocity needed to climb from the lower point to the higher. Experimental confirmation Satellite clocks are slowed by their orbital speed, but accelerated by their distance out of Earth's gravitational well. Gravitational time dilation has been experimentally measured using atomic clocks on airplanes. The clocks aboard the airplanes were slightly faster than clocks on the ground. The effect is significant enough that the Global Positioning System's artificial satellites need to have their clocks corrected. Additionally, time dilations due to height differences of less than one metre have been experimentally verified in the laboratory.C. W. Chou, D. B. Hume, T. Rosenband, D. J. Wineland (24 September 2010), \\"Optical clocks and relativity\\", Science, 329(5999): 1630–1633; Gravitational time dilation has also been confirmed by the Pound–Rebka experiment, observations of the spectra of the white dwarf Sirius B, and experiments with time signals sent to and from Viking 1 Mars lander.

It offers a wide range of banking products and financial services for corporate and retail customers through a variety of delivery channels and specialised subsidiaries in the areas of investment banking, life, non-life insurance, venture capital and asset management. The bank has a network of 5,275 branches and 15,589 ATMs across India and has a presence in 17 countries. ICICI Bank is one of the Big Four banks of India. The bank has subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Canada; branches in United States, Singapore, Bahrain, Hong Kong, Qatar, Oman, Dubai International Finance Centre, China and South Africa; as well as representative offices in United Arab Emirates, Bangladesh, Malaysia and Indonesia. The company's UK subsidiary has also established branches in Belgium and Germany.  History  ICICI Bank was established by the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India (ICICI), an Indian financial institution, as a wholly owned subsidiary in 1994 in Vadodara. The parent company was formed in 1955 as a joint-venture of the World Bank, India's public-sector banks and public-sector insurance companies to provide project financing to Indian industry. The bank was founded as the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India Bank, before it changed its name to ICICI Bank. The parent company was later merged with the bank. ICICI Bank launched internet Banking operations in 1998. ICICI's shareholding in ICICI Bank was reduced to 46 percent, through a public offering of shares in India in 1998, followed by an equity offering in the form of American depositary receipts on the NYSE in 2000. ICICI Bank acquired the Bank of Madura Limited in an all-stock deal in 2001 and sold additional stakes to institutional investors during 2001–02. In the 1990s, ICICI transformed its business from a development financial institution offering only project finance to a diversified financial services group, offering a wide variety of products and services, both directly and through a number of subsidiaries and affiliates like ICICI Bank. In 1999, ICICI become the first Indian company and the first bank or a financial institution from non-Japan Asia to be listed on the NYSE. In October 2001, the Boards of Directors of ICICI and ICICI Bank approved the merger of ICICI and two of its wholly owned retail finance subsidiaries, ICICI Personal Financial Services Limited and ICICI Capital Services Limited, with ICICI Bank. The merger was approved by the Reserve Bank of India in April 2002. In 2008, following the 2008 financial crisis, customers rushed to ICICI ATMs and branches in some locations due to rumours of an adverse financial position of ICICI Bank. The Reserve Bank of India issued a clarification on the financial strength of ICICI Bank to dispel the rumours. In March 2020, the board of ICICI Bank Ltd. approved an investment of Rs 1,000 crore in Yes Bank Ltd. This investment resulted in ICICI Bank Limited holding in excess of a five percent shareholding in Yes Bank.  Acquisitions  * 1996: ICICI Ltd.

A number of cases were filed against the bank and its employees for using \\"brutal measures\\" to recover the money. Most of the allegations were that the bank was using goons to recover the credit card payments and that these \\"recovery agents\\" exhibited inappropriately and in some cases, inhuman behaviour. Incidents were reported wherein the defaulters were put to \\"public shame\\" by the recovery agents. The bank also faced allegations of inappropriate behaviour in recovering its loans. These allegations started initially when the \\"recovery agents\\" and bank employees started threatening the defaulters. In some cases, notes were written by the bank's employees asking the defaulters to \\"sell everything in the house including family members\\", were found. Such charges faced by the bank rose to a peak when suicide cases were reported wherein the suicide notes spoke of the bank's recovery methods as the cause of the suicide. This led to legal battles and the bank paying huge compensation. =Money laundering allegations= ICICI Bank was one of the leading Indian banks accused of blatant money laundering through violation of RBI guidelines in the famous CobraPost sting operation which shook up Indian banking industry during April–May 2013.

It is located in the central portion of the lower peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan, approximately 25 miles (40 km) south of the Saginaw Bay in Lake Huron and five miles (8 km) south of the city of Saginaw in the county's Spaulding and James townships. It was established in 1953 to provide habitat for migratory waterfowl. Known locally as the Shiawassee Flats, the refuge lies in the Saginaw Bay watershed, historically one of the largest and most productive wetland ecosystems in Michigan. The Bad, Flint, and Cass Rivers flow into the Shiawassee River in the refuge. Here also the Shiawassee converges with the Tittabawassee River to form the Saginaw River. Wildlife and Habitat The Shiawassee National Wildlife Refuge in late spring Refuge habitats include riparian, floodplain/bottomland hardwood forests, and emergent marshes, as well as shallow managed wetlands and croplands. Over 265 species of birds have been documented on the refuge, including raptors, shore and wading birds, and more than 100 songbird species. Shiawassee Refuge is designated as a United States Important Bird Area (IBA) for its global significance to migratory waterfowl. It is also one of six focus areas designated by the Great Lakes/St. Lawrence Basin Joint Venture of the North American Waterfowl Management Plan. During peak populations in late October, up to 25,000 Canada geese and 40,000 ducks are present. A great diversity of other wildlife associated with freshwater marshes and floodplain forests are also found here. History In postglacial times, Lake Huron and Saginaw Bay extended much farther inland than they do now. When the water receded, it left behind a flat, sandy wetland surrounded by low hills. It served as the drainage zone for an area of lower Michigan that covers approximately ten counties. The region was a treasure-house of the wetland timber industry in the late 19th century. After the old-growth trees had almost all been removed, starting in 1903 farmers tried to ditch and tile-drain the land for arable crops. The Ferguson Bayou region of this drained land did not prove to be well-suited for this purpose, although the wildlife refuge continues to use, maintain, and rebuild many of the ditches, drains, and dikes dug during this period. The Shiawassee National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1953. The area was an attractive hunting and gathering area for many early cultures and later Native American tribes, like the Odawa and Ojibwa. Ducks and geese flocked to this vast area of wetlands and rivers. Mammalian species including river otter, fisher, marten, elk, moose, and black bear were also found here. The Flats received little human impact until the late 19th century, when the lumber industry expanded to this area. Coal was mined in the area from the early 20th century to the late 1930s. In 1903, farmers began converting the land for crops and, by 1950, a system of pumps, drainage tile, ditches and dikes were in place, making this an extensive agricultural area. Canada geese Shiawassee NWR has been designated as a U.S. Important Bird Area by the American Birding Association because of the genuinely migratory James Bay flocks of Canada geese that utilize the wetland annually. These James Bay geese should be sharply distinguished from the stay-at-home geese that have learned how not to migrate. Refuge management Shiawassee Refuge is also responsible for managing a portion of the Michigan Islands National Wildlife Refuge within Lake Huron and Saginaw Bay, including Thunder Bay, Scarecrow, and the Charity Islands. The Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge is also under its management, until a permanent staff is hired. The refuge also administers the Shiawassee Management District which coordinates wetland restorations in 22 counties and manages conservation easements in 44 counties of lower Michigan. The refuge is authorized to expand its present boundaries by 7,500 acres (30 km2) along the Tittabawassee, Shiawassee, and Cass rivers from willing sellers.

This constitution guaranteed equality of rights to Muslims, Christians (effectively, therefore, to Europeans) and to Jews; in particular, concerning the right to own property. This created a new legal environment which encouraged Europeans to set up businesses in Tunisia; thus new French traders appeared, along with non-Muslim religious schools.Ibn Abi Dhiaf, op. cit., p. 26 On 26 April 1861, the Bey changed the order of succession to the throne; henceforth it would be the oldest prince in the beylical family who would inherit, rather than the oldest son of the late sovereign. Since the time of Hammouda Pasha two hundred years before, French interests in Tunisia had been housed in the fondouk des Français, a caravanserai in the medina. Now the Tunisian government had a new French consulate built, on what was to become the Avenue de la Marine (now Avenue Habib Bourguiba), and it was formally opened by the Bey on 12 January 1862. Portrait of as-Sadiq from 1864 The Bey commissioned the Marseille engineer Colin to repair the Zaghouan aqueduct providing a fresh water supply to the capital. In 1865 he began demolishing the walls around the medina, some of which were so unsound they threatened to collapse. It is during this period that Tunis lost a number of its historic gates - Bab Cartagena, Bab Souika, Bab Bnet and Bab El Jazira. The bronze cannon on the city walls and the fortifications of La Goulette were sold off in 1872. Europeans began to settle near the former Bab el Bhar, in streets close to the old walls and along the Avenue de la Marine, now planted with fig trees. Room for building was limited in nearby areas by European cemeteries, particularly opposite the new consulate building, and by market gardens along the Lake of Tunis which extended as far towards the city as the present Avenue de Carthage. However, intrigues among his ministers, notably Mustapha Khaznadar and Mustapha Ben Ismaïl, constant pressure from European consuls and the looming bankruptcy of the state, provoked the Mejba Revolt of 1864,Bice Slama et Charles-André Julien, L'insurrection de 1864 en Tunisie, éd. Maison tunisienne de l'édition, Tunis, 1967, p. 18 compelled him to secure debts which he could not repay, and opened the door to foreign occupation despite the efforts of his Grand Vizier Kheireddine Pacha. France gained an important foothold in Tunisia in 1869 by means of a tripartite Debt Commission, constituted with the United Kingdom and Italy to manage the country's financial commitments to its creditors.id=2M4UAAAAIAAJ&pg;=PA153&dq;=bey+commission++1869&hl;=fr&ei;=K0B5TOyGCpTk4gatv4D7Ag&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result&resnum;=2&ved;=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q;=bey%20commission%20%201869&f;=false G. S. van Krieken, Khayr al-Dîn et la Tunisie, 1850-1881, éd. Brill, Leyde, 1976, pp. 150-152 In April 1881, a border incident with French Algeria involving raids by Khroumire tribesmen who were subjects of the Bey provided the final pretext for the dispatch of a French expeditionary force which took El Kef, and for the landing of French troops at Bizerte on 1 May. The French army occupied Tunis on 11 May. The Bey was therefore compelled to sign the Treaty of Bardo on 12 May, establishing the French protectorate of Tunisia.Jean-François Martin, La Tunisie de Ferry à Bourguiba, éd. L'Harmattan, Paris, 1993, p. 173  Private life Private chambers of Muhammad III as-Sadiq in Ksar Said Muhammad as-Sadiq had several wives. The first was his cousin, the daughter of the Qaid Ahmed al-Munastiri, from a Turkish family which had been influential in the harem of the Beys of Tunis throughout the century; her mother and grandmother were respectively the second wives of Hussein II Bey et Mahmud ibn Muhammad. His second wife was Henani, daughter of Ali Laroussi, a rich merchant dealing in traditional Tunisian chéchia headgear. He also married a Circassian odalisque Lella Kmar, who was a gift from the Ottoman sultan. His main residence was the Ksar Said palace, built in an Italianate style in front of the Bardo palace. It had been confiscated from the former minister and Keeper of the Seals, Ismail as-Sunni, who was accused of treason and executed in 1867. (This minister was the maternal grandfather of the future Moncef Bey). It was to one of the first floor staterooms of this palace that, on 12 May 1881, the French consul Théodore Roustan brought the French General to the Bey's privy council to secure his signature on the Treaty of Bardo. In his later years, the Bey fell under the influence Mustapha Ben Ismaïl, and died without issue. He was buried in the Tourbet el Bey mausoleum in the medina of Tunis. He was succeeded by his brother Ali III ibn al-Husayn. = Homosexuality of the bey = According to the historian Nizar Ben Saad, Sadok Bey had many sexual affairs with several male ministers from his court, the most famous with his Grand Vizir Mustapha Ben Ismail. The intimate meetings of the bey were always held in Dar El Bey at night to avoid being seen. Not only that, his marriage to Lella Kmar was never consummated, which made it easier for her to marry his brother Ali Bey after his death. = Descendants = The bey died without leaving any children to inherit the throne. Yet, he was the adoptive father of his nephew Mohamed Naceur, and Jnaina the spouse of his Vizie Ismail Ben Mustapha.

If there are fewer than three inhabited houses the convention is to regard the site as deserted; if there are more than three houses, it is regarded as a shrunken medieval village. There are estimated to be more than 3,000 DMVs in England alone.  Other deserted settlements  Not all sites are medieval: villages reduced in size or disappeared over a long period, from as early as Anglo-Saxon times to as late as the 1960s, due to numerous different causes.  Reasons for desertion  Over the centuries, settlements have been deserted as a result of natural events, such as rivers changing course or silting up, flooding (especially during the wet 13th and 14th centuries) as well as coastal and estuarine erosion or being overwhelmed by windblown sand. Many were thought to have been abandoned due to the deaths of their inhabitants from the Black Death in the mid-14th century. While the plague must often have greatly hastened the population decline, which had already set in by the early 14th century in England because of soil exhaustion and disease, most DMVs actually seem to have become deserted during the 15th century, when fields cultivated for cereals and vegetables were transformed into sheep pastures, often with ridge and furrow surviving under grass, even until today. This change of land use by landowners to take advantage of the profitable wool trade led to hundreds of villages being deserted. Later, the aristocratic fashion for grand country mansions, parks and landscaped gardens led to whole villages being moved or destroyed to enable lords of the manor to participate in this trend: a process often called emparkment or enclosure.  Examples  Perhaps the best-known deserted medieval village in England is at Wharram Percy in North Yorkshire, because of the extensive archaeological excavations conducted there between its discovery in 1948 and 1990. Its ruined church and its former fishpond are still visible. In Northamptonshire, around 100 villages can be classified as deserted, there are articles relating to many of them, such as Onley, Althorp, Canons Ashby, Church Charwelton and Coton along with Faxton, Glendon, Snorscombe, Wolfhampcote and Wythmail. Other examples are at Gainsthorpe and Burreth in Lincolnshire.

Published under the then Secretary of State for Defence, Geoff Hoon, the report effectively introduced a series of cutbacks to core equipment and manpower and the scaling back of a series of future capital procurement projects. This was justified due to the implementation of a policy termed Network Enabled Capability. The review also outlined a major restructuring and consolidation of British Army Infantry regiments. Key points The White Paper, scaling back to an extent from the previous Strategic Defence Review, outlined the following posture for the UK armed forces: * The ability to support three simultaneous small (e.g. Operation Palliser in Sierra Leone) to medium scale (e.g. Operation Veritas in Afghanistan) operations, where at least one is an enduring peace-keeping mission (e.g. Kosovo). These forces must be capable of acting as lead nation in any coalition operations. * The ability, at longer notice, to deploy forces in a large scale operation (e.g. Operation Telic in Iraq or Operation Herrick in Afghanistan) while running a concurrent small scale operation. Most of the reforms listed below were announced as part of the Delivering Security in a Changing World: Future Capabilities review, published on 21 July 2004.

He was one of the first European civil servants appointed in 1958 and served as Director-General of the Directorate-General for Competition from 1967 to 1970. He served as Minister President of the state of Lower Saxony from 1976 to 1990. He was the father of the politician Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission. Background Ernst Albrecht was born in Heidelberg, the son of the psychologist, psychotherapist and medical doctor Carl Albrecht, who was known for developing a new method of meditation; the Albrecht family had been among the hübsche (\\"genteel\\") families of the Electorate of Hanover as doctors, jurists and civil servants since the 17th century, but his immediate ancestors had been wealthy cotton merchants in Bremen and members of the city-state's Hanseatic elite in the 19th and 20th centuries. His grandmother Mary Ladson Robertson was an American of prominent planter class origin from Charleston, South Carolina, and a descendant of James H. Ladson and several colonial governors.Deutsches Geschlechterbuch vol. 17 p. 49 European Commission, 1958–1970 Ernst Albrecht studied law and economics. In 1958 he moved to Brussels where he became one of the first European civil servants. He initially served as the Chef de Cabinet to the European Commissioner for Competition Hans von der Groeben in the Hallstein Commission, and in 1967, at the age of 37, he became the Director-General of the Directorate-General for Competition. Business and political career He entered politics in his native Germany when he was elected to the Lower Saxon Landtag (parliament) in 1970, and moved to Hanover with his family the following year. From 1971 to 1976, he was CEO of Bahlsen. When Alfred Kubel resigned from the office of State Premier in 1976, Albrecht was unexpectedly elected as his successor. Since he received three more votes than his party had representatives in the Legislative Assembly, some members of the governing coalition SPD and FDP must have secretly voted for him. He was re-elected in state parliament elections in 1978, 1982 and 1986. Albrecht is known for the decision to make the County of Lüchow-Dannenberg the state's \\"nuclear district\\"; only a radioactive waste dump at Gorleben was realized, however. During his tenure Albrecht was embroiled in an unusually large number of political scandals; most famously, the Celle Hole. In 1980, Albrecht launched a campaign for election as Chancellor, but he lost out to fellow conservative Franz-Josef Strauß. Albrecht lost the 1990 state elections to Gerhard Schröder, who later became Chancellor. Personal life Ernst and Adele Albrecht (1985) Ernst Albrecht married Heidi Adele Stromeyer (1928–2002) in 1953. They had seven children, among them politician Ursula von der Leyen and Hans-Holger Albrecht, President & CEO of the international telecom and media group Deezer. A daughter died at age 11 and one son at age 49 of cancer. His brother is George Alexander Albrecht, a conductor. He had Alzheimer's disease since 2003,Von der Leyen und die Krankheit ihres Vaters.

La Rapide, Tunis, 1944, p. 175 was the sixteenth Husainid Bey of Tunis, reigning from 10 July 1922 until 11 February 1929. His father was Mohamed el-Mamoune Bey, the younger child of Hassine II Bey who had died young in 1861 without ruling when Habib was only three years old, and his mother was a Circassian odalisque named Fatma. His uncle Muhammad III as-Sadiq took charge of his education and married him to the niece of his Grand Vizier Mustapha Ben Ismaïl, his favourite courtier and mainstay of authority in the Regency of Tunis.

Throughout his reign he did not seek to hinder the authorities of the French protectorate, in contrast to the approach of his predecessor. He came to the throne deeply in debt and without any support owing to his coming from a branch of the family that was not close to power. He therefore remained reliant on the good graces of the French Resident General, Lucien Saint. Nevertheless, the aftermath of the First World War saw a change in relations between France and its colonies. About 80,000 Tunisians, mostly conscripted, had served in the French army, and about 20,000 had been killed or wounded.http://www.san.beck.org/16-8-Algeria,Tunisia,Morocco.html#a5 The Ottoman Empire, which until its dissolution had been the nominal suzerain of the Beys of Tunis, no longer existed. Ideas of self-determination were growing, and the Tunisian national movement regrouped in 1922 with the foundation of the Destour party. The French authorities took a number of political initiatives, establishing consultative councils including the Grand Council and regional (caïdat) councils and introducing new laws allowing some Tunisians to acquire French nationality. These initiatives galvanised the Destourians, prompting Habib Bey to advise Abdelaziz Thâalbi to leave the country if he continued to oppose them.Kenneth Perkins, A History of Modern Tunisia, Cambridge University Press, 2014 p.89 Habib Bey took part in the inauguration of the Grand Mosque of Paris in July 1926 along with Mouley Youssef of Morocco.Ingvar Svanberg & David Westerlund, Islam Outside the Arab World, Routledge 2012 p.344 He was also the first Tunisian ruler to have his name included in Friday prayers, replacing the Ottoman caliph. Lucien Saint invited him and his sons Azzedine Bey and Lamine Bey to make a private visit to Marignac in July 1923 and again the following year.

For many years, any small Jurassic or Cretaceous theropod that did not belong to one of the more specialized families recognized at the time was classified with the coelurids, creating a confusing array of 'coelurid' theropods that were not closely related. Although they have been traditionally included in this family, there is no evidence that any of these primitive coelurosaurs form a natural group with Coelurus, the namesake of Coeluridae, to the exclusion of other traditional coelurosaur groups. Classification Before the use of phylogenetic analyses, Coeluridae and Coelurosauria were taxonomic wastebaskets used for small theropods that did not belong to other groups; thus, they accumulated many dubious genera. As late as the 1980s, popular books recognized over a dozen \\"coelurids\\", including such disparate forms as the noasaurid Laevisuchus and the oviraptorosaurian Microvenator, and considered them descendants of the coelophysids. A wastebasket Coeluridae lingered into the early 1990s in some sources (and appears in at least one 2006 source) but since then it has only been recognized in a much reduced form. In 2003, O.W.M. Rauhut, using a cladistic analysis, found Coeluridae to include Coelurus (Late Jurassic, North America), Compsognathus (Late Jurassic, Europe), Sinosauropteryx (Early Cretaceous, Asia) and an unnamed Compsognathus-like form (Early Cretaceous, South America; this dinosaur has since been placed in the new genus Mirischia). Rauhut considered coelurids to be a monophyletic group of basal coelurosaurs, characterized by evolutionary reversals in some aspects of the vertebrae to the more primitive theropod condition. However, he and other authors have not since found this result. Phil Senter proposed in 2007 that Coelurus and Tanycolagreus were the only coelurids, and were actually tyrannosauroids. Coeluridae received a formal phylogenetic definition in 2015, when it was defined as all species more closely related to Coelurus fragilis than to Proceratosaurus bradleyi, Tyrannosaurus rex, Allosaurus fragilis, Compsognathus longipes, Ornithomimus edmontonicus, or Deinonychus antirrhopus by Hendrickx, Hartman and Mateus.Hendrickx, C., Hartman, S.A., & Mateus, O. (2015). An Overview of Non- Avian Theropod Discoveries and Classification. PalArch’s Journal of Vertebrate Palaeontology, 12(1): 1-73. It remains unclear whether or not this group contains any species other than Coelurus itself, and while Tanycolagreus is often included, support for this relationship has been weak in most of the studies that recovered it.Brusatte, S. L., & Carr, T. D. (2016). The phylogeny and evolutionary history of tyrannosauroid dinosaurs. Scientific Reports, 6. Below is a cladogram placing Coelurus in Coelurosauria by Cau et al. in 2015.

He was the penultimate ruler of the Husainid dynasty. Youth Portrait of Moncef Bey as a young man As a young man Moncef Bey distinguished himself during the events of April 1922 when he supported the nationalist Destour movement and prevailed on his father Naceur Bey to receive its representatives. He was invested as Bey al-Mahalla on 30 April 1942 and succeeded his cousin Ahmed Bey on the latter's death on 19 June of the same year.Paul Sebag, Tunis. Histoire d'une ville, éd. L'Harmattan, Paris, 1998, p. 493 Reign =Relations with the Vichy regime= On 2 July 1942 Moncef Bey was awarded the Grand Cross of the Légion d'honneur by the Vichy regime.Michel et Béatrice Wattel, Les Grand’Croix de la Légion d’honneur : de 1805 à nos jours, titulaires français et étrangers, éd. Archives et Culture, Paris, 2009, p. 532 Nevertheless, his attitude on the throne was not one which France found easy to deal with. Thus, in a memorandum of 2 August 1942 to Marshall Pétain presented by his Grand Vizier Hédi Lakhoua he reaffirmed his belief in Tunisian sovereignty, undiminished by the French protectorate. He insisted on the establishment of a consultative legislative Council in which Tunisians would predominate; access to civil service roles for Tunisians, and measures against poverty and unemployment. He also wanted compulsory schooling in Arabic, the nationalisation of key enterprises, and a range of other measures of a broadly nationalist character.Message de Moncef Bey au maréchal Pétain du 2 août 1942 (Archives nationales de Tunisie) On 12 October 1942 at the Eid al-Fitr ceremonies in the palace of La Marsa, Moncef Bey expressed his surprise that there was not a single Tunisian among the senior government personnel who were attending with the French Resident General, Admiral Jean-Pierre Esteva. Esteva replied 'seuls les Français sont aptes aux postes de commande' ('only the French are suited to positions of authority'). The Bey then sent a telegram to Marshal Pétain asking for Esteva to be recalled.https://web.archive.org/web/20081005075810/http://www.jeuneafrique.com/jeune_afrique/article_jeune_afrique.asp?art_cle=LIN13086moncesillas0 accessed 21/05/2017 and tension continued to mount between the Bey and EstevaHenri Grimal, La décolonisation de 1919 à nos jours, éd. Complexe, Bruxelles, 1985, p. 100 In December 1942, a confrontation blew up during a session of the Council of Ministers between Esteva and the Minister of Justice Abdeljelil Zaouche, after the Minister expressed reservations about funding for the National Gendarmerie and Esteva angrily rejected any criticism of the gendarmerie. Moncef Bey considered that the Resident General's tone was an insult to his representative and thus to his own person. Axis troops arrived in Tunisia on 19 November 1942 and the Tunisian Campaign turned much of the country into a battlefield. Moncef Bey was confronted by demands from Pétain to remain loyal to France and from Roosevelt to allow free passage for Allied troops. Moncef Bey proclaimed Tunisian neutrality while secretly informing Roosevelt that Tunisia would support the Allies. He also refused an offer from the Italian ambassador Bombieri to repudiate the Treaty of Bardo and enter into a new treaty with Italy. Moncef Bey with his ministers (left) and the princes (right) On 1 January 1943 the Bey named as his new Prime Minister M'hammed Chenik, who was described as 'half-American' by the German representative Rudolf Rahn. Chenik headed a government which included the destourian Salah Farhat, the neo-destourian Mahmoud El Materi and an independent, Aziz Djellouli.Jean-François Martin, Histoire de la Tunisie contemporaine. De Ferry à Bourguiba. 1881-1956, éd. L’Harmattan, Paris, 1993, p. 151 =Protector of the Jews= His predecessor Ahmed Bey was often referred to as 'the Bey of the French' and signed several decrees prepared by the Vichy regime which were detrimental to The Jewish community in Tunisia. Moncef Bey on the other hand was referred to as 'the Protector of the Jews' and made efforts to ensure that these decrees were not put into effect. He also refused to sign any other anti-Jewish decrees, including those requiring Jews to wear the yellow star, or to undertake forced labour, or to exclude Jews from certain activities.Adnan et Saadeddine Zmerli, « Moncef Bey, protecteur des Juifs », Jeune Afrique, 19 avril 2009, p. 87 Between November 1942 and May 1943, while Axis troops occupied the country, he intervened repeatedly to protect his people, particularly the Jewish community, from their exactions. Deposition and exile Moncef Bey at Pau, 5 October 1947 When Allied troops occupied Tunis, the French colonial lobby around Henri Giraud, including the former Resident General and Vichy minister Marcel Peyrouton, found a pretext to accuse the Bey of collaborating with Axis forces. After Esteva fled, General Alphonse Juin became acting Resident General. On 13 May 1943, on the orders of Giraud, Juin demanded the Bey's abdication, but he refused. The following day he was removed by a decree from Giraud and flown out of the country by the French airforce. He was succeeded by his cousin Lamine Bey on 15 May 1943. Mausoleum of Moncef Bey at the Jellaz Cemetery Moncef Bey was sent to Laghouat in southern Algeria, where he formally abdicated on 8 July. He was then moved to the small town of Ténès, in the north of the country and on 17 October 1945 he was moved again to Pau where he remained until his death on 1 September 1948.Akram Ellyas et Benjamin Stora, Les 100 portes du Maghreb : l’Algérie, le Maroc, la Tunisie.

The Silence of the Quandts The Hanns- Joachim-Friedrichs-Award winning documentary film The Silence of the Quandts by the German public broadcaster ARD described in October 2007 the role of the Quandt family businesses during the Second World War. The family's Nazi past was not well known, but the documentary film revealed this to a wide audience and confronted the Quandts about the use of slave labourers in the family's factories during World War II. As a result, five days after the showing, four family members announced, on behalf of the entire Quandt family, their intention to fund a research project in which a historian will examine the family's activities during Adolf Hitler's dictatorship. The independent 1,200-page study researched and compiled by Bonn historian, Joachim Scholtyseck, that was released in 2011 concluded: \\"The Quandts were linked inseparably with the crimes of the Nazis\\". no compensation, apology or memorial at the site of one of their factories, have been permitted.

Eventually Juin prevailed on him to agree, largely because of the benefits to his family.Maréchal Juin, op. cit., p. 184 As Moncef Bey refused to abdicate, General Giraud removed him on 14 May 1943.Omar Khlifi, op. cit., pp. 196–197 Muhammad VIII was installed on 15 May 1943 at the Bardo palace by General Juin, who invested him at the same time with the Légion d'honneur. He then received the homage of other princes of the royal family, ministers, court officials and members of the consular corps. For this occasion he reinstated the kissing of the hand, which his predecessor had abolished. That same day, Mohamed Chenik presented the resignation of his government and was replaced by Slaheddine Baccouche.Omar Khlifi, op. cit., p. 199 As was the norm under the French protectorate, the Bey was not consulted on the choice of ministers (the Chenik government appointed by Moncef Bey had been an exception to this rule). It was only on 6 July that Moncef Bey eventually abdicated, thereby rendering Lamine Bey's accession legitimate. For most Tunisians however, Lamine Bey was still considered to be a usurper.Omar Khlifi, op. cit., p. 213 Early reign (1943–1948)  General De Gaulle welcomed by Lamine Bey and Resident General Mast. Lamine Bey kept a low profile in the face of demands from loyalists for the return of Moncef Bey. His rare appearances showed that his subjects were indifferent to him, or indeed hostile.Roger Casemajor, L'action nationaliste en Tunisie, éd. MC-Editions, Carthage, 2009, . To rebuild his standing, he supported the teachers of the University of Ez- Zitouna who were striking in December 1943 and chose Neo Destourians as ministers. Nevertheless, the general opinion was that he wanted to abdicate and restore the throne to Moncef Bey. When these rumours were denied, his popularity fell again.Roger Casemajor, op. cit., On 7 May 1944 Charles de Gaulle visited Tunis on the first anniversary of its liberation from the Axis. Tunisians hoped that he would reverse the injustice of his old rival Giraud and restore Moncef Bey, but the Moncefists were disappointed in this hope.Roger Casemajor, op. cit., Instead De Gaulle presented Lamine Bey a Cross of Lorraine in gold, having learned that during the Axis occupation he used to listen secretly to De Gaulle's broadcasts from London. The Bey wore this on his uniform next to his decorations for a long time afterwards.Mohamed Salah Mzali, Au fil de ma vie, éd. Hassan Mzali, Tunis, 1972, p. 175 Hostility towards the Bey showed no signs of decreasing. He was boycotted by the other Husainid princes when he went to the mosque for Eid al-Fitr.Roger Casemajor, op. cit., p. 250 To raise his prestige, he was invited to Paris where he attended the military parades on 14 July 1945, standing next to De Gaulle. He then went on to visit Germany.Roger Casemajor, op. cit., p. 260 For Tunisians however, he remained 'The Bey of the French'.Roger Casemajor, op. cit., p. 277 In August 1946 when the capital was at a standstill during a general strike to protest the arrest of several nationalists, he feigned ill-health to cancel the ceremony of kissing hands which he was due to hold for Eid al-Fitr,Halé Eschadely, De l'ombre vers la lumière. Le combat du docteur Salem Esch- Chadely, éd. Institut supérieur de l'histoire du mouvement national, Tunis, 2014, but when he passed through the streets of Tunis in February 1947 on the Mawlid festival, he could readily see his subjects' indifference.Roger Casemajor, op. cit., p. 279 The anniversary of his accession was regarded by shopkeepers as a good occasion to close their premises and put up portraits of his predecessor. People even spat on his car. His health deteriorated in the face of this hatred and in 1947 an x-ray revealed a lesion in his left lung. Dr. Mohamed Ben Salem (1915–2001), husband of his daughter Princess Zakia, became his doctor and later his political advisor as well.Mohamed Ben Salem, L'antichambre de l'indépendance, éd. Cérès Productions, Tunis, 1988, p. 33 On 3 March 1947, the new French Resident General Jean Mons arrived in Tunis. The political situation had remained unchanged since the end of the war – the Destour and Neo Destour could agree on nothing except the demand to remove Lamine Bey and reinstate his predecessor. The court was consumed by a morbid obsession with his restoration.Jean Mons, Sur les routes de l'Histoire : cinquante ans au service de l'État, éd. Albatros, Paris, 1981, p. 213 Indeed, the mood was so pervasive that Mons suggested to the French government that they proceed to restore Moncef Bey. Prime Minister Paul Ramadier refused, fearing the adverse reaction of French settlers in North Africa.Jean Mons, op. cit., p. 216 On 19 July 1947 a new Grand Vizier, Mustapha Kaak, was appointed by the Resident General. For the first time, there was parity between Tunisians and French in the government.Jean Mons, op. cit., p. 223 Moncef Bey died in exile on 1 September 1948. His remains were brought to Tunis on 5 September for burial, and thousands of Tunisians turned out to pay their respects to him. His family threatened to boycott the ceremony if Lamine Bey attended, and he made no effort to present his condolences to them.Roger Casemajor, op. cit., p. 304} However this was a turning point for his reign, as the possibility of Moncef Bey's restoration was now removed, and for the first time, his people began to regard him as their legitimate ruler.Jean Mons, op. cit., p. 235 Closer relations with the nationalist movement (1948–53) After the death of Moncef Bey, relations between Lamine Bey and the nationalists improved. The Bey worked clandestinely with Habib Bourguiba and Salah Ben Youssef to raise demands for Tunisian self-government and during the period 1948–1951 was able to put the French authorities under considerable pressure. In 1952 a new Resident General took office, Jean de Hauteclocque, who took a much harder line than his predecessor and imprisoned Bourguiba and other nationalist leaders. The Bey sent an angry telegram to President Vincent Auriol complaining of De Hauteclocque's discourteous and threatening tone. The only result was that within a few hours, every one of his ministers had been arrested and interned. Deprived of the support of his ministers, on 28 March the Bey eventually gave way and signed the decree naming De Hauteclocque's nominee Slaheddine Baccouche as his Grand Vizier. Mestiri, Saïd (1991). Le ministère Chenik à la poursuite de l'autonomie interne, pp. 257–258 However he refused to sign any decrees issued by the Baccouche cabinet or by the Resident General, bringing government to a standstill and producing deadlock. With all his ministers and advisers in prison, Lamine Bey relied on the counsel and support of the trade union leader Farhat Hached, but in December 1952 he was assassinated by extremist French settlers of La Main Rouge.http://www.webdo.tn/2013/07/08/les-archives-sur-lassassinat-de-farhat- hached-ecartent-toute-implication-tunisienne/ accessed 15 August 2017 Unable to resist de Hauteclocque any longer, Lamine Bey eventually signed the decrees on limited internal autonomy which had been formulated months previously in Paris, thereby allowing new municipal elections.Mohamed Ben Salem, L'antichambre de l'indépendance, 1988, p. 111Ahmed Ounaies, Histoire générale de la Tunisie, vol. IV. « L'Époque contemporaine (1881-1956) », éd. Sud Éditions, Tunis, 2010, p. 463 However the reforms imposed by the French remained a dead letter – the nationalists launched a campaign of terror against both candidates and voters. This extended as far as the ruling family itself – on 1 July 1953 the Bey's heir apparent Azzedine Bey was assassinated inside his own palace, accused of conducting discussions of his own with the Resident General.Mohamed Sayah (texte réunis et commentés par), Histoire du mouvement national tunisien. Document XIV. Le Néo-Destour face à la troisième épreuve : 1952-1956, vol. 2 « La victoire », éd. Dar El Amal, Tunis, 1979, pp. 73–74 On 2 September 1953, Jean de Hauteclocque was finally recalled to Paris and the new Resident General, Pierre Voizard took a more conciliatory line. Thousands of prisoners were freed and censorship was scaled back. However Voizard's instructions from the French government made the relative calm only temporary – he was to pursue a reform policy with the Bey only, but not with the Neo Destour. France hoped by this means to drive a wedge between the ruler and the militant nationalists.Périllier, Louis (1979) La conquête de l'indépendance tunisienne. p. 182 Lamine Bey was too wily to be deceived by the apparently pleasant demeanour of the new Resident General. On 16 October 1953 he refused to preside at the opening of the Tunis-Carthage Fair because some repressive measures were still in place.Louis Périllier, op. cit., p. 183 More efforts were made to appease him – on 1 January 1954 a number of nationalist leaders were freed and promptly received by the Bey. Bourguiba however, regarded by France as highly dangerous, remained confined on La Galite.Louis Périllier, op. cit., p. 187 Estrangement from the nationalist movement (1953–56) With Bourguiba still in exile, Lamine Bey asked Mohamed Salah Mzali to negotiate a new reform package with the Resident General. On 18 January 1954, sufficient progress had been made that the Bey asked him to form a new government.Mohamed Ben Salem, op. cit., p. 138 A number of nationalists, including Hédi Nouira, were willing to give these reforms a chance, but the French refusal to free Bourguiba remained a stumbling block for many Tunisians, and indeed, for Bourguiba himself. 'The failure of an old man terrorised by the fear of deposition and exile, combined with the vile ambition of an unscrupulous adventurer risk depriving Tunisia of the only asset that remains to it: it standing as a nation state; its legal character, recognised internationally by treaty and confirmed by the General Assembly of the United Nations. Suddenly my release has been postponed indefinitely' he commented.Mohamed Sayah, vol. 2 « La victoire », p. 193 On 27 May Bourguiba, who had recently been transferred from La Gailte to custody in France, returned to the Bey the Grand Cross of the Nichan Iftikhar which he had received in 1950.Ahmed Ounaies, op. cit., p. 492 Mzali's cabinet resigned on 17 June 1954 and no successor was appointed. Bitter at the defeat of his efforts, the Bey confided to Voizard 'For a year, since I have been asking for Bourguiba to be released or transferred to a spa, I have received nothing but threats. Then you transfer him to a remote island without seeking my opinion. Now you are transferring him close to Paris, depriving me of the goodwill I might have earned by securing this move for him. I am ready to take up my rifle and become a fellagha to rebuild my contact with my people, for you have done everything possible to separate me from them.'Mohamed Ben Salem, op. cit., p. 159 On 31 July 1954 the new French Prime Minister Pierre Mendès France arrived in Tunis. He was received by Lamine Bey in the palace of Carthage, where he announced internal autonomy for Tunisia. This was a welcome surprise for the Bey, who had been kept at arm's length from the negotiations between Mendès France and the Neo Destourians before his visit. Shortly afterwards, the Bey addressed his subjects: 'A new phase has just begun in the life of our beloved country. It is hard for us to recall the painful days that all of Tunisia has lived through.... before this decisive step in our national life, we must stand equal to our destiny in offering to the world the spectacle of a united people marching serenely towards progress. This great constructive effort to which we are summoned can only bear fruit for us through order, peace and security, which all the inhabitants of this country have the right to enjoy.'Louis Périllier, op. cit., p. 222 There was no doubt however that the balance of forces had shifted decisively away from the Bey. For France, the experience of the failed Mzali government highlighted the futility of hoping to evolve political institutions by means of negotiating only with the Bey. The new Resident General, Pierre Boyer de Latour was quick to understand thisPierre Boyer de Latour, Vérités sur l'Afrique du Nord, éd. Librairie Plon, Paris, 1956, p. 79 and it was now the Neo Destour who were the sole interlocutors for the Tunisian people. Despite the repeated efforts of the Bey, a new government was formed without consulting the palace. To recover some semblance of his former influence, on 10 August he proposed to the French government that the institution of the beylicate should be replaced with a full monarchy, which would give him the authority he felt was appropriate. He was willing, in return, to sign supplementary agreements to the Treaty of Bardo necessary to maintain Franco-Tunisian cooperation and preserve the French presence in Tunisia. At the same time, he opened communications with Salah ben Youssef, in exile in Geneva. None of these approaches led to anything.Khalifa Chater, Tahar Ben Ammar (1889-1985), éd. Nirvana, Tunis, 2010, p. 189 After six months of negotiation, the autonomy accords were signed on 3 June 1955. Bourguiba had returned to Tunis on 1 June, welcomed as he came down the gangplank by the Bey's three sons,Mohamed Sayah, vol. 2 « La victoire », p. 650 and by a giant demonstration of Tunisians. Having crossed the capital in triumph, Bourguiba visited the Bey in Carthage, apparently unmindful of having returned his decoration only a few months before,Ahmed Mestiri, op. cit., p. 87 and made a stirring declaration of the deep attachment felt by the Tunisian people towards beylical rule. On 7 August the Bey applied his seal to the conventions agreed with FranceLouis Périllier, op. cit., and on 1 September, for the first time since the protectorate was established in 1881, he applied his seal to decrees that had not been authorised by the Resident General. On 29 December 1955 his seal confirmed a decree establishing a Constituent Assembly for the country, with elections to be held on 8 April 1956. Tunisia appeared to be evolving into a constitutional monarchy.Louis Périllier, op. cit., In fact, power continued to ebb rapidly away from Lamine Bey as independence approached. Salah Ben Youssef returned from exile on 13 September 1955, giving the Bey hopes that his political power would start to be restored. He was close to Ben Youssef, who had been one of the few politicians to pay his respects to him at the time of his installation in 1943. However violence quickly erupted between followers of Ben Youssef and those of Bourguiba, leaving the Bey to vainly attempt to act as arbiter between them. The French had already transferred authority over the police force from the Resident General to the Tunisian government, whose ministers had been chosen by Bourguiba, so Ben Youssef's representations to the Bey had no effect. On 2 December the Bey summoned the Resident General (now known as the High Commissioner) Roger Seydoux to remind him of France's responsibility for public order—which in fact it no longer had. In effect, the Bey was appealing for a restoration of colonial powers from the nationalist government.Khalifa Chater, op. cit., As his appeals had no effect he made use of the only power remaining to him and refused to apply his seal to the decrees authorising the forthcoming elections and the appointment of local governors and mayors. This move was welcomed by Ben Youssef, who demanded a ministerial reshuffle, but naturally alienated the Bey further from Bourguiba and his followers. He backed down and signed them the following day.Khalifa Chater, op. cit., Ben Youssef fled the country on 28 January and a crackdown followed on his followers in Tunisia, in which Bourguiba relied on the army, with its French officers, the airforce and heavy artillery. Horrified at this brutality, Lamine Bey renewed his ineffective protestations to Seydoux in April 1956. The only effect was to enrage Bourguiba, who hastened to the palace to accuse the Bey and his family of seeking to hinder the transfer of power from France to the Tunisian government.Béchir Turki, Éclairage sur les recoins s ombres de l'ère bourguibienne, éd. Clairefontaine, Tunis, 2011, On 20 March 1956 the Franco-Tunisian protocol was signed by the Grand Vizier Tahar Ben Ammar and the French Foreign Minister Christian Pineau.  King and Deposition (1956–1957)  Muhammad VIII and Bourguiba receiving the first French ambassador after independence, March 1956 The French protectorate in Tunisia officially ended on 20 March 1956. On the same day, the Kingdom of Tunisia was proclaimed and the Bey was proclaimed King of Tunisia. His reign, however, was to be short-lived. The 1956 Tunisian Constituent Assembly election saw a landslide victory for the National Union (an alliance between Neo Destour, the Tunisian General Labour Union, the National Union of Tunisian Farmers and the Tunisian Union of Craftsmen and Merchants) which won all 98 seats. Following the election, Muhammad VIII dismissed Prime Minister Tahar Ben Ammar and appointed Bourguiba as new head of government. The Constituent Assembly held its formal opening ceremony on 8 April 1956. It was a sign of the changing times that the King presided over the session dressed in the uniform of a marshal of the Ottoman Empire, whose subject he had been when he was born, but which had ceased to exist in 1922. He expected to be present during the debates leading to the election of a speaker of the Assembly, and Tahar Ben Ammar had to intervene to persuade him to leave. The King withdrew with ill grace.Ahmed Mestiri, op. cit., Muhammad VIII and Prime Minister Habib Bourguiba On 31 May a decree from the Constituent Assembly abolished all privileges, exemptions and immunities which had previously been accorded to the ruling family. They were now simply ordinary citizens.Décret du 31 mai 1956 sur les droits et obligations des membres de Notre Famille, Journal officiel de la République tunisienne, , 1er juin 1956, Although this abruptly ended the civil list payments to members of his family and placed the crown estate under government control, the King signed the decree without protest. Another decree on 21 June modified the national emblems and removed any reference to the Husainid dynasty;Décret du 21 juin 1956 sur les armoiries du Royaume, Journal officiel de la République tunisienne, , 22 juin 1956, another still, on 31 August, removed the King's prerogative to pass regulations, transferring this to the Prime Minister.Décret du 3 août 1956 modifiant le décret du 21 septembre 1955 relatif à l'organisation provisoire des pouvoirs publics, Journal officiel de la République tunisienne, , 3 août 1956, Further decrees followed, compelling the King to turn over various properties to the state, against the backdrop of a hostile press campaign highlighting the questionable, and perhaps even criminal, circumstances under which they had been acquired. These measures served to greatly reduce the remaining prestige of the King.Victor Silvera, « Le régime constitutionnel de la Tunisie : la Constitution du 1er juin 1959 », Revue française de science politique, vol. 10, , 1960, Nonetheless King Muhammad VIII was the first person to be honoured, on 19 December 1956, with the decoration of the new Order of Independence. He reciprocated on the same day by awarding Bourguiba the Nichan Iftikhar (for the second time).Khalifa Chater, op. cit., Bourguiba clearly had little remaining respect for the ruling family however. On 19 July, at Eid al-Fitr he made a protocol visit with his ministers to the King's wife, but refused to approach the throne. 'I have not come here as I did before, but as head of the government. You should step forward to meet me and not remain seated in your throne,' he declared.Mohamed Ben Salem, op. cit., On 15 July 1957 the Tunisian army replaced the Royal Guard around the palace, and thereafter the King effectively lost his freedom of movement. On 18 July his younger son Salah Eddine was arrested on charges falsified by the police.Ahmed Mestiri, op. cit., On 25 July 1957 the Constituent Assembly voted on a show of hands to abolish the monarchy, declare a Republic and make Bourguiba President. Straight away, a delegation headed by deputy speaker Ali Belhouane Interior Minister Taïeb Mehiri and Justice Minister Ahmed Mestiri went to the palace of Carthage to make the King aware of the decree and ask him to leave the palace along with his wife, their three sons, seven daughters and grandchildren. > 'We went into the throne room right away, and without being announced, as we > were already expected.

The whole thing > had not even lasted three minutes.'Ahmed Mestiri, op. cit.,  Confinement and death  The 75-year old Muhammad left his palace wearing a simple jebba of white linen and a pair of yellow Moroccan slippers, which he lost along the way. He was taken to the Hidaya palace in Manouba, an old abandoned beylical palace without water or electricity, which was assigned to him and several members of his family: his wife Lalla Djeneïna, their sons princes Chedly, M'hamed and Salah Eddine, princess Soufia, his son in law Mohamed Ben Salem and the Bey al-Mahalla Hassine Bey.Béchir Turki, op. cit., The furniture of their new dwelling was no more than a mattress on the floor, with no sheets or covers. Food was provided for the first three days, after which the family was left to fend for itself. Chedly and Ben Salem were transferred to the prison of Kairouan on 11 August.Mohamed Ben Salem, op. cit., Hassine, M'hamed and princess Soufia were freed several days later. The last son, Salah Eddine, was transferred to the civil prison in Tunis three months after his house arrest.Béchir Turki, op. cit., Alone in the ruined palace, the old couple were not allowed to leave until October 1958, as Lamine's health had deteriorated very badly. They were then transferred to a small villa in La Soukra with a kitchen, a bathroom and two other rooms and given a monthly allowance of 80 dinars, roughly the same as the salary of a secondary school teacher. They remained under house arrest and were forbidden even to go into the garden outside – indeed a policeman remained on duty actually inside the villa. Their daughter princess Soufia was allowed to visit them whenever she wished however.Béchir Turki, op. cit., On 8 September the trial of Tahar Ben Ammar came to an end, having worked up the public mood with accusations made, and later withdrawn, about the who possessed the jewels which had belonged to the Bey's wife, which had still not been found. Two years later, the search for the jewels was renewed and both the former King and his wife were summoned for interrogation. It may have been at this point that Salah Eddine, still confined in the civil prison of Tunis, was taken to his fther, imprisoned in the same building, to say farewell to him.Noura Borsali, Bourguiba à l'épreuve de la démocratie, éd. Samed, Sfax, 2008, Summoned to the national security headquarters Lamine's wife was interrogated relentlessly for three days to the point where she could no longer speak and suffered an apoplexyBéchir Turki, op. cit., as her son Salah Eddine recalled years later. 'As for mother, she never recovered from her arrest and most of all from the three days of interrogation on the fourth floor of the Ministry of the Interior, where the security forces questioned her endlessly about what happened to the family jewels. Whether she was maltreated or not, she came back with blood coming from her mouth and internal hemorrhages in her lower abdomen. She died later in my father's arms, still in shock, and without ever telling us what she had undergone during her interrogation.' Taken back to La Soukra in agony, she died two days later. She was buried in the cemetery of Sidi Abdelaziz in La Marsa, with her sons Salah Eddine and M'hamed present. Lamine was not allowed to leave his villa for the occasion. The public was also kept away from the burial by the police. Sidi Ali Ben Khodja, the Sheikh El Islam, was however allowed to enter the cemetery to pronounce the prayer for the dead. Several days later, the former King's house arrest was lifted. Lamine was allowed to go out into his own garden, and to visit the tomb of his wife. He left the villa in La Soukra and moved into the apartment of a Jewish friend in the Rue de Yougoslavie, who had already taken in Ahmed El Kassar, husband of Princess Soufia as well as the family of Prince Salah Eddine when they were expelled from the palace. When Prince Chedly was freed in 1961, he joined them in Tunis in the Rue Fénelon in Lafayette, in a two-room apartment which was placed under constant surveillance. Muhammad died on 30 September 1962 at the age of 81. He was buried in the cemetery of Sidi Abdelaziz next to his wife, unlike most rulers of his family who were interred in the mausoleum of Tourbet el Bey in the medina of Tunis. Sheikh Mohamed Tahar Ben Achour said the prayers over his body and a single photographer, Victor Sebag, recorded the event, and was held overnight in a police cell for doing so.Fayçal Bey, La dernière odalisque, éd. Stock, Saint-Armand-Montrond, 2001, He was succeeded as head of the Husainid Dynasty and titular king by Husain Bey. Family and private life He married Lalla Jeneïna Beya (1887–1960) in 1902, daughter of Bashir Ayari, a Tripolitanian merchant from the Ras Darb district of Tunis.

During the Cold War, missions consisted in assistance to \\"Free World\\" allies according to the Mutual Defense Assistance Act of 1949. Origins The Willauer Box CAT was created by Claire Chennault and Whiting Willauer in 1946 as Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) Air Transport. Using surplus World War II aircraft such as the C-47 Dakota and the C-46 Commando, CAT airlifted supplies and food into war-ravaged China. It was soon pressed into service to support Chiang Kai-shek and his Kuomintang forces in the civil war between them and the communists under Mao Zedong. Many of its first pilots were veterans of Chennault's World War II combat groups, popularly known as Flying Tigers. (Other of Chennault's veterans went on to form another air transport company, the Flying Tiger Line. This was a completely separate operation from Civil Air Transport and the follow-on Air America.) By 1950, following the defeat of Chiang's forces and their retreat to Taiwan, the airline faced financial difficulties. The CIA formed a private Delaware corporation called Airdale Corporation, which formed a subsidiary called CAT, Inc. The subsidiary corporation purchased nominal shares of Civil Air Transport. CAT maintained a civilian appearance by flying scheduled passenger flights while simultaneously using other aircraft in its fleet to fly covert missions. With the spread of communism throughout Southeast Asia, CAT's mission changed. Military operations =Chinese Civil War= During the Chinese Civil War, under contract with the Chinese Nationalist government and later the CIA, CAT flew supplies and ammunition into China to assist Kuomintang forces on the Chinese mainland, primarily using C-47 and C-46 aircraft. With the defeat of the Kuomintang in 1949, CAT helped to evacuate thousands of Chinese to Taiwan. =Korean War= During the Korean War, CAT airlifted thousands of tons of war materials to supply United States military operations, including support of Kuomintang holdouts based in Burma (Operation PAPER). On 29 November 1952, a CAT C-47 left Seoul on a mission to collect an anti-Communist Chinese agent in the foothills of northeastern China, using a \\"pole and line\\" technique. The mission was apparently compromised and Chinese forces were waiting for them. Approaching low over the ground, it was attacked by small-arms fire, and crash-landed near the town of Antu in China's Jilin province. The pilots, Robert Snoddy and Norman Schwartz were killed during the crash and subsequent fire, and were buried nearby. The two CIA officers, John T. Downey and Richard G. Fecteau survived and were immediately taken prisoner by Chinese forces, who were waiting for the flight. Downey and Fecteau were held by China and regularly interrogated for nearly twenty years. Fecteau was released unexpectedly following Nixon's visit to China in 1972, but Downey was released only after Washington publicly acknowledged their spy mission in 1973. At the time the families of the pilots were told, in order to keep the CIA's covert actions in China secret, that they had crashed into the Sea of Japan on a routine flight to Tokyo. In 2001, China allowed the US Defense Department's Prisoner of War and Missing in Action (POW/MIA) office to conduct a recovery effort for the bodies of the pilots. In 2005 the POW/MIA office announced that it had identified the remains of Robert Snoddy using DNA analysis. Schwartz's remains have not been recovered. The 1952-1953 edition of Jane's All The World's Aircraft lists the head office address as Suite 309, Kass Building, 711 14th Street, N.W., Washington, D.C., with the footnote that the company had reregistered in the U.S. The president is given as Whiting Willauer, and the fleet listed as 23 Curtiss C-46 Commando and 4 Douglas DC-3 aircraft. =First Indochina War= C-119 during the siege of Dien Bien Phu in May 1954. CAT transported supplies and troops for French operations during the First Indochina War as early as Operation Castor in November 1953. CAT assisted the French government at various times during its Indochina wars, flying supplies and equipment into Hanoi's Gia Lam airport and other fields using C-46 and C-47 transport planes. At the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, CAT supplied the French garrison by parachuting troops and supplies with covert USAF C-119 inscribed with French Air Force insignia. In February 2005, seven surviving CAT pilots out of the thirty-seven involved in the battle received the French Legion of Honor during a special ceremony at the French embassy in Washington. Two CAT pilots James B. McGovern, Jr. and Wallace Buford were killed in action during the siege of Dien Bien Phu in May 1954. They were the first American casualties of what was later termed the Vietnam War. McGovern's remains were recovered in 2002 and identified in 2006. The 1956-1957 edition of Jane's All The World's Aircraft lists the head office address as 46 Chung Shan Road, North, 2nd Section, Taipei, Taiwan (Formosa). The president and general manager is given as Hugh L. Grundy, with C.J. Rosbert listed as vice- president and assistant general manager. The fleet is listed as 2 Douglas DC-4, 22 Curtiss Commando, 2 Douglas DC-3, 3 Douglas C-47, and 2 Convair Catalina. In the 1958-1959 edition of Jane's, the last year in which the \\"Airlines of the World\\" section was carried, the home office address in Taiwan remained the same, but no company officers are listed. The fleet is given as 3 Douglas DC-4, 25 Curtiss C-46, 5 Douglas DC-3, 2 Convair Catalina, with 2 Douglas DC-6B on order. C-46D in Indochina. =PRRI/Permesta movement in Indonesia= In 1958 TIME reported that 20 CAT aircraft were supplying the PRRI/Permesta movement against President Sukarno's government of Indonesia, which the Eisenhower administration feared had communist sympathies.Time magazine, June 9, 1958 In April 1958 two CAT pilots flew combat missions for Permesta's Angkatan Udara Revolusioner (\\"Revolutionary Air Force\\") or AUREV. William H. Beale and Allen Pope flew CIA Douglas B-26 Invaders for AUREV. In May, Beale withdrew from the operation, by which time a third CAT pilot, Connie W Seigrist, had joined flying a CIA Consolidated PBY Catalina. The CIA directed Beale and Pope to target not only Indonesian armed forces but also unarmed foreign merchant ships, in order to frighten overseas trade away from Indonesian waters, thereby weakening the Indonesian economy and undermining Sukarno's government. On April 28, 1958, Beale attacked the Royal Dutch Shell terminal at Balikpapan in East Kalimantan, sinking the British tanker , while Pope off the port of Donggala near Palu in Central Sulawesi sank merchant ships from Greece, Italy and Panama. On May 18 west of Ambon Island, Pope attacked one of a pair of Indonesian merchant ships that were carrying government troops for a counter-offensive against Permesta. An Indonesian Air Force P-51 and anti-aircraft fire from the ships shot down the B-26, and Pope and his Indonesian radio operator were captured. The CIA had ordered the CAT pilots to fly \\"sterile\\", i.e. with no documents that could either identify them or link them with the US Government. However, Pope was carrying about 30 documents including his detailed flight log, secret orders for temporary deployment in Indonesia, military separation file and CAT identity card. Pope's capture with these documents immediately exposed the level of CIA support for the Permesta rebellion.Time, June 9, 1958 Embarrassed, the Eisenhower administration quickly ended CIA support for Permesta and withdrew its agents and remaining aircraft from AUREV. Early in 1960 an Indonesian military court tried Pope; in April it convicted him and sentenced him to death. However, in 1962 Robert F. Kennedy negotiated with President Sukarno, and in August that year the Indonesian authorities released Pope and returned him to the USA. =Vietnam War= In 1959 it was reorganized as Air America, which supported covert operations throughout Indochina during the Vietnam War (also known as the \\"Second Indochina War\\"), particularly in Laos. For further information see the article on Air America. =Post Vietnam War= After pulling out of South Vietnam in 1975, there was an attempt to keep a company presence in Thailand. After this fell through, Air America officially disbanded on June 30, 1976. Civil operations 1966 photo of a CAT Convair 880 at Taipei Songshan Airport CAT started to operate scheduled passenger services, beginning with international flights to Hong Kong, then to Japan, Korea, the Philippines and Thailand, as well as domestic routes within Taiwan. The granddaughter of Sun Yatsen, Nora Sun, became the youngest flight attendant to work for CAT. The first flights were carried out with C-46, then C-54 Skymaster aircraft. In 1958, CAT inaugurated DC-6B services. In 1961, CAT started to operate a Convair 880M, becoming the first airline to operate pure jet scheduled passenger services on regional routes in the Far East.. The Convair 880M was replaced by a Boeing 727 in January 1968. On 16 February 1968 the 727, flying from Hong Kong to Taipei, crashed near Linkou in northern Taiwan, ending 23 years of operations. The remnants of the cargo operation became Flying Tiger. Flying Tiger International merged to FedEx Inc.

Award Description The GUC requires a lesser degree of gallantry, determination and esprit de corps than that required for the Presidential Unit Citation (PUC). The unit must have performed with marked distinction under difficult and hazardous conditions in accomplishing its mission so as to set it apart from and above other units participating in the same conflict. The degree of heroism required is the same as that which would warrant award of the Silver Star to an individual. The GUC will normally be earned by units that have participated in single or successive actions covering relatively brief time spans. Only on rare occasions will a unit larger than a group qualify for the GUC. Extended periods of combat duty or participation in a large number of operational missions, either air or ground, is not sufficient.

As one of the first available open-source XML parsers, Expat has found a place in many open- source projects. Such projects include the Apache HTTP Server, Mozilla, Perl, Python and PHP. It is also bound in many other languages.  Timeline  Software developer James Clark released version 1.0 in 1998 while serving as technical lead on the XML Working Group at the World Wide Web Consortium. Clark released two more versions, 1.1 and 1.2, before turning the project over to a group led by Clark Cooper and Fred Drake in 2000. The new group released version 1.95.0 in September 2000 and continues to release new versions to incorporate bug fixes and enhancements.  Availability  GitHub hosts the Expat project. Versions exist for most major operating-systems.  Deployment  To use the Expat library, programs first register handler functions with Expat. When Expat parses an XML document, it calls the registered handlers as it finds relevant tokens in the input stream. These tokens and their associated handler calls are called events. Typically, programs register handler functions for XML element start or stop events and character events. Expat provides facilities for more sophisticated event handling such as XML Namespace declarations, processing instructions and DTD events. Expat's parsing events resemble the events defined in the Simple API for XML (SAX), but Expat is not a SAX-compliant parser. Projects incorporating the Expat library often build SAX and possibly DOM parsers on top of Expat. While Expat is mainly a stream-based (push) parser, it supports stopping and restarting parsing at arbitrary times, thus making the implementation of a pull parser relatively easy as well.

They were originally used for general farm work including cattle droving, sheep herding, and cart pulling, and nowadays as guard dogs and police dogs, as well as being kept as pets. The French name of the breed means, literally, \\"Cow Herder of Flanders\\", referring to the Flemish origin of the breed. Other names for the breed are Toucheur de Boeuf (cattle driver), Vlaamse Koehond (Flemish cow dog), and Vuilbaard (dirty beard). History An adult Bouvier des Flandres The monks at the Ter Duinen monastery were among the earliest known dog breeders in Flanders. The bouviers bred by them are recorded as having been bred from imports such as Irish wolfhounds and Scottish deerhounds with local farm dogs, until a breed considered to be the predecessor of the modern Bouvier des Flandres was obtained. This became a working dog able to perform tirelessly, herding and guarding cattle and even pulling cargo carts, thanks to its strength and temperament, and to withstand the local weather conditions due to its thick coat.Pollet, Robert (2003). Bouvier Des Flandres. Editorial Hispano-Europea. The breed's practical use became antiquated after the invention of the automobile, when cattle were more practically transported by trucks. Historically, the ear cropping and tail docking could have been done for practical reasons, avoiding accidental amputations in the course of work, or to indicate the dog was working stock and not a pet subject to taxation. Bouvier des Flandres closeup Up until the early 20th century, the breed was not completely defined, with three variants: Paret, Moerman or Roeselare, and Briard. Conflict between the proponents of these three variants held the breed's development back. In 1912 and 1913, several local kennel clubs recognized standards for Bouviers; however they usually had different standards for the Roeselare and other variants. World War I nearly caused the breed to disappear, due to the devastation that came over its region of origin and the fact that the dogs were used for military purposes. Indeed, Nic, a male trained as a trench dog who served during the war and was a perennial winner at dog shows after the war, is considered to be the founder of the early Bouvier des Flandres breed. A unified Bouvier des Flandres standard was created in 1936 by a joint French-Belgian committee. However, World War II again endangered the breed's existence. Due to these setbacks, progress was slowed, and it was not until 1965 that the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) breed standard, as agreed to by several minor kennel clubs, was adopted. Description Two Bouviers des Flandres =Appearance= The Bouvier is a powerfully built, compact, rough-coated dog of rugged appearance. It gives the impression of size and strength without clumsiness or heaviness. Perhaps its most notable feature is the impressive head which is accentuated by a heavy beard and mustache. Although the practice of cropping both ears and tail are now mostly cosmetic, tails were originally docked to prevent injuries caused by herding and cart-pulling. The practice of cosmetic docking is currently opposed by the American Veterinary Medical Association. In the area of origin (Flanders, Belgium) cropping was made illegal in 2006. The weight of males ranges from 80 to 120 pounds or 36 to 54 kilograms, slightly smaller for females. They are powerfully built, with a thick double coat, which can be fawn, black, grey brindle, or \\"pepper and salt\\" in color. Bouviers are sometimes considered non-shedding, but in fact do lose hair, like all dogs. Most of the hair that they lose is caught within the double coat which results in matting. They require weekly brushing and combing to maintain the coat. In addition to weekly brushing, the coat should be trimmed approximately every 3–5 weeks if it is to be a show dog. Trimming requires practice to achieve the proper look. =Temperament= An adult Bouvier A 3 month old Bouvier Bouviers des Flandres are rational, gentle, loyal, and protective by nature. The breed's particular blend of characteristics makes them good family pets, as well as keen guard dogs. Unlike some animals bred for aggressive nature and power, the Bouvier possesses sophisticated traits, such as complex control, intelligence, and accountability. The Bouvier des Flandres is an obedient dog with a pleasant nature. They look intimidating, but are actually calm and gentle. They are enthusiastic, responsible, even-tempered, and fearless, and are excellent guard and watchdogs that are easy to train. This breed learns commands relatively fast. However, Bouviers get bored easily and learn best when repetition is limited. They require well-balanced training that remains consistent in nature. Without being harsh, it is important to consistently make the dog aware that the owner will remain the boss. This breed needs an experienced owner to prevent dominance and over-protectiveness problems. These dogs poorly trained can become inappropriately dominant towards humans. An un- socialized Bouvier can become fearful and pose a problem when introduced to new situations in which they do not feel comfortable. Bouviers should be socialized well, preferably starting at an early age, to avoid shyness, suspiciousness, and being overly reserved with strangers (although the breed is naturally aloof with strangers). Protection of the family when danger is present is not something that needs to be taught, nor is it something one can train out of them. The dog will rise to the occasion if needed. A good family dog, the Bouvier likes, and is excellent with, children. The Bouvier is very adaptable and goes about its business quietly and calmly. Obedience training starts when they are young. Their behavior depends on the owner's ability to communicate what is expected, and on the individual dominance level of the dog. They are usually good with other dogs if they are raised with them from puppyhood. Dominant individuals can be dog-aggressive if the owners are not assertive and do not communicate to the dog that fighting is unwanted. Slow to mature both in body and mind, the Bouvier does not fully mature until the age of 2–3 years. =Activities= Bouviers des Flandres can compete in dog agility trials, carting, obedience, dog showmanship, Schutzhund, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Bouviers exhibiting basic herding instincts can then be trained to compete in herding trials.

Later, Graton published the albums by himself when he founded Graton éditeur in 1982. Michel Vaillant is the main character of the eponymous series, a French racing car driver who competes mainly in Formula One. The feature first appeared in Tintin magazine, where Jean Graton had already published a number of short stories about real- life sporting heroes. The series appeared in Tintin between 1957 and 1976, in France as well as in Belgium. An estimated 17 million copies of the series' albums have been sold worldwide. Publication history On February 7, 1957, Jean Graton created the character Michel Vaillant, with five short stories published in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine Tintin, with publication beginning June 12, 1957. With their positive reception, a full-length adventure was written and drawn by Graton, published in Tintin in 1959. The titles were first published in album format by Le Lombard until 1976, then by Dargaud until 1979, by Fleurus in 1979 and 1980, by Novedi in 1981 and 1982, and finally by Graton editeur, created and owned by Philippe and Jean Graton from 1983 on. In 1995, a new series was launched, the Dossiers Michel Vaillant series, with stories and information on important figures in motorsports and the automobile industry. In 2000, the Palmarès Inedit series was created, with early works and stories previously unpublished in books. In 2007, Studio Graton translated three titles into English: \\"The Great Challenge\\" (Tome 1), \\"China Moon\\" (Tome 68), \\"24 Hours Under the Influence\\" (Tome 70). In 2008, a new collection was launched by Le Lombard, named Integrale Michel Vaillant. This series plans to reprint all past adventures in 20 volumes of 200 pages, each volume grouping several stories. All the titles of the original series are to be reprinted, and many comments, dossiers and unpublished strips added. Jean Graton later left the writing to his son Philippe, gradually leaving the artwork to the Studio Graton, which he established. Since Graton stopped drawing the series himself, the graphic style has evolved, with Philippe Graton continuing with the writing and three artists providing the artwork. Philippe Graton admitted that the draftsmanship isn't as rigorous as it once was. Series overview Vaillante is a family-run French business which, in the beginning, was a transporting company. They also create their own trucks and cars and so decide to enter Formula One racing competition. In 1939, Henri Vaillant, a young driver, creates this new team. In the next seventy plus adventures, Michel Vaillant and the Vaillante race team compete in numerous races in Formula One and other driving competitions such as IndyCar, rallying or enduro challenges. Michel, Henri's son, is the main driver, his usual team- mate being the American, Steve Warson. The team is first managed by Henri Vaillant, then by Michel's older brother Jean-Pierre. Henri has remained the chairman of the Vaillante firm, but was replaced by Jean-Pierre when he retired. As the Vaillante firm grows, Vaillante's drivers, among them Michel, accumulate victories, but their success is either disrupted by rivals, by internal problems in the Vaillante team or by the \\"Leader\\", the greatest of Vaillante's enemies. Most of the adventures deal with motor racing life, but they also deal with the Vaillante team drivers' private lives, with concerns in the Vaillante firm and with various outside problems. Realism A Vaillante F1, designed by Michel Vaillant, as drawn by Jean Graton on the back cover of the most recent albumsThe comic is notable for depicting real-life motor racing background, featuring many real-life drivers, teams and personalities. Michel Vaillant competes in existing motor races and Grand Prix on real-life circuits. In the course of the series, the background in which the characters are featured evolves: the series' environment has always been updated, so that cars, teams and personalities have constantly changed.La Marque BD \\"Sport-Auto dans Michel Vaillant \\"Rétrospective des aventure F1 de Michel Vaillant\\" Graton's graphic style also aims at being realistic, as the illustrations are very technically accurate. Notably, Graton is recognized for the meticulous details he provides on cars illustrations.Saturday Morning Cartoons Michel Vaillant The numerous depictions of cars and circuits featured in the series are very specific and detailed; Graton used to personally attend races and circuits to take notes. Philippe Graton later continued this practice. Michel Vaillant's name is very similar to that of the birth name of automotive pioneer Karl Benz, which was Karl Friedrich Michael Vaillant. Realism is also expressed in the fictional background. Vaillant's factories and property are prominently featured in the series. The Vaillante firm is run as a real company, it has financial problems, must launch advertising campaigns and search for sponsors. It owns factories, which employs several engineers and mechanics that are realistically described and is shown employing several real-life drivers. The Vaillants own the familial domain \\"La Jonquière\\", located a short drive / cycle ride from the factory, and is home throughout the series to Henri and Elisabeth Vaillant. Michel and Jean Pierre lived there in the early books, before striking out on their own. As the context in which the characters evolved, Michel also is shown getting older. While he looked like a young man of about twenty years at the beginning of his adventures, he is seen progressively reaching middle-age. Recently his appearance is younger than previously. Other fictional characters are also shown getting older. In recent years, their general appearance has become steady. In spite of this he is still depicted as quite young for a man who has competed against drivers of multiple generations, including Juan Manuel Fangio, Graham Hill and Ayrton Senna. Characters 150pxMichel Vaillant is the main character of the series. Michel Vaillant is a complete driver and sportsman. His main occupation is to drive in the Formula 1 Championship. Michel is named world champion in four different albums. He also twice won the Indianapolis 500 and the 24 Hours of Le Mans four times. He also competed in rally races, winning the East African Safari and the Paris-Dakar. He participated in several stock-car, F2, F3 and GT races. He is also able to drive trucks and motorcycles, and practice football, gymnastics, tennis, judo and skiing very well. As a kind, serious, helpful, attentive, honest and generous man, Michel is very popular. His many abilities, his courage and his values, his kindness and his physical appearance make him a practically perfect hero, without any flaws. Françoise Vaillant is Michel's wife. She first appeared in 1963, as a teenager. At that time, she was a journalist for a newspaper owned by her father Louis Latour, a good friend of Henri Vaillant. In 1966, she appeared again, but as an older, attractive young woman. From that time on, she appeared in every album of the series and saw Vaillant more and more, until his family urged him to marry her. They married in 1974. Françoise has an important role in the series, and in some adventures she is the main character. Jean-Pierre Vaillant is Michel's older brother by six years. Like Michel, he started as a driver for the Vaillante team. He married Agnès de Chanzy, the daughter of Henri Vaillant's friend living in Argentina, in the very first album. But rapidly, he became more and more interested in managing the family team and to elaborate strategies for Formula One racing. He soon became the leader of the Vaillante society, replacing his father. Able to make difficult decisions, he also does not hesitate to launch ambitious projects. He has a son, Jean-Michel Vaillant, who is Michel's godson. Steve Warson is an American driver and Michel's best friend. He first appeared in the series in 1957. Steve has a different personality than Michel: he smokes, drinks, flirts, fights, and defies other drivers. Despite his several flaws, he is a good driver for the Vaillante team and a faithful teammate to Michel, even if his romantic adventures sometimes caused him to be Vaillante's occasional rival. His numerous girlfriends have included Ruth and Julie Wood. As good driver as Michel, he outdoes him in most rallying and American races. The \\"Leader\\" is a mysterious character who is the worst enemy of Vaillante and owner of the Leader team. The Leader team uses modern and advanced technology to compete against the Vaillante team in motor races. The team resorts to aggressive strategies to win races and uses dangerous drivers, such as Vince Hummer, Bob Cramer, Dan Hawkins and Donald Payntor. The leader was brought up by Buddhist monks. An ambitious and cruel man, he studied a form of Buddhism that gives him amazing powers, which he uses to try to dominate the motor industry. His first appearance was in the album \\"Mach 1 pour Steve Warson\\". Ruth alias Jo Barett is the Leader's daughter and was briefly Steve Warson's girlfriend. Before knowing her real origin, Ruth was a kind girl and friendly towards the Vaillante team. She became cruel and mean, taking over as the new Leader at her father's death, and tried to avenge him by fighting against his enemies. Henri Vaillant is Michel and Jean-Pierre's father. He began as a mechanic, then became a driver, created his own team and then became chairman of Vaillante. Rather authoritarian, he gave his two children a strict education. Later, he let his son Jean-Pierre take over as the leader and retired. His way of life remains modest, as chairman he went to work on a bicycle. A respectable man, close to his employees, he is very appreciated by them. Elisabeth Vaillant is Henri Vaillant's wife. She married him when he was a simple mechanic, but does not know anything about cars, motor racing, or mechanics. Julie Wood is an American motorcycle racer and at one time Steve Warson's girlfriend. An orphan, she was brought up by her uncle Chris, in California, with her two brothers, Indy and Phil. She is at ease in any kind of motorcycle race. Before her appearance in the Michel Vaillant series (in the album \\"Paris-Dakar\\"), she starred in her own series, Julie Wood, which ran for eight volumes, from 1976 to 1980. Yves Douleac is a driver for the Vaillante team. He lost his father, a truck driver for Vaillante at Marseilles, at 7. He was brought up by his mother and he was very admirative of Michel Vaillant, getting to know him personally and being employed as a driver. Courageous and proud, he later fell in love with Gabriele Spangenberg, and succeeded in marrying her despite his modest origin. Gabriele Spangenberg is a German female driver for the Vaillante team and Yves Douléac's girlfriend. Her father, of noble heritage, first opposed such a union, due to Yves's poor origin, but later gave his permission, in the face of Gabriele's determination. Bob Cramer is an American driver, Vaillante's enemy and a driver for the Leader team along with his friend and partner Dan Hawkins. A drunkard and a brawler, he is also aggressive in motor races where he caused a lot of crashes. Non-fictional characters As a driver evolving in the motor racing background, Michel Vaillant competes with many existing drivers, some of whom play an important part in the stories. Pierre Dieudonné appeared in some adventures as a driver for the Vaillante team. Drivers, most notably French and Belgians like Vanina and Jacky Ickx, François Cevert, Patrick Tambay, Thierry Boutsen, René Arnoux, Jean-Pierre Beltoise and Éric Bernard, have made appearances in the storylines. Gilles Villeneuve and Jacky Ickx are portrayed as good friends of Michel's as is Didier Pironi, and are the most recurring drivers of the series. Didier Pironi played an important part in the album: Un pilote a disparu (1980). Non-fictional team managers and journalists also appear regularly, as do some statesmen and celebrities. Michel himself is often seen being interviewed by real-life journalist Gérard \\"Jabby\\" Crombac.

The term is most commonly associated with treatment of the Dalit communities in the Indian subcontinent who were considered \\"polluting\\". The term has also been used to refer to other groups, including the Burakumin of Japan, the Baekjeong of Korea, and the Ragyabpa of Tibet, as well as the Romani people and Cagot in Europe, and the Al-Akhdam in Yemen Herbert Passin, \\"Untouchability in the Far East.\\" Monumenta Nipponica (1955): 247-267 online Traditionally, the groups characterized as untouchable were those whose occupations and habits of life involved ritually \\"polluting\\" activities, such as fishermen, manual scavengers, sweepers and washermen. In the medieval times, untouchables were also those who had eating habits like eating dead animals with diseases, in contrast to groups who supposedly followed higher standards of cleanliness. Untouchability has been outlawed in India, Nepal and Pakistan. However, \\"untouchability\\" has not been legally defined. The origin of untouchability and its historicity are still debated. B. R. Ambedkar believed that untouchability has existed at least as far back as 400 AD. A recent study of a sample of households in India concludes that \\"Notwithstanding the likelihood of under-reporting of the practice of untouchability, 70 percent of the population reported not indulging in this practice. This is an encouraging sign.\\"  Origin  B. R. Ambedkar with the leaders and activists of the All India Untouchable Women Conference held at Nagpur in 1942 B. R. Ambedkar, an Indian social reformer and politician who came from a social group that was considered untouchable, theorized that untouchability originated because of the deliberate policy of the upper-caste Brahmanas. According to him, the Brahmanas despised the people who gave up the Brahmanism in favour of Buddhism. Later scholars such as Vivekanand Jha have successfully refuted this theory. Nripendra Kumar Dutt, a professor of history, theorized that the concept of untouchability originated from the \\"pariah\\"-like treatment accorded to the aboriginies of India by the early Dravidians, and that the concept was borrowed by the Indo-Aryans from the Dravidians. Scholars such as R. S. Sharma have rejected this theory, arguing that there is no evidence that Dravidians practised untouchability before coming into contact with the Indo-Aryans. Austrian ethnologist Christoph von Fürer-Haimendorf theorized that untouchability originated as class stratification in urban areas of the Indus Valley Civilisation. According to this theory, the poorer workers involved in 'unclean' occupations such as sweeping or leather work were historically segregated and banished outside the city limits. Over time, personal cleanliness came to be identified with \\"purity\\", and the concept of untouchability eventually spread to rural areas as well. After the decline of the Indus Valley towns, these untouchables probably spread to other parts of India. Scholars such as Suvira Jaiswal reject this theory, arguing that it lacks evidence, and does not explain why the concept of untouchability is more pronounced in rural areas. American scholar George L. Hart, based on his interpretation of Old Tamil texts such as Purananuru, traced the origin of untouchability to ancient Tamil society. According to him, in this society, certain occupational groups were thought to be involved in controlling the malevolent supernatural forces; as an example, Hart mentions the Paraiyars, who played drums during battles and solemn events such as births and deaths. People from these occupational groups came to be avoided by others, who believed that they were \\"dangerous and had the power to pollute the others\\". Jaiswal dismisses the evidence produced by Hart as \\"extremely weak\\" and contradictory. Jaiswal points out that the authors of the ancient Tamil texts included several Brahmanas (a fact accepted by Hart); thus, the society described in these texts was already under Brahmanical influence, and could have borrowed the concept of untouchability from them. English merchant William Methwold who visited India during early seventeenth century says that he found certain castes who followed vegetarian diet, who had high standards of cleanliness practices he also found untouchable castes were those who ate dead animals even those with diseases. British anthropologist John Henry Hutton traced the origin of untouchability to the taboo on accepting food cooked by a person from a different caste. This taboo presumably originated because of cleanliness concerns, and ultimately, led to other prejudices such as the taboo on marrying outside one's caste. Jaiswal argues that this theory cannot explain how various social groups were isolated as untouchable or accorded a social rank. Jaiswal also notes that several passages from the ancient Vedic texts indicate that there was no taboo against accepting food from people belonging to a different varna or tribe. For example, some Shrauta Sutras mandate that a performer of the Vishvajit sacrifice must live with the Nishadas (a tribe regarded as untouchable in later period) for three days, in their village, and eat their food. Scholars such as Suvira Jaiswal, R. S. Sharma, and Vivekanand Jha characterize untouchability as a relatively later development after the establishment of the varna and caste system. Jha notes that the earliest Vedic text Rigveda makes no mention of untouchability, and even the later Vedic texts, which revile certain groups such as the Chandalas, do not suggest that untouchability existed in the contemporary society. According to Jha, in the later period, several groups began to be characterized as untouchable, a development which reached its peak during 600-1200 AD. Sharma theorizes that institution of untouchability arose when the aboriginal tribes with \\"low material culture\\" and \\"uncertain means of livelihood\\" came to be regarded as impure by the privileged classes who despised manual labour, and regarded associated impurity with \\"certain material objects\\". According to Jaiswal, when the members of aboriginal groups were assimilated into the Brahmanical society, the privileged among them may have tried to assert their higher status by disassociating themselves from their lower-status counterparts, who were gradually branded as untouchables. Untouchability is believed to have been first mentioned in Dharmashastra. According to the text, untouchables were not considered a part of the varna system because of their grievous sins, barbaric or unethical acts such as murder, harassment etc. Therefore, they were not treated like the savarnas (Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras). Characteristics Malabar, Kerala (1906). According to Sarah Pinto, an anthropologist, modern untouchability in India applies to people whose work relates to \\"meat, and bodily fluids\\". Based on the punishments prescribed in The Untouchability (Offences) Act, 1955 the following practices could be understood to have been associated with Untouchability in India: *Prohibition from eating with other members *Provision of separate cups in village tea stalls *Separate seating arrangements and utensils in restaurants *Segregation in seating and food arrangements at village functions and festivals *Prohibition from entering places of public worship *Prohibition from wearing sandals or holding umbrellas in front of higher caste members *Prohibition from entering other caste homes *Prohibition from using common village paths *Separate burial/cremation grounds *Prohibition from accessing common/public properties and resources (wells, ponds, temples, etc.) *Segregation (separate seating area) of children in schools *Bonded labour *Social boycotts by other castes for refusing to perform their \\"duties\\"https://www.indiacelebrating.comsocial-issuesuntouchability-in-india Government action in India At the time of Indian independence, Dalit activists began calling for separate electorates for untouchables in India to allow fair representation. Officially labeled the Minorities Act, it would guarantee representation for Sikhs, Muslims, Christians, and Untouchables in the newly formed Indian government. The Act was supported by British representatives such as Ramsay MacDonald. According to the textbook Religions in the Modern World, B. R. Ambedkar, who was also a supporter of the Act, was considered to be the “untouchable leader” who made great efforts to eliminate caste system privileges that included participation in public festivals, access to temples, and wedding rituals. In 1932, Ambedkar proposed that the untouchables create a separate electorate that ultimately led Gandhi to fast until it was rejected.Smith, David (2016). Woodhead, Linda; Partridge, Christopher; Kawanami, Hiroko, eds. Hinduism. New York: Routledge. p. 38-40. A separation within Hindu society was opposed by national leaders at the time such as Gandhi, although he took no exception to the demands of the other minorities. He began a hunger strike to protest this type of affirmative action, citing that it would create an unhealthy divide within the religion. At the Round Table Conferences, he provided this explanation for his reasoning: > I don't mind untouchables if they so desire, being converted to Islam or > Christianity. I should tolerate that, but I cannot possibly tolerate what is > in store for Hinduism if there are two divisions set forth in the villages. > Those who speak of the political rights of the untouchables don't know their > India, don't know how Indian society is today constituted and therefore I > want to say with all the emphasis that I can command that if I was the only > person to resist this thing that I would resist it with my life.Kumar, > Ravinder. \\"Gandhi, Ambedkar and the Poona pact, 1932.\\" South Asia: Journal > of South Asian Studies 8.1-2 (1985): 87-101. Gandhi achieved some success through his hunger strike. Dalit activists faced pressure from the Hindu population at large to end his protest at the risk of his ailing health. The two sides eventually came to a compromise where the number of guaranteed seats for Untouchables would be increased at both central and provincial levels, but there would be a common electorate. The 1950 national constitution of India legally abolished the practice of untouchability and provided measures for positive discrimination in both educational institutions and public services for Dalits and other social groups who lie within the caste system. These are supplemented by official bodies such as the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Despite this, instances of prejudice against Dalits still occur in some rural areas, as evidenced by events such as the Kherlanji massacre.

informally known as the Apology Resolution, is a Joint Resolution of the U.S. Congress adopted in 1993 that \\"acknowledges that the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii occurred with the active participation of agents and citizens of the United States and further acknowledges that the Native Hawaiian people never directly relinquished to the United States their claims to their inherent sovereignty as a people over their national lands, either through the Kingdom of Hawaii or through a plebiscite or referendum\\" (U.S. Public Law 103-150 (107 Stat. 1510)). The resolution has been cited as impetus for the Hawaiian sovereignty movement, and has been the subject of debate.The Opposite Of Progress, Slade Gorton and Hank Brownalohaquest.com, pro-sovereignty website The resolution was adopted by both houses of the United States Congress on November 23, 1993. A joint resolution, it was signed by President of the United States Bill Clinton on the same day. The resolution was passed in the Senate by a vote of 65–34. In the House, it was passed by a two-thirds voice vote. It was sponsored on January 21, 1993, as S.J.Res.19 by Daniel Akaka and co-sponsored by Daniel Inouye, both Democratic senators from Hawaii. Arguments for =Historical evidence= The Apology Resolution derives mainly from the Blount Report, which was compiled shortly after the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy (spring 1893). Blount found strongly in the favor of the queen and her supporters, and his report was an official criticism of the U.S. role in the overthrow. President Grover Cleveland was also strongly supportive of the Queen, and made official statements supporting the view held in the Blount Report. These official statements by the U.S. Government are seen as historical evidence for the claims made by the Apology Resolution. =Parallels between Native Hawaiians and Native Americans= Although the histories of Native Hawaiians and Native Americans are significantly different, there is still a widely held perception that Native Hawaiians have received similar kinds of unfair treatment from the U.S. Government as Native Americans. The Apology Bill is thus seen as a means of acknowledging historical grievances that they believe are valid. Some also see it as a step towards identifying Native Hawaiians as an indigenous people to preserve for them specific legal rights based on ancestry; some also see it as the beginning of a process to provide compensation or reparation to native Hawaiians for alleged past injustices. How this decision on the \\"nonsubstantive\\" nature of the Apology Resolution will affect the pursuit of the Akaka Bill, which has based itself on the Apology Resolution, is not yet clear. In 2009, the U.S. Congress passed a similar resolution, S.J.Res. 14, \\"To acknowledge a long history of official depredations and ill-conceived policies by the Federal Government regarding Indian tribes and offer an apology to all Native Peoples on behalf of the United States.\\" Arguments against =Disputed historical basis= Although the Blount Report of July 17, 1893, upon which the Apology Resolution was based, was an official report of the U.S. government, it was followed by the Morgan Report on February 26, 1894, which after public hearings and testimony under oath found the Blount Report to be mistaken on many of the facts reported. Some of the criticisms of the Blount Report included the fact that it was done in secrecy, with no opportunity for cross-examination of witnesses and no witnesses placed under oath. Opponents of the Apology Resolution point to this official repudiation of the Blount Report as sufficient reason to dismiss any conclusions based on it. Despite being staunchly in favor of reinstating the monarchy, President Grover Cleveland also reversed himself upon receipt of the Morgan Report, refusing requests from the queen for further aid in her restoration, and acknowledging both the Provisional Government and Republic of Hawaii as the legitimate successors to the Kingdom. Washington-based constitutional lawyer and Grassroot Institute of Hawaii consultant Bruce Fein has outlined a number of counterarguments challenging the historical accuracy and completeness of the assertions made in the Apology Resolution. =Allegations that the bill was rushed through= There has been criticism of the 1993 Apology Bill for its use in buttressing the Akaka Bill. The Apology Bill of '93 was passed with only one hour of debate on the Senate floor with only five senators participating, three opposed (Slade Gorton, Hank Brown, John C. Danforth) and two in favor (Akaka and Inouye). It passed the house on November 15 in less time with no debate and no objections. Senator Inouye, wrapping up the debate, said: The reliance upon the text of the Apology Resolution as justification for the Akaka Bill has been seen by some as contradicting Inouye's statements on the matter in 1993. In 1993, Senators Slade Gorton and Hank Brown did not take issue with the historical accuracy of the bill, although they voted against it. More recently they have described it as being a piece of historical revisionism. They wrote in the Wall Street Journal an article The Opposite Of Progress very critical of the historical veracity of the Apology Bill. =Advocates of Hawaiian independence= Some non-ancestry-based nationalist Hawaiian groups have accused Senators Akaka and Inouye of acting as accomplices of the U.S. in a long-term anti-Hawaiian strategy. These groups see the language of the Apology Resolution as deceptively conflating one accepted definition of sovereignty--which the Hawaiian Kingdom possessed as an internationally recognized nation-state--with another notion of the \\"inherent sovereignty\\" of an \\"indigenous\\" or \\"Native\\" people within, and subordinate to, the United States. They reason that citizenship in the Kingdom was not defined by ancestry; that an entire country was the victim of the conspirators' misdeeds, not merely certain individuals or groups; and that all loyal Hawaiian nationals were deprived of their right to self-determination, not just \\"Native\\" Hawaiians. They also point out that it was the U.S. Congress that introduced blood quota requirements in the first place, in the Hawaiian Homelands Commission Act of 1921, over the opposition of their ancestors. Accordingly, most of these groups also reject the Akaka Bill, saying that the proper arena for redress is at the international level. Practical legal effect In a response to the State of Hawai'i Appeal of the Arakaki Decision, the plaintiffs argued that the \\"whereas\\" clauses should not be given legal effect. In testimony before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary, April 17, 2002, Professor of Law Mr. Michael Glennon makes clear the fact that whereas clauses in general can have \\"no binding legal effect\\": The legal effect of the Apology Resolution was addressed in the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court of March 31, 2009, which held that the 37 \\"whereas\\" clauses of the Apology Resolution have no binding legal effect, nor does it convey any rights or make any legal findings for native Hawaiian claims.https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/08pdf/07-1372.pdf The Court concluded that the Resolution does not change or modify the \\"absolute\\" title to the public lands of the State of Hawai'i. The decision also affirmed that federal legislation cannot retroactively alter a title given as a part of statehood in general.

Social policy consists of guidelines, principles, legislation and activities that affect the living conditions conducive to human welfare, such as a person's quality of life. The Department of Social Policy at the London School of Economics defines social policy as \\"an interdisciplinary and applied subject concerned with the analysis of societies' responses to social need\\", which seeks to foster in its students a capacity to understand theory and evidence drawn from a wide range of social science disciplines, including economics, sociology, psychology, geography, history, law, philosophy and political science. The Malcolm Wiener Center for Social Policy at Harvard University describes social policy as \\"public policy and practice in the areas of health care, human services, criminal justice, inequality, education, and labor\\". Social policy might also be described as actions that affect the well-being of members of a society through shaping the distribution of and access to goods and resources in that society.Social Policy in Aotearoa New Zealand: A Critical Introduction (2005) by Christine Cheyne, Mike O'Brien, & Michael Belgrave - Page 3 Social policy often deals with wicked problems.Rittel, H. & Webber, M. (1973). Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning. Policy Sci 4:155-169. The discussion of 'social policy' in the United States and Canada can also apply to governmental policy on social issues such as tackling racism, LGBT issues (such as same-sex marriage) and the legal status of abortion, guns, euthanasia, recreational drugs and prostitution. In other countries, these issues would be classified under health policy and domestic policy. The study of social policy can either be a specialization as part of a public policy degree, such as at McGill University, Balsillie School of International Affairs, Harris School of Public Policy, and the Hertie School of Governance, or as a stand alone degree in social policy such as the University of York, Princeton University, and the University of Pennsylvania. History The earliest example of direct intervention by government in human welfare dates back to Umar ibn al- Khattāb's rule as the second caliph of Islam in the 6th century. He used zakat collections and also other governmental resources to establish pensions, income support, child benefits, and various stipends for people of the non- Muslim community. In the West, proponents of scientific social planning such as the sociologist Auguste Comte, and social researchers, such as Charles Booth, contributed to the emergence of social policy in the first industrialised countries following the Industrial Revolution. Surveys of poverty exposing the brutal conditions in the urban slum conurbations of Victorian Britain supplied the pressure leading to changes such as the decline and abolition of the poor law system and Liberal welfare reforms. Other significant examples in the development of social policy are the Bismarckian welfare state in 19th century Germany, social security policies in the United States introduced under the rubric of the New Deal between 1933 and 1935, and the National Health Service Act 1946 in Britain. Social policy in the 21st century is complex and in each state it is subject to local and national governments, as well as supranational political influence. For example, membership of the European Union is conditional on member states' adherence to the Social Chapter of European Union law = Other = Types Lady Justice depicts justice as equipped with three symbols: a sword symbolizing the court's coercive power; a human scale weighing competing claims in each hand; and a blindfold indicating impartiality.Luban, Law's Blindfold, 23 Social policy aims to improve human welfare and to meet human needs for education, health, housing and economic security. Important areas of social policy are wellbeing and welfare, poverty reduction, social security, justice, unemployment insurance, living conditions, animal rights, pensions, health care, social housing, family policy, social care, child protection, social exclusion, education policy, crime and criminal justice, urban development, and labor issues. United States social policy U.S. Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan was the first major U.S. political figure to incorporate formal social policy into official government decisions, a champion of social justice. Bryan is pictured in 1908. Social Security Administration headquarters is in Woodlawn, Maryland. The United States was a pioneer in generous social spending (relative to comparable countries), as it provided substantial social spending for Civil War veterans and their families. However, the United States would go on to lag behind other advanced industrial democracies in social spending. Religious, racial, ideological, scientific and philosophical movements and ideas have historically influenced American social policy, for example, John Calvin and his idea of pre- destination and the Protestant Values of hard work and individualism. Moreover, Social Darwinism helped mold America's ideas of capitalism and the survival of the fittest mentality. The Catholic Church's social teaching has also been considerably influential to the development of social policy. United States politicians who have favored increasing government observance of social policy often do not frame their proposals around typical notions of welfare or benefits; instead, in cases like Medicare and Medicaid, President Lyndon Johnson presented a package called the Great Society that framed a larger vision around poverty and quality of life. Insurance has been a growing policy topic, and a recent example of health care law as social policy is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act formed by the 111th U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama, a Democrat, on March 23, 2010. Moreover, former president Franklin D. Roosevelt's ground breaking New Deal is a paragon example of Social Policy that focused predominantly on a program of providing work and stimulating the economy through public spending on projects, rather than on cash payment. The programs were in response to the Great Depression affecting the United States in the 1930s. An American education policy proposal from a Republican president is the No Child Left Behind Act. This Act took effect on January 8, 2002, and was put in place to raise standards in education so different individuals can have better educational outcomes. The No Child Left Behind Act requires every state to assess students on basic skills to receive federal funding. However, this Act did not create a national standard since each state develops their own set of standards and assessments. Critics of most all social policies point toward a depiction of a welfare state on the make of a Hobbesian Leviathan.

Graton created the famous character Michel Vaillant and the eponymous series in 1957. Biography Graton was born in Nantes, France, in 1923. He moved to Brussels in 1947 and worked there in animation and advertising companies. He was hired by Spirou magazine in 1952, for which he illustrated Belles Histoires de l'Oncle Paul. Determined to create and draw his own characters, he got a job for Tintin magazine. From 1953, he published his own stories in Tintin. Some consisting of a few strips, and most related to sports and automobiles, were published in 1957 by Le Lombard in an album entitled Ca c'est du sport!. In 1957, Graton created the character Michel Vaillant. Some short comics were published in Tintin and acquired huge popularity. As soon as 1959, a full album was published by Le Lombard. In 1966, Graton created the Les Labourdet series with his wife, Francine, and published it between 1967 and 1970 in the Chez Nous magazine. In 1972, he created Julie Wood, a character who starred first in her own series, then in the Michel Vaillant series. In 1982, Graton started, with his son Philippe Graton, his own publishing house, Graton Editeur. He launched, with Phillippe Graton, the Dossiers Michel Vaillant series in 1995, each album of which being dedicated to a famous driver. In 2000, they created the Palmarès Inedit series, made up of comics that were drawn by Graton in the 1950s and 1960s, including the Labourdet series, as well as comics that had not been published before. In 2004, Graton, at the age of 80, decided to retire and to stop drawing. His works are continued by Philippe Graton and the Studio Graton, which he created himself. Graphic style The huge popularity of Graton's series is partly due to their extreme realism. Graton's works, particularly the Michel Vaillant series, are notable for featuring real-life people, drivers, teams, races, and places. Graton is widely recognized as a great automobile and motorsport drawer. The several descriptions of places, circuits, and cars he gave in his series are highly well-documented, specific, and realistic.

He is credited with laying the foundation of Muslim rule in the Indian subcontinent, which lasted for several centuries. He reigned over a territory spanning over parts of modern-day Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Northern India, Pakistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. Mu'izz ad-Din took the city of Ghazni in 1173 to avenge the death of his ancestor Muhammad ibn Suri at the hands of Mahmud of Ghazni and used it as a launching-pad for expansion into northern India.Encyclopedia Iranica, Ghurids, C. Edmund Bosworth, Online Edition 2012, (LINK) In the meantime, he assisted his brother Ghiyath in his contest with the Khwarazmian Empire for the lordship of Khorasan in Western Asia. In 1175, Mu'izz captured Multan from the Hamid Ludi dynasty, and also took Uch in 1175. He also annexed the Ghaznavid principality of Lahore in 1186, the last haven of his Persianised rivals. After the death of Ghiyath in 1202, he became the successor of the Ghurid Empire and ruled until his assassination in 1206. A confused struggle then ensued among the remaining Ghuri leaders, and the Khwarizmi were able to take over the Ghurid Sultanate in about 1215. Though the Ghurids' empire was short-lived, and petty Ghurid states remained in power until the arrival of the Timurids, Mu'izz's conquests laid the foundations of Muslim rule in India. Qutbu l-Din Aibak, a former slave (Mamluk) of Mu'izz, was the first Sultan of Delhi.  Early life  Mu'izz ad-Din Muhammad was born in 1149 in the Ghor region of Khorasan. The exact date of his birth is unknown. His father, Baha al-Din Sam I, was the local ruler of the Ghor region at the time. Mu'izz also had an elder brother named Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad. During their early life, Mu'izz and Ghiyath were imprisoned by their uncle Ala al-Din Husayn, but were later released by the latter's son Sayf al-Din Muhammad.History of Civilizations of Central Asia, C.E. Bosworth, M.S. Asimov, p. 186. When Sayf died in 1163, the Ghurid nobles supported Ghiyath, and helped him ascend the throne. Ghiyath shortly gave Mu'izz control over Istiyan and Kajuran. However, the throne was challenged by several Ghurid chiefs; Mu'izz aided Ghiyath in defeating and killing a rival Ghurid chief named Abu'l Abbas.  Early campaigns  Ghiyath was then challenged by his uncle Fakhr al-Din Masud, who claimed the throne for himself, and had allied with Tadj al-Din Yildiz, the Seljuq governor of Herat, and Balkh. However, the coalition was defeated by Ghiyath and Mu'izz at Ragh-i Zar. The brothers managed to kill the Seljuq governor during the battle, and then conquered Zamindawar, Badghis, Gharjistan, and Urozgan. Ghiyath, however, spared Fakhr al-Din and restored him as the ruler of Bamiyan. Mu'izz, after returning from an expedition from Sistan, was shortly awarded with Kandahar by his brother. In 1173, the two brothers invaded Ghazni, and defeated the Oghuz Turks who had captured the city from the Ghaznavids. Mu'izz was then appointed as the ruler of Ghazni. In 1175, the two brothers conquered Herat from its Seljuq governor, Baha al-Din Toghril, and also managed to conquer Pushang. The ruler of Sistan, Taj al-Din Harb ibn Muhammad, shortly acknowledged the sovereignty of the Ghurids, and so did the Oghuz Turks dominating Kirman.Encyclopedia Iranica, Ghaznavids, Edmund Bosworth, Online Edition 2007, (LINK ) During the same period, the Khwarazmian Sultan Shah, who was expelled from Khwarezm by his brother Tekish, took refuge in Ghor and requested military aid from Ghiyath. Ghiyath, however, did not help the latter. Sultan Shah managed to get help from the Kara-Khitan Khanate, and began plundering the northern Ghurid domains.  Invasion of India  After having helped his brother in expanding the western frontiers of the Ghurid Empire, he began to focus on India. Mu'izz's campaign against the Qarmatians rulers of Multan in 1175 had ended in victory.Andre Wink, Al-Hind: The Making of the Indo-Islamic World, Vol. 2, 244. He turned south, and led his army from Multan to Uch and then across the desert towards the Chaulukya capital of Anhilwara (modern day Patan in Gujarat) in 1178. On the way, Muizz suffered a defeat at the Battle of Kayadara, during his first campaign against an Indian ruler.Andre Wink, Al-Hind: The Making of the Indo-Islamic World, Vol. 2, (Brill, 2002), 143. Gujarat was ruled by the young Chaulukya ruler Mularaja II; the Chaulukya forces included the armies of their feudatories such as the Naddula Chahamana ruler Kelhanadeva, the Jalor Chahamana ruler Kirtipala, and the Arbuda Paramara ruler Dharavarsha. Mu'izz's army had suffered greatly during the march across the desert, and the Chaulukyas inflicted a major defeat on him at the village of Kayadara (near to Mount Abu, about forty miles to the north-east of Anhilwara). The invading army suffered heavy casualties during the battle, and also in the retreat back across the desert to Multan. However, Mu'izz was able to take Peshawar and Sialkot. In 1186, Mu'izz, along with Ghiyath, ended the Ghaznavid dynasty after having captured Lahore and executed the Ghaznavid ruler Khusrau-Malik.The Iranian World, C.E. Bosworth, The Cambridge History of Iran, Vol. 5, ed. J. A. Boyle, John Andrew Boyle, (Cambridge University Press, 1968), 161–170.Rediscovery Of India, The: A New Subcontinent By Ansar Hussain Khan, Ansar Hussain Published by Orient Longman Limited Page 54Ghaznavids, C.E. Bosworth, Encyclopedia Iranica Mu'izz shortly returned to Ghor, and along with the rulers of Bamiyan and Sistan, aided his brother Ghiyath in defeating the forces of Sultan Shah at Merv in 1190. He also annexed most of the latter's territories in Khorasan. = First Battle of Tarain = A sign post in Sohawa pointing towards the direction of Mu'izz's Tomb In 1191, Mu'izz proceeded towards Indian Sub- continent through the Khyber Pass in modern-day Pakistan and was successful in reaching Punjab. Mu'izz captured a fortress, Bathinda in present-day Punjab state on the northwestern frontier of Prithvīrāj Chauhān's kingdom. After appointing a Qazi Zia-ud-Din as governor of the fortress,Cambridge History (Page 40) he received the news that Prithviraj's army, led by his vassal prince Govind Tai were on their way to besiege the fortress. The two armies eventually met near the town of Tarain, 14 miles from Thanesar in present-day Haryana. The battle was marked by the initial attack of mounted Mamluk archers to which Prithviraj responded by counter-attacking from three sides and thus dominating the battle. Mu'izz mortally wounded Govind Tai in personal combat and in the process was himself wounded, whereupon his army retreated and Prithvīrāj's army was deemed victorious. According to Rima Hooja and Kaushik Roy, Govind Tal was wounded by Ghori, and later fought at the second battle of Tarain, where he was killed. = Second Battle of Tarain = On his return to Ghor, Mu'izz made preparations to avenge the defeat. According to Firishta, the Rajput army consisted of 3,000 elephants, 300,000 cavalry and infantry (most likely a gross exaggeration).Satish Chandra, Medieval India: From Sultanat to the Mughals (1206–1526), 25. Minhaj-i-Siraj, stated Mu'izz brought 120,000 fully armored men to the battle in 1192.Satish Chandra, Medieval India: From Sultanat to the Mughals (1206–1526), 25. Prithviraj had called his banners but hoped to buy time as his banners (other Rajputs under him or his allies) had not arrived. Before the next day, Mu'izz attacked the Rajput army before dawn. Rajputs had a tradition of fighting from sunrise to sunset. Although they were able to quickly form formations, they suffered losses due to surprise attack before sunrise. The Rajput army was eventually defeated and Prithviraj was taken prisoner and subsequently executed.A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East, Vol. I, 263. = Further campaigns = When the state of Ajmer failed to fulfill the tribute demands as per the custom after a defeat, Qutbu l-Din Aibak, in 1193 took over Ajmer and soon established Ghurid control in northern and central India. Hindu kingdoms like Saraswati, Samana, Kohram and Hansi were captured without any difficulty. Finally his forces advanced on Delhi, capturing it soon after the Battle of Chandwar, defeating Raja Jaichand of Kannauj.Kaushik Roy, Military Manpower, Armies and Warfare in South Asia, (Taylor & Francis, 2013), 42. Within a year, Mu'izz controlled northern Rajasthan and the northern part of the Ganges-Yamuna Doab. The Kingdom of Ajmer was then given over to Golā, on condition that he send regular tributes to the Ghurids. Mu'izz returned west to Ghazni to deal with the threat to his western frontiers from the unrest in Iran, but he appointed Aibak as his regional governor for northern India. His armies, mostly under Turkic and Khalaj generals such as Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji, continued to advance through northern India, raiding as far east as Bengal. Followed by his conquest of Delhi. An army led by Qutbu l-Din Aibak, Mu'izz's deputy in India, invaded in ca. 1195–97 and plundered Anahilapataka.Sailendra Nath Sen, Ancient Indian History and Civilization, (New Age International, 1999), 327.  War with the Khwarezmians and supreme leader of the Ghurids  In 1200, Tekish died, and was succeeded by Muhammad II of Khwarezm (who took the honorific name 'Ala' al-Din). Among the first to hear of this were Ghiyath and Mu'izz al-Din. Within weeks the two brothers had moved their armies westwards into Khorasan. Once they had captured Nishapur, Mu'izz al-Din was sent on an expedition towards Ray, but he let his troops get out of control and got little further than Gurgan, earning criticism from Ghiyath which led to the only reported quarrel between the brothers.Ahmad Hasan Dani et al. History of civilizations of Central Asia, vol. IV, Delhi, Motilal Banarsidass Pub. (1999) , p182Enc. Islam, article: Muhammad, Mu'izz al-Din Ghiyath died at Herat in 1202 after months of illness. Mu'izz, who had quickly returned to Ghor from India, obtained the support of Ghurid nobles, and was crowned as Sultan of the Ghurid Empire at Firuzkuh. Just after his ascension, Muhammad II invaded his domains, and besieged Herat. Mu'izz managed to repel him from Herat and then pursued him to Khwarezm, besieging Gurganj, their capital. Muhammad desperately requested aid from the Kara-Khitan Khanate, who sent an army to aid Muhammad. Mu'izz, because of the pressure from the Kara-Khitans, was forced to relieve the siege and retreat. However, on his way to his domains in Ghur, he was defeated at Andkhud in 1204.A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle, Vol. I, ed. Spencer C. Tucker, (ABC-CLIO, 2010), 269.Farooqui Salma Ahmed, A Comprehensive History of Medieval India: From Twelfth to the Mid-Eighteenth Century, (Dorling Kindersley Pvt., 2011), 53–54. Mu'izz, however managed to reach Ghur, and prepared a counter-attack against the Khwarmezians and Kara- Khitans. A revolt shortly broke out in Punjab and the surrounding regions, which forced Mu'izz to make order in the region before mounting a counter- attack against his enemies.  Final days and death  Muhammad Ghori's grave within his tomb near Jhelum In 1206, Mu'izz, having settled the affairs in India,Michel Biran, The Empire of the Qara Khitai in Eurasian History, (Cambridge University Press, 2005), 70. left all the affairs in India in hands of his slave Qutbu l-Din Aibak. On his way back to Ghazni, his caravan rested at Dhamiak near Sohawa (which is near the city of Jhelum in the Punjab province of modern-day Pakistan). He was assassinated on March 15, 1206 while offering his evening prayers. His killers are unconfirmed. It may have been the Khokhars or Ismāʿīlīs. One source states that he was assassinated by the Nizari Ismaili AssassinsNajeebabadi, History of Islam Vol.3 (1922), p.284 In Indian folklore, the death of Mu'izz was caused by Prithviraj Chauhan,Prithviraj, a valorous hero par excellence, has been depicted in the lofty style which has been a source of inspiration to and influence on the North-Indian people. Krishnadatt Paliwal (1988) \\"Epic (Hindi)\\" In Datta, Amaresh (1988) The Encyclopaedia Of Indian Literature: Volume Two: Devraj to Jyoti, Sahitya Akademi, New Delhi, India, page 1178, but this is not borne out by historical documents and Prithviraj died much earlier before the death of Mu'izz.Whatever may be their arguments, one cannot deny that the Prithviraj Raso remains a great piece of Hindi literature.

Many of his competent and loyal slaves rose to positions of importance in Mu'izz's army and government. When a courtier lamented that the Sultan had no male heirs, Mu'izz retorted: > \\"Other monarchs may have one son, or two sons; I have thousands of sons, my > Turkish slaves who will be the heirs of my dominions, and who, after me, > will take care to preserve my name in the Khuṭbah (Friday sermon) throughout > these territories.\\" Mu'izz's prediction proved true. After his assassination, his Empire was divided amongst his slaves. Most notably: * Qutbu l-Din Aibak became ruler of Delhi in 1206, establishing the Sultanate of Delhi, which marked the start of the Slave dynasty. * Nasir-ud-Din Qabacha became ruler of Multan in 1210. * Tajuddin Yildoz became ruler of Ghazni. * Ikhtiyar Uddin Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khilji became ruler in parts of Bengal.  Legacy  * A mausoleum for Muhammad Ghori was built at his gravesite in Dhamiak by Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan in 1994-1995 and was later handed over to the Punjab archaeology department. * Pakistani military named three of its medium- range ballistic missile Ghauri-I, Ghauri-II and Ghauri-III, in the memory of Mu'izz. * Notes  References  Sources    Further reading  * *A History of India By August Friedrich Rudolf Hoernle, Herbert Alick Stark *The history of India from the earliest ages By James Talboys Wheeler *Outline of Indian history By Sri Ram Sharma * Elliot, Sir H.

In Canada, he was a member of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada and the Executive Council of the Province of Canada. He held the offices of Solicitor General of Canada, Minister of Public Works and Minister of Finance. In the United Kingdom, he held the offices of Receiver General of the Duchy of Cornwall and Privy Counsellor. In 1872, he was created 1st Baronet Rose, of Montreal. His eldest son inherited the title and in 1909, his second son, Sir Charles Day Rose, was created 1st Baronet Rose of Hardwick House in his own right. His home from 1848, Rosemount, was in Montreal's Golden Square Mile. From 1872, he lived in England at Loseley Park. Early life in Scotland John Rose was born 2 August 1820, at Gask, near Turriff, Aberdeenshire. He was the son of William Rose (b. 1792), of Gask, and Elizabeth (d. 1822), daughter of Capt. James Fyfe.History of Turriff John's father, William, was a great-grandson of Hugh Rose (d. 1755), 16th Laird of Kilravock Castle and Chief of Clan Rose. The estate of Gask had passed to John's father through his ancestor, Lt.-General Alexander Forbes (d. 1672), 10th Lord Forbes.Forbes/Rose Peerage John Rose was educated at Udny Academy and King's College, Aberdeen. Career Rear view of Rosemount House in Montreal's Golden Square Mile. Built by Sir John Rose in 1848, it was his home until 1872. In 1836, he immigrated to Huntingdon, Quebec, in what was then Lower Canada, where he was active in suppressing the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837. He was admitted to the bar in 1842 and established a commercial practice in Montreal. From 1857 until 1867, he was a member of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada, and he was a member of the Executive Council from 1858 until 1861. He was Lower Canada's Solicitor General from 1857 to 1858 and from 1858 to 1859, and he also acted as various times as commissioner of public works and Receiver General. In 1864, the British government appointed him to the commission to settle claims under the Oregon Treaty with the United States. Rose was elected to the House of Commons of Canada for the electoral district of Huntingdon, Quebec on 20 September 1867, and was later appointed Minister of Finance in the government of Sir John A. Macdonald. He resigned from Parliament on 29 September 1969, to return to private life with the banking firm of Morton, Rose and Co. Rose was a delegate to the Colonial Conference in London in 1867 and again in 1868. In 1869, Rose moved to England to practice law and acted as an unofficial representative of the Canadian government. His was one of the first missions of a partly diplomatic nature which Canada ever sent abroad. He was sent partly because his was perceived as being \\"gentlemanly\\" enough for the world of London politics. He worked for Canada's interests in trade and immigration, and lobbied for Canada's viewpoint on matter of Anglo-American relations. In this function, he answered directly to the Prime Minister of Canada, Sir John A. Macdonald, since it was an informal position and was therefore not under the purview of the Governor General, meaning that communications could be kept secret from the Imperial Government. As well, Canada did not have a foreign affairs department at the time. This unusual situation did lead to a tradition of direct executive involvement in foreign affairs in Canada which still exists. He also sat on a number of Royal Commissions in Britain and became a baronet in 1872, and a member of the Imperial Privy Council in 1886. Following his passing in 1888, Sir John Rose was interred in Guildford, England, near the Loseley Park estate, which he had rented for some years. Family Grave at Mount Cemetery in Guildford. He was succeeded by his elder son Sir William Rose, 2nd Baronet. His granddaughters Mrs. Edith Mary Bibby and Mrs. Baird were two of the noted beauties of the day, and their portraits by Fildes, R.A.

Background In 1893, pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the monarchy and formed the Republic of Hawaii, which the U.S. annexed in 1898. In 1921, in order to make amends for injustices associated with the overthrow and annexation, the US created the Hawaiian Homes Commissions Act which set aside 200,000 acres of land for the use of homelands for Native Hawaiians of 50% blood quantum or more. It was meant to create some compensation for forced colonization of the indigenous peoples, but in 1959 Hawaii was officially adopted as the fiftieth state of the US, with the Statehood Admissions Act defining \\"Native Hawaiian\\" as any person descended from the aboriginal people of Hawaii, living there prior to 1778. The Ceded lands (lands once owned by the Hawaiian kingdom monarchy) were transferred from the federal government to the State of Hawaii for the \\"betterment of the conditions of the native Hawaiians\\". In 1978 the Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA) was created in response to the growing Hawaiian sovereignty movement of the 1970s to manage that portion of the ceded lands allotted to Hawaiian Homelands, advance the lifestyle of Native Hawaiians, preserve Hawaiian culture and protect Native Hawaiian rights. It was established during the 1978 state constitutional convention Government funding has created programs, schools, scholarships and teaching curriculums through OHA. Many of these organizations, agencies and trusts like OHA, have had a good deal of legal issues over the years. In the US Supreme court case; \\"Rice v. Cayetano\\", OHA was accused of violating the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the United States constitution with voting provisions that were raced based. The court found for the plaintiff that OHA had violated the fifteenth amendment. OHA has also been questioned for programs and services to Hawaiians of less than the fifty percent, required blood quantum (The minimum requirement to qualify for Hawaiian Homelands). Board of trustees The Office of Hawaiian Affairs is governed by an elected board of nine trustees. The constitution provides an outline of that board, \\"There shall be a board of trustees for the Office of Hawaiian Affairs elected by qualified voters who are Hawaiians, as provided by law. The board members shall be Hawaiians. There shall be not less than nine members of the board of trustees; provided that each of the following Islands have one representative: Oahu, Kauai, Maui, Molokai and Hawaii. The board shall select a chairperson from its members. The board of trustees provision was amended upon a United States Supreme Court ruling in the case of Rice v. Cayetano that non-Hawaiians could not be excluded from the election process, including the right of non-Hawaiians to run for such an office. Trustees are elected to a four-year term by general election of Hawaii registered voters. The board of trustees generally meets twice a month. The constitution adds, \\"The board of trustees of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs shall exercise power as provided by law: to manage and administer the proceeds from the sale or other disposition of the lands, natural resources, minerals and income derived from whatever sources for native Hawaiians and Hawaiians, including all income and proceeds from that pro rata portion of the trust referred to in section 4 of this article for native Hawaiians; to formulate policy relating to affairs of native Hawaiians and Hawaiians; and to exercise control over real and personal property set aside by state, federal or private sources and transferred to the board for native Hawaiians and Hawaiians. The board shall have the power to exercise control over the Office of Hawaiian Affairs through its executive officer, the administrator of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, who shall be appointed by the board. On January 30, 1989 the board of trustees agreed that salaries should be consistent with other departments of the State of Hawaii.

It was created by Roderick Taylor as a sort of Lost in Space on Earth. Taylor gave himself a cameo role in each episode. The series was later shown in reruns on the Sci Fi Channel. Series overview In the first episode, the Sterling family (Hal, June, Trace, Gina, Smith) take a tour of the interior of the Great Pyramid of Giza at the same time as a once-in-ten-thousand-years conjunction of the planets. Inside, they are abandoned by their guide, and as they try to get out, they are mysteriously transported to another planet which may or may not be in a parallel universe. On this other planet (called 'Thel'), which is inhabited by humans, there are no familiar countries or states. The area they are in is divided up into self-contained \\"Zones,\\" each with a wildly different style of government and way of life, although the province of \\"Imar\\" (ruled by a Praetor) appears to be the central seat of government for this entire Earth. Most of Thel's history is not revealed, although the pilot episode contains references to 'territories', android creators, and 'wars of unification'. It is thus unknown whether Thel is an alternate universe version of Earth, or another planet entirely. Travel between Zones is so strictly regulated to the point that no one can travel outside their home zone province (save for the Zone troopers), and all maps have been banned by the state. Thus, the inhabitants of each zone know absolutely nothing about life in other areas. The family could not know about the travel ban, and approach a soldier (the first Thel native they met) in all innocence, seeking help, while the soldier - Kommander Nuveen Kroll, reputed to be the worst, and most ill-tempered of all Zone Troopers - views them as lawbreakers and treats them as such. When Hal insists they need help, Kroll attempts to arrest them and gets rough with Smith, the youngest of the Sterling sons. The Sterlings resist and, in the struggle, Kroll's sidearm weapon goes off, the blast rendering him unconscious. The Sterlings take his access crystal, (which is possessed only by Zone Trooper officers, and which gives them security access to state- controlled equipment and information data banks) his vehicle, and his sidearm and drive away. For the rest of the series, Kroll is resolute in his attempts to recover his crystal, capture the Sterlings (whom, in a report to his superior, he would later regard as a band of \\"armed terrorists\\") and subject them to severe punishment. The Sterling family's first night in Thel is spent in a province called Sarlax. This province is an ages old mining colony where sophisticated androids labor at mining a radioactive mineral named \\"Sarlax\\". The mineral is just radioactive enough to make humans sick which necessitates the android labor force. The androids are sophisticated enough to have created a culture of their own and are related to the once ancient robots that ruled Thel in the past. It is here that a friendly android couple gives the Sterlings a historical book called \\"The Book of Imar\\" which chronicles the history of not just the planet but the androids and the culture of Thel. The Church of Artificial Intelligence is the official state religion of Thel, and no conflicting ideologies are permitted. Very few actual details about this religion are known, except that it appears to be centered on the worship of robots, computers and cybernetic technology (adherents are, in one episode, said to use \\"Worship Modules\\" which are electronic in nature). There is mention in the first episode of a race of humans that created primitive robots and then died out. Eventually the robots evolved themselves through continued upgrades and modifications until they created what is known as a plasmoid being: an android that was a biomechanical equivalent of a true human in almost every aspect. These plasmoids were so in love with their creators that they even built in lifespans into their being so that they would be able to emulate death much like their onetime human masters. Eventually they began the process of recreating humans by a process that is not explained but once again Thel was populated by a majority of human lifeforms. A series of Egyptian-like stone markers (Obelisks), each with one eye, are supposed to mark the way to Imar, a city with beautiful buildings and a suspension bridge (the city shown in the opening credits, apparently intended to be Imar, is a photographic negative of New York City). Each episode has the family dealing with the bizarre ways of life in each \\"Zone,\\" and at the end of the episode, fleeing one Zone for another, pursued by Commander Kroll (Jonathan Banks) and his Zone Troopers. Kroll is intent on revenge, given that the Sterlings stole his high security access crystal, acquired during their disastrous encounter in the first episode. Contact with Earth was evident by several references to Earth history: * Nova tells Trace in the pilot episode (\\"Rules of Attraction\\") that there are 77 independent provinces. * References to Egyptian mythology abound, particularly in the signposts which the Sterlings use to attempt to find Imar; it was implied that the ancient Egyptians either had the ability to travel between universes, or had contact with a people that did. * The episode \\"Village of the Motorpigs\\" featured a retired Zone Trooper who shows the Sterlings a United States dollar and says that his grandfather came from Earth. *It was also said that those that traveled from Thel to Earth used the pyramid and all-seeing-eye as a form of hidden message about the gateway to Thel. * Another episode (\\"Princess Metra\\") takes place in a zone called Metraplex. The Zone's former leader, Kelly Bradford (since deceased), came from Earth; When seeing Gina, who resembles Kelly Bradford and wears a similar necklace made of an American half-dollar, they believe that Kelly Bradford has returned. Before appointing her the new leader, she is quizzed on Earth historical events by Metraplex officials - the quiz having been written by Kelly Bradford. In this episode, we learn that time passes at a different rate on Thel and Earth; Kelly is from Earth of the 1960s, yet her time on Thel was over 200 years ago. * As mentioned, Imar appears to be the alternate universe's version of New York City, an image of which is used in the opening credits of the show to depict Imar. *A friendly android couple give the Sterlings a book containing the history of Thel called \\"The Book of Imar\\", which serves as a historical window on many of the provinces the Sterlings find themselves staying in. =Technology in Otherworld= Though Thel had many similarities to Earth of the 1980s, there was quite a bit of advanced technology displayed throughout the series. First, a state religion was the unifying ideology of the land. The Church of Artificial Intelligence, a rigid, computer based ideology without equal, the church wields powers of censorship, worship and could even put people to death in cases of heresy. The Church of Artificial Intelligence, however, may be just a means for the government to add one more measure of control to the everyday lives of the peoples of Thel. Computational machines were advanced enough in Thel that certain facilities were maintained and monitored by artificial intelligences that substituted for human control when humans were busy with other concerns. For example, the Sarlicon brain was an ancient but artificially intelligent computer tasked with the safekeeping of the memories of the android population of Sarlax. The computer was subject to humans with high level access crystal keys but could defend itself from human attempts to circumvent the machine's operations. In Thel there also existed robot technology that allowed android design including androids so advanced they were indistinguishable from flesh and blood humans. These advanced androids are known as \\"Plasmoids\\" and they occupy the province of Sarlax serving as miners that can tolerate the minerals' radiation. Access crystals were the method of securing high level databanks, travel, power sources and other high security areas of Thel. The crystal was basically a faceted glass appliance, several centimeters long, purplish in color, with a series of electronic chips and components inside. They are individually numbered and have the \\"mark of Imar\\" engraved on the bottom. Though not fully discussed in the series, it might have operated by being optically read or perhaps the electronics were of an RFID type. The crystal was read by a reader that simply allowed insertion of the crystal less than halfway into its interface shaft. A light would illuminate the crystal as it was being accessed and most readers were shown tied to computer terminals but in some cases they were freestanding units not unlike keyholes and used to secure doors. It was mentioned in the pilot that Kroll possessed a \\"class 1\\" access crystal, which is possibly the highest access class. What the lower class crystals' abilities were was never revealed. It was mentioned in the episode \\"Metraplex\\" that advanced electronic entertainments known as \\"wave games\\" and \\"gratification intensifiers\\" existed. How these devices functioned was never revealed but it was also mentioned in the same episode that the province also produced \\"particle beam\\" weaponry had access to a \\"disintegration chamber\\" and subjugated an entire underclass population with \\"Vibratory Behavior Modification Modules\\". In another episode, weapons called \\"electrum bolts\\" are mentioned; they are supposedly deadly and exotic in what they do to living tissue. The state soldiers, the Zone Troopers, are armed with a sidearm known as a \\"bioruptor\\". Bioruptors are sleek, black tubes with a rear-facing pistol grip at the butt end and are held with the barrel flipped from a natural pistol fashion with the trigger on top of the pistol grip. A single switch on the side of the bioruptor barrel serves as a \\"safety\\" to prevent accidental discharge. Though the devices could be quite deadly in the right hands, the weapons were capable of being adjusted from a light stun to a kill setting. The weapon's bright blue laser-like beams were said to affect the heart so they could be an electrical discharge type of weapon. There also exists in Thel the ability for rudimentary holographic video which is used not only as entertainment but for education and telepresence communications. In the pilot episode we see a vehicle that sounds and looks like a hovercraft of some kind, however there also exists combustion engine technology as seen in the episode \\"Village of the Motor Pigs\\". Though it is suggested in the episode \\"Rock and Roll Suicide\\" that wind-powered turbines may exist (the father designed windmill blades) there is probably more than one source of energy available to the various provinces of Thel. In addition to these, we also were shown advanced biological research that could stop the aging process as well as weather control and shielding that can protect from laser storms.

Underwood (\\"Blu\\") and Jenny McLaren (Autobahn's sister). Their music is characterised by fast electronic beats, heavy reliance upon samples and the repetition of the name drop \\"the Cuban Boys\\" in the background of many of their tracks. They achieved success after being aired on John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show with sample-heavy dance tracks and cut-ups and were responsible for the UK No. 4 hit single \\"Cognoscenti vs. Intelligentsia\\" which was released through EMI. Band formation The Cuban Boys formed in 1998 using the Internet as a publicity and collaboration tool from the outset. After a web- only release of an anonymous dance track, \\"Diophantus Arithmetica\\", with hints that it was by Noel Gallagher, they recorded \\"Oh My God! They Killed Kenny\\" (later retitled \\"Kenny\\"), which featured sampled dialogue from South Park combined with \\"The Bump\\" by Kenny. This was played extensively by John Peel and took the 6th position in the 1998 Festive Fifty.BBC: Festive Fifty 1998 Following this it was released as the band's first single.BBC: The Cuban invaders A six-track EP, Blueprint for Modernisation, followed. A track from this EP, \\"Cuban Boy (Cuban Boys Go Boom! Mix)\\", went on to be used as the theme music for the BBC sitcom Still Game. \\"Cognoscenti vs. Intelligentsia\\" The Cuban Boys' next single, \\"Cognoscenti vs. Intelligentsia\\" was built on a sample used from \\"Whistle Stop\\" by Roger Miller which was featured in the Disney movie Robin Hood. It was first featured online as part of the Hampster Dance song on the website of the same name. The same sample was later used as the basis for the song \\"Irritating Hamster\\" by DJ Mavica, then as part of the Cuban Boys' hit (a close but noticeably different imitation of the original sample was used in the final release, as the licensing fees could not be met). \\"Cognoscenti vs. Intelligentsia\\" became a No. 4 hit in the UK in December 1999, following months of speculation and rumours - all of which turned out to be false - that the men behind the Cuban Boys project were in fact Paul Weller and Noel Gallagher of Oasis. Either way, the track received many requests for play on radio, and was heavily hyped as a contender for the Christmas number one spot. Upon release, the single peaked at No. 4 on the Christmas chart, outsold only by Westlife, Cliff Richard (with \\"The Millennium Prayer\\"), and a re-release of John Lennon's \\"Imagine\\". It also took the number one position in the 1999 Festive Fifty.BBC: Festive Fifty 1999 The Cuban Boys co-wrote Atomic Beat Boy with Helen Love, released as a CD single, followed by a 12\\" remix EP 'Helen Love Vs Cuban Boys: Does Your Heart Go Boom'. Eastwood In 2000, the Cuban boys released their first album, Eastwood, through EMI but, despite the popularity of \\"Cognoscenti vs. Intelligentsia\\", Eastwood suffered poor sales. It was not released in time to capitalise on the success of \\"Cognoscenti vs. Intelligentsia\\" and was given limited marketing. Some of the older tunes featuring unauthorised samples had them replaced by obvious imitations. Following the commercial failure of Eastwood, the band were dropped by the label and left with some bitterness, later expressed through their releasing of a 7\\" cover version of the Sex Pistols' \\"EMI\\". Later work Commercially, little was heard of the band itself after Eastwood, although they released several limited release singles and EPs. The band focused mainly on Internet downloads, and made much of their early discography available free of charge from their various websites and on Myspace. All the members became involved in other projects and although the Cuban Boys never formally split up, the band ceased to be active around 2001. Its members continued to work together under various names, most notably Spray. Following the death of John Peel in 2004, the Cuban Boys (now consisting only of Skreen B and Ricardo Autobahn) reformed to release a tribute song, \\"The Nation Needs You\\",BBC: Cuban Boys as a free download.Cuban Boys Discography Following this, they returned to producing individual tracks, releasing some of them as download-only or limited release CD singles. In 2008, they released their first full album since Eastwood, The Satellite JunkyardTeletext UK: Review of The Satellite Junkyard on their own record label, House of Beauty. In 2010, the Cuban Boys released a greatest hits compilation of their singles. Art vs Commerce amounted to twenty one tracks, and was released once again on House of Beauty Records. The cover for the CD consists of a booklet with new artwork and a detailed history of the band. Their third album, Machines was released in 2017.

It supports a variety of executable formats for different processors and operating systems. It also can be used as a debugger for Windows PE, Mac OS X Mach-O, and Linux ELF executables. A decompiler plug-in for programs compiled with a C/ compiler is available at extra cost. The latest full version of IDA Pro is commercial, while an earlier and less capable version is available for download free of charge (version 7.0 ).IDA Pro 7.0 Freeware version download IDA performs automatic code analysis, using cross-references between code sections, knowledge of parameters of API calls, and other information. However, the nature of disassembly precludes total accuracy, and a great deal of human intervention is necessarily required; IDA has interactive functionality to aid in improving the disassembly. A typical IDA user will begin with an automatically generated disassembly listing and then convert sections from code to data and vice versa, rename, annotate, and otherwise add information to the listing, until it becomes clear what it does. Created as a shareware application by Ilfak Guilfanov, IDA was later sold as a commercial product by DataRescue, a Belgian company, who improved it and sold it under the name IDA Pro. In 2005, Guilfanov founded Hex-Rays to pursue the development of the Hex-Rays Decompiler IDA extension. In January 2008, Hex- Rays assumed the development and support of DataRescue's IDA Pro. Scripting \\"IDC scripts\\" make it possible to extend the operation of the disassemble. Some helpful scripts are provided, which can serve as the basis for user written scripts. Most frequently scripts are used for extra modification of the generated code. For example, external symbol tables can be loaded thereby using the function names of the original source code.

Grant was one of the first four black MPs and the constituency was one of the centres of the London Afro- Caribbean community. However, Grant's widow Sharon (who was white) declared her intention to seek selection and this split opinion within the local Labour Party. Both Sharon and Bernie Grant had been on the left-wing of the party whereas the leading black contender for the nomination, David Lammy, was a supporter of Tony Blair. After a close-fought selection battle, Lammy was chosen. During the campaign, Sharon Grant made a public show of supporting his election campaign in order not to allow disunity in the Labour Party. Polling day in the by-election was on 22 June, when Lammy comfortably retained the seat for Labour on a low turnout. Neither of the other main party candidates was able to mount a credible challenge in a seat where Labour was so strongly ahead, with Liberal Democrat candidate and future Chippenham MP Duncan Hames finishing second, and Conservative candidate and future Battersea MP Jane Ellison coming third. All three candidates from the Labour, Conservative and Lib Dem parties in this by-election would go on to become MPs. Lammy won and became the MP for Tottenham a seat he holds to this day, Lib Dem Duncan Hames became the MP for Chippenham in 2010, losing in 2015 and Jane Ellison became the MP for Battersea in 2010, losing in 2017.

AUT was the second established technical university in Iran (Khajeh Nasir Toosi University of Technology is the oldest technical university in Iran), and is referred to as the \\"Mother of Engineering Universities\\". Acceptance to the university is competitive, and entrance to undergraduate and graduate programs requires scoring among the top 1% of students in the Nationwide University Entrance Exams, known as \\"Konkour\\". The university was founded in 1928 as a standard academy, and developed to the university of technology by Habib Nafisi in 1956, after that extended by Dr. Mohammad Ali Mojtahedi, during the Pahlavi dynasty. Named the Tehran Polytechnic, it began with five engineering departments. Six months before the victory of 1979 Iranian Revolution, Tehran Polytechnic was renamed after the Iranian prime minister Amir Kabir (1807–1852). The university now has 15 science and engineering departments, and three other affiliated centers, located in Garmsar, Bandar Abbas and Mahshahr. Around 9,100 students are enrolled in the undergraduate and graduate programs.

It was created as a joint venture between Universal Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment in response to the popularity of Napster. Universal and Sony created PressPlay rather than joining RealNetworks' online service MusicNet, which had signed BMG, EMI and AOL Time Warner. It was originally announced under the name Duet in May 2001 and launched as PressPlay in December 2001. Apart from Universal and Sony, the service carried some music from BMG, EMI and Warner, as well as various independent labels. It was branded for multiple services, most notably Yahoo.com. The service allowed users 500 low-quality audio streams in DRMed Windows Media Audio, 50 song downloads and 10 songs burnt to CD, for $15 a month. It could also build and store users' playlists. Not every song could be downloaded, and users could not burn more than two tracks from the same artist to CD. Downloads expired after 30 days. Songs could not be transferred to a portable player. Artists were paid around $0.0023 (0.23 of a cent) per song. Many artists, outraged at this rate and stating their songs were being used without proper permission, sought to have their music removed from the service unless they were paid a licensing fee rather than a CD-style royalty. Even before it was launched, the restrictions meant the service was not attractive to consumers. PressPlay and rival MusicNet were given the shared 9th place in PC World's 2006 list of the \\"25 Worst Tech Products of All Time\\", which stated that \\"the services' stunningly brain-dead features showed that the record companies still didn't get it\\". Universal and Sony had also licensed at least a portion of their catalog to other, more successful online music stores such as Streamwaves' Christian music service HigherWaves, FullAudio and Streamwaves' full product. Roxio acquired the service on May 19, 2003 and used it as a base to launch their paid music service under the brand name Napster.

The course includes three phases of instruction involving U.S. Army rotary wing aircraft: combat air assault operations; rigging and slingloading operations; and rappelling from a helicopter. According to the United States Army Institute of Heraldry, \\"The Air Assault Badge was approved by the Chief of Staff, Army, on 18 January 1978, for Army-wide wear by individuals who successfully completed Air Assault training after 1 April 1974. The badge had previously been approved as the Airmobile Badge authorized for local wear by the Commander of the 101st Airborne Division, effective 1 April 1974.\\" The division had been reorganized from parachute to airmobile in mid-1968 in Vietnam and designated the 101st Airborne Division (Airmobile). The parenthetical designation changed to Air Assault on 4 October 1974 and the name of the badge was likewise changed. History Original Air Assault Badge LTG (R) Hal Moore wearing the original Air Assault Badge On 7 February 1963, the colors of the 11th Airborne Division were reactivated at Fort Benning, GA, as the 11th Air Assault Division (Test). The 11th was a small unit, never intended for deployable status, and used to test the airmobile concept then under development. Units of the 2d Infantry Division, also located at Fort Benning, were “borrowed” for large-scale airmobile tests and maneuvers. An earlier Air Assault Badge, pictured on the right, was worn in the early 1960s by troops of 11th who qualified for it by making three helicopter rappels from and three from . Soldiers were also required to be knowledgeable of aircraft safety procedures; familiar with aircraft orientation; proficient in hand and arm signals and combat assault operations; able to prepare, inspect and rig equipment for external sling loads; and able to lash down equipment inside helicopters. The badge was first awarded in early 1964 and was only authorized for wear by soldiers within the 11th, as it was a division award and not authorized for Army-wide wear by the Department of the Army. On 30 June 1965 the 11th Air Assault Division was inactivated and its assets merged with the 2d Infantry Division to become the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile). The colors of the 2d Infantry Division were sent to Korea where the existing 1st Cavalry Division was reflagged as 2d Infantry Division and the colors of the 1st Cavalry Division sent to Fort Benning. Shortly thereafter the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) was sent to Vietnam. Maj. Jack R. Rickman is credited with the design of the Air Assault Badge when he was in 1971 on tour with the 101st Airborne Division in Vietnam. He thought little of the outcome of the design assignment, given to him by a division operations officer, which the Army adopted officially in January 1978. He was made aware of his part in the badge design years later when he recognized his design work seen in a published photograph. He never earned a badge himself.Army Times, 16 March 1981. The design was influenced by the Parachutist BadgeQualification Badges, Parachutists Badge, U.S. Army Institute of Heraldry, dated 24 January 1950, last accessed 16 October 2020 worn when the division was on jump status, as well as the Glider BadgeQualification Badges, Glider Badge, U.S. Army Institute of Heraldry, dated 2 June 1944, last accessed 16 October 2020 worn by glider units during World War II. Charles Bloodworth, a pathfinder officer in the 101st during the early 1970s, wrote, \\"Locally designed and fabricated, the badge was deliberately crafted to mimic the glider wings of WWII. The nose of the Huey took the place of the glider body, and the horizontal rotor blade was the spitting image of the glider wing.\\" The 101st returned from Vietnam to Fort Campbell, Kentucky and the 173rd Airborne Brigade was inactivated with its assets transferred to form the division's 3rd Brigade, at the time was on jump status. The remainder of the division was organized as Airmobile. In February 1974, Major General Sidney B. Berry, Commanding General, signed Division General Order 179 authorizing the wearing of the Airmobile Badge effective 1 April 1974, the same date that the 3rd Brigade would terminate its jump status. Bloodworth describes the transition of the post-war division to fully Air Assault and the adoption of the Air Assault Badge in his article titled, \\"History of the 101st (Post-Vietnam).\\"History of the 101st (Post- Vietnam), airassault.bizhosting.com, last accessed 15 May 2017 Training Student at Fort Hood traverse one of the obstacles during Day Zero.

This course consists of the following phases of training:Lifestyle, Air Assault School, goarmy.com, last accessed 15 May 2017 * Day Zero: Candidates must successfully complete an obstacle course and a two-mile run before they are officially considered “Air Assault Students.” * Day One: Candidates will undergo a six-mile march, followed by a strict inspection. * Combat Assault Phase: During this three-day phase, candidates will learn aircraft safety and orientation, along with the principles of aero-medical evacuation, pathfinder operations, and combat assault operations among several other topics. Soldiers will be given a written and “hands-on” test following this phase. * Slingload Operations: During the second three-day phase of Air Assault School, candidates will learn how to rig equipment onto rotary aircraft with a sling, an operation that generally requires the loading soldier to hook a tether to the underbelly of a helicopter hovering just a few feet above the ground. Typical loads can range anywhere from 1,000 to 8,000 pounds. Trainees must pass a written and hands-on test before moving to the next phase. * Rappelling Phase: In the third and final three-day phase of Air Assault training, soldiers receive basic instruction on ground and aircraft rappelling procedures. By the end of the phase, trainees must complete two rappels from a 34-foot tower and two rappels from a UH-60, hovering at 70-90 feet. * Graduation Day: Soldiers must complete a 12-mile foot march in full gear plus a rucksack in less than three hours. Graduates are awarded the Air Assault Badge and the \\"2B\\" Additional Skill Identifier (ASI) upon completion of the march. =Training locations= Formal air assault training has been conducted at Fort Campbell, Kentucky by the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) since the Air Assault School was formed in 1974. During the early stages of the occupation of Iraq in late 2003, the division conducted a course in-theater to maintain Air Assault proficiency. Air Assault training is also offered by the Army National Guard (ARNG) Warrior Training Center at Fort Benning, which conducts training both at the post and at a variety of other locations throughout the United States by means of Mobile Training Teams. A III Corps Air Assault School was announced for Fort Hood that was to start in June 2012.

Vietnam veterans of the 101st Airborne Division and 1st Cavalry Division have sought the retroactive award of the Air Assault Badge for their training and pioneering experience in combat, but the Army has yet to grant their request. =Background trimmings= Air Assault Badge with background trimming of 3rd Battalion, 187th Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division When the 101st Airborne Division was converted to air assault, it adopted the wear of the cloth background trimming (ovals) that are used to identify active airborne units --that is worn behind the U.S. Army's Parachutist Badge-- vice those who have earn their Parachutist Badge but are not assigned to an active airborne unit. According to DA PAM 670-1, \\"a background trimming is authorized for organizations designated (by structure, equipment and mission) 'Airborne' or 'Air Assault' by Headquarters, Department of the Army.

The rationale given by The Institute of Heraldry was that units outside of the 101st Airborne Division did not have an \\"air assault mission.\\" The reason various ARNG units were organized according to the Air Assault Modified Table of Organization and Equipment (MTOE) was because such units were authorized fewer personnel and less equipment, thus making them less expensive to operate and maintain. They were not organized with actual air assault missions in mind.A letter dated 1 April 2004 from Colonel Paris M. Mack, Chief, R&R; Task Force, Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff G-1 to Lieutenant Colonel Steven Goff, Commander, 1st Battalion, 184th Infantry. Air Force wear All of the military services can and do send personnel to the U.S. Army's Air Assault School, but only the Air Force allows for the Air Assault Badge to be worn on the uniform. For several decades only USAF personnel attached to the 101st Airborne Division were allowed to wear the badge, and only at that duty assignment, paralleling US Army policy from 1974 to 1978 for Army soldiers; however, as of the 17 January 2014 update to AFI36-2903 (USAF uniform regulations), U.S. Air Force personnel are authorized to wear the Air Assault Badge along with other special skill badges they have earned through the other Uniformed Services. This means that only the Army and the Air Force authorize their personnel to wear the Air Assault Badge on their uniforms upon graduation of the Air Assault Course.U.S. Air Force Instruction 36-2903: Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel, Secretary of the Air Force, dated 17 January 2014, last accessed 20 June 2014AF uniform policy update: welcome back morale T-shirts, badges and limitless athletic shoes, U.S. Air Force News, dated 20 January 2014, last accessed 20 June 2014Airmen Vie for Slots in Army Air Assault Course, U.S. Air Force Official Website, dated 7 February 2011, last accessed 20 June 2014Official USAF Photo of Maj.

The original release included versions for Apple II, Atari 8-bit family, TRS-80, and IBM PC compatibles (both as a booter and for MS-DOS). The Atari ST and Commodore 64 versions were released in 1985. A version for CP/M was also released. Although Planetfall was Meretzky's first title, it proved one of his most popular works and a best-seller for Infocom; it was one of five top- selling titles to be re-released in Solid Gold versions including in-game hints. Planetfall utilizes the Z-machine originally developed for the Zork franchise and was added as a bonus to the \\"Zork Anthology\\". The word planetfall is a portmanteau of planet and landfall, and occasionally used in science fiction to that effect. The book Planetfall written by Arthur Byron Cover, uses the game image on the cover, and is marketed \\"In the bestselling tradition of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\\" A sequel, Stationfall, was released in 1987. Plot The game starts with the user assuming the role of a lowly Ensign Seventh Class on the S.P.S. Feinstein, a starship of the Stellar Patrol. Overbearing superior Ensign First Class Blather assigns the player to mop decks, not exactly the glorious adventures promised by the recruiters on Gallium. In the diary provided in the \\"feelies\\", the player is on the verge of deserting ship. But a sudden series of explosions aboard the ship sends the player scrambling for an escape pod, which eventually crash- lands on a nearby planet. There are signs of civilization, but curiously no traces of the beings that once lived there. Eventually encountering a helpful but childlike robot named Floyd, the player must unravel the mysteries of the single deserted structure on the planet, Resida, and find a way to get back home. As the fate of the planet's former inhabitants becomes clearer, a time limit also imposes itself. The adventurer does not remain on S.P.S. Feinstein for long. Talking to the alien ambassador and performing the assigned task of scrubbing the floor don't accomplish much. Wandering to other parts of the ship merits demerits from Blather and an ultimately fatal run-in with the Brig unless the player returns to work. Soon, an explosion occurs and an escape pod door opens. The pod safety netting breaks the player's fall and an escape kit is produced, which proves critical to survival. With great exertion, the adventurer swims out of the pod and climbs up to a mysterious deserted base. By putting together various clues, slowly the player realizes that the nearly uninhabited island is in fact one of the last remaining landmasses on a planet on the verge of destruction. A deadly plague for which no cure existed threatened to kill off all inhabitants of the world. The inhabitants initiated a planetwide project to place everyone under suspended animation while automated systems of robots and computers worked towards finding a cure. Once the cure was found, the inhabitants could be revived. By the time the player arrives, it is clear that the project is on the edge of success, but the planet itself is on the verge of destruction. The planetary orbit has decayed, leading to massive global warming and an enormous rise in the oceanic levels. Meteorites bombard the planet with ferocious intensity, and the project to find a cure for the plague is itself threatened by the failure of the main computer and repair systems. Adding to the challenge is the fact that some of the puzzles are not solvable. Determining which ones are impossible and avoiding even trying is essential. Early on in the game, the player finds what at first appears to be the only remaining inhabitant of the island: Floyd, a childish yet endearing robot. He is both a constant source of comic relief (e.g. \\"Oh, boy! Are we going to try something dangerous?\\" when the player saves the game in his presence), and also critical in advancing the plotline. Once Floyd realizes that the ProjCon repair robot (aptly named Achilles) is non-functional, and that the Project is close to completion, he performs the ultimate sacrifice and gives his life to retrieve the vital Miniaturization Card from the Bio-lab (the mutants within kill the player if he tries to get it himself). As Floyd lies dying, the player sings the \\"Ballad of the Starcrossed Miner\\" to him (itself an allusion to the earlier Infocom game Starcross). The adventurer then uses the Miniaturization Booth to access malfunctioning Relay Station #384 and repairs the main computer by removing an offending speck of dust with a laser. After defeating a giant microbe, the adventurer is informed that the primary Miniaturization Booth is malfunctioning and is rerouted to the Auxiliary Booth. Unfortunately, this puts a room full of mutants between the player and the endgame. With a biomask and the help of the Laboratory's poison gas system, the player makes it through the Bio-lab but emerges with the mutants on his tail. However, the adventurer makes it to the Cryo-Elevator which is hidden behind a mural. The elevator takes the adventurer to a secret room where the survivors of the infection were cryogenically frozen, just as the entire facility staff is reanimated by the antidote discovered by the ProjCon Computer. The adventurer is proclaimed a hero, Floyd is repaired, and Blather is demoted. There are 41 ways to die. The adventurer must sleep in a Dormitory each night and eat when hungry. Taking more than a few days causes the adventurer to succumb to the infection which apparently has ravaged the facility unless the antidote is obtained at the underground site. But even taking the antidote only buys a little time as the planet is nearing its sun. To achieve the optimum ending, the adventurer also must repair the three Planetary systems: the Communications System, the Planetary Defense System, and the Course Control System. Reception Softline stated that \\"the puzzles are good; the character of Floyd is great\\". The magazine stated that the \\"game is excellent\\", but criticized the ending as \\"unabashed adolescent wish fulfillment ... more like a fairy tale\\". In 1984 the magazine's readers named the game the tenth most-popular Apple program of 1983. Computer Gaming World called Floyd's role as sidekick \\"unique\\" and hoped that future games would add such innovations. It stated that Planetfall was \\"another excellent adventure\\" for text-adventure fans, and a good place to start for those new to interactive fiction. Creative Computing wrote that Planetfall \\"is as remarkable, funny, perplexing, and entertaining a game as you are likely to find anywhere.\\" It praised Floyd as \\"the most imaginative and cleverly written part of the entire game, Floyd, besides being hysterically funny through most of the adventure, evokes in the player of Planetfall authentic feelings of affection and attachment.\\" Steve Meretzky stated that Floyd \\"was the result of research into how an artificially intelligent mind might work\\". The Boston Globe in 1984 described the robot as \\"the most popular Infocom character\\". Planetfall has been described as \\"still lovingly remembered\\",(Murray 1998, p52) and parts have been described as \\"transcendent\\", including Floyd's death. Meretzky claims that \\"numerous players\\" have told him that they cried over the death of Floyd. Softline wrote, \\"You don't feel like this very often. Maybe after you've read Charlotte's Web. Maybe when they shot Bambi's mother. Maybe when Raskolnikov got religion in the Siberian slave labor camp. But this scene is from a computer game. A game!\\" A game developers round table on GEnie concluded that Floyd's death was a sad moment that could make someone cry. Floyd's death has been described as directly evoking the player's emotions because the story and gameplay are aligned.\\"By aligning the story with the gameplay, you evoke the emotions in the player directly, without having to appeal to a sometimes vain hope of sympathy. ... Examples range from the classic \\"Death of Floyd\\" in Planetfall, where a selfless robot helps your character--you-- directly...\\" The death of Floyd has been described as changing the game to an \\"evocative theatrical experience\\" after which \\"the player feels lonely and bereaved.\\" \\"At this point the game [Planetfall] changes from a challenging puzzle to an evocative theatrical experience. The escape from the planet continues, but without Floyd's company the player feels lonely and bereaved.\\" (Murray 1998, p53) The memory of Floyd's death remains with players for years and is remembered as a direct experience.\\"The memory of Floyd the Robot's noble self-sacrifice remains with players even years later as something directly experienced. 'He sacrificed himself for me,' is the way one twenty-year-old former player described it to me.\\" (Murray 1998, p53) Floyd's death \\"convey[ed] a sense of wonder at the unexpected and touching quality of the gesture.\\"\\"Even those who speak of it less personally ('When you get to that room, he goes in to save you\\") convey a sense of wonder at the unexpected and touching quality of the gesture.\\" (Murray 1998, p53) The scene has been described as a minor milestone toward video games as an expressive narrative art. \\"The death of Floyd is a minor milestone on the road from puzzle gaming to an expressive narrative art.\\" (Murray 1998, p53) Game designer Raph Koster feels that Floyd's death is \\"cheating\\" because it occurs in a cut scene. Reviews *The V.I.P. of Gaming Magazine #3 (April/May, 1986) Feelies Beginning with 1982's Deadline, Infocom included extra novelty items with their packaged games called feelies. Included with Planetfall was: *A Stellar Patrol \\"Special Assignment Task Force\\" ID card (about the size and shape of a credit card). The ID number printed on the card is the telephone number of MIT's student newspaper, The Tech, which was in the way of a prank by Meretzky. *3 interstellar postcards *A Stellar Patrol recruiting manual, \\"Today's Stellar Patrol: Boldly Going Where Angels Fear to Tread\\" *A short diary kept by the player's character (in the Solid Gold release, an in-game object included in the player's starting inventory rather than the packaging) The level of main character backstory contained in the feelies is a noted departure from the AFGNCAAP endemic to the other games in the Zork genre. Remake In February 1992, a remake of was developed and published by Japanese software development company SystemSoft for the NEC PC-9801, over eight-and-a-half years after the original Planetfall. There are differences in this enhanced remake: the game recognizes verb commands typed in kana (Japanese syllable system) or Latin alphabet. For convenience, some of the most common verb commands (Look, Take, etc.) can be accessed by pressing a corresponding button, but the player still has to type the name of an object. This remake also helps the player to interact with the environment by displaying a list of objects after the player has typed a command. Also, unlike the original, the remake contains enhanced graphics; every location has a unique background picture, on which the text is super-imposed, like in the PC-9801 version of Zork I and Enchanter.

It is about west of Stuttgart city centre, in the valley of the River Würm, and is often called the \\"Gate to the Black Forest\\". Name The name Weil derives from from the Latin word villa, an estate or manor. The suffix die Stadt (the town) was added to distinguish Weil from various nearby villages of the same name, such as Weil im Dorf and Weil im Schönbuch. The modern name is unusual in that it contains the dative article der rather than the nominative article die. This quirk arose because place names typically come after prepositions that govern the dative case in German, such as in or aus. The Roman origins of the town are immortalized in its coat of arms, which features the motto SPQR. History The village of Wile was first mentioned in 1075, and described as the property of the famous abbey of Hirsau. Weil der Stadt became a Free Imperial City in the 13th century, but had existed for centuries before as an important trading place. The city was completely destroyed during the Thirty Years' War in 1648 but was subsequently rebuilt, and is still dominated by buildings from this period. The city's fortifications have survived largely intact, with city walls, gates, and several towers. Weil der Stadt is best known as the birthplace of the astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571–1630), and it bears the unofficial title of Keplerstadt, or Kepler town. Another famous son is the Protestant reformer Johannes Brenz (1499–1570). Due to its surroundings and attractive cityscape, dominated by the church steeple of St. Peter and Paul, Weil der Stadt is a popular destination for excursions in the Stuttgart region. Events Weil der Stadt is a stronghold of traditional carnival, which is celebrated with a parade in the city centre. In contrast to the carnival in the Rhineland, the carnival in Weil der Stadt, called Fasnet, is based on Alemannic traditions, shared by various towns in southwestern Germany and Switzerland. Weil der Stadt escaped destruction in World War II when a French artillery barrage was called off in honour of it being Kepler's birthplace.  References  Borst, Otto and Joachim Feist.

It was created on 8 May 1971 due to its national and international scientific interest, with the aim to protect the soil, water, flora, fauna, and landscape, while preserving its value to the existent human and natural resources. Education and tourism are also goals of the park. History Dolmens in Serra do Soajo, used by early inhabitants in the inhospitable high altitudes The Espigueiros of Soajo, used by early settlers to warehouse and protect food cropsProbably, because the Gerês mountains are an inhospitable place, the oldest signs of human presence date only from 6000 BC to 3000 BC; dolmens and other megalithic tombs remain interspersed within the region, including near Castro Laboreiro and Mourela.Vânia Andreia Malheiro Proença (2009), p.23 Human activities consisted of animal husbandry and incipient agriculture, and archaeological evidence points to the beginning of decrease in forest cover. The Roman Geira, a Roman road, crosses the region, which formerly connected the Roman civitates of Asturica Augusta and Braccara Augusta. Long stretches of the road, along the Homem River are still preserved, along with several Roman bridges and numerous millenarium markers. The Germanic tribe of the Buri accompanied the Suebi in their invasion of the Iberian Peninsula and establishment in Gallaecia (modern northern Portugal and Galicia). The Buri settled in the region between the Cávado and Homem Rivers, in the area later known as Terras de Bouro (Land of the Buri). The move from the terraced cliffs and slopes to the lowland river valleys brought-on a patterned of new deforestation. The reoccupation of mountain areas started in the 12th century, intensifying in the 16th century with the introduction of maize, beans, and potatoes from the Americas.Vânia Andreia Malheiro Proença (2009), p.24 Agricultural fields occupied former pastures, and these were displaced to more elevated areas resulting in a mosaic of fields, pastures, and forests. The reforestation of uncultivated lands, imposed by the government in 1935, reduced the available pastures, and contributed to a rural exodus that continued after the 1950s. Yet it was still common practice for the residents of mountain communities to spend part of the year in two locations, primarily near Castro Laboreiro. From about Easter to about Christmas, residents would live in homes over 1,000 m above sea level, known as branda (from the Portuguese brando, meaning ‘mild’ or ‘gentle’). In the remaining part of the year, these inhabitants would occupy homes in the river valley, known as inverneira (from the Portuguese inverno, meaning ‘winter’). In 1970, the village of Vilarinho das Furnas was flooded by the Vilarinho das Furnas dam on the Homem River. During years with low rainfall, the village ruins stands above the water, attracting thousands of tourists. The creation of the national park (completed under decree no. 187/71, 8 May 1971) envisioned a planning area of mountainous spaces, in order to conserve the environment, while permitting human and natural resource activities, which would include educational, touristic and scientific projects. At heart is the conservation of soils, water, flora and fauna, in addition to the preservation of landscapes within the vast mountainous region in the northwest of Portugal. In 1997, Peneda-Gerês was included in the Natura 2000 network, and in 1999, designated a Special Protection Area for Wild Birds.Vânia Andreia Malheiro Proença (2009), p.19-20 Moreover, it also encompasses an important area of natural forest, which forms part of the European Network of Biogenetic Reserves, and is recognized as a national park by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. In 2007, it was accepted in the PAN Parks network that certifies the quality protected areas, according to rigorous criteria of nature conservation, cultural services and sustainability.  Geography  A view of the Lima River and landscape within the national park The rounded rocks and boulders of the Gerês granite structure, surrounding a small kettle lake The depositional remains and older granite structures in Fojo Lobo The Peneda-Gerês National Park is located in the northwest of Portugal, extending through the municipalities of Melgaço, Arcos de Valdevez and Ponte da Barca (in the district of Viana do Castelo), Terras de Bouro (district of Braga), and Montalegre (district of Vila Real). The park includes an area of 702.90 km2, of which 52.75 km2 are public lands, 194.38 km2 are private property and the remaining 455.77 km2 are commons. =Physical geography= The park is a vast amphitheatre-shaped space sculpted during the Variscan orogeny by geological forces, wind and water, and extends from the Castro Laboreiro to the Mourela plateaus, encompassing the Serra da Peneda, Serra do Soajo, Serra Amarela and the Serra do Gerês.J.B. Brilha et al. (1999), p.316Vânia Andreia Malheiro Proença (2009), p.20 These form a barrier between the ocean plains to its west and the plateaus in the east. The highest peaks are Peneda (1340 m), Soajo (1430 m), Amarelo (1350 m), Gerês (1545 m) and Altar dos Cabrões (1,538 m) located on the border with Galicia, continuing into this territory as part of the Serra do Xurés.ICN (1995), p.6 The granitic rocks that dominate this shield were deposited during the process of continental collision that brought together the lower Iberian peninsula with Europe, between 380 million and 275 million years; the oldest of them, at Amarela, date from 310 million years ago. The most extensive of the granitic rocks that occur within the park are the Peneda-Gerês pluton which is an exposed relief that became exposed around 290-296 Ma by the Gerês-Lovios fault. Sedimentary layers laid down between 435 and 408 Ma (Silurian epoch) were deformed and metamorphosed into schists, greywackes and quartzites (such as in the area of Castro Laboreiro). Also, dykes and sills formed from quartz and aplite-pegmatites were mineralized resulting in tin, tungsten, molybdenum and gold (which would become the focus of mining in the human era, at the now-closed mines of Carris and Borrageiro). Generally, the lithological structures can be divided into three layers:ICN (1995), p.7 * Gerês granite structures - includes Gerês, Paufito, Carris, Borrageiro and Tieiras, and is composed of special mineralogical and geochemical intrusions that occurred through third phase of Hercynian faults, caused by a differentiating of basic magmas. The terrain in these regions include a vigorous relief, a rounded granite petrography, such as in the Serra da Peneda; * older granite structures - includes a very heterogeneous group of Mezio, Soajo, Serra Amarela, Linhoso, Parada, Tourém, Pedrada e Ermida, Germil, Sezelhe and Frades, with a texture and composition that quite variable, from the crustal fusion of various materials with surface contamination; * sedimentary formations - includes sediments deposited in Silurian waters and metamorphosed during the Devonian period, as well as carbon and more recent sediments, resulting during the Quaternary. The first group includes principally schists and quartz-feldspar, greywackes and quartzites with meta-crystals, such as andalusite, cordierite and sillimanite. These sedminentary deposits are prominently preserved in two linear patches: Vale das Antas and Louriça, near Castro Laboreiro, between two granite structures. The most recent geological formations are those created by fluvial, torrential and glacial deposits. During the Pleistocene (approximately 1.8 to 0.001 Ma ago) climatic variations resulted in an extension of glacial fields to the mid-latitudes. While there are no remnants of glaciers now, their Ice Age products (U-shaped valleys, moraines, glacial deposits, polished and natural granite surfaces) are identified in the Serra da Peneda, Serra do Soajo and Serra do Gerês mountain ranges. The principal watersheds that cross the park are those of the Minho (occupying 2% of the park), Lima (47.8%) and Cávado (50.2%), with brooks and waterfalls common on many of the mountain slopes, in addition to several secondary tributaries (such as the Homem, Rabagão, Castro Laboreiro, and Arado rivers). The Cávado cuts across the PNPG east to west, while the Lima serves the southern limits of the districts of Vila Real and Braga. Fractures in the landscape have confined the rivers to deep, straight valleys and are visible in the younger granite outcrops visible in the uncovered higher altitudes. Owing to the number tributaries, the construction of hydroelectrical dams has been undertaken to generate electricity across six locations: Alto Rabagão, Paradela, Caniçada, Vilarinho da Furna, Touvedo and Lindoso. Soils within the elevated terrains and inclined spaces are non-existent, while the valleys are rich and deep, deposited and transported by pluvial action. These strata are textured, permeable, easily worked, albeit with a weak consistency, and marked by the peculiarities of local agriculture.Vânia Andreia Malheiro Proença (2009), p.21 The incorporation of biomass and elevated precipitation, along with the low autumn-winter temperatures give an origin to the alterations in pH levels. The elevated levels of incompletely decomposed organic material, low in phosphorus and intermittently low/high in potassium, are subject of alluvial deposition. =Climate= The region of the Parque Nacional Peneda Geres falls within a transitional zone between the Atlantic and Mediterranean environments, and is influenced by various climatic systems: Atlantic, Mediterranean and Continental.ICN (1995), p.8 Its climate is greatly influenced by the topography; the mountains exert a barrier effect to the passage of hot and wet air masses coming from the Atlantic Ocean, resulting in elevated precipitation throughout the year.Vânia Andreia Malheiro Proença (2009), p.22 It falls in a part of Portugal (and Europe) that is affected by extreme rainfall, obtaining precipitation levels of 3000 millimetres per year, with more than 130 rainy days per year. Average annual temperatures range from 17°C to 20°C, with some variation; the high lands have an average temperature of about 10°C, ranging from 4 to 14 °C, while areas in the valleys (such as the Homem and Cávado river valleys) have milder climates, with temperatures ranging from 8 to 20 °C (with an average of 14 °C). Consequently, the area is prone to various micro-climates, affected by variations in altitude, topographic characteristics, human occupation, different exposures and thermal variation. Similarly, the variation has resulted in a variation in vegetation characteristic of Mediterranean, Euro-Siberian and Alpine environments. =Biome= Rivas-Martinez defined that the foothills of the Serra da Gerês along with the foothills of the Serra da Cabreira (lands below the Tâmega, Ave and Cávado watersheds) constitute the frontier between the Euro-Siberian and Mediterranean regions, that confers on the Peneda-Gerês a floral and phytogeographic importance.ICN (1995), p.23 Flora Example of the English oak (Quercus robur) common to the forests of Peneda-Gerês Biomass coverage of the Serra do Gerês, Serra Amarela, Serra do Peneda and Serra do Soajo, as well as the Mourela and Castro Laboreiro plateaus, are dominated by four distinct biomes: oak forest, shrubbery, marshes and riparian vegetation. The floristic diversity includes 823 vascular taxa that occur in 128 types of natural vegetation. The oak forests which are common throughout the park, are specifically concentrated in Ramiscal, Peneda, Gerês and Beredo river valleys. These forested are dominated by an alliance between the Pyrenean (Quercus pyrenaica) and English (Quercus robur) oaks, which themselves are differentiated among the lower altitudes and exposed flanks (the Rusceto- Quercetum roboris) and those oaks with Atlantic characteristics (Myretillo- Quercetum roboris). The first association are commonly found with English oak (Quercus rober), cork oak (Quercus suber), butcher's broom (Ruscus aculeatus), maple (Acer pseudoplatanus) and Portuguese laurel (Prunus lusitanica), while the second association unites the English and Pyrenean oaks with bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo) and European holly (Ilex aquifolium). In upper altitudes there are patches of English oak that enter into their own association (Holco-Quercetum pyrenacia), which is integrated into another group (Quericon robri-patraea). These oaks have been, over the course of human settlement, the object of intense use, resulting in a general degradation of the spaces into nothing more than shrubbery. The bush and shrublands, which characterize the remainder of the spaces (74% of the park), are dominated by dwarf (Ulex minor) and European (Ulex europaeus) gorse and heather (Erica umbellata and Calluna vulgaris), with a mixtures of common juniper (Juniperus communis), southern heather (Erica australis) in the upper altitudes, while lower altitude bush includes cross-leaved heather (Erica tetralix), dwarf gorse (Ulex minor), Dorset heath (Erica ciliaris), common sundew (Drosera rotundifolia), pale butterwort (Pinguicula lusitanica), marsh violet (Viola palustris) and purple moor grass (Molinia caerulea). Riparian and marshlands along the river courses are also sites of rare species of chain ferns (Woodwardia radicans), willow (Salix repens), downy birch (Betula pubescens), deciduous shrubs (Spiraea hypericifolia), Portuguese enchanter's nightshade (Circaea lusitanica) and angelica herbs (Angelica laevis).ICN (1995), p.24 There are 627 flora species identified by Serra and Carvalho (1989) as under pressure and considered endangered, which included two medicinal plants: tutsan (Hypericum androsaemum) and sundew (Drosera rotundifolia). Based on the protection list of botanical species, and UICN categories: 18 are considered in risk of extinction, 17 are vulnerable and one is rare. They also identified two species as extinct within the park boundaries: a geranium (Geranium lanuginosum) and fragrant orchid (Gymnadenia conopsea). There are three endemic species. Those factors that have been identified that threaten these habitats include: natural and manmade fires, use of forest for fuel wood and agricultural use of habitats. Fauna The Pyrenean desman commonly restricted to the northern portion of the Iberian peninsula The Iberian wolf (Canis lupus signatus), whose population was almost eradicated: a rare resident of the park Many of the studies conducted on the species that inhabitant the park have been concentrated in the area of Matas de Albergaria/Palheiros, traditionally identified as the \\"heart\\" of the park.ICN (1995), p.25 Work by the Faculty of Sciences at the University of Porto and University of Minho have concentrated on a few mammals (Pyrenean desman, European otter, roe deer, and wild boar), reptiles and fish. These studies looked into the numbers of species and factors influencing their habitats. Approximately 235 vertebrate species were identified within the boundaries of the park, of which 200 are threatened or under protection. These include three species of bat under pressure (of the eight that exist): greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hipposideros) and Mediterranean horseshoe bat ('[Rhinoloplus euryale). Other species of particular importance: the Iberian shrew (Sorex granarius), the European pine marten (Martes martes), the European wildcat (Felis silvestris), the gold-striped salamander (Chioglossa lusitanica) and the snub-nosed viper (Vipera latastei). A few of the local species are protected by the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats. The red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) whose habitat is restricted and marginal in continental Portugal, is another species that is common to the park. After four centuries absent from Portuguese territory, its population began to be recorded in 1985-1986, in Viana do Castelo. There were also registered sightings in Albergaria, Lamas de Mouro and Serra da Paneda, while comparable encounters in Spain were identified across the border. Roe deer, which are a symbol of the park are encountered in prolific quantity, along the margins of the park, where they find shelter and food.ICN (1995), p.26 Meanwhile, other mammals, such as the population of Iberian wolf (Canis lupus signatus) have collapsed with human encroachment, while the number of exemplars are limited. Along with the golden eagle, the wolf was seen as a threat to livestock, were almost hunted to extinction, although protected by law since the end of the 20th century. brown bears disappeared from the region in the 17th century, and the extinct Portuguese ibex (Capra pyrenaica lusitanica), locally known as Gerês goat, was last seen in the 1890s. More than a century later, its vacant ecological niche was reoccupied naturally by Spanish ibex coming from Galicia, and their population numbered about 100 animals by 2011. Worthy of mention are the Garrano (or Minho horse), a breed of small equine species who were ancestors of the Galician pony and Andalusian horse, which mostly live in the wild, but are a gentle breed with no significant fear of humans. For a long time these horses permeated the farms of Vilarinho das Furnas (before it was inundated with the dam's construction), but later began to freely move between the Portuguese-Spanish border after 1979. There are 147 avian species that are associated with the Peneda-Gerês park, especially along the Mourela region in the southern part of its frontier. In this region, although it might vary throughout the year (given climate and season), approximately 36 species make their nests in the area. Of particular note in this park are the: hen harrier (Circus cyaneus), European honey buzzard (Pernis apivorus), common snipe (Gallinago gallinago), red-backed shrike (Lanius collurio), yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella), garden warbler (Sylvia borin) and whinchat (Saxicola rubetra). For the winchat, the area of Mourela is the unique nesting ground in Portugal, while the red-backed shrike and yellowhammer are limited to Castro Lombeiro plateau and northern corners of the park. Also important to highlight is the gold-striped salamander (Chioglossa lusitanica) a species endemic to the northwest Iberian peninsula, typically associated with mountainous areas with elevated precipitation. The waters of the park teem with various species, often called \\"Rios truteiros\\" (Trout Rivers) for the abundance of trout. Although stocks have diminished, the salmon populations still spawns in the rivers of the park. Species well represented in the biotopes of Peneda-Gerês include: * Pyrenean desman (Galemys pyrenaicus), commonly restricted to northern portions of the Iberian Peninsula and French Pyrenees; * European otter (Lutra lutra), a carnivore well adapted to waters of the park, but in decline throughout Europe, it inhabits the watercourses and uses the banks for shelter; * Iberian emerald lizard (Lacerta schreiberi), endemic to the western portions of the Iberian peninsula, it inhabits mountainous river valleys, where it protected by vegetation; * Iberian frog (Rana iberica), common to northwestern Iberia, Portugal and mountainous lands =Ecoregions/protected areas= The Peneda-Gerês logo overlooking one of the scenic belvedres near Gerês The 1971 classification of Peneda-Gerês as a national park came from a group of rules/requirements established to allow: the prudent use of the park's resources, preservation of existing flora and fauna species, allowing for the continued cohabitation, while providing an environment for scientific, educational and touristic investigation. These specified: * Areas of Natural Environments (), these were defined in 1991 into three zones: ** Integrated reserves, to preserve habitats and natural elements that were unique, vulnerable, rare, threatened or representative; ** Partial reserves, to allow conservation and environmental interpretation; ** Complementary areas, a transition zones between natural and rural environments. * Freshwater Environments (), to provide means of management and conservation that would allow the constant preservation of existing water-based environments. The park is located within mountainous granite geomorphology, characterized by narrow watercourses, irregular inclines and unmineralized, highly oxygenated, semi- acidic, cold waters, which are the base of the ecosystem. Its importance, therefore, resulted in three-level classification of freshwater environments characterized by the natural resources that existed, and those activities which were permitted in each environment. * Sites of Ornithological Interest (), areas identified for avian species conservation were prepared by Neves et al. =Human geography= Although there has been variable growth throughout the Norte region, there has been a general population decrease in those administrative units that fell within the Peneda-Gerês National Park (1981–1991), in the municipalities of Melgaço (-16.8%), Arcos de Valdevez (-13.4%), Ponte da Barca(-6.1%), Terras de Bouro (-7.2%), and Montalegre (-20.3%). There was a population of 9,099 according to the 1991 census, a 16% decrease from the 10,849 registered in 1981. There are no positive-negative variations between civil parishes; of those civil parishes that fell within the PNPG authority, their populations dropped from 0.8% (Vilar da Veiga) to 38.6% (Sezelhe). These residents are concentrated primarily in various agglomerations: small nuclei separated from each other; an extension of buildings located along roadways; some isolated groups; constructions along agricultural roads in pasturelands; and three or more homes isolated by pastures.ICN (1995), p.35-36 Consequently, there are six homogeneous zones: * Castro Laboreiro and Rio Laboreiro Valley - consisting of small agglomerations separated by short distances.ICN (1995), p.36 It was still common practice for the residents of mountain communities to spend part of the year in two locations, primarily near Castro Laboreiro. From about Easter to about Christmas, residents would live in homes above 1,000 m above sea level, known as branda (from the Portuguese brando, meaning mild or gentle). In the remaining part of the year, these inhabitants would occupy homes in the river valley, known as inverneira (from the Portuguese Inverno, meaning winter); * Serras da Peneda and Serras do Soajo - small pastoral agglomerations, with different summer and winter residences; * Lima Valley and Serra Amarela - where the Lima Valley consists of two or more agglomerations connected by lines of residences between them, while in the Serra Amarela populations are concentrated in isolated pockets; * Gerês Valley - development of tourism, around the Caniçada Dam and Thermal baths, resulted in uncontrolled re- construction, re-modelling and expansion of existing residences, although there already existed a tendency for expansion along the avenues and accessways along the valley; * Cabril-Gerês - steep areas along the River Cávado and Salamonde Dam, where buildings are concentrated along the accessways, and Cabril River, with pasturelands located between agglomerations; * Mourela/Barroso Plateau - extending south, southeast and southwest, the plateau is a series of agglomerations, connected by avenues of built-up occupation. The expansion of Várzea, owing to the construction of the Paradela Dam, resulted in the reduction of cultivatable lands, meadows and marshes. Some of the villages in the high lands are located near the arable lands. Terraces, built to make better use of these scarce lands, and traditional houses, with granite walls and thatch roofs, shape the landscape with an indelible, harmonious, human mark in some of the most isolated villages such as Pitões das Júnias and Ermida. Economy The primary economic sector dominates the activities of residents that live within the park's territory. Although agricultural activity remains difficult, it still out-paces secondary and tertiary activities which, apart from the Terras de Bouro and Ponte da Barca, have been insignificant.ICN (1995), p.14 The inaccessibility and diminished exterior investment potential, has concentrated those activities in the region primarily in the exploration of forestry, the support of hydro-electrical generation and tourism. But this too is limited; tourism is concentrated generally in the vicinity of Caldas do Gerês, hydro- electrical transmission has not affected the local economy, and along with forestry, has not seen an appreciable re-investment or re-capitalization of wealth (with income generated transferred outside the local market). The primary sector, although the largest contributor, is subsistence at best: supported by an ageing (mostly female) population; individual parcels are small and over-subdivided; producers that support familial or local clients; a production that is primarily concentrated on personal consumption; poor commercial networks; and physical and social isolation, with limited educational supports. Between 60-70% of the production is supported by subsidies. Industrial activities in the civil parishes within the park are poorly diversified and support familial businesses. Civil construction, although one of the larger economic supporters, has little effect on local incomes, since a majority of the employed come from outside the region.ICN (1995), p.15 Although there are a few larger operations (bread-making, construction and saw-milling/carpentry) most are small owner-operators, that support local consumption or occasional sales. Frequently, artisanal producers have disappeared, and have not been replaced by mass-produced or comparable vendors. Similarly, tertiary activities are limited small operators; commonly poorly diversified, dominated by commercial establishments and focused on local consumption, they are operated by families and do not generate much in employment. Cafés and restaurants, are a good example of entrepreneurship, with many dotting the settlement landscape of the park's limits, primarily in the area of Gerês. Other service sector activities are concentrated within the urbanized municipal seats and larger villages, with many of the more dynamic nuclei the centre of postal services, banks, posts for the G.N.R. or health centres.  Tourism  The park tries to simultaneously encourage and control tourism, since the park's nature would not resist a massive flow of tourists. Accordingly there are six small camping sites and several hikingtrails are marked, making it relatively easy to find many of the most interesting spots, such as the castros at Castro Laboreiro and Calcedónia and the monastery at Pitões das Júnias. The trail at Mézio as a particular concern in describing some of the local features. Locations near the few major roads are the most visited. Many of them are related to the strong religiousness of the people in northern Portugal namely the shrines at Senhora da Peneda and São Bento da Porta Aberta. Others, such as Soajo and Lindoso, display small, traditional granaries built of granite, the espigueiros (from the Portuguese espiga, meaning spike). Probably the two most known and visited features are the many waterfalls, mostly the one near the old frontier station at Portela do Homem, and the Vilarinho das Furnas village, whenever the Vilarinho das Furnas Dam is low enough. Two domestic animals also deserve being noted. The Barrosão ox, once used in agriculture, is nowadays endangered because it is losing its utility; as is also the Castro Laboreiro dog, a hunting dog.

Candidates The election arose after the Good Friday Agreement, with prisoner releases having started, but before the pro-agreement parties had reached agreement on the shape of a devolved government. After a disputatious selection contest, the London-based public relations executive David Burnside was selected as the new Ulster Unionist Party candidate. Burnside claimed to have supported the Agreement at the time of its negotiation but to have since turned against the way in which it was being implemented. However this was at odds with his party's policy. This was seized upon by the Democratic Unionist Party candidate, former Mid-Ulster MP Rev. William McCrea in campaigning. McCrea campaigned on a policy of refusal to co-operate with Sinn Féin in the absence of progress on arms decommissioning. The Northern Ireland Unionist Party initially selected Norman Boyd, who was a local member of the Northern Ireland Assembly (elected as a member of the United Kingdom Unionist Party). However, during the campaign Boyd withdrew, urging voters not to divide the anti-agreement vote, and supported McCrea. Although the Progressive Unionist Party had secured 8.7% of the vote at the previous general election, they did not stand on this occasion. The Alliance Party of Northern Ireland selected David Ford, who was a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly for the area and who had previously fought the seat in the 1997 general election. With all the Unionist candidates opposed to the Good Friday Agreement to some degree, Ford hoped to gain the support of pro Agreement unionist voters. However, with the Unionist parties fighting fiercely, Ford faced the difficult task of convincing voters that a vote for the Alliance was not wasted, especially when many who supported the Agreement argued that the best realistic result for maintaining it would be for Burnside to win the seat. The nationalist SDLP also ran their local assembly member, in this case Donovan McClelland. With the constituency overwhelmingly Protestant the SDLP had no chance of winning and much of the spotlight on them concerned their electoral battle with Sinn Féin as a prelude to forthcoming Assembly elections. Sinn Féin had no Assembly members but ran Martin Meehan, who had been their sole Assembly candidate the last time, in the hope of increasing his profile and building up their local organisation in preparation for a shot at the next election. The battle between McClelland and Meehan attracted much attention as it would indicate the movement of votes within the nationalist community between the two parties, though most agreed that it was always likely for the SDLP to come out on top in the highly middle-class constituency. In addition the Natural Law Party selected David Collins. This was to be one of the last occasions that the party would fight an election in Northern Ireland. Campaign With delays over the selection and the summer holiday intervening, polling day in the by-election was held off until 21 September, allowing extensive campaigning. The constituency is strongly Protestant and it was always clear that the real contest was between the two Unionist parties. Away from these two, interest was piqued by the advance of Sinn Féin, overtaking the Alliance in the number of votes won. Many believed that this heralded the former party subsequently taking the latter's Assembly seat in the next assembly election, but in the event Ford narrowly held on.

The units of measurement are pounds-force or kilograms-force. This measurement is performed using a special test machine and standard block and ring test specimens. The test machine is based on a machine manufactured by the Timken Company from 1935 to 1972, It is now an industry recognized standard test to compare extreme pressure resistance of greases and oils in a reproducible way. It is not to be confused with some smaller lubricity testers that are also often erroneously called Timken: the confusion originates from a now obsolete Italian brand TIMPKEN. The test machine consists of a standardized bearing race mounted on a tapered arbor rotating at high speed. The race is brought into contact with a square steel test block under a constant load. The contact area is flooded with the lubricant or grease being tested. The Timken OK Load is the highest standard load at which the spinning bearing race produces no scouring mark on the test block, but only a uniform wear scar. Timken OK Loads are listed on grease and oil property charts and are part of many specifications. It was once generally assumed that the measure and the film strength of the lubricant were directly related. Today, the primary purpose of the test is to determine whether EP additives are present and functioning. A measure of 35 pounds (16 kilograms-force or 155 newtons) or more means that EP additives are present and working well.

It also covers surrounding towns in Merrimack County, most of Belknap County, as well as portions of Grafton, Rockingham and Hillsborough counties. The Monitor has several times been named as one of the best small papers in America and in April 2008, became a Pulitzer Prize winning paper, when photographer Preston Gannaway was honored for feature photography. History The Monitor has been published continuously since 1864, under a variety of names, including the Evening Monitor, and owners. In the late 19th century it was owned by a publishing company called the Republican Press Association which also published a paper named the Independent Statesman. Its masthead calls it the Concord Monitor and New Hampshire Patriot, although the Monitor name is the only one in widespread use. James M. Langley, who had acquired both publications in the 1920s, was responsible for the merger. William Dwight, publisher of the Holyoke Transcript-Telegram in Massachusetts, bought the Monitor from Langley in 1961, becoming its publisher. When he retired in 1975, his son-in-law George W.

Macdonald was called to the bars of both Ontario and Manitoba in 1882. He practised in Brandon, Manitoba from 1882 to 1897. Macdonald first ran for public office in the provincial election of 1888, losing in the riding of North Brandon to Liberal Clifford Sifton (later an important provincial and federal cabinet minister). He was elected for Brandon City in 1892, defeating incumbent Liberal James Smart by 12 votes. Before the 1892 election, Rodmond Roblin had been the de facto leader of the opposition Conservative caucus. With Roblin having lost his seat, Macdonald was chosen as his replacement and was recognized as the official leader of the opposition. He did not serve in this capacity long. Macdonald's election was declared void in mid-1893, and he lost a by-election to Liberal Charles Adams on September 8 of the same year. In 1896, Macdonald ran federally as the official Conservative candidate in Brandon. He was defeated by D'Alton McCarthy, a maverick Conservative who opposed the extension of French-language rights and was supported by local Liberals. From 1897 to 1909, Macdonald practised law in Nelson, British Columbia. In 1909, he moved to Vancouver, where he was counsel for the board of trade.

Some 12,575 ASTM voluntary consensus standards operate globally. The organization's headquarters is in West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, about northwest of Philadelphia. Founded in 1898 as the American Section of the International Association for Testing Materials (see also International Organization for Standardization), ASTM International predates other standards organizations such as the British Standards BSI (1901), IEC (1906), DIN (1917), ANSI (1918), AFNOR (1926), and ISO (1947).  History  A group of scientists and engineers, led by Charles Dudley, formed ASTM in 1898 to address the frequent rail breaks affecting the fast-growing railroad industry. The group developed a standard for the steel used to fabricate rails. Originally called the \\"American Society for Testing Materials\\" in 1902, it became the \\"American Society for Testing and Materials\\" in 1961 before it changed its name to “ASTM International” in 2001 and added the tagline \\"Standards Worldwide\\". In 2014, it changed the tagline to \\"Helping our World Work better\\". Now, ASTM International has offices in Belgium, Canada, China, Peru, and Washington, D.C.  Membership and organization  Membership in the organization is open to anyone with an interest in its activities. Standards are developed within committees, and new committees are formed as needed, upon request of interested members. Membership in most committees is voluntary and is initiated by the member's own request, not by appointment nor by invitation. Members are classified as users, producers, consumers, and \\"general interest\\". The latter includes academics and consultants. Users include industry users, who may be producers in the context of other technical committees, and end-users such as consumers. In order to meet the requirements of antitrust laws, producers must constitute less than 50% of every committee or subcommittee, and votes are limited to one per producer company. Because of these restrictions, there can be a substantial waiting-list of producers seeking organizational memberships on the more popular committees. Members can, however, participate without a formal vote and their input will be fully considered. As of 2015, ASTM has more than 30,000 members, including over 1,150 organizational members, from more than 140 countries. The members serve on one or more of 140+ ASTM Technical Committees. ASTM International has several awards for contributions to standards authorship, including the ASTM International Award of Merit (the organization's highest award) ASTM International is classified by the United States Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.  Standards compliance  ASTM International has no role in requiring or enforcing compliance with its standards. The standards, however, may become mandatory when referenced by an external contract, corporation, or government. * In the United States, ASTM standards have been adopted, by incorporation or by reference, in many federal, state, and municipal government regulations. The National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act, passed in 1995, requires the federal government to use privately developed consensus standards whenever possible. The Act reflects what had long been recommended as best practice within the federal government. * Other governments (local and worldwide) also have referenced ASTM standards.Transport Canada use of ASTM * Corporations doing international business may choose to reference an ASTM standard. * All toys sold in the United States must meet the safety requirements of ASTM F963, Standard Consumer Safety Specification for Toy Safety, as part of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA).

It is the only species in the genus Perodicticus. It is also known as Bosman's potto, after Willem Bosman, who described the species in 1704.Smeenk, C., L.R. Godfrey & F.L. Williams. The early specimens of the potto Perodicticus potto (Statius Müller, 1776) in the National Museum of Natural History, Leiden, with the selection of a neotype. Zool. Med. Leiden 80-4 (12), 10.xi.2006: 139-164 ISSN 0024-0672. In some English-speaking parts of Africa, it is called a \\"softly-softly\\". Etymology The common name \\"potto\\" may be from Wolof (a tailless monkey). The generic name Perodicticus is composed of Greek (, ‘maimed’) and (, \\"able to show/indicate\\", cf. , , ‘index finger’). It refers to the stubby index finger that seems mutilated. Taxonomy There are four recognized subspecies: * Perodicticus potto potto * Perodicticus potto edwardsi * Perodicticus potto ibeanus * Perodicticus potto stockleyi However, variation among pottos is significant, and there may, in fact, be more than one species. A few closely related species also have \\"potto\\" in their names: the two golden potto species (also known as angwantibos) and the false potto. Although it has been suggested that the differences that separate the false potto from the potto are a result of an anomalous specimen being used as the holotype which may have been a potto. The Central and South American kinkajou (Potos flavus) and olingos (Bassaricyon sp.) are similar in appearance and behavior to African pottos, and were formerly classified with them (hence Potos). Olingos and kinkajous are now known to be members of the raccoon family. Description Potto handMivart 1871 The potto grows to a length of 30 to 39 cm, with a short (3 to 10 cm) tail, and its weight varies from . The close, woolly fur is grey-brown. The index finger is vestigial, although it has opposable thumbs with which it grasps branches firmly. Like other strepsirrhines the potto has a moist nose, toothcomb, and a toilet claw on the second toe of the hind legs. In the hands and feet, fingers three and four are connected to each other by a slight skin fold, while toes three through five are joined at their bases by a skin web that extends to near the proximal third of the toes. The neck has four to six low tubercles or growths that cover its elongated vertebrae which have sharp points and nearly pierce the skin; these are used as defensive weapons. Both males and females have large scent glands under the tail (in females, the swelling created by the glands is known as a pseudo-scrotum), which they use to mark their territories and to reinforce pair bonds. The potto has a distinct odor that some observers have likened to curry. Distribution and habitat The potto inhabits the canopy of rain forests in tropical Africa: from Nigeria, Guinea to Kenya and Uganda into the north of the Democratic Republic of Congo. It is nocturnal and arboreal, sleeping during the day in the leaves and almost never descending from the trees. Behaviour and ecology Potto gripping branches The potto moves slowly and carefully, always gripping a branch with at least two limbs. It is also quiet and avoids predators using cryptic movement. The most common call is a high-pitched \\"tsic\\", which is used mainly between mother and offspring. Studies of stomach contents have shown the potto diet consists of about 65% fruit, 21% tree gums and 10% insects. The potto has also occasionally been known to catch bats and small birds. Its strong jaws enable it to eat fruits and lumps of dried gum that are too tough for other tree-dwellers. The insects it eats tend to have a strong smell and are generally not eaten by other animals. The potto has large territories which it marks with urine and glandular secretions. Same-sex intruders are vehemently guarded against, and each male's territory generally overlaps with that of two or more females. Females have been known to donate part of their territories to their daughters, but sons leave their mother's territory upon maturity. As part of their courting rituals, pottos often meet for bouts of mutual grooming. This is frequently performed while they hang upside down from a branch. Grooming consists of licking, combing fur with the grooming claw and teeth, and anointing with the scent glands. Pottos mate face-to-face while hanging upside down from a branch. After a gestation period of about 193–205 days, the female gives birth, typically to a single young, but twins are known to occur. The young first are clasped to the belly of the mother, but later she carries them on her back. She can also hide her young in the leaves while searching for food. After about six months, they are weaned, and are fully mature after about 18 months. =Predators and defences= Perodicticus potto skeleton The potto has relatively few predators, because large mammalian carnivores cannot climb to the treetops where they live, and the birds of prey in this part of Africa are diurnal. One population of chimpanzees living in Mont Assirik, Senegal, was observed to eat pottos, taking them from their sleeping places during the day; however, this behaviour has not been observed in chimps elsewhere.Chimpanzees in the dry habitats of Mont Assirik, Senegal and Semliki Wildlife Reserve, Uganda' by K. D. Hunt and W. C. McGrew. Chapter from Behavioural Diversity in Chimpanzees and Bonobos, edited by Christophe Boesch (Cambridge University Press, 2002) Pottos living near villages face some predation from humans, who hunt them as bushmeat.Hunting for Sustainability in Tropical Forests, edited by John Robinson and Elizabeth Bennett (Columbia University Press, 1999) They are sometimes preyed upon by African palm civets, although African palm civets are largely frugivorous. If threatened, the potto will hide its face and neck-butt its opponent, making use of its unusual vertebrae. It can also deliver a powerful bite. Its saliva contains compounds that cause the wound to become inflamed. The highest recorded life span for a potto in captivity is 26 years. =Cognition and social behaviour= In a study of strepsirrhine cognition conducted in 1964, pottos were seen to explore and manipulate unfamiliar objects, but only when those objects were baited with food. They were found to be more curious than lorises and lesser bushbabies, but less so than lemurs. Ursula Cowgill, a biologist at Yale University who looked after six captive pottos for several decades, noticed they appeared to form altruistic relationships. The captive pottos were seen to spend time with a sick companion and to save food for an absent one. However, there is no confirmation this behaviour occurs in the wild.

Eisenhower during his period as Supreme Commander Allied Expeditionary Force in command of the Allied forces in north west Europe. Summersby and Eisenhower spent a significant amount of time together until World War II ended, at which time Eisenhower cut ties and returned to the United States. It is generally agreed that Summersby and Eisenhower became extremely close during the war; some writers have suggested a sexual relationship between the two, although people who knew both of them at the time have rejected that claim, as have most of Eisenhower's biographers. Early life Summersby was born in Ballydehob, County Cork, Ireland.Entry in Census of Ireland, 1911Wyden, Barbara, Papers, 1944–1945, Dwight D. Eisenhower Library, Abilene, Kansas She was the daughter of Donald Florence MacCarthy-Morrogh and Vera Mary MacCarthy-Morrogh (née Hutchinson). Her father, descended from the MacCarthy Reagh Princes of Carbery, was originally from County Kerry, and her mother was born in Wales, as the fourth of five sisters, to an English Gentleman and Irish mother who was also descended from the Morrogh family.1958 edition of Burke's Landed Gentry of Ireland She described her father, a retired Lieutenant Colonel of the Royal Munster Fusiliers, as \\"black Irish\\" and her mother as English. As a young woman, she moved to London where she worked as a film studio extra, dabbled in photography, and eventually became a fashion model. She was married in 1936 to British Army officer Gordon Thomas Summersby; when they divorced, she retained the name of her ex-husband. There was an engagement to marry US Army officer Lieutenant Colonel Richard \\"Dick\\" Arnold that overlapped her initial period with Eisenhower; however, this ended with the death of her fiancé while mine clearing during the North Africa campaign. World War II When Britain entered the Second World War in 1939, Summersby joined the British Mechanised Transport Corps (MTC). She drove an ambulance throughout the London Blitz in 1940 and 1941, and was reportedly excellent at navigating London streets during blackouts and fog. When the United States joined the Allies after the German declaration of war in December 1941, Summersby was one of many MTC drivers assigned as chauffeurs to high-ranking American military officers. Summersby was assigned to drive then Major General Dwight Eisenhower when he arrived in London in May 1942. Though there was a brief interruption of several weeks due to Eisenhower's short return to the US, Summersby chauffeured Eisenhower and later became his secretary until November 1945, based at his home Telegraph Cottage in Warren Road, Coombe, Kingston upon Thames. During this time Eisenhower rose in rank to a five-star General of the Army and Commander of the European Theatre, and Kay, with his help, became a US citizen and a commissioned officer in the US Women's Army Corps (WACs), ultimately leaving the service as a captain in 1947. Captain Summersby's military awards included the Bronze Star Medal,In the photo linked above, Captain Summersby is wearing the ribbon of the Bronze Star Medal Women's Army Corps Service Medal, European Campaign Medal, World War II Victory Medal and the Army of Occupation Medal with \\"Germany\\" clasp. (Although several online sources state that Summersby received the Legion of Merit, there is no known documentary evidence that she was awarded it. The Legion of Merit was normally awarded to senior officers in the rank of colonel and above.) Life after the war Summersby was awarded the British Empire Medal (BEM) in the 1945 New Year Honours List. The award, at the insistence of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, was presented, with a signed photograph of the Prime Minister, aboard the MV Britannic in New York more than three years later. After leaving the service in 1947, Summersby settled in the United States, and was, at one point, engaged to a man in San Francisco who thought she had money. She married the Wall Street stockbroker Reginald H. Morgan in 1952,Announcement of marriage, Time, Monday, 1 December 1952 but was divorced in 1958.Obituary, The New York Times,21 January 1975 She died at her home in Southampton, Long Island, of cancer, on 20 January 1975, at the age of 66. Relationship with Eisenhower There is a question whether Summersby consummated a romance with Eisenhower during the war, as there is no definitive evidence as to the matter. Many people knew both of them during the war but none alleged there was an affair. In Eisenhower Was My Boss, her 1948 memoir of the war years, written with journalist Frank Kearns, she made no mention of any affair. Her 1975 autobiography, Past Forgetting: My Love Affair with Dwight D. Eisenhower, was explicit about there being a romance, although it also said they had not actually had sexual intercourse. However she did not dictate the text. Past Forgetting was ghostwritten by Barbara Wyden while Summersby was dying of cancer. This book was contracted after Eisenhower had died in 1969. The text states the omission of the affair from the 1948 book was due to her concern for Eisenhower's privacy. Summersby reportedly stated shortly before her death: \\"The General is dead. I am dying. When I wrote Eisenhower Was My Boss in 1948, I omitted many things, changed some details, glossed over others to disguise as best I could the intimacy that had grown between General Eisenhower and me. It was better that way.\\" Those who dispute the claim of an affair maintain that the second book's description of the relationship was simply fabricated, presumably by the ghostwriter. By the book's account there were two unsuccessful attempts to have intercourse. Instead of sex, wrote Summersby, the affair mostly consisted of \\"stolen kisses\\" during walks or on aeroplanes, holding hands, and horseback riding or golfing together. She kept a note from Eisenhower that asked, \\"How about lunch, tea, & dinner today?\\" the note says. \\"If yes: Who else do you want, if any? At which time? How are you?\\" Eisenhower himself only mentioned Summersby once in Crusade in Europe, his 1948 memoir of the war, in a list of aides. Historian Carlo D'Este notes that members of Eisenhower's staff denied that there was ever an affair between them, and dismisses Summersby's book as \\"fanciful\\". However, rumours and jokes about their relationship were common among soldiers who did not know the two. Eisenhower's son John, who briefly served as an aide, described her as \\"the Mary Tyler Moore of headquarters. She was perky and she was cute. Whether she had any designs on the Old Man and the extent to which he succumbed, I just don't know.\\" Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery wrote in his diary that Past Forgetting \\"should have never been written, it can do Eisenhower no good. If American generals were in the habit of dealing with women secretaries and drivers as Eisenhower did and others appear to have done if this book is true, then their characters slump in the eyes of the world. This book makes it clear that Eisenhower discussed with Kay Summersby, his woman car driver, his views on Generals under him, and disclosed to her the most secret matters; all this is now given to the public in her book. Her views on world figures are enlightening, since they are obviously Eisenhower's views.\\" President Harry S. Truman reportedly told author Merle Miller that in 1945, Eisenhower asked permission from General George Marshall to divorce his wife to marry Summersby, but permission was refused. Truman also allegedly said he had the correspondence between Marshall and Eisenhower retrieved from the Army archives and destroyed.Miller, Merle, Plain Speaking: An Oral Biography of Harry S. Truman (1974) Putnam Publishing Group. . But Truman's account of the Summersby controversy has been rejected by most scholars. Historians say Truman had a mistaken recollection, and emphasise that Eisenhower had asked permission to bring his wife to England. Others have speculated that Truman was not truthful about Eisenhower because of animosity between the two men that intensified during the Eisenhower presidency (Truman stated that Eisenhower did not invite him back to the White House during his administration). Historian Robert H. Ferrell stated he found that the tapes of Miller's interviews with Truman contain no mention whatever of Summersby, and concludes that Miller concocted the story. Eisenhower biographer Jean Edward Smith wrote, \\"Whether he and Kay were intimate remains a matter of conjecture. But there is no question they were in love.\\" He accepted Miller's account because Garrett Mattingly, who as a naval officer in Washington censored outgoing cables, told a similar story to his Columbia University faculty colleagues in the early 1950s. Smith cited several other people who believed in or were told of the existence of an affair. Omar Bradley in his autobiography wrote that the two were in love and that \\"Their close relationship is quite accurately portrayed, so far as my personal knowledge extends, in Kay's second book, Past Forgetting.\\"Ike: The War Years (1979) by ABC Circle Films (www.imdb.com/title/tt0078628/?ref_=ur_urv) Awards and honours *Bronze Star Medal *Women's Army Corps Service Medal *European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with one silver and two bronze campaign stars *World War II Victory Medal *Army of Occupation Medal with \\"GERMANY\\" clasp *British Empire Medal (United Kingdom) *Defence Medal (United Kingdom) *War Medal 1939-1945 (United Kingdom) *Six overseas service bars See also *Jean Gordon – The alleged mistress of George S.

Part of the metropolitan area of London and the Greater London Urban Area, it is adjacent to the northern boundary of the London Borough of Redbridge, around north-east of Charing Cross. The area developed following the opening of a railway line in 1856, originally part of the Eastern Counties Railway and now on the Central line of the London Underground. History The first mention of Buckhurst Hill is in 1135, when reference was made to \\"La Bocherste\\", becoming in later years \\"Bucket Hill\\", originally meaning a hill covered with beech trees. It lay in Epping Forest and consisted of only a few scattered houses along the ancient road from Woodford to Loughton. Before the building of the railways, Buckhurst Hill was on the stagecoach route between London and Cambridge, Norwich, Bury St Edmunds and Dunmow. Originally it was a part of the parish of Chigwell; there was no road connecting the two communities and in order to get to church, parishioners had to ford the River Roding at Woodford.[A History of the County of Essex: Volume 4: Ongar Hundred. W R Powell (Editor), 1956 (pp 18–22) http://www.british- history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=15534] The Parish Church of St John was built in 1838 as a chapel of ease but Buckhurst Hill did not become a separate ecclesiastical parish until 1867. St John's National School was also built in 1838. The lord of the manor gave a site next to the church; the building cost £209, most of which was donated by the church congregation. The opening of Buckhurst Hill station in 1856 saw a rapid expansion in the population of the area; nearly six hundred new houses had been built near the station by 1871, leading to the opening of the Prince's Road school in 1872. Some of the land for this expansion was enclosed from Epping Forest, before this practice was halted by the Epping Forest Act, 1878. The civil parish of Buckhurst Hill became Buckhurst Hill Urban District in 1894. In 1933, it was merged with the Chigwell and Loughton Urban District to form the Chigwell Urban District. A further merger with Epping Urban District, Waltham Holy Cross Urban District and most of Epping and Ongar Rural District in 1974 brought Buckhurst Hill into Epping Forest District, and in 1996, Buckhurst Hill Parish Council was established as a first tier of local government. Geography It is at the western edge of Essex, 10.7 miles (17.2 km) northeast of Charing Cross and bordering the London Borough of Redbridge. Parts of Epping Forest in Buckhurst Hill are intermingled with residential areas. Transport Buckhurst Hill is served by two London Underground stations: Buckhurst Hill (in London fare zone 5) and Roding Valley (in London fare zone 4), which are on the Central Line. The line directly links the area to central London, as well as local areas including Woodford, South Woodford, Leytonstone, Epping and Loughton. Also, from nearby Chingford station, services can be used to reach London Liverpool Street via Walthamstow and Hackney. Bus service 397 can be used to reach Chingford station. Most bus routes serving Buckhurst Hill are London Buses services (despite being outside the London Buses zone). Sport Buckhurst Hill Cricket Club Loughton Rugby Union Football Club has its clubhouse and pitches on Hornbeam Rd at the south of the town. Buckhurst Hill Football Club is on Roding Lane at the east of the town. Buckhurst Hill Cricket Club plays in the Shepherd Neame Essex League, and fields four Saturday XIs, two Sunday XIs, and teams in a junior section. The club plays at two cricket fields: one off Roding Lane at the east of the town; and one at the edge of Powell's Forest (part of Epping Forest), off High Road at the north of the town. Education Primary schools in Buckhurst Hill include St John's, a CofE, (Church of England) school and Whitebridge Primary School. Braeside School is an independent school. Media Buckhurst Hill was featured on the ITV1 series Essex Wives, a programme about women in the area who were in business or fairly well-off. Filming for The Only Way Is Essex takes place at a beauty salon in Queens Road.

Biography Dillema was named \\"athlete of the match\\" in 1949 after winning the 100 metres and 200 metres race during a tournament in London. She was an important rival for another Dutch athlete Fanny Blankers- Koen, who won four gold medals during the 1948 Summer Olympics and who was voted \\"Female Athlete of the Century\\" by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) in 1999. In 1950 Dillema was banned from competition for life by the IAAF. Dillema had refused to go to a mandatory sex test for the European championships in Brussels in August 1950. Dillema was the first subject of a mandatory gender verification. The IAAF introduced mandatory sex verification in 1950 and continued this practice until 1992. Dillema's national record of 24.1 seconds for the 200 metres was erased. On 13 July 1950, Dillema was stopped on her way to an international meeting in France by the Dutch athletics authorities and expelled for life from competition. She returned home to Friesland and did not leave her house for at least one year. She lived a quiet life in her home town afterwards and always refused to speak on the subject.Dohle, M. (2008) Het verwoeste leven van Foekje Dillema: de grootste tragedie uit de Nederlandse sportgeschiedenis, Arbeiderspers, Dillema, having the typical female phenotype, was designated female at birth, raised as a girl and lived her life as a woman. After her death a forensic test on body cells obtained from her clothing showed signs of a Y-chromosome in her DNA. She may have been a genetic mosaic, having cells with either 46,XX (female) or 46,XY (male) chromosomes, in approximately a one-to-one ratio, in her skin. The forensic report speculated that Dillema developed from a zygote with an XXY genotype that promptly divided into a half XX, half XY embryo through nondisjunction. Dillema was probably a 46XX/46XY woman. This is also known as ovotesticular disorder of sex development (DSD) or true hermaphroditism.Andere Tijden Sport – Het mysterie Foekje Dillema. NOS Dutch broadcast 2008 Her biographer Max Dohle concludes that Dillema, having a Y-chromosome, would never have been allowed to race in the last 45 years. The Barr body test (1966) as well as the test based on PCR (1992) scan for a Y-chromosome or an SRY-gene on the Y-chromosome. All female athletes with a Y-chromosome were expelled from competition from 1966 until 2011. At the end of the century, renowned institutions worldwide protested against the viewpoint of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), causing the mandatory gender test based on the Y chromosome to be abandoned. In case of doubt an athlete with a hyperandrogenic syndrome can still be tested, by a multidisciplinary medical team, during a large tournament like the Olympic Games. The IAAF and the IOC test testosterone levels since May 2011. An athlete with hyperandrogenism not having CAIS will not be allowed to compete without a suitable medical treatment. Dohle concludes that Dillema was an intersex individual who had ovotesticular DSD. She had an operation on her glands in 1952. During the operation, testes or ovotestes were removed. The SRY-gene on the Y is the testis determining factor, so Dillema may have had infertile testes or ovotestes palpable in her groin. These ovotestes produce more testosterone than ovaries. Higher testosterone levels were considered unfair towards the competition, despite being an entirely natural feature of Dillema's physiology.

Hilton, A Mad, Bad, & Dangerous People? (Oxford 2008) p. 174 with the object of publishing information to people who were unable to obtain formal teaching or who preferred self- education. A Whiggish London organisation that published inexpensive texts intended to adapt scientific and similarly high-minded material for the rapidly-expanding reading public, it was wound up in 1848. Lecture-Hall of the Greenwich Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge at its opening on 15 February 1843 An American group of the same name was founded as part of the Lyceum movement in the United States in 1829. Its Boston branch sponsored lectures by such speakers as Ralph Waldo Emerson and was active from 1829 to 1947. In 1838 and 1839, an American Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge published a fifty-volume set of books called The American School Library. Henry David Thoreau cites the Society in his essay \\"Walking\\" in which he jestingly proposes a Society for the Diffusion of Useful Ignorance.Thoreau's Walking – 3 Aims SDUK publications were intended for the working class and the middle class, as an antidote to the more radical output of the pauper presses. The society set out to achieve this by acting as an intermediary between authors and publishers by launching several series of publications. It was run by a committee of eminent persons, and had a close association with the newly formed University College London, as well as the numerous provincial Mechanics' Institutes. Its printers included Baldwin & Cradock, later succeeded by Charles Knight. The Society commissioned work and dealt with the printers, and finally distributed the publications; profits were used to continue the Society's work. Development While conceived with high ideals the project gradually failed, as subscribers fell away and sale of publications declined. Charles Knight was largely responsible for what success SDUK publications did have; he engaged in extensive promotional campaigns, and worked to improve the readability of the sometimes abstruse material.Secord, Victorian Sensation, pp 48–50 Nonetheless many of the titles had little interest to readers, though the Penny Magazine at its peak had a circulation of around 200,000 copies a week. The Society eventually wound up in 1848, though some of its works apparently continued to be published. The archives of the Society are in the possession of University College, London. The Society was not without opposition, and the Literary Gazette mounted a campaign on behalf of the book trade, supported by publications such as the Royal Lady's Magazine, who complained in the early 1830s that: > Few persons are aware that the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge > have done, and are still doing, more to ruin the Book trade than all the > change of times, the want of money, the weight of taxes, and even the law of > Libel have accomplished; yet they – a committee of Noblemen and pretended > Patriots – are permitted to go on in their unfeeling, nay, considering the > hundreds of thousands engaged in the Book trade, we may add brutal, career, > without interruption.The Royal Lady's Magazine Publications =Library of Useful Knowledge= One significant set of publications by the SDUK was the Library of Useful Knowledge;Library of Useful Knowledge (Baldwin & Craddock; then Charles Knight) - Book Series List, publishinghistory.com.

However, attempts to reach the working class market were largely unsuccessful; only among the middle class was there sustained interest in popular science texts. Like many other works in the new genre of popular scientific narratives—such as the Bridgewater Treatises and Humphry Davy's Consolations in Travel—the books of the Library of Useful Knowledge focused on natural theology and imbued scientific fields with concepts of progress: uniformitarianism in geology, the nebular hypothesis in astronomy, and the scala naturae in the life sciences. According to historian James A. Secord, such works met a demand for \\"general concepts and simple laws\\", and in the process helped establish the authority of professional science and specialised scientific disciplines.Secord, Victorian Sensation, pp 55–62; quotation from p 55. =Other SDUK publications= Map of Naples published by SDUK *Maps, primarily in a two-volume set, and prepared to a very high standard (many drawn by W.B.

(Franz Schubert is occasionally added to the list.) In German-speaking countries, the term Wiener Klassik (lit. Viennese classical era/art) is used. That term is often more broadly applied to the Classical era in music as a whole, as a means to distinguish it from other periods that are colloquially referred to as classical, namely Baroque and Romantic music. The term \\"Viennese School\\" was first used by Austrian musicologist Raphael Georg Kiesewetter, in 1834, although he only counted Haydn and Mozart as members of the school. Other writers followed suit and eventually Beethoven was added to the list. The designation \\"first\\" is added today to avoid confusion with the Second Viennese School. With the exception of Schubert, these composers certainly knew each other, with Haydn and Mozart even being occasional chamber-music partners. Yet they did not form a school in the sense of a deliberate co-operation associated with 20th-century schools, such as the Second Viennese School, or Les Six. Nor is there any evidence that one composer was \\"schooled\\" by another, in the way that Berg and Webern were taught by Schoenberg, although it is true that Beethoven for a time received lessons from Haydn. Attempts to extend the First Viennese School to include such later figures as Anton Bruckner, Johannes Brahms, and Gustav Mahler are merely journalistic, and never encountered in academic musicology.

She has been the host of the American version of the CBS reality-television program Big Brother since its debut in July 2000 and is the longest-serving host of any country's version of the show. Chen Moonves was a co-host and the moderator of the CBS Daytime talk show, The Talk, for eight seasons. Previously, she was a co-anchor of The Early Show on CBS. Early life The daughter of Chinese immigrants, Julie Chen was born in Queens, New York City. Her grandfather, Lou Gaw Tong, grew up \\"dirt poor\\" in the rural village of Penglai in the Fujian province of China, but became wealthy through a chain of grocery stores and ultimately became a polygamist with nine wives and 11 children. Julie has two older sisters, Gladys and Victoria.Dec 10 episode of The Talk. Chen attended junior high school in the Whitestone area of Queens.194 Chen went on to graduate from St. Francis Preparatory School in 1987. She attended the University of Southern California and graduated in 1991, majoring in broadcast journalism and English. Career One of her earlier jobs came in June 1990, interning at CBS Morning News alongside Andy Cohen the series which she would anchor a decade later where she answered phones and copied faxes for distribution. The following year, while still in school, she worked for ABC NewsOne for one season as a desk assistant. She was subsequently promoted to work as a producer for the next three years. The following year, she relocated to Dayton, Ohio, to work as a local news reporter for WDTN-TV, from 1995 to 1997. In 2015, Chen revealed on The Talk that during her time in Dayton her news director had told her that she would never become a news anchor because of her \\"Asian eyes\\". After a \\"big-time agent\\" agreed and advised her to get plastic surgery, she made the decision to have a surgical procedure to reduce the epicanthic folds of her eyes. From 1999 to 2002, Chen was the anchor of CBS Morning News and news anchor of CBS This Morning and later The Early Show, alongside Bryant Gumbel, Jane Clayson, Hannah Storm, Harry Smith, Maggie Rodriguez, Erica Hill, and Rene Syler. From 2002 to 2010, she was a co-host of The Early Show on CBS, before leaving the daily position but remaining as a special contributing anchor of the program until its cancelation. Before CBS News, she was a reporter and weekend anchor at WCBS-TV in New York City. 209x209px Since 2000, she has also been the host of the American version of Big Brother. During the first season (2000), Chen was widely criticized for her heavily scripted, wooden delivery in her interaction with the studio audience and in the interviews on the live programs, earning her the nickname \\"Chenbot.\\" She has indicated in two interviews that she takes no personal offense at the term, adding that it may derive from her \\"precise on-air style\\" which comes from \\"a desire to be objective.\\" She again acknowledged the nickname while discussing mugs made in her likeness when she proudly proclaimed, \\"I am the Chenbot!\\" in a segment on The Early Show. Chen was the moderator and co-host of the CBS Daytime talk show, The Talk, which premiered on October 18, 2010. The show featured Chen, the show creator Sara Gilbert, Sharon Osbourne, Leah Remini, Holly Robinson Peete and Marissa Jaret Winokur. On September 18, 2018, Chen announced in a prerecorded tape that she would not be returning to The Talk because she needed \\"to spend more time at home with [her] husband\\", after a number of sexual assault allegations surfaced against her husband Les Moonves. Personal life Following her graduation from the University of Southern California as a broadcasting and English major, she became a news assistant for ABC News in Los Angeles, in September 1991. There, she met her future longtime boyfriend, television news editor Gary Donahue, though their relationship did not last. She began dating Les Moonves, president and chief executive officer of CBS Television, during his marriage to Nancy Wiesenfeld Moonves, and on April 22, 2003, a week after Les Moonves signed a five-year, multimillion-dollar contract with Viacom, his wife filed for divorce in Los Angeles Superior Court citing irreconcilable differences. Divorce proceedings were delayed for almost two years because of financial settlement disagreements.

The Authority also works to prevent water pollution as much as is practicable along the Kentucky River Basin, in large measure because the stream is the source of the drinking water for approximately one-sixth of all Kentucky residents.

The best known, longest-lasting, and most influential of the four was the third, which was published regularly from 1802 to 1929.  Edinburgh Review, 1755–56  The first Edinburgh Review was a short-lived venture initiated in 1755 by the Select Society, a group of Scottish men of letters concerned with the Enlightenment goals of social and intellectual improvement. According to the preface of the inaugural issue, the journal's purpose was to \\"demonstrate 'the progressive state of learning in this country' and thereby to incite Scots 'to a more eager pursuit of learning, to distinguish themselves, and to do honour to their country.'\\" As a means to these ends, it would \\"give a full account of all books published in Scotland within the compass of half a year; and ... take some notice of such books published elsewhere, as are most read in this country, or seem to have any title to draw the public attention.\\" Among the most notable of the foreign publications it observed was Jean-Jacques Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality, which Adam Smith reviewed in the journal's second and final issue, published in March 1756.

He was briefly the leader of Manitoba's Conservative parliamentary caucus in 1894, and later served as a cabinet minister in the governments of Hugh John Macdonald and Rodmond Roblin. Davidson was born in Thamesford, Canada West (now Ontario). He moved to Manitoba in 1871, and became a mill owner and general merchant, also serving on the Protestant school board. Manitoba's boundaries were expanded in 1881, and Davidson was elected to the provincial legislature in a by-election as the first member for Dauphin. A Liberal, he defeated his sole opponent, P.S. St. Clair McGregor, 148 votes to 17. Party affiliations were fluid in Manitoba in this period, and by the general election of 1883 Davidson was identifying himself as a Liberal- Conservative, and a supporter of Premier John Norquay. He was re-elected in Dauphin without opposition. Following redistribution, Davidson campaigned in the Beautiful Plains constituency for the provincial election of 1886. The Liberals saw their support rise in this campaign, and Davidson (now a Conservative) lost to Liberal John Crawford by thirty votes. Crawford again defeated Davidson in the 1888 election, this time by twenty-four votes. Provincial support for the Conservatives recovered slightly in the 1892 election, and Davidson defeated Crawford by sixteen votes in their third encounter. The opposition caucus to which he belonged initially chose William Alexander Macdonald as its leader. When Macdonald's constituency election was overturned in 1893, Davidson was chosen in his place. He made his first speech as leader of the opposition in January 1894. Davidson was a moderate figure, whose interventions were respected by the province's Liberal leadership. He did not serve as opposition leader for long. His constituency victory was also overturned on April 17, 1894, and he was subsequently defeated by John Forsyth of the Patrons of Industry in a by-election. After his loss, the leadership of the opposition seems to have fallen to James Fisher, an Independent MLA. Davidson again lost to a Patrons of Industry candidate in the 1896 election. Though the Conservatives returned to government in the 1899 election, Davidson was once again defeated in Beautiful Plains, losing to Liberal Robert Ennis by ninety votes. He was, nonetheless, appointed to cabinet by Premier Hugh John Macdonald in January 1900, serving as Provincial Treasurer, Minister of Agriculture, and Provincial Lands Commissioner. Ennis was persuaded to resign his seat the following month, and Crawford was returned to the legislature in a by-election. Rodmond Roblin took the Agriculture portfolio for himself on becoming Premier in late 1900, but kept Davidson in his other two positions. Within a year, Davidson had eliminated the debt accumulated during the previous administration of Thomas Greenway. Davidson was re-elected in the 1903 election, but died shortly after the election.

English dictionary definitions of Late Latin date this period from the 3rd to the 6th centuries AD, and continuing into the 7th century in the Iberian Peninsula. This somewhat ambiguously defined version of Latin was used between the eras of Classical Latin and Medieval Latin. There is no scholarly consensus about exactly when Classical Latin should end or Medieval Latin should begin. However, Late Latin is characterized (with variations and disputes) by an identifiable style. Being a written language, Late Latin is not the same as Vulgar Latin. The latter served as ancestor of the Romance languages. Although Late Latin reflects an upsurge of the use of Vulgar Latin vocabulary and constructs, it remains largely classical in its overall features, depending on the author who uses it. Some Late Latin writings are more literary and classical, but others are more inclined to the vernacular. Also, Late Latin is not identical to Christian patristic Latin, used in the theological writings of the early Christian fathers. While Christian writings used a subset of Late Latin, pagans also wrote extensively in Late Latin, especially in the early part of the period. Late Latin formed when large numbers of non-Latin-speaking peoples on the borders of the empire were being subsumed and assimilated, and the rise of Christianity was introducing a heightened divisiveness in Roman society, creating a greater need for a standard language for communicating between different socioeconomic registers and widely separated regions of the sprawling empire. A new and more universal speech evolved from the main elements: Classical Latin, Christian Latin, which featured (ordinary speech) in which the people were to be addressed,Auerbach (1958), Chapter 1, Sermo Humilis. and all the various dialects of Vulgar Latin. The linguist Antoine Meillet wrote, \\"Without the exterior appearance of the language being much modified, Latin became in the course of the imperial epoch a new language\\",Meillet (1928), p.270: \\"Sans que l'aspect extérieur de la langue se soit beaucoup modifié, le Latin est devenu au cours de l'epoque impériale une langue nouvelle}\\", and, \\"Serving as some sort of lingua franca to a large empire, Latin tended to become simpler, to keep above all what it had of the ordinary\\".Meillet (1928), p. 273: \\"Servant en quelque sorte de lingua franca à un grand empire, le Latin a tendu à se simplifier, à garder surtout ce qu'il avait de banal\\". Philological constructs =Late and post-classical Latin= Neither Late Latin nor Late Antiquity are modern terms or concepts; neither are they ancient; their origin remains obscure. A notice in Harper's New Monthly Magazine of the publication of Andrews' Freund's Lexicon of the Latin Language in 1850 mentions that the dictionary divides Latin into ante- classic, quite classic, Ciceronian, Augustan, post-Augustan and post-classic or late Latin, which indicates the term already was in professional use by English classicists in the early 19th century. Instances of English vernacular use of the term may also be found from the 18th century. The term Late Antiquity meaning post-classical and pre-medieval had currency in English well before then. =Imperial Latin= Wilhelm Sigismund Teuffel's first edition (1870) of History of Roman Literature defined an early period, the Golden Age, the Silver Age and then goes on to define other ages first by dynasty and then by century (see under Classical Latin). In subsequent editions he subsumed all periods under three headings: the First Period (Old Latin), the Second Period (the Golden Age) and the Third Period, \\"the Imperial Age\\", subdivided into the Silver Age, the 2nd century, and Centuries 3–6 together, which was a recognition of Late Latin, as he sometimes refers to the writings of those times as \\"late.\\" Imperial Latin went on into English literature; Fowler's History of Roman Literature mentions it in 1903. There are, however, insoluble problems with the beginning and end of Imperial Latin. Politically the excluded Augustan Period is the paradigm of imperiality, and yet the style cannot be bundled with either the Silver Age or with Late Latin. Moreover, in 6th century Italy, the Roman Empire no longer existed; the rule of Gothic kings prevailed. Subsequently, the term Imperial Latin was dropped by historians of Latin literature, although it may be seen in marginal works. The Silver Age was extended a century and the final four centuries represent Late Latin. =Christian, patristic, vulgate and ancient Latin= =Low Latin= St. Gildas, one of a number of Late Latin writers to promulgate an excidium or ruina Britanniae because of moral turpitude. Low Latin is a vague and often pejorative term that might refer to any post-classical Latin from Late Latin through Renaissance Latin depending on the author. Its origins are obscure but the Latin expression media et infima Latinitas sprang into public notice in 1678 in the title of a Glossary (by today's standards a dictionary) by Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange. The multi-volume set had many editions and expansions by other authors subsequently. The title varies somewhat; most commonly used was Glossarium Mediae et Infimae Latinitatis. It has been translated by expressions of widely different meanings. The uncertainty is understanding what media, \\"middle\\", and infima, \\"low\\", mean in this context. The media is securely connected to Medieval Latin by Cange's own terminology expounded in the Praefatio, such as scriptores mediae aetatis, \\"writers of the middle age.\\" Cange's Glossary takes words from authors ranging from the Christian period (Late Latin) to the Renaissance, dipping into the classical period if a word originated there. Either media et infima Latinitas refers to one age, which must be the middle age covering the entire post-classical range, or it refers to two consecutive periods, infima Latinitas and media Latinitas. Both interpretations have their adherents. Edward Gibbon, English historian who espoused the concept of a decline of the Roman Empire resulting in its fall. In the former case the infimae appears extraneous; it recognizes the corruptio of the corrupta Latinitas Cange said his Glossary covered. The two-period case postulates a second unity of style, infima Latinitas, translated into English as \\"Low Latin\\" (which in the one-period case would be identical to media Latinitas). Cange in the glossarial part of his Glossary identifies some words as being used by purioris Latinitatis scriptores, such as Cicero (of the Golden Age). He has already said in the Preface that he rejects the ages scheme used by some: Golden Age, Silver Age, Brass Age, Iron Age. A second category are the inferioris Latinitatis scriptores, such as Apuleius (Silver Age). The third and main category are the infimae Latinitatis scriptores, who must be post-classical; that is, Late Latin, unless they are also medieval. His failure to state which authors are low leaves the issue unresolved. He does however give some idea of the source of his infima, which is a classical word, \\"lowest\\", of which the comparative degree is inferior, \\"lower.\\" In the Preface he opposes the style of the scriptores aevi inferioris (Silver Age) to the elegantes sermones, \\"elegant speech\\", the high and low styles of Latinitas defined by the classical authors. Apparently Cange was basing his low style on sermo humilishttps://sermohumilis.com, the simplified speech devised by Late Latin Christian writers to address the ordinary people. Humilis (humble, humility) means \\"low\\", \\"of the ground\\". The Christian writers were not interested in the elegant speech of the best or classical Latin, which belonged to their aristocratic pagan opponents. Instead they preferred a humbler style lower in correctness, so that they might better deliver the gospel to the vulgus or \\"common people.\\" Low Latin in this view is the Latin of the two periods in which it has the least degree of purity, or is most corrupt. By corrupt du Cange only meant that the language had resorted to non- classical vocabulary and constructs from various sources, but his choice of words was unfortunate. It allowed the \\"corruption\\" to extend to other aspects of society, providing fuel for the fires of religious (Catholic vs. Protestant) and class (conservative vs. revolutionary) conflict. Low Latin passed from the heirs of the Italian renaissance to the new philologists of the northern and Germanic climes, where it became a different concept. In Britain Gildas' view that Britain fell to the Anglo-Saxons because it was morally slack was already well known to the scholarly world. The northern Protestants now worked a role reversal: if the language was \\"corrupt\\" it must be symptomatic of a corrupt society, which indubitably led to a \\"decline and fall\\", as Edward Gibbon put it, of imperial society. Writers taking this line relied heavily on the scandalous behavior of the Julio-Claudian dynasty and the bad emperors reported by Tacitus and other writers and later by the secret history of Procopius, who hated his royal employers to such a degree that he could not contain himself about their real methods and way of life any longer. They, however, spoke elegant Latin. The Protestants changed the scenario to fit their ideology that the church needed to be purified of corruption. For example, Baron Bielfeld, a Prussian officer and comparative Latinist, characterised the low in Low Latin, which he saw as medieval Latin, as follows: As 'Low Latin' tends to be muddled with Vulgar Latin, Late Latin and Medieval Latin and has unfortunate extensions of meaning into the sphere of socioeconomics, it has gone out of use by the mainstream philologists of Latin literature. A few writers on the periphery still mention it, influenced by the dictionaries and classic writings of former times. Tertullian Cyprian As Teuffel's scheme of the Golden Age and the Silver Age is the generally accepted one, the canonical list of authors should begin just after the end of the Silver Age, regardless of what 3rd century event is cited as the beginning; otherwise there are gaps. Teuffel gave the end of the Silver Age as the death of Hadrian at 138 AD. His classification of styles left a century between that event and his final period, the 3rd–6th centuries BC, which was in other systems being considered Late Antiquity. Starting with Charles Thomas Crutwell's A History of Roman Literature from the Earliest Period to the Death of Marcus Aurelius, which first came out in 1877, English literary historians have included the spare century in Silver Latin. Accordingly, the latter ends with the death of the last of the five good emperors in 180 AD. Other authors use other events, such as the end of the Nervan–Antonine dynasty in 192 AD or later events. A good round date of 200 AD gives a canonical list of nearly no overlap. The transition between Late Latin and Medieval Latin is by no means as easy to assess. Taking that media et infima Latinitas was one style, Mantello in a recent handbook asserts of \\"the Latin used in the middle ages\\" that it is \\"here interpreted broadly to include late antiquity and therefore to extend from c. AD 200 to 1500.\\" Although recognizing \\"late antiquity\\" he does not recognize Late Latin. It did not exist and Medieval Latin began directly at 200 BC. In this view all differences from Classical Latin are bundled as though they evolved through a single continuous style. Of the two- style interpretations the Late Latin period of Erich Auerbach and others is one of the shortest: \\"In the first half of the 6th century, which witnessed the beginning and end of Ostrogoth rule in Italy, Latin literature becomes medieval. Boethius was the last 'ancient' author and the role of Rome as the center of the ancient world, as communis patria, was at an end.\\"Auerbach (1965), p.85. In essence, the lingua franca of classical vestiges was doomed when Italy was overrun by the Goths, but its momentum carried it one lifetime further, ending with the death of Boethius in AD 524. Not everyone agrees that the lingua franca came to an end with the fall of Rome, but argue that it continued and became the language of the reinstituted Carolingian Empire (predecessor of the Holy Roman Empire) under Charlemagne. Toward the end of his reign his administration conducted some language reforms. The first recognition that Late Latin could not be understood by the masses and therefore was not a lingua franca was the decrees of 813 AD by synods at Mainz, Rheims Tours that from then on preaching was to be done in a language more understandable to the people, which was stated by Tours Canon 17 as rustica Romana lingua, identified as proto-Romance, the descendant of Vulgar Latin. Late Latin as defined by Meillet was at an end; however, Pucci's Harrington's Mediaeval Latin sets the end of Late Latin when Romance began to be written, \\"Latin retired to the cloister\\" and \\"Romanitas lived on only in the fiction of the Holy Roman Empire.\\" The final date given by those authors is AD 900. =Through the death of Boethius= Constantine the Great Ausonius Ambrose * Domitius Ulpianus (170 AD – 228 AD), jurist, imperial officer * Julius Paulus Prudentissimus (2nd & 3rd centuries AD), jurist, imperial officer * Aelius Marcianus (2nd & 3rd centuries AD), jurist * Herennius Modestinus (3rd century AD), jurist * Censorinus (3rd century AD), historian, essayist * Quintus Gargilius Martialis (3rd century AD), horticulturalist, pharmacologist * Gaius Asinius Quadratus (3rd century AD), historian * Quintus Septimius Florens Tertullianus (AD 160 - 220), \\"the father of Latin Christianity\\", polemicist against heresy * Thascius Caecilius Cyprianus (AD 200 - 258), converted rhetorician, bishop of Carthage, martyr, saint * Novatianus (200 AD – 258 AD), theologian, rival pope, excommunicant * Quintus Serenus Sammonicus (2nd century AD, early 3rd century AD), scholar, educator * Commodianus (3rd century AD), poet, Christian educator * Lucius Caelius Firmianus Lactantius (AD 240 - 320), converted rhetorician, scholar, Christian apologist and educator * Ammianus Marcellinus (4th century AD), soldier, imperial officer, historian * Claudius Claudianus (4th century AD), court poet * Gaius Julius Solinus (3rd or 4th century AD), topical writer * Nonius Marcellus (3rd or 4th century AD), topical writer * Marcus Aurelius Olympius Nemesianus (fl. 283 AD), poet * Aquila Romanus (3rd century AD), rhetorician * Eumenius of Autun (3rd century AD), educator * Aelius Festus Aphthonius (3rd or 4th century AD), grammarian * Calcidius (4th century AD), translator * Gaius Marius Victorinus (4th century AD), converted philosopher * Arnobius of Sicca (4th century), Christian apologist * Constantine I (272 AD – 337 AD), first Christian emperor * Nazarius (4th century AD), rhetorician, educator * Gaius Julius Victor (4th century AD), rhetorician * Gaius Vettius Aquilinus Juvencus (4th century AD), Christian poet * Nonius Marcellus (3rd and 4th centuries AD), grammarian, lexicographer * Julius Firmicus Maternus (4th century AD), converted advocate, pagan and Christian writer * Aelius Donatus (4th century AD), grammarian, rhetorician, educator * Palladius (408/431 AD – 457/461 AD), saint, first bishop of Ireland * Sextus Aurelius Victor (AD 320 - 390), imperial officer, historian * Eutropius (4th century AD), imperial officer, historian * Aemilius Magnus Arborius (4th century AD), poet, educator, friend of the imperial family * Decimius Magnus Ausonius (ca. 310 AD – 395 AD), poet, rhetorician, educator, friend of the imperial family * Claudius Mamertinus (4th century AD), imperial officer, panegyricist, embezzler * Hilarius (4th century AD), converted neo-Platonist, theologian, bishop of Poitiers, saint * Ambrosius (337/340 AD – 397 AD), theologian, Bishop of Milan, saint * Lucifer (d. 370/371 AD), theologian, Bishop of Sardinia * Priscillianus (d. 385 AD), theologian, first person executed as a heretic * Flavius Sosipater Charisius (4th century AD), grammarian * Diomedes Grammaticus (4th century AD), grammarian * Postumius Rufus Festus Avienus (4th century AD), imperial officer, poet, translator * Priscianus Caesariensis ( AD 500), grammarian See also * Decline of the Roman Empire * Panegyrici Latini, a collection of 3rd to 4th century panegyrics; their language is however predominantly classical (Golden Age) Latin base, derived from an education heavy on Cicero, mixed with a large number of Silver Age usages and a small number of Late and Vulgar terms.

The theory by itself was among the first to go against the psychometric approach to intelligence and take a more cognitive approach, which leaves it to the category of the cognitive-contextual theories https://www.britannica.com/science/human-intelligence-psychology/Cognitive- contextual-theories. The three meta components are also called triarchic components. Sternberg's definition of human intelligence is \\"(a) mental activity directed toward purposive adaptation to, selection and shaping of, real-world environments relevant to one's life\\". Thus, Sternberg viewed intelligence as how well an individual deals with environmental changes throughout their lifespan. Sternberg's theory comprises three parts: componential, experiential, and practical. Different components of information processing Schematic illustrating one trial of each stimulus pool in the Sternberg task: letter, word, object, spatial, grating. Sternberg associated the workings of the mind with a series of components. These components he labeled the metacomponents, performance components, and knowledge-acquisition components. The metacomponents are executive processes used in problem solving and decision making that involve the majority of managing our mind. They tell the mind how to act. Metacomponents are also sometimes referred to as a homunculus. A homunculus is a fictitious or metaphorical \\"person\\" inside our head that controls our actions, and which is often seen to invite an infinite regress of homunculi controlling each other. Sternberg's next set of components, performance components, are the processes that actually carry out the actions the metacomponents dictate. These are the basic processes that allow us to do tasks, such as perceiving problems in our long-term memory, perceiving relations between objects, and applying relations to another set of terms. The last set of components, knowledge-acquisition components, are used in obtaining new information. These components complete tasks that involve selectively choosing relevant information from a mix of information, some of it relevant and some of it irrelevant. These components can also be used to selectively combine the various pieces of information they have gathered. Gifted individuals are proficient in using these components because they are able to learn new information at a greater rate. Whereas Sternberg explains that the basic information processing components underlying the three parts of his triarchic theory are the same, different contexts and different tasks require different kinds of intelligence. =Componential – analytical subtheory= This form of intelligence focuses on academic proficiency. Sternberg associated the componential subtheory with analytical giftedness. This is one of three types of giftedness that Sternberg recognizes. Analytical giftedness is influential in being able to take apart problems and being able to see solutions not often seen. Unfortunately, individuals with only this type are not as adept at creating unique ideas of their own. This form of giftedness is the type that is tested most often. =Experiential – creative subtheory= This form of intelligence focuses on \\"capacity to be intellectually flexible and innovative. The experiential subtheory is the second stage of the triarchic theory. This stage deals mainly with how well a task is performed with regard to how familiar it is. Sternberg splits the role of experience into two parts: novelty and automation. A novel situation is one that you have never experienced before. People that are adept at managing a novel situation can take the task and find new ways of solving it that the majority of people would not notice. A process that has been automated has been performed multiple times and can now be done with little or no extra thought. Once a process is automatized, it can be run in parallel with the same or other processes. The problem with novelty and automation is that being skilled in one component does not ensure that you are skilled in the other. The experiential subtheory also correlates with another one of Sternberg's proposed types of giftedness. Synthetic giftedness is seen in creativity, intuition, and a study of the arts. People with synthetic giftedness are not often seen with the highest IQ's because there are not currently any tests that can sufficiently measure these attributes, but synthetic giftedness is especially useful in creating new ideas to create and solve new problems. Sternberg also associated another one of his students, \\"Barbara\\", to the synthetic giftedness. Barbara did not perform as well as Alice on the tests taken to get into school, but was recommended to Yale University based on her exceptional creative and intuitive skills. Barbara was later very valuable in creating new ideas for research. =Practical - contextual subtheory= Sternberg's third subtheory of intelligence, called practical or contextual, \\"deals with the mental activity involved in attaining fit to context\\". Through the three processes of adaptation, shaping, and selection, individuals create an ideal fit between themselves and their environment. This type of intelligence is often referred to as \\"street smarts.\\" Adaptation occurs when one makes a change within oneself in order to better adjust to one's surroundings. For example, when the weather changes and temperatures drop, people adapt by wearing extra layers of clothing to remain warm. Shaping occurs when one changes their environment to better suit one's needs. A teacher may invoke the new rule of raising hands to speak to ensure that the lesson is taught with least possible disruption. The process of selection is undertaken when a completely new alternate environment is found to replace the previous, unsatisfying environment to meet the individual's goals. For instance, immigrants leave their lives in their homeland countries where they endure economical and social hardships and go to other countries in search of a better and less strained life. The effectiveness with which an individual fits to his or her environment and contends with daily situations reflects degree of intelligence. Sternberg's third type of giftedness, called practical giftedness, involves the ability to apply synthetic and analytic skills to everyday situations. Practically gifted people are superb in their ability to succeed in any setting. An example of this type of giftedness is \\"Celia\\". Celia did not have outstanding analytical or synthetic abilities, but she \\"was highly successful in figuring out what she needed to do in order to succeed in an academic environment. She knew what kind of research was valued, how to get articles into journals, how to impress people at job interviews, and the like\\". Celia's contextual intelligence allowed her to use these skills to her best advantage. Sternberg also acknowledges that an individual is not restricted to having excellence in only one of these three intelligences. Many people may possess an integration of all three and have high levels of all three intelligences. Practical intelligence is also a topic covered by Malcolm Gladwell in his book Outliers: The Story of Success.Malcolm Gladwell. Outliers: The Story of Success. Criticism Psychologist Linda Gottfredson criticises the unempirical nature of triarchic theory. Further, she argues it is absurd to assert that traditional intelligence tests are not measuring practical intelligence, given that they show a moderate correlation with income, especially at middle age when individuals have had a chance to reach their maximum career potential, and an even higher correlation with occupational prestige, and that IQ tests predict the ability to stay out of jail and stay alive (all of which qualifies as practical intelligence or \\"street smarts\\"). Gottfredson claims that what Sternberg calls practical intelligence is not a broad aspect of cognition at all but simply a specific set of skills people learn to cope with a specific environment (task specific knowledge). There is evidence to suggest that certain aspects of creativity (i.e. divergent thinking) are separable from analytical intelligence, and are better accounted for by the cognitive process of executive functioning. More specifically, task-switching and interference management are suggested to play an important role in divergent thinking. A more recent meta-analysis found only small correlations between IQ and creativity. See also * Educational psychology * J. P.

Stig S. Bakken founded the PEAR project in 1999 to promote the re-use of code that performs common functions. The project seeks to provide a structured library of code, maintain a system for distributing code and for managing code packages, and promote a standard coding style. Though community- driven, the PEAR project has a PEAR Group which serves as the governing body and takes care of administrative tasks. Each PEAR code package comprises an independent project under the PEAR umbrella. It has its own development team, versioning-control and documentation. PEAR packages A PEAR package is distributed as a gzipped tar file. Each archive consists of source code written in PHP, . Many PEAR packages can readily be used by developers as ordinary third party code via simple include statements in PHP. More elegantly, the PEAR package manager which comes with PHP by default may be used to install PEAR packages so that the extra functionality provided by the package appears as an integrated part of the PHP installation. Unlike the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) archives, , PEAR packages do not have implicit dependencies so that a package's placement in the PEAR package tree does not relate to code dependencies. Rather, PEAR packages must explicitly declare all dependencies on other PEAR packages. The PEAR base classes contain code for simulating object-oriented destructors and consistent error-handling. Packages exist for many basic PHP functions including authentication, caching, database access, encryption, configuration, HTML, web services and XML. PEAR means “PHP Extension and Application Repository.” It is a framework and distribution system for reusable PHP components. It extends PHP and gives a higher level of programming for all web developers. PEAR is divided into three different classes that are: PEAR Core Components, PEAR Packages, and PECL Packages. The PEAR Packages include functionality giving for authentication, networking, and file system features and tools for working with HTML and XML templates.  PEAR package manager  The PEAR package manager provides a standardized way to install, uninstall, or upgrade with new PEAR packages or PECL extensions. Before installing a package it can also be instructed to take care of package dependencies so all the extra needed packages are installed too. The PEAR package manager is run from the command line using the \`pear\` command. Usually it is therefore only the server administrator who can alter the installed base of PEAR and PECL extensions. On PHP installations running on Linux, the PEAR package manager is ready for usage by default, but on Windows the PEAR package manager is only available after running a batch file called \`go-pear.bat\`.  PEAR2 Pyrus  With Pyrus an attempt was undertaken to redesign and improve PEAR from the ground up for PHP 5.3 or newer. Pyrus can be used to install packages from PEAR channels. The last release is from March 2011 and its development might have been discontinued due to the popularity of Composer.https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34199824/what-is-the-difference- between-pear-and-composer  PEAR and Composer  With Composer there is an alternative available for managing packages for a PHP project. Composer also supports the installation of PEAR packages.https://getcomposer.org/doc/05-repositories.md#pear Some people of the PHP community argue for replacing PEAR in favor of composer.http://fabien.potencier.org/the-rise-of-composer-and-the-fall-of- pear.html PECL The PHP Extension Community Library (PECL), (pronounced 'pickle') is conceptually very similar to PEAR, and indeed PECL modules are installed with the PEAR Package Manager. PECL contains C extensions for compiling into PHP. As C programs, PECL extensions run more efficiently than PEAR packages. PECL includes modules for XML-parsing, access to additional databases, mail-parsing, embedding Perl or Python in PHP scripts and for compiling PHP scripts. PECL spun off from the PEAR Project in October 2003. PECL extensions are documented alongside standard extensions within the PHP Manual, so there is no special manual for PECL extensions. Also, several extensions began their development cycle in PECL and ended up in core (the distributed PHP source) and in many of these cases the PECL versions become unmaintained.

Addresses were five characters long and allowed a maximum memory of 80,000 characters, much larger than the 16,000 characters permitted by the 1401's three character addresses. However, the 1410 could also be run in what was termed 1401 compatibility mode. On the 1410, this was accomplished in wired hardware - the machine literally turned into a 1401 with the flip of a switch. In addition, with care, it was possible to write source code in the Autocoder assembler language that could be used on either system, as nearly all 1401 instructions had exact 1410 equivalents, and had the same mnemonics. The later IBM 7010 used the same architecture as the 1410, but was implemented in 7000 series technology (see IBM 700/7000 series), and supported up to 100,000 characters of storage.

By definition, a bishop is an \\"overseer\\" of a community of the faithful, so when a priest is ordained a bishop, the tradition of the Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches is that he be ordained for a specific place. There are more bishops than there are functioning dioceses. Therefore, a priest appointed not to head a diocese as its diocesan bishop but to be an auxiliary bishop, a papal diplomat, or an official of the Roman Curia is appointed to a titular see. Roman Catholic Church In the Roman Catholic Church, a titular bishop is a bishop who is not in charge of a diocese.Code of Canon Law (1983), canon 376. Quote=Bishops to whom the care of some diocese is entrusted are called diocesan; others are called titular Examples of bishops belonging to this category are coadjutor bishops, auxiliary bishops, bishops emeriti, vicars apostolic, nuncios, superiors of departments in the Roman Curia, and cardinal bishops of suburbicarian dioceses (since they are not in charge of the suburbicarian dioceses). Most titular bishops hold the title to a titular see. Assigning titular sees serves two purposes. Since part of being a bishop means being the head of a Christian Church, titular sees serve that purpose for bishops without a diocese. At the same time, the office of titular bishop memorializes ancient Churches, most of which were suppressed because they fell into the hands of non-Christian conquerors. For this reason the former terminology was not \\"titular bishop\\" but \\"bishop in infidel regions\\" (in partibus infidelium). In recent times the names of titular sees are drawn also in numerous cases from those of former dioceses which were absorbed into other dioceses or expanded and hence moved to larger towns and cities. Since 1970, there are two more exceptions. Diocesan bishops who resign their see or are transferred to a non-diocesan appointment are no longer habitually transferred to a titular see. Instead, they take the title Bishop (or Archbishop) Emeritus of the last see. Also, coadjutors are no longer named to titular sees, instead taking the title Coadjutor Bishop (or Coadjutor Archbishop) of the see they will inherit. In other cases titular bishops still take a titular see. Beginning in 2019, titular sees are no longer being assigned to new Vicars Apostolic. When Francis Green was named Coadjutor Bishop of Tucson, Arizona, in 1960, his official title remained \\"Titular Bishop of Serra\\" until he succeeded Daniel James Gercke later that same year. However, when Gerald Kicanas became Coadjutor Bishop of Tucson in 2001, he ceased being Titular Bishop of Bela. He remained a titular bishop until he succeeded Manuel Moreno in 2003, but his official title changed from \\"Titular Bishop of Bela\\" to \\"Coadjutor Bishop of Tucson.\\" Cardinal Bishops of suburbicarian dioceses are also titular bishops, but unlike others, they hold titles to existing dioceses, namely one or more of the suburbicarian sees near Rome. While they do not govern their see, they are obliged to give it their patronage. Angelo Sodano, as Cardinal Bishop of Albano, is titular bishop of the see, while Bishop Marcello Semeraro is its actual diocesan bishop. The Cardinal Dean is by tradition Cardinal Bishop of Ostia, in addition to the suburbicarian see he previously held. Occasionally, the transfer of a diocesan bishop to a titular see has been used by the Holy See to strip of responsibilities a bishop whose behavior was disapproved. For instance, in 1995, Jacques Gaillot, known for his activism on Catholic-sensitive social and political topics (such as support for contraception and abortion), was transferred from the see of Évreux in France to Partenia, a titular see in Algeria, instead of becoming Bishop Emeritus of Évreux. Eastern Orthodox Church Titular bishops and titular metropolitans are often appointed in the Eastern Orthodox Church. In Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, titular bishops and metropolitans are usually appointed with titles of former dioceses in the regions of Thrace, Asia Minor and Pontus (now Turkey), that were often active until the Greek-Turkish population exchange of 1923. In Serbian Orthodox Church, titular bishops are usually appointed to serve as auxiliary bishops, assisting diocesan bishops in various fields of diocesan administration.Constitution of the Serbian Orthodox Church See also *Catholic Church hierarchy *Titular archbishop *List of Catholic titular sees  References  Literature Category:Episcopacy in the Catholic Church Category:Episcopacy in Eastern Orthodoxy Category:Bishops by type ","title":"Titular bishop"},{"id":"852582","text":"James Fisher (November 6, 1840 - March 8, 1927) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He may have served as leader of the parliamentary opposition in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba for a brief period in the mid-1890s. Born at Glenquaich in Perthshire, Scotland, Fisher moved to Canada West (now Ontario) in his youth. He was educated at the University of Toronto, and was a member of that body's Senate. In July 1875, Fisher contested a federal by-election in Perth North for the Liberals, losing to Conservative Andrew Monteith by 20 votes. He was defeated in the same riding in the general election of 1878. Fisher subsequently moved to Winnipeg, where he practised law and was a member of the University of Manitoba Council. In 1886, he ran for the provincial riding of Russell as a Liberal, losing to Conservative Edward Leacock by eight votes. He was easily elected in his second attempt for the seat, in the Liberal landslide victory of 1888. Fisher soon lost confidence in the government of Thomas Greenway, and crossed the floor to the opposition. He was re-elected without opposition in 1892, and appears to have served as the de facto leader of the opposition from 1894 to 1896. He did not identify himself as a Conservative, but sat among their ranks in parliament. Fisher was re- elected in 1896, but did not contest the election of 1899. In 1897, while still serving as a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA), he served in a Hudson's Bay Expedition unit.

It is often accompanied by traditional folk dances of Korea, known as hyangak jeongjae. These dances are performed in front of audiences—as opposed to the square dance more familiar to Westerners, which is primarily for the participants' enjoyment. One important hyangak piece is Yeomillak (hangul: 여민락; hanja: 與民樂). Few hyangak pieces are performed in Chinese style; these include Pollyeong, Haeryeong (hangul: 해령; hanja: 解令), and Poheoja  History  During the Unified Silla Period, Hyangak began to be used as a symmetrical concept with dangak. At that time, Hyangak included both native music from the Korean Peninsula and foreign music that had been adopted before the unified Silla Dynasty. The literature of the Goryeo Dynasty often referred to Korean traditional court music as 'Sokak' rather than 'Hyangak'. During the Goryeo Dynasty, the musical instruments Of Hyangak were composed of Samhyeon and Samjook, which were handed over from the unified Silla, and foreign instruments such as janggu, haegeum, and flute. In the Joseon Dynasty, Hyangak and Dangak were influenced musically by one another. Hyangak, the early Joseon Dynasty, was part of a project to honor the historical legitimacy of Joseon and the new dynasty. Since the mid-sized Joseon Dynasty, the contents of the music have changed as the music changed like Hyangak, and the distinction between Hyanggak and Dangak was blurred even when using musical instruments.

History It was founded by Queen Joan I of Navarre in 1305, who provided for three departments, the arts with 20 students, philosophy with 30 and theology with 20 students.The modern history is by Nathalie Gorochov, Le Collège de Navarre de sa fondation (1305) au début du XVe siècle (1418): Histoire de l'institution, de sa vie intellectuelle et de son recrutement. The queen bequeathed part of her fine hôtel de Navarre in rue Saint André des Arts, together with lands generated rents of 2000 livres p.a. in her counties of Champagne and Brie. Her trustees decided to sell the Paris property and acquire an ample plot on the Montagne Sainte-Geneviève (rue de la Montagne- Sainte-Geneviève / rue Descartes), right in the Latin Quarter, and build the college anew. The first stone, laid 12 April 1309, was for the college chapel. Provision was made also for the scholars' support, 4 Paris sous weekly for the artists, 6 for the logicians and 8 for the theologians. These allowances were to continue until the graduates held benefices of the value respectively of 30, 40 and 60 livres. The regulations allowed the theological students a fire, daily, from November to March after dinner and supper for one half-hour. The luxury of benches was forbidden by a commission appointed by Urban V in 1366. On the festival days, the theologians were expected to deliver a collation to their fellow-students of the three classes. The rector at the head of the college, originally appointed by the faculty of the university, was now appointed by the king's confessor. The students wore a special dress and the tonsure and ate in common. Classes bore little resemblance to today's universities. Subjects were included that are not taught today, such as rhetoric in its classical meaning. The students were required to speak and write only in Latin and all subjects had to be learned by rote. Only after graduation were students allowed to write using their own words or discuss the subjects. At least one of the rectors, Claude D'Espence became rector before he obtained his doctorate.

He was educated at Halifax in Yorkshire, and showed such aptitude in mathematics, drawing and surveying, that he was brought under the notice of John Smeaton (1724–1792). After his education he moved to London, where he had relatives, and worked there for a number of years, during which time he met and married, Sophia Hubert, (1770–1830). While in London they had their first child John Farey Jr.Alec Skempton. \\"Farey, Jr., John,\\" in: A Biographical Dictionary of Civil Engineers in Great Britain and Ireland: 1500–1830. 2002. p. 223-224 They went on to have eight more children, two of whom died in infancy. = Land agent in Woburn and consulting surveyor in London = In 1792 Farey was appointed surveyor and land agent to Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford for his Woburn estates. After the death of the duke, Farey in 1802 moved to London, and, after first contemplating emigrating or taking a farm in the country, he settled there as a consulting surveyor and geologist. That he was enabled to take this step was due largely to his acquaintance with the geologist William Smith, who in 1801 had been employed by the duke of Bedford in works of draining and irrigation. The duke, appreciating Smith's knowledge of the strata, commissioned him in 1802 to explore the margin of the chalk- hills south of Woburn in order to determine the true succession of the strata; and he instructed Farey to accompany him. Farey has remarked that Smith was his Master and Instructor in Mineral Surveying, and his subsequent publications show how well he had profited by the teachings he received. In 1805, he succeeded the agriculturist Arthur Young as Secretary of the Smithfield Club. His surveying work took him all over the country and he was in much demand from landowners wishing to improve their estates, or exploit the minerals they held. His work on economic geology then was of importance in the burgeoning Industrial Revolution by locating new resources of coal and metal ores.  Work  = Writings = Farey was a prolific writer, and Professor Hugh Torrens (see references below) has traced around 270 papers by him, quadrupling the number given by the Royal Society's Catalogue of Scientific Papers. He wrote on all manner of subjects, ranging from horticulture, geology, meteorology, metrology, currency decimalisation, music and mathematics to pacifism. He was an important contributor to Rees's Cyclopædia with articles on canals, mineralogy, surveying and a number of the scientific and mathematical basis of sound. His Canals article is the largest in the work, baing some 210,000 words. He contributed similarly to the Edinburgh Encyclopedia. Various nineteenth-century biographical sources, including the Dictionary of National Biography, claimed wrongly that he wrote the Rees article on Steam. It was actually written by his son John Farey Jr. He contributed articles on music to periodicals, as well as around 350 articles on the topic the two encyclopaedias. They concerned the mathematical relationship of note values and musical temperament. He devised a notation which allowed a sound to be expressed by the sum of three small values Σ + f + m. He made great use of the researches of Marmaduke Overend (music theorist and organist) (c1730-1790), whose MS were then in the library of the Royal Institution In 1809 Farey met William Martin who had published work on Derbyshire fossils, to investigate whether they could create a joint geological map of Derbyshire. Martin however was too ill to meet a second time and he died the following year. Farey's best known work is General View of the Agriculture and Minerals of Derbyshire (3 volumes 1811–17) for the Board of Agriculture. In the first of these volumes (1811) he gave an account of the upper part of the British series of strata, and an exposition of the Carboniferous and other strata of Derbyshire. In this work, and in a paper published in the Philosophical Magazine, vol. 51, 1818, p. 173, on 'Mr Smith's Geological Claims stated', he called attention to the importance of the discoveries of William Smith. =Farey sequence= As well as being remembered by historians of geology, his name is more widely known by the Farey sequence which he noted as a result of his interest in the mathematics of sound (Philosophical Magazine, vol. 47, 1816, pp. 385–386). Farey died in London. Subsequently, Sophia, his widow, offered his geological collection to the British Museum. The museum rejected the collection, and it was dispersed and broken up.

It is located along Oregon Route 212 in the foothills of the Cascade mountain range, approximately southeast of downtown Portland, and northeast of Oregon City. A bedroom community, Boring is named after William Harrison Boring, a Union soldier and pioneer whose family built a farm in the area in 1856, before Oregon had received statehood. The community was officially platted in 1903 after the Portland Railway, Light and Power Company constructed an electric rail line, which operated from Portland to Cazadero. The former railway is now part of the Springwater Corridor, a rail trail which begins in Boring and ends at the Eastbank Esplanade along the Willamette River in southeast Portland. The Boring Lava Field, an extinct volcanic field zone that comprises terrain spanning between Boring and downtown Portland, took its namesake from the community. Boring was a hub of the timber industry in the Pacific Northwest prior to and during World War I due to the abundance of surrounding temperate coniferous and evergreen forests, as well as its proximity to the Port of Portland. In addition to logging, plant nurseries and agriculture have also historically been major economic forces in Boring. Boring has often been included in lists of places with unusual names. In 2012, Boring was named a sister city of the village of Dull, Perthshire, Scotland, and later Bland, New South Wales, Australia. History =Timeline= The land on which Boring was built was a former lava field. The Boring Lava Field, which takes its namesake from the community, is located just north of Boring. There are approximately 80 lava vents across the area, remnants of the volcanic activity that occurred there roughly 2.6 million years ago. The lava field extends across surrounding Portland and Vancouver, Washington, though the volcanic centers are extinct. The land that would later become Boring had no known inhabitants, though the Clackamas Tribe had a camp located south of Boring, near present-day Oregon City, along the Willamette River. By 1855, the remaining members of the tribe had relocated to the Grand Ronde. Settlers began to arrive in the Oregon Territory in mid-1800s via the Oregon Trail, after the establishment of Portland. Boring takes its namesake after William Harrison Boring, an Illinois native and early resident who began farming there in 1874, and subsequently donated land for the community's first schoolhouse to be built. He was a Union veteran who had moved to Oregon after having fought in the Siege of Vicksburg during the Civil War. William's half-brother, Joseph, had settled in the area in 1856 prior to his arrival. William Boring died in 1932 at the age of 91 and was buried beside his wife Sarah in Damascus Pioneer Cemetery. Boring was platted in 1903 as Boring Junction after the construction of a railway line by the Portland Railway, Light and Power Company. The post office was established and named Boring the same year, which builders of an interurban railway adopted as the name of the community. An electric trolley operated on the railroad line from Portland through Gresham and Boring, ending in Cazadero, which began transporting passengers in 1905. The trolley significantly reduced travel time between Portland and the communities to its east: Horse and buggy travel from Boring to Portland took an average of six hours, while a trip to Portland via the trolley system took only one hour. Though younger students in the area attended a local school built on Richey Road, high school students in Boring commuted via trolley to Gresham and Portland to attend high schools there. The early residents of the area post-settlement were mainly German and Swedish immigrants. After World War II and the prominence of automobile ownership, the trolley ceased passenger operations to Portland, but continued to travel between Boring and Gresham. The railway went defunct in the following years, and was incorporated as part of the Springwater Corridor, a rail trail that begins in Boring and ends at the Eastbank Esplanade in downtown Portland. In 2005, citizens of Boring applied to become one of the first legally recognized villages in Oregon. However, after many months of polarizing debate on the village issue, residents narrowly defeated the village designation in a town hall referendum in August 2006, with 293 votes in favor and 298 against. =Name and municipality pairings= Dull, Scotland The unusual name of the community often prompts its inclusion on lists of unusual place names.TripAtlas The name \\"Boring\\" is embraced by locals, however, and found in many local businesses, resulting in many road signs that seem humorous to outsiders. Boosters of the village designation use the slogan \\"The most exciting place to live.\\" In 2011, Elizabeth Leighton of Aberfeldy, Scotland, proposed the community's pairing with the village of Dull, Scotland, after passing through Boring on a cycling holiday. In June 2012, Boring accepted the proposal of Dull to \\"pair\\" their municipalities, in an effort to promote tourism in both places as a play on their names. Dull is a village of only 84 residents, while Boring has about 8,000. In 2013, the farm community and former gold prospecting site Bland Shire in West Wyalong, New South Wales, Australia was added to the mix to create not a \\"twinned town\\" relationship but a \\"League of Extraordinary Communities\\" grouping Dull, Boring and Bland as a means of encouraging travel, promoting all three communities. The same year, construction of the Boring Station Trailhead Park was completed on the empty lot that once housed the original 1903 train station, and opened to the public. The Boring Community Planning Organization also issued commemorative \\"Boring & Dull: a pair for the ages\\" T-shirts and mugs, as well as raffling off a trip to Dull. Geography =Topography= View of Mount Hood from Boring Aerial view of Boring and surrounding area, with Mount Hood in the background Located at the northernmost end of the eastern Willamette Valley, Boring rests in the foothills of the Cascade mountain range, at the base of Mount Hood. The community is approximately from Government Camp, a major resort and skiing community on Mount Hood. The community comprises approximately of Clackamas County. Boring is considered part of the Portland metropolitan area, located approximately southeast of the Portland city limits, and from downtown Portland. Boring's landscape is hilly, with its elevation ranging between and . Several creeks run west through the community limits into the Clackamas River, including Doane Creek, North Fork Deep Creek, and Tickle Creek. =Climate= According to the Köppen climate classification, Boring has a Mediterranean climate, characterized by warm summers and cool, rainy winters. The community receives an annual average of 54.26 inches (1,378.2 mm) of rain—significantly more than neighboring Portland, which averages 36.03 inches (915.2 mm), or Gresham, which averages 44.85 inches (1,139.2). Boring's high volume of rainfall can be attributed to its location in the Cascade foothills, which situates it at a considerably higher elevation than other towns and cities in the Portland metropolitan area. The first frost in Boring typically occurs within the first week of November, while the last is typically in the first week of April. Annual data Economy Two teen girls picking berries on a farm in Boring, 1946 After its inception as a railroad community, Boring evolved into a hub for the timber industry in the Northwest, beginning in the pre-World War I era and continuing throughout much of the 20th century. One of the first mills established in Boring was the Hillyard Sawmill, which began operations in the 1890s; the mill produced over of lumber per day, mostly consisting of railroad ties. Bert Jonsrud, an early resident of the area, would later establish the Jonsrud Bros. Lumber Company, which would become Boring's main lumber mill. In a 1915 survey of timber and logging camps in the Pacific Northwest, it was reported that Jonsrud mill was producing of lumber per day. The Portland Traction Company, a now-defunct railroad, operated a rail line from Portland (near the current location of the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI) on the Willamette River) to Boring via Gresham. In the 1950s, the Southern Pacific and Union Pacific railroads jointly took over operation of the remaining portion of the line for freight operations. Much of the line has since been purchased by local governments for the creation of a long-distance rail trail named the Springwater Corridor. The community is also home to a large number of dairy farms, plant nurseries and berry farms, including Iseli Nursery and Liepold Farms, who supplies produce to the local restaurant chain Burgerville. There are over thirty active plant and tree nurseries that operate within the community. Boring is also home of a campus of Guide Dogs For The Blind, Inc., the oldest guide dog training program on the US west coast. The largest employer in Boring as of 2018 is Good Shepherd Community Church, an independent evangelical church. Demographics According to the 2010 U.S. census, the ZCTA for Boring's ZIP code had a population of 7,726 in 2,875 households. This was a significant drop from the 2000 census, which had reported a population of 12,851. Males made up 50.50% of the population, while females made up 49.50%. According to this data, the population's ethnic profile was 77.3% white, 13.3% Hispanic or Latino, 2.6% Asian, .3% African American, and 4% two or more races. 32.20% of households in the ZCTA earned under $50,000 annually, while 39.80% earned between $50,000–$100,000, and 28% had reported earnings exceeding $100,000. As of 2018, the unemployment rate was 3.98%. 86.8% of residents were property owners, while 13.2% were renters. Law and government Along with other unincorporated communities in Clackamas County, Boring is served by Metro, a regional government of the Portland metropolitan area, and the only metropolitan planning organization in the United States. The community is located within Oregon's 3rd congressional district, represented by Earl Blumenauer. In 2015, Steve Bates, the former chair of the Boring planning council received over 700 signatures in favor of having the community removed from the Metro jurisdiction, due to the fact that Metro's regional boundary only includes the western half of the community, where Boring's downtown area lies. Metro responded by noting that Boring lies outside of their urban growth boundary, and that the jurisdictional boundary had no bearing on any foreseeable incorporation of Boring. According to the Clackamas County voting data from the 2012 U.S. general election, Boring somewhat favored the Republican party, which accounted for 59% of votes, while 37% favored the Democratic party. Other parties accounted for 4% of votes. In the 2008 U.S. general election, the Republican party was only slightly favored at 51%, with the Democratic party at 47%, and 2% accounting for other parties. Education Former Kelso Schoolhouse, 1885 The first schoolhouse in Boring was the Fern Hill School, built in 1883. The Kelso Schoolhouse opened two years later, in 1885. Another four-room school house called Oregonia was built in 1904. A play shed was added to the school in 1918. Contemporarily, the community is served by the Oregon Trail and the Gresham-Barlow school districts as the community straddles the boundary between the two. Elementary schools in Boring include Naas Elementary and Kelso Elementary. Secondary schools serving Boring include Boring Middle School, Sandy High School (Oregon Trail), and Sam Barlow High School (Gresham-Barlow). Private schools in the area include Good Shepherd School and Hoodview Adventist School. Boring is also home to Oregon Trail Academy, the only public K-12 single campus International Baccalaureate school in the Northwest. The school was established as a charter school in 2010 by the Oregon Trail School District and also serves students from Gresham-Barlow. In 2019, the school ranked in the top 15 schools in the Portland metro area and 17th in the state. Students' test score performance in the public school system in Boring ranks at or above the national average in both elementary and middle school(s). Infrastructure Oregon Route 212 begins in Boring, and runs through the center of the downtown area. Its roads are maintained by the Oregon Department of Transportation. From the 1970s until the end of 2012, Boring was within the TriMet transit district, the Portland metropolitan area's mass transit system, and was served by bus line 84, albeit with only a single round trip in each peak period. In 2011, business owners in Boring petitioned the transit district's board to remove Boring from the district, arguing that Boring was receiving too little bus service relative to the amount being paid in employer-payroll taxes. The petition was approved, to take effect at the beginning of 2013, bringing an end to TriMet service in Boring. The Springwater Corridor, a rail trail that was originally a railroad running between Boring and Portland, begins in Boring next to Boring Middle School, and is used for running, walking, and cycling. The trail ends at the Eastbank Esplanade in downtown Portland. In popular culture The eponymous fictional town of the Disney TV series Gravity Falls is inspired by Boring. In 2017, it was reported that ABC had developed a \\"serial killer comedy\\" series titled Boring, OR about a small town under siege by a serial murderer. The series is being produced by Jack Black. In 2013, the community was home to an event hosted by Vitaminwater, in a series in which the company gave Boring and the town of Normal, Illinois, \\"makeovers\\". The event featured musical performances by Santigold, Matt & Kim, and Yung Skeeter, as well as standup comedy performances which included Amy Schumer. Boring was the subject of a 2016 promotional documentary short by Brooklyn, New York-based cinematographer Adam McDaid for Ogilvy & Mather. In 2018, the Netflix web television series Everything Sucks! is set in the town and focuses on students attending the fictional \\"Boring High School.\\"  Notable people  * Bob Amsberry (1928–1957), original member of The Mickey Mouse Club *William H.

He was the leader of the Manitoba Conservative Party in the provincial election of 1915, and later served as the province's ninth Lieutenant Governor. Aikins was born in Grahamsville, Toronto Gore Township, Peel County, Canada West (now Mississauga, Ontario) and educated at Toronto's Upper Canada College. His father, James Cox Aikins, was a prominent Canadian politician, serving as a cabinet minister from 1869 to 1873 and 1878 to 1882, and serving as Manitoba's Lieutenant-Governor between 1882 and 1888. The younger Aikins was educated at Upper Canada College and the University of Toronto, receiving his B.A. in 1875. He subsequently moved to Winnipeg with his father, and remained in the western city after the elder Aikins returned to Ontario. From 1879 to 1896, Aikins was a counsel for the Department of Justice. In 1880, he was part of a committee that investigated the administration of justice in the North-West Territories. Aikins was appointed counsel to the Manitoba government in 1900, and was responsible for drafting the Temperance Act passed by the government of Hugh John Macdonald. He also served as President of the Law Society of Manitoba, and was a solicitor for the Canadian Pacific Railway from 1881 to 1911. In the 1911 federal election, Aikins was elected as a Conservative candidate to the House of Commons of Canada, for the riding of Brandon. The Conservative Party won this election, and Aikins served as a backbench supporter of Robert Borden's administration. Aikins left federal politics in 1915, amid unexpected circumstances. The provincial Conservative government of Rodmond Roblin was forced to resign amid scandal in May 1915. Aikins served as chair of the provincial party's convention in July, and accepted the position of party leader on July 15 when no other candidates came forward. He resigned his federal seat, and led the provincial party into a new election. The new Liberal government of Tobias Norris was extremely popular, and portrayed Aikins as the tool of more sinister figures in the Conservative Party. The Liberals won 40 seats in the election, against only five for the Tories. Aikins was resoundingly defeated in Brandon City. The following year, Aikins was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba on the recommendation of Prime Minister Robert Borden. He served in this largely ceremonial position from August 5, 1916, to October 25, 1926. Although his initial appointment was greeted with skepticism, Aikins proved to be a popular office-holder. Even the pro-Liberal Winnipeg Free Press approved of the continuance of his appointment on the recommendation of Prime Minister Arthur Meighen in 1921. Aikins gave the Norris government permission to continue in office for a few weeks after losing a vote of confidence in 1922, such that important legislation could be passed before the next election. Aikins was the first president of the Canadian Bar Association, holding that office for 13 years.Canadian Bar Association: Past CBA Presidents He was the first of five lawyers from the Aikins firm to serve as president of the CBA, the others being his son Gordon Harold Aikins (1942–1943), John MacAulay (1953–1954), A.

As of the 2010 census it had a population of 242. It lies along the lower reaches of the Kentucky River across from the confluence of the Dix River with the Kentucky. The community is part of the Lexington–Fayette Metropolitan Statistical Area. History A post office was established in 1879 in the community then known as \\"North Tower\\". In 1888, the town was renamed for the landmark High Bridge, a nearly railroad bridge over the Kentucky River. The Kentucky River runs through the Kentucky River Palisades for much of the lower portion of its length. Most of the bridges over it in the area are relatively high ones. High Bridge was opened in 1876 and was the first cantilever bridge in North America. Standing over the river between the Palisades, it first carried both passenger and freight trains. The American Society of Civil Engineers has designated it a National Engineering Landmark. The 1876 bridge was replaced in 1911 by a more robust bridge in the same place. This is the current bridge, which stands above the river. Freight trains of the Norfolk Southern Railway still use this bridge several times a day. The Palisades were a popular spot for picnics and dances. An open-air roofed ballroom was built there for dances and has been preserved. A small playground and park adjoin the Palisades property. A brand of bottled water named for the community depicts the bridge on its label. Highbridge Springs water is well-known to the University of Kentucky Wildcats. The Wildcat mascot is used on the bottle label to show support for the team. The bottle name is \\"Swish\\".

Bowers. Development The prototype Fly Baby first flew in 1962. It is now on display at the Museum of Flight in Seattle. Variants include a biplane version called the Bowers Bi-Baby or Fly Baby 1-B and several dual cockpit designs by various builders. Bowers also designed a side-by-side two-seat version he called Namu, but few examples have been built.Plane and Pilot: 1978 Aircraft Directory, pages 135-136. Werner & Werner Corp, Santa Monica CA, 1977. The Fly Baby was the winner of the Experimental Aircraft Association's 1962 design competition. Over 500 Fly Babies have been completed to date, with scores still flying worldwide and an active network of builders and owners. It is built from plans and was designed to be constructed in a garage using only basic hand tools, by a person of average \\"home handyman\\" skill in 1962. The plans consist of over one hundred pages of typewritten instructions and dimensioned drawings. After Bowers' death in 2003 the plans were unavailable for a time, but starting in 2007 they were back on the market, sold by the Bowers family.Bayerl, Robby; Martin Berkemeier; et al: World Directory of Leisure Aviation 2011-12, page 97.

Design The Fly Baby was designed to be a very simple aircraft. For example, the fuel gauge is a stiff wire attached to a float poking up through the gas cap (a common application in the 1930s and 1940s, as seen on Piper and Aeronca light aircraft). The structure is of aircraft-grade spruce and plywood (Bowers did not advocate skimping on the quality of structural wood), covered with doped aircraft fabric. Aileron controls are push-tube, elevator controls are a combination of push-tube and cable, the rudder is cable-controlled. The landing gear is fixed and unsprung. The main landing gear struts are made of laminated wood with a steel axle. The only shock absorption comes from the tires themselves. Hydraulic wheel brakes are usually fitted. The aircraft was designed to be powered by a 65-horsepower (48 kW) Continental A-65 piston engine taken from a Piper Cub. Engines of up to 100 horsepower (75 kW) have been fitted, including the Continental O-200 and converted Corvair automotive conversions. While the instrumentation installed is up to the builder, most Fly Babys are equipped for visual flight rules (VFR) only. An electrical system is optional; many Fly Baby owners hand-prop the engine for starting, and use a handheld radio. The Fly Baby's wings fold up against the fuselage enabling it to be stored in a single-car garage or a car trailer. The wings can be folded or unfolded in about 15 minutes. The airplane was designed to be stored in a garage and towed to the airport on its own gear. In practice, most owners use a trailer or keep their Fly Baby hangared at an airport. Some of the components used, such as the fuel tank and engine, were designed to be taken from the Piper Cub, which were cheap and plentiful in 1962. Even today, the total cost of construction can be under US$10,000. Variants ;Bowers Bi-Baby :A Fly Baby can be converted to a biplane Bi-Baby in less than one hour by adding the struts and upper wing to the existing aircraft (if the fittings were built in) or it can be built as a biplane version from the start. Regulations =USA= In the United States of America the FAA categorizes the Fly Baby as an Experimental Amateur-Built aircraft.

Differentiating f with respect to z is out of the question, but it turns out if :f(z)=g(\\\\bar{z},z) for some analytic function g of two complex variables, we can pretend f is g (physicists do this sort of thing all the time) and work with :\\\\left.\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z_1}g\\\\right_{z_1=\\\\bar{z};z_2=z} and :\\\\left.\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z_2}g\\\\right_{z_1=\\\\bar{z};z_2=z} instead.

Note that if g exists, it is unique (due to the theorem about the uniqueness of analytic continuations), at least if we ignore complications like branch cuts and so on. Conceptually, whenever this trick is used, it probably means on a physical level that the variable z that they are working with \\"really\\" has a real structure and physicists are merely pigeonholing it into a complex variable. Actually, it's not even necessary for there to be an analytic g.

Life and work His father was a master tailor and when 12 he studied at the Friedrich‐Werdersche Gymnasium in Berlin. He was orphaned at age 19 by an outbreak of typhus, and found himself responsible for raising three younger sisters. He began giving academic lessons as a private tutor and in this way met Wilhelm Beer, a wealthy banker, in 1824. In 1829 Beer decided to set up a private observatory in Berlin, with a 95 mm refractor telescope made by Joseph von Fraunhofer, and Mädler worked there. In 1830 they began producing drawings of Mars which later became the first true maps of that planet. They were the first to choose what is today known as Sinus Meridiani as the prime meridian for Martian maps. They made a preliminary determination for Mars's rotation period, which was off by almost 13 seconds. A later determination in 1837 was off by only 1.1 seconds. They also produced the first exact map of the Moon, Mappa Selenographica, published in four volumes in 1834–1836. In 1837 a description of the Moon (Der Mond) was published. Both were the best descriptions of the Moon for many decades, not superseded until the map of Johann Friedrich Julius Schmidt in the 1870s. Beer and Mädler drew the firm conclusion that the features on the Moon do not change, and there is no atmosphere or water. In 1836, Johann Franz Encke appointed Mädler an observer at the Berlin Observatory, and he observed with its 240-mm refractor. In 1840, Mädler was appointed director of the Dorpat (Tartu) Observatory in Estonia (then Russian Empire), succeeding Friedrich Wilhelm Struve who had moved to Pulkovo Observatory. He carried out meteorological as well as astronomical observations. He continued Struve's observations of double stars. He remained in Tartu until he retired in 1865, and then returned to Germany. By examining the proper motions of stars, he came up with his \\"Central Sun Hypothesis\\", according to which the center of the galaxy was located in the Pleiades star cluster and that the Sun revolves around it. He got the location wrong. He published many scientific works, among them a two-volume History of Descriptive Astronomy in 1873. In 1864, he proposed a calendar reform for Russia: After dropping 12 days to align with Gregorian calendar dates before the year 1900, the leap year in 1900 along with every 128th year afterwards (2028, 2156, etc.) under the Julian rules would be cancelled. This would give a mean year of 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 45 seconds, which is extremely close to the mean tropical year. Neither the Tsar nor Orthodox clergy accepted this unsolicited proposal, though a modified version of it was made by Sergey Glazenap in 1900, and ultimately Russia would adopt the Gregorian calendar in 1918. Notwithstanding several singular scientific errors, von Mädler, without doubt, is one of the great and eminent astronomers of the 19th century. The craters Mädler on the Moon and Mädler on Mars are both named in his honor. References  Bibliography  * Heino Eelsalu, Dieter B.

Composed in Bergen-op-Zoom in 1480; preserved in Ghent University Library. The Blessed John van Ruysbroeck (, ; 1293 or 1294 – 2 December 1381) was an Augustinian canon and one of the most important of the Flemish mystics. Some of his main literary works include The Kingdom of the Divine Lovers, The Twelve Beguines, The Spiritual Espousals, A Mirror of Eternal Blessedness, The Little Book of Enlightenment, and The Sparkling Stone. Some of his letters also survive, as well as several short sayings (recorded by some of his disciples, such as Jan van Leeuwen). He wrote in the Dutch vernacular, the language of the common people of the Low Countries, rather than in Latin, the language of the Church liturgy and official texts, in order to reach a wider audience. Life =Until his ordination= John had a devout mother, who brought him up in the Catholic faith; of his father we know nothing. John's surname, Van Ruusbroec, is not a surname in the modern sense but a toponym that refers to his native hamlet; modern-day Ruisbroek near Brussels (compare John of Salisbury or Democritus of Abdera). At the age of eleven he left his mother, departing without leave or warning, to place himself under the guidance and tuition of his uncle, Jan Hinckaert, a canon regular of St. Gudule's, Brussels. Hinckaert was living according to his Apostolic views with a fellow-canon, Frank van Coudenberg. This uncle provided for Ruysbroeck's education with a view to the priesthood. In due course, John was presented with a prebend in St. Gudule's church, and ordained in 1318. His mother had followed him to Brussels, entered a Béguinage there, and died shortly before his ordination. =Priest in Brussels= From 1318 until 1343 Ruysbroeck served as a parish priest at St Gudula. He continued to lead, together with his uncle Hinckaert and Van Coudenberg, a life of extreme austerity and retirement. At that time the Brethren of the Free Spirit were causing controversy in the Netherlands and one of them, a woman named Heilwige Bloemardinne, was particularly active in Brussels, propagating her beliefs chiefly by means of popular pamphlets. Ruysbroeck responded with pamphlets also written in the native tongue (Middle Dutch). Nothing of these treatises remains. The controversy had a permanent effect on Ruysbroeck: his later writings bear constant reference, direct and indirect, to the heretical views expressed in these times, and he always wrote in the country's native language, chiefly with a view to counteracting these writings which he viewed as heretical. =Priest in Groenendaal= Small chapel in the forest at Groenendaal near the monastery where Ruysbroeck contemplatedThe desire for a more retired life, and possibly also the persecution which followed Ruysbroeck's attack on Bloemardinne, induced Ruysbroeck, Jan Hinckaert (d. 1350) and Vrank van Coudenberg (d. 1386) to leave Brussels in 1343 for the hermitage of Groenendaal, in the neighbouring Sonian Forest, which was made over to them by John III, Duke of Brabant. The ruins of the monastery are still present in the forest of Soignes.Michel Erkins. De Priorij van Groenendaal. Gemeentehuis. Jan van Ruusbroecpark. Hoeilaart. 2007. But here so many disciples joined the little company that it was found expedient to organize into a duly-authorized religious body. The hermitage was erected into a community of canons regular on 13 March 1349, and eventually it became the motherhouse of a congregation, which bore its name of Groenendaal. Francis van Coudenberg was appointed first provost, and Blessed John Ruysbroeck prior. Hinckaert refrained from making the canonical profession lest the discipline of the house should suffer from the exemptions required by the infirmities of his old age; he dwelt, therefore, in a cell outside the cloister and there a few years later died. This period, from his religious profession (1349) to his death (1381), was the most active and fruitful of Ruysbroeck's career. During this time, his fame as a man of God, as a sublime contemplative and a skilled director of souls, spread beyond the bounds of Flanders and Brabant to Holland, Germany, and France.A characteristic story was that one day two priests came from Paris to ask his opinion of their spiritual state, to be told: \\"You are as holy as you wish to be!\\" (Evelyn Underhill introduction to The Adornment of the Spiritual Marriage; The Sparkling Stone; The Book of the Supreme Truth. Translation by C. A. Wynschenk. London: J. M. Dent, 1916. p3) He had relations with the nearby Carthusian house at Herne, and also with several communities of Poor Clare Franciscans. We know that he had connections with the Friends of God in Strasbourg, and also that in about 1378 he was visited by Geert Groote, the founder of the Devotio Moderna. It is possible, though disputed, that John Tauler came to see him.Bernard McGinn, The Varieties of Vernacular Mysticism (New York: Herder & Herder, 2012), p. 7. John died at Groenendaal, aged 82, on 2 December 1381. Works In total, Ruysbroeck wrote twelve books, seven epistles, two hymns and a prayer. All were written in Middle Dutch. Around 1340, Ruysbroeck wrote his masterpiece, The Spiritual Espousals. The 36 surviving Dutch manuscripts, as well as translations into Latin and Middle High German, are evidence of the book's popularity. Some of the text was also translated into Middle English (via the Latin translation) as The Chastising of God's Children (which was later printed by Wynkyn de Worde). Around the same time, he also wrote a short treatise, The Sparkling Stone, which was also translated into Middle English. Ruysbroeck's most famous writings were composed during his time in Groenendaal. His longest and most popular work (surviving today in 42 manuscripts), The Spiritual Tabernacle was begun in Brussels but finished at Groenendaal, presumably early on in his time there. Two brief works, The Christian Faith (an explanation of the Creed) and a treatise on The Four Temptations, also date from around the time of Ruysbroeck's arrival in Groenendaal. His later works include four writings to Margareta van Meerbeke, a Franciscan nun of Brussels. These are The Seven Enclosures (c1346-50), the first of his seven surviving letters, The Seven Rungs (c1359-60), and A Mirror of Eternal Blessedness. Around 1363 the Carthusians at Herne dispatched a deputation to Groenendaal presenting Ruysbroeck with questions on his first book, The Realm of Lovers. Ruysbroeck went to Herne to clarify his teaching, and afterwards put this in writing in his work The Little Book of Enlightenment. Thought Jan Ruysbroeck Weg sign on walls of his old monastery at Groenendaal.Of Ruysbroeck's works, the treatise The Seven Steps of the Ladder of Spiritual Love is the one that is currently most-readily available. Of the various treatises preserved, the best-known and the most characteristic is that entitled The Spiritual Espousals. It is divided into three books, treating respectively of the active, the interior, and the contemplative life. Literally, Ruysbroeck wrote as the spirit moved him. He loved to wander and meditate in the solitude of the forest adjoining the cloister; he was accustomed to carry a tablet with him, and on this to jot down his thoughts as he felt inspired so to do. Late in life he was able to declare that he had never committed aught to writing save by the motion of the Holy Ghost. In none of his treatises do we find anything like a complete or detailed account of his system; perhaps it would be correct to say that he himself was not conscious of elaborating any system. In his dogmatic writings he explains, illustrates, and enforces traditional teachings with remarkable force and lucidity. In his ascetic works, his favourite virtues are detachment, humility and charity; he loves to dwell on such themes as flight from the world, meditation upon the life of Christ, especially the passion, abandonment to the Divine Will, and an intense personal love of God. In common with most of the German mystics, Ruysbroeck starts from divine matters before describing humanity. His work often then returns to discussing God, showing how the divine and the human are so closely united as to become one. He demonstrates inclinations towards Christian universalism in writing that \\"Man, having proceeded from God is destined to return, and become one with Him again.\\" But here he is careful to clarify his position: \\"There where I assert that we are one in God, I must be understood in this sense that we are one in love, not in essence and nature.\\" Despite this declaration, however, and other similar saving clauses scattered over his pages, some of Ruysbroeck's expressions are certainly rather unusual and startling. The sublimity of his subject-matter was such that it could scarcely be otherwise. His devoted friend, Gerard Groote, a trained theologian, confessed to a feeling of uneasiness over certain of his phrases and passages, and begged him to change or modify them for the sake at least of the weak. Later on, Jean Gerson and then Bossuet both professed to find traces of unconscious pantheism in his works. But as an offset we may mention the enthusiastic commendations of his contemporaries, Groote, Johannes Tauler, Thomas à Kempis, John of Schoonhoven, and in subsequent times of the Franciscan Henry van Herp, the Carthusians Denis and Laurentius Surius, the Carmelite Thomas á Jesu, the Benedictine Louis de Blois, and the Jesuit Leonardus Lessius. Ernest Hello and especially Maurice Maeterlinck have done much to make his writings known. Ruysbroeck was a powerful influence in developing United Nations Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld's conception of spiritual growth through selfless service to humanity, as expressed in his book of contemplations called Vägmärken ('Markings').\\"[t]he counterpoint to this enormously exposed and public life is Eckhart and Jan van Ruysbroek. They really give me balance and-a more necessary sense of humor.\\" Henry P van Dusen. Dag Hammarskjöld. A Biographical Interpretation of Markings. Faber and Faber. London, 1967. pp49-50 Ruysbroeck insisted that the soul finds God in its own depths, and noted three stages of progress in what he called the spiritual ladder of Christian attainment: (1) the active life, (2) the inward life, (3) the contemplative life. He did not teach the fusion of the self in God, but held that at the summit of the ascent the soul still preserves its identity.\\"Nevertheless neither is this unity one, but each of those established in singular grace and glory hold in themselves unity and their own function in accordance with their own dignity and nobility. But this unity is situated in the mind and in the form of all powers by means of the bond of love.\\" Jan Ruysbroeck. The Kingdom of the Lovers of God. T. Arnold Hyde (trans) Kegan Paul. London, 1919. p134. In the Kingdom of the Lovers of God he explains that those seeking wisdom must \\"flow forth on the waters to all the boundaries of the earth, that is, on compassion, pity and mercy shown to the needs of all men\\", must \\"fly in the air of the Rational faculty\\" and \\"refer all actions and virtues to the honour of God\\"; thence (through grace) they will find an \\"immense and boundless clearness\\" bestowed upon their mind.Jan Ruysbroeck. The Kingdom of the Lovers of God. T. Arnold Hyde (trans) Kegan Paul. London, 1919. pp 82-83 and 163 In relation to the contemplative life, he held that three attributes should be acquired: The first is spiritual freedom from worldly desires (\\"as empty of every outward work as if he did not work at all\\"), the second is a mind unencumbered with images (\\"inward silence\\"), and the third is a feeling of inward union with God (\\"even as a burning and glowing fire which can never more be quenched\\").The Adornment of the Spiritual Marriage; The Sparkling Stone; The Book of the Supreme Truth. Translation by C. A. Wynschenk. Introduction and Notes by Evelyn Underhill. London: J. M. Dent, 1916. pp 89, 94 and 110 His works, of which the most important were De vera contemplatione (\\"On true contemplation\\") and De septem gradibus amoris (\\"On the seven steps of love\\"), were published in 1848 at Hanover; also Reflections from the Mirror of a Mystic (1906) and Die Zierde der geistlichen Hochzeit (1901). A depiction of Jan van Ruysbroeck Veneration and commemoration After John's death in 1381, his relics were carefully preserved and his memory honoured as that of a saint. After his death, stories called him the Ecstatic Doctor or Divine Doctor, and his views formed a link between the Friends of God and the Brethren of the Common Life, the ideas which may have helped to bring about the Reformation. When Groenendaal Priory was suppressed by Joseph II in 1783, his relics were transferred to St. Gudule's, Brussels, where, however, they were lost during the French Revolution. John was beatified on 1 December 1908, by Pope Pius X. No authentic portrait of John is known to exist; but the traditional picture represents him in the canonical habit, seated in the forest with his writing tablet on his knee, as he was in fact found one day by the brethren—rapt in ecstasy and enveloped in flames, which encircle without consuming the tree under which he is resting. At the University of Antwerp there is a Ruusbroec Institute for the study of the history of spirituality. There is also a secondary school called Jan van Ruusbroeckollege in Laken near the Royal Palace of Belgium.  Cultural references  The epigraph of the 1884 novel À rebours by Joris-Karl Huysmans has the following Ruysbroeck quotation: \\"I must rejoice beyond the bounds of time ... though the world may shudder at my joy, and in its coarseness know not what I mean.\\" In this novel, Huysmans describes Ruysbroeck as \\"un mystique du e siècle, dont la prose offrait un incompréhensible mais attirant amalgame d’exaltations ténébreuses, d’effusions caressantes, de transports âpres\\" (\\"a thirteenth century mystic whose prose presented an incomprehensible but attractive amalgam of gloomy ectasies, tender raptures, and violent rages.\\") Mentioned in The Razor's Edge, a novel by W. Somerset Maugham.

She was the lead ship of the first British s and the only one to have a single bow torpedo tube. She was actually sunk twice: first in 1904 when she became the first submarine casualty, with the loss of all hands; however, she was recovered, but sank again in 1911, this time when she was unmanned. The wreck was discovered in 1989 and was deisgnated under the Protection of Wrecks Act in 1998.The Advisory Committee for Historic Wreck Sites Annual Report for 2005 The wreck is a Protected Wreck managed by Design and construction She was an enlarged and improved – longer than the Royal Navy's five \\"Holland\\"-type boats. The most notable improvement was the addition of a conning tower. Subsequent A-class boats were even larger and differed from her in several respects. Like all members of her class, she was built at Vickers, Barrow-in-Furness. She was launched on 9 July 1902. Before she left the yard she suffered from a hydrogen explosion. Later while under tow to Portsmouth to join with the rest of the navy's submarines, seawater managed to reach her batteries, which gave off chlorine gas, forcing the evacuation of the vessel. Casualty, recovery, loss and rediscovery 1904 illustration of the loss. She was accidentally sunk in the Solent on 18 March 1904 whilst carrying out a practice attack on the protected cruiser by being struck on the starboard side of the conning tower by a mail steamer, SS Berwick Castle, which was en route from Southampton to Hamburg. She sank in only of water, but the boat flooded and the entire crew was drowned.Submarine losses 1904 to present day RN submarine museum website One consequence was that all subsequent Royal Navy submarines were equipped with a watertight hatch at the bottom of the conning tower.* She was raised on 18 April 1904 and repaired and re-entered service. Following a petrol explosion in August 1910, she was converted to a testbed for the Admiralty's Anti-Submarine Committee. She was lost a year later when running submerged but unmanned under automatic pilot. Although the position of her sinking was known at the time, all efforts to locate her were fruitless.

It ostensibly derives from the name of their mother, Pleione, effectively meaning \\"daughters of Pleione\\". However, the name of the star- cluster likely came first, and Pleione was invented to explain it.Robin Hard, The Routledge Handbook of Greek Mythology (London: Routledge, 2004), p. 518.

Oxford University Press, December 2014. Web. 20 January 2015.  Seven Sisters  Several of the most prominent male Olympian gods (including Zeus, Poseidon, and Ares) engaged in affairs with the seven heavenly sisters. These relationships resulted in the birth of their children. * Maia (Μαῖα), eldestPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca of Pseudo- Apollodorus 3.112. https://www.theoi.com/Text/Apollodorus3.html of the seven Pleiades, was mother of Hermes by Zeus. * Electra (Ἠλέκτρα) was mother of Dardanus and Iasion, by Zeus. * Taygete (Ταϋγέτη) was mother of Lacedaemon, also by Zeus. * Alcyone (Ἀλκυόνη) was mother of Hyrieus, Hyperenor and Aethusa by Poseidon. * Celaeno (Κελαινώ) was mother of Lycus and Nycteus by Poseidon; and of Eurypylus also by Poseidon, and of Lycus and Chimaereus by Prometheus. * Sterope (Στερόπη) (also Asterope) was mother of Oenomaus by Ares. * Merope (Μερόπη), youngest of the seven Pleiades, was wooed by Orion. In other mythic contexts she married Sisyphus and, becoming mortal, faded away. She bore Sisyphus several sons. Sometimes they are related to the Hesperides, nymphs of the morning star.  Mythology  Lost Pleiad (1884) by William-Adolphe Bouguereau. After Atlas was forced to carry the heavens on his shoulders, Orion began to pursue all of the Pleiades, and Zeus transformed them first into doves, and then into stars to comfort their father. The constellation of Orion is said to still pursue them across the night sky. One of the most memorable myths involving the Pleiades is the story of how these sisters literally became stars, their catasterism. According to some versions of the tale, all seven sisters committed suicide because they were so saddened by either the fate of their father, Atlas, or the loss of their siblings, the Hyades. In turn Zeus, the ruler of the Greek gods, immortalized the sisters by placing them in the sky. There these seven stars formed the star cluster known thereafter as the Pleiades. The Greek poet Hesiod mentions the Pleiades several times in his Works and Days. As the Pleiades are primarily winter stars, they feature prominently in the ancient agricultural calendar. Here is a bit of advice from Hesiod: The Pleiades would \\"flee mighty Orion and plunge into the misty deep\\" as they set in the West, which they would begin to do just before dawn during October–November, a good time of the year to lay up your ship after the fine summer weather and \\"remember to work the land\\"; in Mediterranean agriculture autumn is the time to plough and sow. The poet Lord Tennyson mentions the Pleiades in his poem Locksley Hall: The loss of one of the sisters, Merope, in some myths may reflect an astronomical event wherein one of the stars in the Pleiades star cluster disappeared from view by the naked eye.The Pleiades in mythology, Pleiade Associates, Bristol, United Kingdom, accessed June 7, 2012Marusek, James A., Did a Supernova cause the Collapse of Civilization in India?, October 28, 2005  Alternate version  In the account of Diodorus, the Pleiades were called Atlantides after their father Atlas and Hesperides from their mother Hesperis, daughter of Hesperus, brother of Atlas (making him the uncle of his bride). These sisters excelled in beauty and chastity and thus, Busiris, the king of the Egyptians, was seized with desire to get the maidens into his power; and consequently he dispatched pirates by sea with orders to seize the girls and deliver them into his hands. Later on, Heracles conquered this prince when the latter attempted to sacrifice the hero. Meanwhile the pirates who had seized the girls while they were playing in a certain garden and carried them off, and fleeing swiftly to their ships had sailed away with them. Heracles came upon these pirates as they were taking their meal on a certain strand, and learning from the maidens what had taken place he slew the pirates to a man and brought the girls back to Atlas. In return, the father was so grateful to Heracles for his kindly deed that he not only gladly gave him such assistance as his Labour called for, but he also instructed him quite freely in the knowledge of astrology.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca historica 4.27.1-3. A scholia also added that after this events, the Pleiades were then persecuted by Orion.Scholia, on Apollonius of Rhodes, Argonautica 3.309 Although most accounts are uniform as to the number, names, and main myths concerning the Pleiades, the mythological information recorded by a scholiast on Theocritus' Idylls with reference to CallimachusScholia on Theocritus, Idyll 13, 25 has nothing in common with the traditional version. According to it, the Pleiades were daughters of an Amazonian queen; their names were Maia, Coccymo, Glaucia, Protis, Parthenia, Stonychia, and Lampado. They were credited with inventing ritual dances and nighttime festivals.

The system labels the cream of the crop as gifted. Clark (2002) defines giftedness as “only a label that society gives to those who have actualized their ability to an unusually high degree or give evidence that such achievement is imminent”. The American government defines giftedness as “students, children or youth who give evidence of high performance capability in areas such as intellectual, creative, artistic, or leadership capacity, or in specific academic fields, and who require services or activities not ordinarily provided by the school in order to fully develop such capabilities” (Clark, 2002). Gifted students learn in a different manner and at an accelerated rate compared to their peers in the classroom and therefore require gifted programs to develop and apply their talents. Gifted children need outside instruction and development opportunities to expand their minds and become most useful to society and themselves. In a list of reasons compiled in Fostering Academic Excellence, McLeod and Cropley (1989) describe the specific advantages to placing gifted children in adequate programs: #“Gifted children are a resource”; here the need for inventive and intelligent minds who will improve the quality of life and advance in the new technological age is stated. #“The gifted deserve special treatment corresponding to that received by the handicapped;” the gifted ought to have the same financial support that is given to other groups that are far from the “norm”. #“Gifted children need adequate stimulation;” a debate is raised between the incentive that gifted children gain by being in an isolated class of the top five-percent and the argument that normal and slow children would benefit from being mixed in with giftedness. #“Special provision for the gifted will prevent dropouts, underachievement and delinquency;” gifted children may lose their zest for school when kept back from learning at their own pace and may almost strive to achieve “normality” to “have a quiet life in school”. (McLeod & Cropley, 1989). Not only is it important to give the gifted the extra push which is beneficial to society, those students’ minds also operate in a unique way and require a different style of teaching. “The intellectually adept think and learn differently from others…it is important to teach them appropriately” (Freeman et al., 1999). As Merenheimo is quoted in the Journal of Biological Education, “gifted pupils have an analytic strategy of perceiving information. The less gifted use either atomistic or serialistic strategies” (Freeman et al., 1999). Gifted children were also found to be more ambitious—both in the difficulty and effort put into the task—in their schoolwork than others their age. (Freeman et al., 1999). Schools should bear some responsibility to nurture the talents of the gifted students in their charge. “It is clear from the evidence that excellence does not emerge without appropriate help…. To reach an exceptionally high standard in any area, potentially gifted children need the means to learn; this includes the material to work with and focused, challenging tuition, sometimes including tutoring or mentoring that is not provided in normal schools” (Freeman et al., 1999). Two methods mentioned by Freeman that schools use in the teaching of gifted children are: 1. Accelerating the learning of children, either by moving them up to an older age-group or compacting the material they have to learn, and 2. Enrichment, rounding out, and deepening the material to be learned (Freeman et al., 1999). Classroom guidelines for teaching the gifted * “To be at their most effective, pupils can be helped to identify their own ways of learning, which will include strategies of planning, monitoring, evaluation, and choice of what to learn. They should also be helped to be aware of their attitudes to the area to be learned, such as curiosity, persistence, and confidence.” (Freeman et al., 1999). * “All the evidence indicates that specific provision within subject areas is by far the most effective in promoting talent, rather than general enrichment without identified goals.” (Freeman et al., 1999) * “Meaningful curriculum experiences for gifted learners need to be carefully planned, written down, implemented, and evaluated in order to maximize potential effect.” (Van Tassel-Baska, 2000) * Giftedness “can be furthered only by participation in learning experiences that challenge and extend from the point of the child’s talent, ability, and interest” (Clark, 2002). Gifted students may not reach their full potential with the standards of regular classwork, which can appear to progress at a slowed rate. They may become isolated from their peers on a social level, since intellectual pursuit for the sake of itself is their primary motivation. These students may receive the desired enrichment when put among other high achievers via accelerated coursework and by allowing them to develop their own ideas and viewpoints. Programs tailored for gifted students can cultivate an environment conducive to their success. Difficulties with socialization A common myth concerning gifted youth in regular classrooms is that the gifted are a great asset to other students and, through their brilliance, help those of normal intelligence to become better students. According to the National Association for Gifted Children, the self-confidence of normal students is not heightened by the presence of a brilliant young mind. Conversely, historical examples of jealousy and spite toward gifted students have been noted by writers. Leonard Mlodinow recounts of Isaac Newton's school years that \\"being different and clearly intellectually superior brought Newton the same reaction then as it would today—the other kids hated him.\\" An additional concern is that gifted children who are pulled form their traditional grade level classroom for enrichment education will fail to strive in their social relationships. It has been shown, however, that students who participate in either in-class or pull- out programs that are at least mostly meeting the academic needs of the student, will tend to form strong relationships with their peers, be well- rounded students, and act an age that is appropriate for their own wellness Gallagher, J. J. (2015). Peer acceptance of highly gifted children in elementary school. Journal for the Education of the Gifted, 38(1), 51-57. doi: 10.1177/0162353214565549. In fact, studies have shown that gifted students, whether lowly gifted, moderately gifted, or highly gifted “were, on a whole, socially well adjusted, and there seemed to be no relation between increased intelligence and social adjustment”Gallagher, J. J. (2015). Peer acceptance of highly gifted children in elementary school. Journal for the Education of the Gifted, 38(1), 51-57. doi: 10.1177/0162353214565549. Students who are allowed to meet their academic needs, at any level, tend to be more secure and confident in their social needs and in turn form more significant relationships with their age peers. While many link a child's social growth with their academic growth and assume that one must suffer in order for the other to prosper, this has been statistically shown to not be the case. Assessment So now that the necessity of these gifted programs have been established, how then do schools and talent search programs identify who meet the criteria for being gifted? National Excellence: A Case for Developing America's Talent suggests that the following guidelines be used (Clark, 2002): #Look at a variety of disciplines for outstanding students. #Use a variety of tests and other assessment measures to find and serve students who express high levels of ability in different ways and at different ages. #Ensure that all students have equal access to challenging learning opportunities and unbiased assessment. #Develop assessment procedures that allow varying rates of maturity and interests. #Seek students whose potential evidences itself in diverse and less obvious ways. #Consider motivational factors such as interest, drive, and passion in assessing accomplishment. There are six areas of ability which are often evaluated in order to determine whether or not a child is gifted: generic, cognitive, academic, creative, leadership, and visual and performing arts. They are measured in combinations of standardized tests, peer and teacher evaluations and nominations, and observations of the particular child. As for the legitimacy of these methods, Olszewski-Kubilius assures us that “the available research evidence suggests that these practices are valid” (Olszewski-Kubilius et al., 1998).

Born in Makhachkala, Daghestan. A 1970 graduate of The Daghestan State Pedagogical Institute, Nazlymov earned a bachelor's and master's degree in physical education. He earned the title of Master of the Sport (Fencing) in 1968. Early years Nazlymov began fencing at a young age in Makhachkala, Daghestan. His first coach was Gaik Kazaryan (). While fulfilling a two-year army obligation, which was mandatory for all 18-year-olds in the Soviet Union, Nazlymov was put in a special regimen where he was able to fence with the Central Sports Army Club team in Moscow. He achieved a rank of Colonel with the Red Army. Competitive years / Olympic fame / Civilian Awards Medal For Labour ValourMedal For Distinguished Labour Competing for the Soviet Union, Nazlymov was a three-time Olympic Team Gold medalist (1968, 1976, 1980), Team Silver medalist (1972) and individual silver and bronze medalist (1976, 1972). In addition to his six Olympic medals, Nazlymov also is a 10-time World Champion. Eight of the championships were team titles, while two were individual crowns (1975, 1979). Additionally, he was a world championship silver medalist (1977) and bronze medalist (1970, 1973). From 1971-1977, Nazlymov reigned as the USSR national champion (team and individual). In recognition of his success, Nazlymov twice was named the world's best sabre fencer by the (F.I.E.) International Fencing Federation (1975, 1977). For his achievements and dedication to the sport of fencing, Nazlymov also was awarded two civilian medals of the Soviet Union (Medal \\"For Labour Valour\\", Medal \\"For Distinguished Labour\\") Coaching career Nazlymov's coaching career began in Moscow as the head coach of the Soviet Union Military Fencing Team from 1976-90. The Central Sports Army Club (ЦСКА) in Moscow was a state of the art training facility for the Soviet Olympic Machine. The club churned out teams that dominated Olympic hockey, gymnastics, fencing, Greco-Roman wrestling, and many more. From 1970-80, Nazlymov served as the captain of the USSR Olympic Team. His students won two Olympic gold medals and 12 world championships, as well as eight European Championship crowns. From 1986-88, Nazlymov served as the USSR National Team's head coach. The USSR went on to win a gold medal at the 1986 World Championships and silver medals at the 1987 Worlds and 1988 Olympics. Move to USA After moving to the United States with his family in 1991, Nazlymov captained the USA team at the World Championships from 1995–97 and at the 1995 and 1997 World University Games. Nazlymov also served as the sabre coach for the U.S. National Team from 1994-99. Nazlymov guided US teams to ninth-place finish at the 1996 Olympics, third place at the 1997 Junior World Championships, and 12th place at the Senior World Championships. He was named a coach for the 1999 US Pan American Games and 1999 Senior World Championships teams. His US Junior Team finished in second place in the overall medal count at the Junior Worlds in 2001. In 1999, he was named Coach of the Year by the United States Fencing Association. NCAA In the end of 1999, Nazlymov came to The Ohio State University after spending eight years as the head coach for the Kansas City, Mo., School District, where he developed a fencing program, as well as establishing a private club in the Kansas City area (KCFC). Nazlymov's new goal was to guide his new team to win an NCAA crown and produce a new generation of US Olympic fencers. In the 2003-04 and 2007-08 seasons, Nazlymov guided Ohio State Buckeyes to the NCAA Collegiate Fencing National Championship, as well as produced several individual NCAA champions (Adam Crompton, Boaz Ellis, Andras Horanyi) and numerous All-Americans. In 2004, two of Nazlymov's students, Jason Rogers and Louise Bond-Williams qualified for the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece. Most recent OSU Fencing team member and Nazlymov's student Siobhan Byrne participated in 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China. In his eight years at Ohio State, Nazlymov holds a men's and women's combined record of 270-73 (.787). He retired from coaching in Spring 2018. Officiating credentials Nazlymov is an internationally ranked referee (Category A) and officiated at the 1988 Olympic games as well as several World Championships from 1981 to 1990. Progeny Nazlymov's son, Vitali began fencing the age of 9 under the instruction of Anzor Gagulashvili in Central Sports Army Club. Vitali was bronze medalist in the USSR youth and junior nationals as well as a champion of the Military Games. He was also a candidate for the 1992 USSR Olympic Team. After moving to United States, Vitali was offered a full scholarship to Penn State University. At Penn State, he won 1991 Individual NCAA championship and led the team to two national championship titles. Vitali pursued a career in banking, currently in a role of VP with Morgan Stanley. Fencing Alliance of Ohio In his quest to raise the bar on the level of fencing in United States and to develop an Olympic Caliber Nationwide Training program, Nazlymov started a new club in Columbus, OH, called the Fencing Alliance of Ohio.

During his tenure as sultan, the Ayyubids defeated the Fifth Crusade. He was known to the Frankish crusaders as Meledin, a name by which he is still referred to in some older western sources. As a result of the Sixth Crusade, he ceded Jerusalem to the Christians and is known to have met with Saint Francis.Saint Francis and the Sultan: The Curious History of a Christian- Muslim Encounter, John V. Tolan OUP 2009  Biography  = Jazira campaign = Al-Kamil was the son of sultan al-Adil (\\"Saphadin\\"), a brother of Saladin. Al-Kamil's father was laying siege to the city of Mardin (in modern-day Turkey) in 1199 when he was called away urgently to deal with a security threat in Damascus. Al-Adil left al-Kamil to command the forces around Mardin continuing the siege.Humphreys, R. Stephen, From Saladin to the Mongols: The Ayyubids of Damascus 1193-1260, p.112 Taking advantage of the Sultan's absence, the combined forces of Mosul, Sinjar and Jazirat ibn Umar appeared at Mardin when it was on the point of surrender, and drew Al-Kamil into battle. He was badly defeated and retreated to Mayyafariqin.Humphreys, R. Stephen, From Saladin to the Mongols: The Ayyubids of Damascus 1193-1260, p.114 However dissent and weakness among his opponents meant that Al-Kamil was able to secure Ayyubid rule in the Jazira Region by taking Harran (in modern-day Turkey).Humphreys, R. Stephen, From Saladin to the Mongols: The Ayyubids of Damascus 1193-1260, p.115The chronicle of Ibn al-Athir for the Crusading period from al-Kamil fi'l-Tarikh, Part 3, edited by D. S. Richards Ashgate Publishing Ltd, Farnham 2008, p.46 = Viceroy of Egypt = In 596/1200, after proclaiming himself Sultan, Al-Adil invited Al-Kamil to come from the Eastern Territories to join him in Egypt as his viceroy (na'ib) in that country. Al- Adil's second son, Al-Mu'azzam Isa, had already been made prince of Damascus in 594/1198.Humphreys, R. Stephen, From Saladin to the Mongols: The Ayyubids of Damascus 1193-1260, p.125 It appears that Al-Adil allowed Al-Kamil a fairly high degree of authority, since he oversaw much of the work on the Cairo Citadel, issued decrees in his own name, and even managed to persuade his father to dismiss the powerful minister Ibn Shukr.Humphreys, R. Stephen, From Saladin to the Mongols: The Ayyubids of Damascus 1193-1260, p.145 Al-Kamil remained viceroy until his father's death in 1218 when he became Sultan himself. = The Fifth Crusade = In 1218 when Al-Adil died, the Ayyubid domains were divided into three parts, with Al-Kamil ruling Egypt, his brother Al-Muazzam Isa ruling in Palestine and Transjordan, and a third brother, Al- Ashraf Musa in Syria and the Jazira. Nominally the other two recognised Al- Kamil's supremacy as Sultan. Unusually for an Ayyubid succession, there was no obvious dissent or rivalry between the brothers at this point, partly because just before Al-Adil's death, Egypt had been attacked by the forces of the Fifth Crusade.Humphreys, R. Stephen, From Saladin to the Mongols: The Ayyubids of Damascus 1193-1260, p.161 Al-Kamil took command of the forces which defended Damietta against the Crusaders. In 1219 he was almost overthrown by a conspiracy led by the amir Imad ad-Din ibn al-Mashtub, commander of the Hakkari Kurdish regiment, to replace him with his younger and more pliant brother al-Faiz Ibrahim. Alerted to the conspiracy, Al-Kamil had to flee the camp to safety and in the ensuing confusion the Crusaders were able to tighten their grip on Damietta. Al-Kamil considered fleeing to Yemen, which was ruled by his son Al-Mas'ud, but the timely arrival of his brother Al-Muazzam from Syria with reinforcements brought the conspiracy to a swift end.Humphreys, R. Stephen, From Saladin to the Mongols: The Ayyubids of Damascus 1193-1260, p.163 Al-Kamil made many offers of peace to the Crusaders, all of which were rejected, due to the influence of the papal legate Pelagius. He offered to return Jerusalem and rebuild its walls (which his brother had torn down earlier in the year), and to return the True Cross (which he probably did not have). At one point he even negotiated with Francis of Assisi, who had accompanied the crusade, and who apparently tried to convert the sultan. Due to famine and disease after the Nile failed to flood, al-Kamil could not defend Damietta and it was captured in November 1219.Riley-Smith, Jonathan (ed.), The Atlas of the Crusades,Times Books 1990, p.94 The sultan withdrew to al-Mansourah, a fortress further up the Nile. After this there was little action until 1221, when al-Kamil offered peace again, proposing to surrender the entire territory of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, except Transjordan, in return for the Crusaders evacuating Egypt but was again refused. The Crusaders marched out towards Cairo, but al-Kamil simply opened the dams and allowed the Nile to flood, and finally the Crusaders accepted an eight-year peace. He retook Damietta in September.

By Benozzo Gozzoli. =Power struggle and the treaty of 1229 = In the following years there was a power struggle with his brother al-Mu'azzam, and al-Kamil was willing to accept a peace with emperor and King of Sicily Frederick II, who was planning the Sixth Crusade. Al- Mu'azzam died in 1227, eliminating the need for a peace, but Frederick had already arrived in Palestine. After al-Mu'azzam's death, al-Kamil and his other brother al-Ashraf negotiated a treaty, giving all of Palestine (including Transjordan) to al-Kamil and Syria to al-Ashraf. In February 1229 al-Kamil negotiated a ten-year peace with Frederick II and returned Jerusalem and other holy sites to the Crusader kingdom.The New Cambridge Medieval History: Volume 5, C.1198-c.1300 edited by David Abulafia, CUP 1999 p.576 The treaty of 1229 is unique in the history of the Crusades. By diplomacy alone and without major military confrontation, Jerusalem, Bethlehem, and a corridor running to the sea were ceded to the kingdom of Jerusalem. Exception was made for the Temple area, the Dome of the Rock, and the Aqsa Mosque, which the Muslims retained. Moreover, all current Muslim residents of the city would retain their homes and property. They would also have their own city officials to administer a separate justice system and safeguard their religious interests. The walls of Jerusalem, which had been destroyed, were rebuilt, and the peace was to last for 10 years. However although there was peace with the Crusaders, al-Kamil had to contend with the Seljuks and the Khwarezmians before he died in 1238. = Successors = His sons as-Salih Ayyub and al-Adil II succeeded him in Syria and Egypt respectively, but the Ayyubid empire soon descended into civil war. In 1239 the treaty with Frederick expired, and Jerusalem came under Ayyubid control. = Personality = Al-Kamil exemplified the Islamic laws of war. For example, after al-Kamil defeated the Franks during the Crusades, Oliverus Scholasticus praised and commented on how al- Kamil supplied the defeated Frankish army with food:  See also  *List of rulers of Egypt  References   External links  Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:1170s births Category:1238 deaths Category:Ayyubid sultans of Egypt Category:Muslims of the Fifth Crusade Category:Muslims of the Sixth Crusade Category:13th-century Egyptian people ","title":"Al-Kamil"},{"id":"852668","text":"HMS A2 was an submarine built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the 20th century.

He served as leader of the Manitoba Conservatives in the late 1910s, and was subsequently a member of the United Farmers of Manitoba. Born in Upton, Canada East (now Quebec), the son of Firmin Prefontaine and Mathilde (Mathilda) Desautels, Préfontaine was educated in Greenfield, Massachusetts. He subsequently moved to Manitoba in 1880, where he worked as a farmer and store manager and served as Reeve of the Municipality of De Salaberry from 1892 to 1896. In 1888, he married Albina L'Heureux. Préfontaine was president of the Carillon Agricultural Society, of the Carey Elevator Company and of the St. Pierre Trading Company. Préfontaine was first elected to the provincial parliament in 1903, running for Rodmond Roblin's governing Conservatives in the francophone riding of Carillon. He was re-elected in 1907 and 1910. In 1914, Préfontaine lost his seat to Liberal Thomas Molloy by seven votes. He was re-elected the following year, despite the disastrous showing of the Conservatives in the rest of the province. His victory may be credited to the fact that the provincial Conservatives were seen as more supportive of francophone rights than were Tobias Norris's Liberals (indeed, Norris' government withdrew state funding for French-language education soon after the election). Conservative leader James Aikins lost his seat in the 1915 election, and Préfontaine was chosen to lead the small opposition caucus in parliament (he was sworn in as leader of the opposition in January 1916). He declined to be a candidate in the party's leadership convention, held on November 6, 1919. Although it had been in government from 1900 to 1915, the Conservative Party of Manitoba was marginalized by developments in the later half of the 1910s. Increasingly radicalized farmer and labour groups were forming political organizations of their own, and the old divisions between Grit and Tory no longer seemed as relevant. The Conservatives again fared poorly in the election of 1920, and Préfontaine was personally defeated by Farmer candidate Maurice Duprey. After this loss, Préfontaine detached himself from the Conservative Party. He ran as an Independent in the federal election of 1921, losing to Progressive candidate Arthur-Lucien Beaubien in the Provencher riding, and subsequently left the Conservatives to join the United Farmers of Manitoba. Running as a UFM candidate, he was re-elected for Carillon in 1922. On December 3, 1923, Premier John Bracken appointed Préfontaine to the high-level cabinet positions of Provincial Secretary, Provincial Lands Commissioner and Railway Commissioner. Préfontaine also became Minister of Agriculture in 1925. In the 1927 election, he defeated his old nemesis Thomas Molloy by a landslide. Préfontaine stood down as Provincial Secretary, Provincial Lands Commissioner and Minister of Agriculture in 1928, though he retained the Railway Commissioner's position until 1932. He was re- elected in that year's general election, and continued to serve the Franco- Manitoban community as a Minister without Portfolio until his death in 1935. Préfontaine's career reveals the continued importance of the francophone community to Manitoba politics, even after immigration from Ontario and Eastern Europe had significantly reduced their relative strength. His decision to join the UFM was indicative of a larger cultural change, as Franco- Manitobans became an important part of the Progressive Party of Manitoba during its long period in government. His son Edmond also served in the Manitoba assembly. The resort community of Albert Beach, Manitoba (French: \\"Plage Albert\\") was named after him.

W. Rouse Ball (1960) Calculating Prodigies, in Mathematical Recreations and Essays, Macmillan, New York, chapter 13. Biography Colburn was born in Cabot, Vermont, in 1804. He was thought to be intellectually disabled until the age of six. However, after six weeks of schooling his father overheard him repeating his multiplication tables. His father was not sure whether or not he learned the tables from his older brothers and sisters but he decided to test him further on his mathematical abilities and discovered that there was something special about his son when Zerah correctly multiplied 13 and 97. Colburn's abilities developed rapidly and he was soon able to solve such problems as the number of seconds in 2,000 years, the product of 12,225 and 1,223, or the square root of 1,449. When he was seven years old he took six seconds to give the numbers of hours in thirty-eight years, two months, and seven days. Zerah is reported to have been able to solve fairly complex problems. For example, the sixth Fermat number is 225+1 (or 232+1). The question is whether this number, 4,294,967,297, is prime or not. Zerah calculated in his head that it was not and has divisor 641. The other divisor is 6,700,417 and can easily be found using a calculator. His father capitalized on his boy's talents by taking Zerah around the country and eventually abroad, demonstrating the boy's exceptional abilities. The two left Vermont in the winter of 1810–11. Passing through Hanover, New Hampshire, John Wheelock, then president of Dartmouth College, offered to take upon himself the whole care and expense of his education, but his father rejected the offer. At Boston, the boy's performances attracted much attention. He was visited by Harvard College professors and eminent people from all professions, and the newspapers ran numerous articles concerning his powers of computation. After leaving Boston, his father exhibited Zerah for money throughout the middle and part of the southern states and, in January 1812, sailed with him for England. In September 1813 Colburn was being exhibited in Dublin. Colburn was pitted against the 8-year-old William Rowan Hamilton in a mental arithmetic contest, with Colburn emerging the clear victor. In reaction to his defeat, Hamilton dedicated less time to studying languages and more time to studying mathematics. After traveling over England, Scotland, and Ireland, they spent 18 months in Paris. Here Zerah was placed in the Lycée Napoléon, but was soon removed by his father, who, at length, in 1816, returned to England in deep poverty. The Earl of Bristol soon became interested in the boy, and placed him in Westminster School, where he remained until 1819. In consequence of his father's refusal to comply with certain arrangements proposed by the earl, Zerah was removed from Westminster, and his father now proposed to Zerah that he should study to become an actor. Accordingly, he studied for this profession, and was for a few months under the tuition of Charles Kemble. His first appearance, however, dissatisfied both his instructor and himself so much, that he was not accepted for the stage, so he accepted a position as an assistant in a school, and soon afterward commenced a school of his own. To this he added the performing of some astronomical calculations for Thomas Young, then secretary of the Board of Longitude. In 1824 when his father died, he was enabled by the Earl of Bristol and other friends to return to the United States. Though Zerah's schooling was rather irregular, he showed talent in languages. He went to Fairfield, New York, as assistant teacher of an academy; but not being pleased with his situation, he moved in March following to Burlington, Vermont, where he taught French, pursuing his studies at the same time in the University of Vermont. Toward the end of 1825 he connected himself with the Methodist Church and, after nine years of service as an itinerant preacher, he settled in Norwich, Vermont, in 1835, where he was soon after appointed professor of languages at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. In 1833 Colburn published his autobiography. From this it appears that his faculty of computation left him about the time he reached adulthood. He died of tuberculosis at the age of 34 and was buried in Norwich's Old Meeting House Cemetery. Family His nephew, also named Zerah Colburn, was a noted locomotive engineer and technical journalist. He has known descendants living in Vermont.

These corals can be recognized by their jet-black or dark brown chitin skeletons, surrounded by the polyps (part of coral that is alive). Antipatharians are a cosmopolitan order, existing at nearly every location and depth, with the sole exception of brackish waters. However, they are most frequently found on continental slopes under deep. A black coral reproduces both sexually and asexually throughout its lifetime. Many black corals provide housing, shelter, food, and protection for other animals. Black corals were originally classified in the subclass Ceriantipatharia along with ceriantharians (tube-dwelling anemones), but were later reclassified under Hexacorallia. Though they have historically been used by Pacific Islanders for medical treatment and in rituals, its only modern use is making jewelry. Black corals have been declining in numbers and are expected to continue declining due to the effects of poaching, ocean acidification and climate change. Etymology Despite its name, a black coral is rarely black, and depending on the species can be white, red, green, yellow, or brown. The corals get their name from their black skeletons, which are composed of protein and chitin. Black corals have several different names. One of the more common names is thorn coral, so called because of the microscopic spines all along the skeleton. The name Antipatharia comes from the Ancient Greek word (\\"against disease\\"). In the Hawaiian language, a black coral is called (\\"hard bush growing in the sea\\"); it is the official state gem of Hawaii. In Malay, the corals are called (\\"root of the sea\\"), likely named for their tendency to grow at low-light depths. Taxonomy and classification Black corals have historically been difficult to classify due to poor-quality specimens. They have few distinguishing morphological characteristics, and the few that there are vary across species, similar to other corals. When black corals were first documented by Henri Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime, two French zoologists in 1857, all species of Antipatharia were placed in the family Antipathidae. From 2001 to 2006, marine biologists Dennis Opresko and Tina Molodtsova helped transform the taxonomic system into what it is today. A 2007 phylogenetic study confirmed the new taxonomic system. Blacks corals are classified in the order Antipatharia with 7 families, 44 genera, and 280 distinct species. The families are Antipathidae, Aphanipathidae, Cladopathidae, Leiopathidae, Myriopathidae, Schizopathidae, and Stylopathidae. Black corals can be distinguished from other corals by their black, flexible skeletons and near- total lack of any kind of protection from sediment. All black corals have small or medium-sized polyps and a chitin skeleton, lined with small spines. =Genera= List of genera according to the World Register of Marine Species: * Family Antipathidae Ehrenberg, 1834 ** Allopathes Opresko & , 1994 ** Antipathes Pallas, 1766 ** Cirrhipathes de Blainville, 1830 ** Hillopathes van Pesch, 1914 ** Pseudocirrhipathes Bo et al., 2009 ** Pteropathes , 1889 ** Stichopathes Brook, 1889 * Family Aphanipathidae Opresko, 2004 ** subfamily Acanthopathinae Opresko, 2004 *** Acanthopathes Opresko, 2004 *** Distichopathes Opresko, 2004 *** Elatopathes Opresko, 2004 *** Rhipidipathes Milne-Edwards & Haime, 1857 ** subfamily Aphanipathinae Opresko, 2004 *** Aphanipathes Brook, 1889 *** Asteriopathes Opresko, 2004 *** Phanopathes Opresko, 2004 *** Pteridopathes Opresko, 2004 *** Tetrapathes Opresko, 2004 * Family Cladopathidae Kinoshita, 1910 ** subfamily Cladopathinae Kinoshita, 1910 *** Chrysopathes Opresko, 2003 *** Cladopathes Brook, 1889 *** Trissopathes Opresko, 2003 ** subfamily Hexapathinae Opresko, 2003 *** Heteropathes Opresko, 2011 *** Hexapathes Kinoshita, 1910 ** subfamily Sibopathinae Opresko, 2003 *** Sibopathes Van Pesch, 1914 * Family Leiopathidae Haeckel, 1896 ** Leiopathes Haime, 1849 * Family Myriopathidae Opresko, 2001 ** Antipathella Brook, 1889 ** Cupressopathes Opresko, 2001 ** Myriopathes Opresko, 2001 ** Plumapathes Opresko, 2001 ** Tanacetipathes Opresko, 2001 * Family Schizopathidae Brook, 1889 ** Abyssopathes Opresko, 2002 ** Alternatipathes Molodtsova & Opresko, 2017 ** Bathypathes Brook, 1889 ** Dendrobathypathes Opresko, 2002 ** Dendropathes Opresko, 2005 ** Lillipathes Opresko, 2002 ** Parantipathes Brook, 1889 ** Saropathes Opresko, 2002 ** Schizopathes Brook, 1889 ** Stauropathes Opresko, 2002 ** Taxipathes Brook, 1889 ** Telopathes MacIsaac & Best, 2013 ** Umbellapathes Opresko, 2005 * Family Stylopathidae Opresko, 2006 ** Stylopathes Opresko, 2006 ** Triadopathes Opresko, 2006 ** Tylopathes Brook, 1889 Physical characteristics A sample of coral next to its skeleton, showing the minuscule spines all along it The skeleton grows of these corals grow in many patterns unique to black corals, such as whips, trees, fans, or coils. These range in size from , though polyps can be as small as in size. Skeletons are also lined with tiny spikes. These spikes are roughly in size, and vary widely in terms of size, length, proportion, and sharpness. A layer of \\"bark\\" forms around the skeleton as the coral grows. The polyps that live inside this bark are less than and are gelatinous and have six tentacles (the same as hard corals and unlike soft corals, which have eight). These polyps can be nearly any color. Some corals also have \\"sweeper tentacles\\", which can grow up to long. Though individual polyps are either male or female, entire colonies are typically hermaphroditic. Unlike the vast majority of other corals, black corals have no protection against abrasive materials such as sand and rocks and lack muscular development which can help the corals to hide. These factors can lead to sediment tearing the soft tissue, resulting in death. In response, corals live near crevices, which allows much of their body to be protected. Ecology =Habitat= A Cirrhipathes coral, sometimes known as wire coral Though black corals occur throughout all the oceans, nearly 75% of them can only survive at depths below due to a lack of harmful free-floating sediment. The sole oceanic area in which black corals have not been found are brackish waters, though they can inhabit areas with decreased salinity. Black corals will occasionally help to build reefs, but will more often choose to live alone. Most individuals require a hard surface to attach to. They will frequently grow where undersea currents flow, which allows them to feed on the meiofauna that is swept by. Since undersea currents benefit the corals, they will often grow on or by geographic structures that cause currents, such as continental slopes, cliffs, caves, or undersea plateaus. =Diet= Black corals are carnivorous, with the coral's polyps allowing it to feed mostly on meiofauna such as zooplankton. The polyps of cnidarians have an oral disk in their center which serves as the mouth for the coral. The disk is surrounded by the tentacles, which stings and digests food. The reason many corals are fan-shaped is to catch meiofauna. Many corals only have polyps on the downstream side of the coral, allowing them to catch nearly the same amount of animals without wasting energy keeping unnecessary polyps alive. A princess parrotfish, one of the few predators of black coral =Predators= Vertebrate predation is not a major threat to black corals. There are rare reports of parrotfish and butterflyfish gnawing and eating at the polyps of black corals and even if a polyp is gnawed off, it will not affect the coral. The skeleton of a black coral is hard and inert, due to its composition of protein and chitin, making it nearly inedible. Though black coral skeletons have been found in the stomachs of green sea turtles and sharks, these incidents are rare; it has thus been suggested that black corals are not a major part of any vertebrate diets. However, invertebrates such as muricids and ovulids feed on black corals and similar corals regularly. These mollusks mimic the polyps that the coral typically feeds on and is taken inside of the coral. They will then consume the polyps from the inside out. Various mollusks, such as Coralliophila kaofitorum and Phenacovolva carneptica live solely where various species of black corals are found, suggesting that they prey exclusively on the species. =Interactions= Black corals around the world provide a unique environment for crustaceans, bivalves, and fish. Some species, such as Dascyllus albisella and Centropyge potteri inhabit specific coral trees. Due to this abundance of species, nighttime predation around the coral beds has been observed. Life cycle and reproduction Due to the slow life cycle and deep-water habitats of black coral, little is known about their life cycle and reproduction. As with other cnidarians, the life cycle of these corals involves both asexual and sexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction (also known as budding), is the first method of reproduction used by a black coral during their lifespan. Once a polyp is anchored, it builds a colony by creating a skeleton, growing new branches and making it thicker, similar to the growth of a tree. This method of growing creates \\"growth rings\\" which can be used to estimate the age of a colony. Asexual reproduction can also occur if a branch breaks off and a replacement is needed. Though light is not required for growth or development, mature colonies will grow towards light. Why they do so is unknown. Antipathes dendrochristos growing several hundred meters down in the ocean Little is known about sexual reproduction in these corals. Sexual reproduction occurs after the coral colony is established. A colony will produce eggs and sperm, which meet in the water to create larvae that use currents to disperse and settle in new areas. The larval stage of the coral, called a planula, will drift along until it finds a surface on which it can grow. Once it settles, it metamorphoses into its polyp form and creates skeletal material to attach itself to the seafloor. It will then begin to bud, which will create new polyps and eventually form a colony. In areas with ideal conditions, black coral colonies can grow to be extremely dense, creating beds. In some black corals that have been closely examined, colonies will grow roughly every year. Sexual reproduction occurs after 10 to 12 years of growth; the colony will then reproduce annually for the rest of its life. The male to female polyp ratio is 1:1, with females producing anywhere from 1.2 million to 16.9 million oocytes. A large tall coral tree is somewhere between 30 and 40 years old. The estimated natural lifespan of a black coral colony in the epipelagic zone is 70 years. However, in March 2009 around 4,265 years old specimens of Leiopathes glaberrima were found at depths of nearly , making them some of the oldest living organisms on earth. The researchers showed that the \\"individual colony longevities are on the order of thousands of years.\\" Rarely, black corals will grow too large to support their own weight, and collapse. Human use and harvesting Black coral bracelet Black corals have historically been associated with mystical and medicinal properties in Indonesian, Chinese, and Hawaiian culture. More recent harvesting has been for use as jewelry. Many Indo-Pacific peoples believed that black coral has curative and anti-evil powers and made them into necklace and bracelets; however, black corals are not ideal for jewelry-making due to it being soft as opposed to stony, causing jewelry made with it to dry out and break. If a real black coral is boiled in milk, it will smell of myrrh; this test can be used to determine if a sample is genuine. The best studied and regulated black coral fisheries are in Hawaii, where they have been harvested since the 1960s. In the Caribbean harvesting is typically done to produce jewelry for sale to tourists, and has followed a boom-and-bust cycle, where new coral populations are discovered and overexploited leading to rapid declines. For example, Cozumel, Mexico, was famed for dense black coral beds that have been harvested since the 1960s leading to widespread black coral population declines.Padilla, C., & Lara, M. (2003). Banco Chinchorro: the last shelter for black coral in the Mexican Caribbean. Bulletin of Marine Science, 73(1), 197–202. Despite improvements in management in Cozumel, including no harvesting permits issued since the mid-1990s, the black coral population had failed to recover when assessed in 2016. Though it is illegal to harvest black corals without authorization, as they are listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), it is still possible to buy them. Though various methods have been tried to rejuvenate black coral colonies quicker and more efficiently, none have worked to the point where it would work for full restoration. Threats A Bathypathes species growing in a brush shape Though black corals are not listed on the IUCN Red List, a number of factors threaten them today. The largest single threat is poaching— though the majority of black coral fisheries are heavily regulated, there is still a black market for the corals. Particularly on tropical islands and Madagascar, the market for illegally-harvested black corals is large. Due to overfishing of mature corals, in some areas nearly 90% of corals are juveniles (less than tall.) Global warming is the primary threat to black corals worldwide, as well as all other corals. Though black corals rarely builds reefs (the most threatened areas), threats caused by climate change such as coral bleaching, rising sea temperatures, changing underwater currents, and changing salinity and pH also affect deep-sea corals. Invasive species such as Carijoa riisei, which were introduced to Hawaiian waters by humans, may pose a significant threat to black corals. References External links  .

The proximal end of the catheter is attached to computerized ultrasound equipment. It allows the application of ultrasound technology, such as piezoelectric transducer or CMUT, to see from inside blood vessels out through the surrounding blood column, visualizing the endothelium (inner wall) of blood vessels in living individuals. The arteries of the heart (the coronary arteries) are the most frequent imaging target for IVUS. IVUS is used in the coronary arteries to determine the amount of atheromatous plaque built up at any particular point in the epicardial coronary artery. Intravascular ultrasound provides a unique method to study the regression or progression of atherosclerotic lesions in vivo. The progressive accumulation of plaque within the artery wall over decades is the setup for vulnerable plaque which, in turn, leads to heart attack and stenosis (narrowing) of the artery (known as coronary artery lesions). IVUS is of use to determine both plaque volume within the wall of the artery and/or the degree of stenosis of the artery lumen. It can be especially useful in situations in which angiographic imaging is considered unreliable; such as for the lumen of ostial lesions or where angiographic images do not visualize lumen segments adequately, such as regions with multiple overlapping arterial segments. It is also used to assess the effects of treatments of stenosis such as with hydraulic angioplasty expansion of the artery, with or without stents, and the results of medical therapy over time. Advantages over angiography Arguably the most valuable use of IVUS is to visualize plaque, which cannot be seen by angiography. Over time this technique has evolved into an extremely useful research tool for modern invasive cardiology, and it has been increasingly used in research to better understand the behavior of the atherosclerosis process in living people. IVUS enables accurately visualizing not only the lumen of the coronary arteries but also the atheroma (membrane/cholesterol loaded white blood cells) \\"hidden\\" within the wall. IVUS has thus enabled advances in clinical research providing a more thorough perspective and better understanding. In the early 1990s, IVUS research on the re-stenosis problem after angioplasty lead to recognition that most of the re-stenosis problem (as visualized by an angiography examination) was not true re-stenosis. Instead it was simply a remodeling of the atheromatous plaque, which was still protruding into the lumen of the artery after completion of angioplasty; the stenosis only appearing to be reduced because blood and contrast could now flow around and through some of the plaque. The angiographic dye column appeared widened adequately; yet considerable plaque was within the newly widened lumen and the lumen remained partially obstructed. This recognition promoted more frequent use of stents to hold the plaque outward against the inner artery walls, out of the lumen. Additionally, IVUS examinations, as they were done more frequently, served to reveal and confirm the autopsy research findings of the late 1980s, showing that atheromatous plaque tends to cause expansion of the internal elastic lamina, causing the degree of plaque burden to be greatly underestimated by angiography. Angiography only reveals the edge of the atheroma that protrudes into the lumen. Intravascular ultrasound image of a coronary artery (left), with color-coding on the right, delineating the lumen (yellow), external elastic membrane (blue) and the atherosclerotic plaque burden (green). The percentage stenosis is defined as the area of the lumen (yellow) divided by the area of the external elastic membrane (blue) times 100. As the plaque burden increases, the lumen size will decrease and the degree of stenosis will increase.Perhaps the greatest contribution to understanding, so far, was achieved by clinical research trials completed in the United States in the late 1990s, using combined angiography and IVUS examination, to study which coronary lesions most commonly result in a myocardial infarction. The studies revealed that most myocardial infarctions occur at areas with extensive atheroma within the artery wall, however very little stenosis of the artery opening. The range of lumen stenosis locations at which myocardial infarctions occurred ranged from areas of mild dilation all the way to areas of greater than 95% stenosis. However the average or typical stenosis at which myocardial infarctions occurred were found to be less than 50%, describing plaques long considered insignificant by many. Only 14% of heart attacks occurred at locations with 75% or more stenosis, the severe stenoses previously thought by many to present the greatest danger to the individual. This research has changed the primary focus for heart attack prevention from severe narrowing to vulnerable plaque. Current clinical uses of IVUS technology include checking how to treat complex lesions before angioplasty and checking how well an intracoronary stent has been deployed within a coronary artery after angioplasty. If a stent is not expanded flush against the wall of the vessel, turbulent flow may occur between the stent and the wall of the vessel; some fear this might create a nidus for acute thrombosis of the artery. Disadvantages versus angiography The primary disadvantages of IVUS being used routinely in a cardiac catheterization laboratory are its expense, the increase in the time of the procedure, and the fact that it is considered an interventional procedure, and should only be performed by angiographers that are trained in interventional cardiology techniques. In addition, there may be additional risk imposed by the use of the IVUS catheter. The computerized IVUS echocardiographic imaging systems list for $120,000, US, 2007 for a cart based system and ~$70,000 for an installed or integrated solution. The disposable catheters used to do each examination typically cost ~$600, US, 2007. In many hospitals, the IVUS system is placed as part of a bundle deal based on minimum disposable sales volumes. In other words, the cost of the console is paid for by rebates from other purchased products including IVUS catheters. Because no standard exists, IVUS catheters cannot be interchanged between different manufacturers. Additionally, IVUS adds significant additional examination time and some increased risk to the patient beyond performing a standard diagnostic angiographic examination. This increase is significantly less when IVUS is part of a percutaneous coronary intervention, since much of the setup is the same for the intervention as for the IVUS imaging. IVUS continues to improve and some manufacturers have proposed building IVUS technology into angioplasty and stent balloon catheters, a potential major advance, but limited by complexity, cost and increased bulk of the catheters. Comparison versus intravascular optical coherence tomography Compared to IVUS, intravascular OCT offers an order of magnitude improved resolution for a better visualization of vessel lumen, tissue microstructure and devices (e.g., intracoronary stents). IVUS offers an improved imaging depth for the assessment of lipid or necrotic plaques, while intravascular OCT offers better penetration and enhanced imaging of calcific tissue. Intravascular OCT requires a short injection of contrast (e.g., 2 to 3 seconds) in a similar way to obtain an angiographic image. IVUS does not require a contrast injection as ultrasounds can penetrate through blood. Method To visualize an artery or vein, angiographic techniques are used and the physician positions the tip of a guidewire, usually 0.36 mm (0.014\\") diameter with a very soft and pliable tip and about 200 cm long. The physician steers the guidewire from outside the body, through angiography catheters and into the blood vessel branch to be imaged. The ultrasound catheter tip is slid in over the guidewire and positioned, using angiography techniques so that the tip is at the farthest away position to be imaged. The sound waves are emitted from the catheter tip, are usually in the 20-40 MHz range, and the catheter also receives and conducts the return echo information out to the external computerized ultrasound equipment which constructs and displays a real time ultrasound image of a thin section of the blood vessel currently surrounding the catheter tip, usually displayed at 30 frames/second image. The guide wire is kept stationary and the ultrasound catheter tip is slid backwards, usually under motorized control at a pullback speed of 0.5 mm/s. (The motorized pullback tends to be smoother than hand movement by the physician.) The (a) blood vessel wall inner lining, (b) atheromatous disease within the wall and (c) connective tissues covering the outer surface of the blood vessel are echogenic, i.e. they return echoes making them visible on the ultrasound display. By contrast, the blood itself and the healthy muscular tissue portion of the blood vessel wall is relatively echolucent, just black circular spaces, in the images. Heavy calcium deposits in the blood vessel wall both heavily reflect sound, i.e. are very echogenic, but are also distinguishable by shadowing. Heavy calcification blocks sound transmission beyond and so, in the echo images, are seen as both very bright areas but with black shadows behind (from the vantage point of the catheter tip emitting the ultrasound waves). Uses IVUS, as outlined above, has been the best technology, so far, to demonstrate the anatomy of the artery wall in living animals and humans. It has led to an explosion of better understanding and research on both (a) the behavior of the atherosclerosis process and (b) the effects of different treatment strategies for changing the evolution of the atherosclerosis disease process. This has been important given that atherosclerosis is the single most frequent disease process for the greatest percentage of individuals living in first world countries. =Intravascular ultrasound in the coronary anatomy= left main coronary artery (left). The blue outline delineates the cross- sectional area of the lumen of the artery (A1 in the upper right corner), measuring 6.0 mm2. A two-dimensional mapping of the proximal LAD and left main coronary arteries is shown on the right. While the routine use of IVUS during percutaneous coronary intervention does not improve short term outcomes, there are a number of situations in which IVUS is of particular use in the treatment of coronary artery disease of the heart. In particular in cases when the degree of stenosis of a coronary artery is unclear, IVUS can directly quantify the percentage of stenosis and give insight into the anatomy of the plaque. One particular use of IVUS in the coronary anatomy is in the quantification of left main disease in cases where routine coronary angiography gives equivocal results. Many studies in the past have shown that significant left main disease can increase mortality, and that intervention (either coronary artery bypass graft surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention) to reduce mortality is necessary when the left main stenosis is significant. When using IVUS to determine whether an individual's left main disease is clinically significant, in terms of the desirability of physical intervention, the two most widely used parameters are the degree of stenosis and the minimal lumen area. A cross sectional area of ≤7 mm² in a symptomatic individual or ≤6 mm² in an asymptomatic individual is considered to be clinically significant and warrants intervention to improve one-year mortality. However, these exact cutoffs are up for debate and different cutoff cross-sectional areas may be used in practice depending on differing interpretations of the trial data. =Validating the efficacy of new treatments= Because IVUS is widely available in coronary catheterization labs worldwide and can accurately quantify arterial plaque, especially within the coronary arteries, it is increasingly being used to evaluate newer and evolving strategies for the treatment of coronary artery disease, including the statins and other approaches.

CRASH was established in South Central in 1979, to combat the rising problem of gangs in Los Angeles, California. Each of the LAPD's 18 divisions had a CRASH unit assigned to it, whose primary goal was to suppress the influx of gang-related crimes in Los Angeles, which came about primarily from the increase in illegal drug trade. CRASH was subject of the Rampart scandal from 1997 which exposed widespread police corruption within the unit, including involvement in murders, robberies, police brutality, evidence planting, and participating in gang activity. CRASH was disbanded in 2000, and was replaced by the LAPD Gang and Narcotics Division. History =Establishment= By 1973, street gangs were quickly becoming a problem in the 77th Street Division of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), located in the South Central area of Los Angeles, California. Deputy Chief Lou Sporrer, commanding officer of South Bureau, responsible for 77th Street Division operations and ultimately responsible to Chief of Police Edward M. Davis, created a unit of uniformed officers and a plainclothes intelligence section. The two were combined to be identified as 77th Street Division TRASH, an acronym for \\"Total Resources Against Street Hoodlums\\" with the idea that LAPD did not want to glamorize gangs. Community activists began efforts to abolish the TRASH unit, stating the name itself hurt the image of these youths joining gangs. Sporrer agreed to a name change, with the \\"T\\" for Total becoming a \\"C\\" for Community and TRASH became CRASH. In addition to gang- related crime prevention, CRASH officers also had to obtain information about a specific gang that was assigned to them and relay that information between districts. The \\"freedom of movement and activity\\" and \\"gung-ho\\" nature of CRASH officers led some of them to incite controversy among themselves and the whole CRASH unit. In the 1980s, gang violence began to increase dramatically as a result of the drug trade, specifically the introduction of crack cocaine. =Operation Hammer= Operation Hammer was a CRASH-led initiative that began in 1987 to crack down on gang violence in South Central Los Angeles. As a result of increasing gang violence and a drive-by killing resulting in the deaths of seven people, then-Chief of Police Daryl Gates responded by sending CRASH officers to arrest suspected gang members. At the height of this operation in April 1988, 1,453 people were arrested by one thousand police officers in a single weekend. While considered successful by some, this operation and the LAPD were maligned with accusations of racism; some believed that Operation Hammer heavily employed racial profiling, targeting African- American and Hispanic youths that were labelled as \\"urban terrorists\\" and \\"ruthless killers.\\" However, proponents of the operation counter that it was not discriminatory as each gang member arrested had warrants for their arrests. =Rampart Division CRASH scandal= Every LAPD patrol division had a CRASH unit stationed in it. One of the most prominent CRASH units was stationed in the Rampart Division. On February 26, 1998, Rampart CRASH officer Brian Hewitt was suspended and later stripped of his job when allegations arose of a cover-up of the beating and asphyxiation of Ismail Jiminez. Hewitt was accused of choking Jiminez in an interview room when the suspect refused to provide evidence of gang activities. When Jiminez reported his beating at a hospital, the evidence implicated Hewitt and led to his termination at a Board of Rights hearing. In August 1998, the same month that Chief Bernard Parks claimed that the Christopher Commission reforms were \\"essentially complete\\", officer Rafael Pérez, a nine-year LAPD veteran, was arrested on charges of stealing six pounds (2.7 kilograms) of cocaine from the department's Property Division. Pérez was initially tried on one count of possession of cocaine for sale, grand theft and forgery each. After a mistrial on December 7 of that year, more reports of cocaine theft by Pérez arose. In September 1999, in exchange for partial immunity from prosecution, he testified about a pattern of abuse and misconduct involving seventy CRASH officers, threatening to overturn thousands of criminal convictions. As part of his plea bargain, Pérez implicated scores of officers from the Rampart Division's anti-gang unit, describing routinely beating gang members, planting evidence on suspects, falsifying reports and covering up unprovoked shootings. As of May 2001, the Rampart investigation had brought fifty-eight officers before an internal administrative board. Of these, twelve were suspended, seven resigned, and five were terminated. Perez confessed to framing Javier Ovando, an 18th Street Gang member, who was shot by Nino Durden and Perez on October 12, 1996. =Disbandment= In March 2000, CRASH was disbanded after being gradually diminished following the Rampart scandal, and replaced with a similar anti- gang unit known as the LAPD Gangs and Narcotics Division. This new unit's minimum requirements for enlistment are higher than was CRASH's, requiring recruits to have a sufficiently high amount of experience and a low number of personnel complaints. Major categories of crime offenses and attempted crimes in 2000 in Los Angeles increased over those of the previous year, when CRASH was at full staff. Kevin Starr, the State Librarian of California, wrote in his history of California in the 1990s that \\"CRASH ... became, in effect, the most badass gang in the city.\\"Kevin Starr, Coast of Dreams: California On The Edge, 1990-2003 (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2004), 92. In popular culture A fictionalized version of C.R.A.S.H. appears as the main antagonistic faction in the 2004 open world action-adventure video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. The unit is led Officers Frank Tenpenny and Eddie Pulaski, who have criminal ties in Los Santos (the in-game version of Los Angeles) and often engage in deals with gangs for personal profit. The unit's unofficial motto (\\"We intimidate those who intimidate others\\") is explicitly used by Tenpenny with protagonist Carl Johnson, whom he blackmails into helping prevent his illicit activities from going public. Near the end of the game, Tenpenny's crimes are exposed, leading to a trial, in which he is found not guilty due to the lack of evidence; this results in violent riots across the city, inspired the real-life 1992 Los Angeles riots. The riots eventually end after Tenpenny's death in a car crash caused by Carl. The 1988 film Colors stars Robert Duval and Sean Penn as two members of C.R.A.S.H. Although corruption in L.A.'s C.R.A.S.H. unit had yet to be exposed when Training Day was written, Antoine Fuqua has stated that the emergence of the Rampart Scandal in the late 1990s catalyzed the completion of the film. Denzel Washington also grew a beard in order to emulate the appearance of Rafael Pérez, an LAPD narcotics officer involved in multiple scandals.Murray Pomerance (February 1, 2012).

It is related to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium which causes tuberculosis in humans. M. bovis can jump the species barrier and cause tuberculosis-like infection in humans and other mammals.  Bacterium morphology and staining  The bacteria are curved or straight rods. They sometimes form filaments, which fragment into bacilli or cocci once disturbed. In tissues they form slender rods, straight or curved, or club- shaped. Short, relatively plump bacilli (rods) in tissue smears, large slender beaded rods in culture. They have no flagella or fimbria, no capsule. Mycobacterium tuberculosis group bacteria are 1.0 - 4.0 µm long by 0.2 - 0.3 µm wide in tissues. In culture they may appear as cocci, or as bacilli up to 6 - 8 µm long . The bacteria stain Gram-positive, acid-fast. The cell wall contains as high as 60% lipid, giving the mycobacteria their hydrophobic characteristics, slow growth and resistance to desiccation, disinfectants, acids and antibodies. (Mycobacterium Family). They are not easy to stain with analine dyes; although they are Gram positive it may not be easy to confirm this. Ziehl-Neelsen staining results in stain pink with hot carbol fuscin and then resist decolourisation with 3 percent hydrochloric acid in 95% alcohol (i.e. they are acid-alcohol fast); following washing, the slide is counterstained with e.g. methylene blue. They are non-spore-forming.  Culture and biochemical features  =Growth requirements= Mycobacterium bovis is a facultative intracellular parasite. For in vitro growth, special culture media are required, for example Dorset's egg medium incorporates egg yolk, phosphate buffer, magnesium salts and sodium pyruvate; amino acids may be added but glycerol is not included as it is inhibitory. It is inhibited by glycerine. Culture generally requires several weeks at 37 °C to reach colonies visible to the unaided human eye. Strictly aerobic. Grows at 37 °C, does not grow at 25 °C. Optimum growth at 37-38 °C. Does not reduce nitrate, does not reduce niacin. Resistant to pyrazineamide. Sensitive to thiophene-2-carboxylic acid hydrazide. =Appearance of colonies= Initially (after 3–4 weeks), minute dull flakes, thickening to form dry irregular masses standing high above the culture medium surface. Eventually confluent growth over the whole culture surface, forming a rough waxy blanket, becoming thick and wrinkled and reaching up the sides of the container. Yellow when they are first visible, darkening to deep yellow and eventually brick red, if exposed to light. In fluid media, growth on the surface only, unless a wetting agent (e.g. Tween 80) is added to the medium.  Cell structure and metabolism  M. bovis is similar in structure and metabolism to M. tuberculosis. M. bovis is a Gram- positive, acid-fast, rod-shaped, aerobic bacteria. Unlike M. tuberculosis, M. bovis lacks pyruvate kinase activity, due to pykA containing a point mutation that affects binding of Mg2+ cofactor. Pyruvate kinase catalyses the final step of glycolysis, the dephosphorylation of phosphorenolpyruvate to pyruvate. Therefore, in M. bovis, glycolytic intermediates are unable to enter into oxidative metabolism. Although no specific studies have been performed, it seems that M. bovis must rely on amino acids or fatty acids as an alternative carbon source for energy metabolism. Pathogenesis Lesions consistent with bovine tuberculosis on the lower jaw and lung of a wild boar During the first half of the 20th century, M. bovis is estimated to have been responsible for more losses among farm animals than all other infectious diseases combined. Infection occurs if the bacterium is ingested or inhaled. M. bovis is usually transmitted to humans by consuming raw, infected cows' milk, although it can also spread via aerosol droplets. Actual infections in humans are nowadays rare in developed countries, mainly because pasteurisation kills M. bovis bacteria in infected milk. In the UK, cattle are tested for the disease as part of an eradication program and culled if they test positive. Such cattle can still enter the human food chain, but only after a meat inspector or a government veterinary surgeon has inspected the carcass and certified that it is fit for human consumption. However, in areas of the developing world where pasteurisation is not routine, M. bovis is a relatively common cause of human tuberculosis. Bovine tuberculosis is a chronic infectious disease which affects a broad range of mammalian hosts, including humans, cattle, deer, llamas, pigs, domestic cats, wild carnivores (foxes, coyotes) and omnivores (common brushtail possum, mustelids and rodents); it rarely affects equids or sheep. The disease can be transmitted in several ways; for example, it can be spread in exhaled air, sputum, urine, faeces, and pus, so the disease can be transmitted by direct contact, contact with the excreta of an infected animal, or inhalation of aerosols, depending on the species involved.  Application to biotechnology  M. bovis is the ancestor of the most widely used vaccine against tuberculosis, M. bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin. The BCG strain was isolated after sub-culturing on glycerine potato medium 239 times during 13 years starting from an initial virulent strain . Epidemiology and control =New Zealand= In New Zealand, the introduced common brushtail possum is a vector for the spread of M. bovis. The Biosecurity Act 1993, which established a national pest-management strategy, is the legislation behind control of the disease in New Zealand. The Animal Health Board operates a nationwide programme of cattle testing and possum control, with the goal of eradicating M. bovis from wild vector species across 2.5 million hectares – or one-quarter – of New Zealand's at-risk areas, by 2026 and, eventually, eradicating the disease entirely. The TB-free New Zealand programme is regarded as \\"world- leading\\". It has successfully reduced cattle and deer herd infection rates from more than 1700 in 1994 to fewer than 100 herds in July 2011. Much of this success can be attributed to sustained cattle controls reducing cross- infection and breaking the disease cycle. For example, at Hohotaka, in New Zealand's central North Island, control work from 1988 to 1994 achieved a sustained mean reduction of 87.5% in the density of TB‐infected possums. As expected, annual TB incidence in local cattle herds consequently declined by a similar amount (83.4%). Possums are controlled through a combination of trapping, ground-baiting, and where other methods are impractical, aerial treatment with 1080 poison. From 1979 to 1984, possum control was stopped due to lack of funding. From that point until 1994, TB rates in herds steadily increased. The area of New Zealand harbouring TB-infected wild animals expanded from about 10% of the country to 40%. That possums are such effective transmitters of TB appears to be facilitated by their behaviour once they get the disease. =United Kingdom= In the 1930s, 40% of cattle in the UK were infected with M. bovis and 50,000 new cases of human M. bovis infection were reported every year. According to DEFRA and the Health Protection Agency, the risk to people contracting TB from cattle in Great Britain would be low. Badgers (Meles meles) were first identified as carriers of M. bovis in 1971, but the report of an independent review committee in 1997 (the Krebs Report) concluded: 'strong circumstantial evidence [exists] to suggest that badgers represent a significant source of M. bovis infection in cattle... [h]owever, the causal link... has not been proven'. In essence, the contribution of badgers 'to the TB problem in British cattle' was at this point a hypothesis that needed to be tested, according to the report. The subsequent Randomised Badger Culling Trial (designed, overseen and analysed by the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB, or ISG ) examined this hypothesis by conducting a large field trial of widescale (proactive) culling and localised reactive culling (in comparison with areas which received no badger culling). In their final report, the ISG concluded: \\"First, while badgers are clearly a source of cattle TB, careful evaluation of our own and others’ data indicates that badger culling can make no meaningful contribution to cattle TB control in Britain. Indeed, some policies under consideration are likely to make matters worse rather than better. Second, weaknesses in cattle-testing regimens mean that cattle themselves contribute significantly to the persistence and spread of disease in all areas where TB occurs, and in some parts of Britain are likely to be the main source of infection. Scientific findings indicate that the rising incidence of disease can be reversed, and geographical spread contained, by the rigid application of cattle-based control measures alone.\\" On 26 July 2007, the Minister of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Lord Rooker) said, \\"My Lords, we welcome the Independent Scientific Group’s final report, which further improves the evidence base. We are carefully considering the issues that the report raises, and will continue to work with industry, government advisers, and scientific experts in reaching policy decisions on these issues.\\" In the UK, many other mammals have been found to be infected with M. bovis, although the frequency of isolation is generally much less than cattle and badgers. In some areas of south-west England, deer, especially fallow deer due to their gregarious behaviour, have been implicated as possible maintenance hosts for transmission of bovine TB In some localised areas, the risk of transmission to cattle from fallow deer has been argued to be greater than it is from badgers. One of the reasons that the Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs requires infected or suspected cattle to be culled is to meet EU regulations for the export of meat and dairy products to other member states. Meat and dairy products can still be sold in the UK into the human food chain, providing the relevant carcass inspections and milk pasteurisation have been applied. Spread of the disease to humans by domestic pets became evident in March 2014 when Public Health England announced two people in England developed bTB infections after contact with a domestic cat. The two human cases were linked to 9 cases of bTB infection in cats in Berkshire and Hampshire during 2013. These are the first documented cases of cat-to-human transmission. In a 2010 opinion piece in Trends in Microbiology, Paul and David Torgerson argued that bovine tuberculosis is a negligible public-health problem in the UK, providing milk is pasteurized. Bovine TB is very rarely spread by aerosol from cattle to humans. Therefore, the bovine tuberculosis control programme in the UK in its present form is a misallocation of resources and provides no benefit to society. Indeed, very little evidence exists of a positive cost benefit to the livestock industry, as few studies have been undertaken on the direct costs of bovine TB to animal production. Milk pasteurisation was the single public health intervention that prevented the transmission of bovine TB to humans, and no justification for the present test and cull policy in the UK is seen. In July 2010, the second issue of the discussion document Bovine TB, Time for a Rethink 'Bovine TB, Time for a Rethink www.rethinkbtb.org/a_better-way.html' was published by Rethink Bovine TB, an independent research group. The paper considers current policy in England and Wales. It proposes an alternative solution that is both practical and cost effective. In the paper, evidence is drawn from DEFRA and the work by Professors Paul and David Torgerson. In March 2012, think tank the Bow Group published a target paper urging the government to reconsider its plans to cull thousands of badgers to control bovine TB, stating that the findings of Labour's major badger-culling trials several years prior were that culling does not work. The paper was authored by Graham Godwin-Pearson with a foreword by singer Brian May and contributions by leading tuberculosis scientists, including Lord Krebs. In 2017 Rachel Tanner and Helen McShane, of the Jenner Institute, Oxford, published research on replacing, reducing and refining the use of animals in tuberculosis vaccine research. =United States= As of the end of 2013, the USDA has accredited cattle herds in all US states except for Michigan and California as being free from bovine TB. According to Barbara Gutmann Rosenkrantz, the late 19th- century discovery of the relationship between bovine and human tuberculosis led to state and federal attempts to stamp out bovine tuberculosis. The campaigns for clean milk and meat frightened city people into supporting controls, although at the time there was little evidence that tuberculosis was spread to humans through infected meat or milk. The campaigns against impure meat and milk led to tension between the developing veterinarian profession and the medical profession, each claiming that area as part of their own expertise.Barbara Gutmann Rosenkrantz, \\"The trouble with bovine tuberculosis.\\" Bulletin of the History of Medicine 59.2 (1985): 155-175 online. By 1917, 5 percent of American cattle were infected with Mycobacterium bovis (bovine tuberculosis or BTB), including 10 percent of dairy animals and 1–2 percent of range cattle. The rates were going up. Around 1900 15,000 Americans, mostly children, died each year from BTB and many more suffered pain and disfigurement.Alan L. Olmstead and Paul W. Rhode, \\"Not on my farm! Resistance to bovine tuberculosis eradication in the United States.\\" Journal of Economic History 67.3 (2007): 768-809. online Alan L. Olmstead and Paul W. Rhode. \\"An impossible undertaking: the eradication of bovine tuberculosis in the United States.\\" Journal of Economic History 64.3 (2004): 734-772 Threatened by a sales cutoff ordered by urban public health officials, Vermont state government officials launched an innovative eradication campaign against bovine tuberculosis on farms, 1877 to 1936. They made use of the latest German research, and thereby kept the New York City and Boston markets.Basil P. Tangredi, \\"Routing Mr. Bovine Bacillus: Eradication of Bovine Tuberculosis on Vermont Farms\\" Vermont History (2017) 85#2 pp 113-127. Vermont was exceptional, for across the country many farmers strenuously resisted bovine tuberculosis eradication as an expensive violation of their libertarian right to farm.Olmstead and Rhode. \\"An impossible undertaking: the eradication of bovine tuberculosis in the United States.\\" In recent decades M. bovis infections in cattle herds in the United States is not common. M. bovis is endemic in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in the northeastern portion of Michigan and northern Minnesota, and sporadically imported from Mexico. Only the white-tailed deer has been confirmed as a maintenance host in the Michigan outbreak of bovine tuberculosis, although other mammals such as raccoons (Procyon lotor), opossums (Didelphis virginiana), and coyotes (Canis latrans) can serve as spill-over and dead-end hosts. The fact that white- tailed deer are a maintenance host for M. bovis remains a significant barrier to the US nationwide eradication of the disease in livestock. In 2008, 733,998 licensed deer hunters harvested around 489,922 white-tailed deer in attempts to control the disease spread. These hunters purchased more than 1.5 million deer-harvest tags. The economic value of deer hunting to Michigan's economy in the drive to eradicate TB is substantial. For example, in 2006, hunters spent US$507 million hunting white-tailed deer in Michigan. =Global= The disease is found in cattle throughout the globe, but some countries have been able to reduce or limit the incidence of the disease through a process of 'test and cull' of the cattle stock. Most of Europe and several Caribbean countries (including Cuba) are virtually free of M. bovis. Australia is officially free of the disease since the successful BTEC program, but residual infections might exist in feral water buffalo in isolated parts of the Northern Territory. In Canada, affected wild elk and white-tailed deer are found in and around Riding Mountain National Park in Manitoba. To improve control and eliminate bovine TB, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency has split Manitoba into two management areas: The Riding Mountain TB eradication area, where the disease has been found, and the Manitoba TB Eradication Area, the rest of the province outside RMEA where the disease has not been found.\\" Bovine Tuberculosis (TB) Management - In the Riding Mountain Area, Manitoba Conservation The disease has also been found in African buffalo in South Africa. M. bovis can be transmitted from human to human; an outbreak occurred in Birmingham, England, in 2004, and from human to cattle, but such occurrences are rare. In Mexico, the disease is prevalent and rising among humans.  Zoonotic tuberculosis  The infection of humans with M. bovis is referred to as zoonotic tuberculosis. In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO), World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and The International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (The Union), published the first Roadmap for Zoonotic Tuberculosis, recognizing zoonotic tuberculosis as a prominent global health problem. The main route of transmission is through the consumption of unpasteurized milk or other dairy products, although transmission via inhalation and via consumption of poorly cooked meat has also been reported. In 2018, based on the most recent Global Tuberculosis Report, an estimated 142,000 new cases of zoonotic tuberculosis, and 12,500 deaths due to the disease occurred. Cases of zoonotic tuberculosis have been reported in Africa, the Americas, Europe, the Eastern Mediterranean, and the Western Pacific. Human zoonotic tuberculosis cases are linked to the presence of bovine tuberculosis in cattle, and regions without adequate disease control measures and/or disease surveillance are at higher risk. It is difficult to clinically distinguish zoonotic tuberculosis from tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis in people, and the current most commonly used diagnostics cannot effectively distinguish between M. bovis and M. tuberculosis, which contributes to an underestimation of total cases worldwide. Controlling this disease requires animal health, food safety, and human health sectors to work together under a One Health approach (multi- disciplinary collaborations to improve the health of animals, people, and the environment). The 2017 Roadmap identified ten priority areas for addressing zoonotic tuberculosis, which include collecting more accurate data, improving diagnostics, closing research gaps, improving food safety, reducing M. bovis in animal populations, identifying risk factors for transmission, increasing awareness, developing policies, implementing interventions, and increasing investments. To align with goals outlined in the Stop TB Partnership Global Plan to End TB 2016-2020, The Roadmap outlines specific milestones and goals to be met within this time frame. Treatment :See: Tuberculosis treatment M. bovis is innately resistant to pyrazinamide; therefore, the standard treatment is isoniazid and rifampicin for 9 months. However, most cattle with TB are culled.

It extends from Mesa de Maya, Colorado southeasterly along the north bank of the Cimarron River, crossing the northeast corner of New Mexico to end at the confluence of the Cimarron River and Carrizo Creek near Kenton in the Oklahoma panhandle. Its highest elevation is in Colorado. The highest point of Black Mesa within New Mexico is . In northwestern Cimarron County, Oklahoma, Black Mesa reaches , the highest point in the state of Oklahoma. The plateau that formed at the top of the mesa has been known as a \\"geological wonder\\" of North America. There is abundant wildlife in this shortgrass prairie environment, including mountain lions, butterflies, and the Texas horned lizard. History The plateau has been home to Plains Indians. In the late- nineteenth and early twentieth century the area was a hideout for outlaws such as William Coe and Black Jack Ketchum. The outlaws built a fort known as the Robbers' Roost. The stone fort housed a blacksmith shop, gun ports, and a piano. The present-day Oklahoma Panhandle area, which was then considered a no man's land, lacked law enforcement agencies and hence the outlaws found it safe to hide in the region. However, as new settlers arrived in the area for copper and coal mining and also for cattle ranching activities by grazing cattle in the mesa region, law enforcement became more effective, and the outlaws were brought under control. In more recent times, at least one person has claimed to have been abducted by extraterrestrial aliens at Black Mesa. Geography The Mesa is situated in the Cimarron County in the Oklahoma Panhandle. The Black Mesa plateau there is part of the Rocky Mountains and the shortgrass prairie. Some features include the Old Maid Rock, and Devil's Tombstone. The mesa's base includes a escarpment which is parallel with the Dry Cimarron River's north bank. Its highest elevation is in Colorado. The highest point of Black Mesa within New Mexico is . In northwestern Cimarron County, Oklahoma, Black Mesa reaches , the highest point in the state of Oklahoma. A hiking trail of leads from the preserve to the summit which rises about above the level of the surrounding plains, and a round trip requires four hours minimum; overnight camping is not permitted. The mesa's highest point within Oklahoma is marked by a granite obelisk, and a visitors' log. Climate Black Mesa is not only the highest point in Oklahoma but it is also the driest, harshest and coldest place in the state. A nearby weather station is located in Kenton. Geology The visual and map view appearance of Black Mesa is as an \\"inverted valley\\" because erosion has removed the relatively soft sedimentary strata from either side of the resistant Raton basalt of the lava which originally had occupied and filled a river valley. The mesa is capped by erosion-resistant basaltic lava formed by a volcanic eruption 3 to 5 million years ago. The lava erupted from a vent in the Raton- Clayton volcanic field in northeastern New Mexico and southeastern Colorado. The volcanic cap to the mesa is thick, long and from 0.5 miles to 8 miles wide, which is to the north-northwest of Oklahoma. The erupting lava filled a stream channel in the Pliocene age Ogallala Formation. During the years since the eruption, the adjacent rock of the Ogallala and older formations have been removed leaving the valley-filling basalt perched atop a long ridge. Strata exposed along the mesa below the basalt and Ogallala include the Cretaceous Dakota Sandstone and the Jurassic Morrison Formation. Beginning in 1935, geologists and paleontologists have searched the mesa's outcroppings, finding dinosaur fossils in the Jurassic and Triassic strata. A large quantity of dinosaur bones has been recovered from the Black Mesa locale; totaling over eighteen tonnes. These remains were split between several species, including stegosaurus, camptosaurus, diplodocus, and edmontosaurus. Clear fossil physical evidence, a distinct line of footprints believed to have been made by an allosaurus, has been found juxtaposed with the Carrizo Creek, which runs around the modern-day northern edge of the mesa. Protected area View from the summit The mesa lies in the protected area known as the Black Mesa Nature Preserve which was established in 1991, covering . The preserve protects 60% of the area of the mesa peak. The peak is accessible along an trail. Apart from the nature reserve, there is also the Black Mesa State Park encompassing , with a lake known as the Lake Carl G. Etling. The park is a recreational area with many facilities for camping, hiking and many other outdoor activities. The park is about 15 miles away from the peak. Wildlife The flora and fauna and terrain of Black Mesa are unique in Oklahoma, more typical of the semi-arid grasslands and rocky buttes of eastern Colorado and New Mexico. Many species reach their easternmost or westernmost limits of their ranges here.\\"Black Mesa Nature Preserve,\\" The Nature Conservancy, , accessed 25 May 2019 Black Mesa Nature Preserve in particular covers around 60% of the flat portion of the mesa in Oklahoma. Wildlife reported in the park and the reserve are golden eagles, piñon jays, red-tailed hawks, and mule deer, part from a bird area for bird watchers. =Flora= The vegetation of the preserve is mostly shortgrass prairie with scattered juniper trees and Cholla cactus. The summit plateau is vegetatively classified as a \\"Bluestem-grama shortgrass community\\". The preserve contains 23 plant species listed by the state as \\"rare\\" =Fauna= The prairie rattlesnake is well adapted to Black Mesa's dry environment. The indigenous top predator is the mountain lion; its cousin, the smaller bobcat, is also present. The more omnivorous American black bear is present, along with a variety of prey species including bighorn sheep, mule deer, and pronghorn. Eight native species of animal are state-level designated as \\"rare\\". Two lagomorphs are present, the eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), and the black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus). Other mammals include the dog-like coyote, as well as the much smaller prairie dog and a species of badger. Nine snake species are found in this arid environment, the plains hog-nosed snake, western coachwhip, bullsnake, longnose snake, plains blackhead snake, blackneck garter snake, plains garter snake, lined snake, and prairie rattlesnake. The broad-headed skink, prairie racerunner, red-lipped plateau lizard, northern earless lizard, eastern collared lizard, and Texas horned lizard are also indigenous to the area. Two types of turtle, the ornate box turtle and the yellow mud turtle have been found in the Black Mesa preserve. Only one frog is found in this desert habitat, the American bullfrog, but there are six other species of amphibians; the Great Plains narrowmouth toad, New Mexico spadefoot, plains spadefoot, Woodhouse's toad, red-spotted toad, and the western green toad, all toads. Birds are common, and there are 59 species present during at least some years. Seven different raptors are found, the turkey vulture, American kestrel, golden eagle, ferruginous hawk, red-tailed hawk, Mississippi kite, and the prairie falcon, all of which are classed as being of least concern according to the IUCN. There is one other bird of prey, the western screech-owl. There are no waterfowl found on Black Mesa. The mourning dove, greater roadrunner, common nighthawk, common poorwill, ladder-backed woodpecker, red-shafted flicker, olive-sided flycatcher, Say's phoebe, ash-throated flycatcher, Cassin's kingbird, and western kingbird are also found. There are five corvids; the black-billed magpie, pinyon jay, American crow, and common raven, as well as the more local Chihuahuan raven. Papilio polyxenes, the state butterfly of Oklahoma, is found on Black Mesa. 61 species of butterfly are found in the preserve, including seventeen skippers, three swallowtails, four hairstreaks, a copper, four whites, nine true brushfoots, two satyrs, and a leafwing. There are 91 species of moths on Black Mesa. No species of fish are found on Black Mesa. Culture A permanent exhibit in the Sam Noble Museum is a diorama of the Black Mesa. It covers and is housed in the Hall of Natural Wonders. Funds for its creation were provided by the Whitten-Newman Foundation. The diorama is touchscreen computerized and interactive and is set within the boundaries of the mesa. It is a replication of the real shape and form of the mesa and is modeled to a suitable scale which brings out the short-grass prairie habitat next to a rivulet. Stuffed and mounted animals on display are the ones found in the mesa, including eagle, vulture, mule deer, pronghorn antelope, mountain lion, prairie dog, jackrabbit and badger. An ephemeral lake is also on display in a cross section format.

Original long-case was also replaced by a mandapa-shaped wooden carved case done in South Indian style. The front and the side panels are done in metal repoussé work with floral meanders. Lower part of the case depicts mythological scenes and the case was manufactured at the Madras School of Arts. Clock on display in The Prince of Wales Museum in Mumbai and was donated by Dorab Tata. A grandfather clock (also a longcase clock, tall-case clock, grandfather's clock, or floor clock) is a tall, freestanding, weight-driven pendulum clock with the pendulum held inside the tower or waist of the case. Clocks of this style are commonly 1.8–2.4 metres (6–8 feet) tall. The case often features elaborately carved ornamentation on the hood (or bonnet), which surrounds and frames the dial, or clock face. The English clockmaker William Clement is credited with the development of this form in 1670. Until the early 20th century, pendulum clocks were the world's most accurate timekeeping technology, and longcase clocks, due to their superior accuracy, served as time standards for households and businesses. Today they are kept mainly for their decorative and antique value, having been widely replaced by both analog and digital timekeeping. Origin Lateral view of a longcase clock movement without striking mechanism, mid-1800s. The advent of the longcase clock is due to the invention of the anchor escapement mechanism by Robert Hooke around 1658. Prior to the adoption of the anchor mechanism, pendulum clock movements used an older verge escapement mechanism, which required very wide pendulum swings of about 80–100°. Long pendulums with such wide swings could not be fitted within a case, so most freestanding clocks had short pendulums. Timothy Mason longcase clock movement with striking mechanism, circa 1730 The anchor mechanism reduced the pendulum's swing to around 4° to 6°, allowing clockmakers to use longer pendulums, which had slower \\"beats\\". These consumed less power allowing clocks to run longer between windings, caused less friction and wear in the movement, and were more accurate. Almost all longcase clocks use a seconds pendulum (also called a \\"Royal\\" pendulum) meaning that each swing (or half-period) takes one second. These are about a metre (39 inches) long (to the centre of the bob), requiring a long narrow case. The long narrow case actually predated the anchor clock by a few decades, appearing in clocks in 1660 to allow a long drop for the powering weights. However, once the seconds pendulum began to be used, this long weight case proved perfect to house it as well. British clockmaker William Clement, who disputed credit for the anchor escapement with Robert Hooke, made the first longcase clocks by 1680. Later the same year, Thomas Tompion, the most prominent British clockmaker, was making them too. Longcase clocks spread rapidly from England to other European countries and Asia. The first longcase clocks, like all clocks prior to the anchor escapement, had only one hand; an hour hand. The increased accuracy made possible by the anchor motivated the addition of the minute hand to clock faces in the next few decades. Between 1680 and 1800, the average price of a grandfather clock in England remained steady at £1 10s. In 1680, this was the amount paid by an average working family for a year's rent, so the purchase of clocks was confined to the relatively well-off. But by 1800 wages had increased enough so that many lower middle class households owned grandfather clocks. Modern longcase clocks use a more accurate variation of the anchor escapement called the deadbeat escapement. Description Most of a longcase clock's height is used to hold the long pendulum and weights. The two chains attached to the weights and the lack of winding holes in the dial show this to be a 30-hour clock. Traditionally, longcase clocks were made with two types of movement: eight-day and one-day (30-hour) movements. A clock with an eight-day movement required winding only once a week, while generally less expensive 30-hour clocks had to be wound every day. Eight-day clocks are often driven by two weights – one driving the pendulum and the other the striking mechanism, which usually consisted of a bell or chimes. Such movements usually have two keyholes, one on each side of the dial to wind each one. By contrast, 30-hour clocks often had a single weight to drive both the timekeeping and striking mechanisms. Some 30-hour clocks were made with false keyholes, for customers who wished that guests to their home would think that the household was able to afford the more expensive eight-day clock. All modern striking longcase clocks have eight-day mechanical quarter chiming and full hour striking movements. Most longcase clocks are cable-driven, meaning that the weights are suspended by cables. If the cable were attached directly to the weight, the load would cause rotation and untwist the cable strands, so the cable wraps around a pulley mounted to the top of each weight. The mechanical advantage of this arrangement also doubles the running time allowed by a given weight drop. Cable clocks are wound by inserting a special crank (called a \\"key\\") into holes in the clock's face and turning it. Others, however, are chain-driven, meaning that the weights are suspended by chains that wrap around gears in the clock's mechanism, with the other end of the chain hanging down next to the weight. To wind a chain-driven longcase clock, one pulls on the end of each chain, lifting the weights until the weights come up to just under the clock's face. Elaborate striking sequences In the early 20th century, quarter-hour chime sequences were added to longcase clocks. At the top of each hour, the full chime sequence sounds, immediately followed by the hour strike. At 15 minutes after each hour, 1/4 of the chime sequence plays, at the bottom of each hour, 1/2 of the chime sequence plays, and at 15 minutes before each hour, 3/4 of the chime sequence plays. The chime tune used in almost all longcase clocks is Westminster Quarters. Many also offer the option of Whittington chimes or St. Michael's chimes, selectable by a switch mounted on the right side of the dial, which also allows one to silence the chimes if desired. As a result of adding chime sequences, all modern mechanical longcase clocks have three weights instead of just two. The left weight provides power for the hour strike, the middle weight provides power for the clock's pendulum and general timekeeping functions, while the right weight provides power for the quarter-hour chime sequences. Naming Longcase clock circa 1730 by Timothy Mason (clockmaker) of Gainsborough, Lincolnshire. The Oxford English Dictionary states that the popular 1876 song My Grandfather's Clock is responsible for the common name \\"grandfather clock\\" being applied to the longcase clock. Clock face circa 1730 Timothy Mason (clockmaker) of Gainsborough The song was composed by an American songwriter by the name of Henry Clay Work who discovered a long grandfather clock in The George Hotel in Piercebridge, in County Durham in England. When he asked about the clock, he was informed that it had two owners. After the first owner died the clock became inaccurate and when the second owner died, the clock stopped working altogether. The story inspired Henry to create the song. Grandfather clocks are of a certain height. There are also \\"grandmother\\" and \\"granddaughter\\" clocks, which are slightly shorter in height. Clock-face signature of Tim Mason Types Comtoise clock =Comtoise clocks= Comtoise clocks, also known as Morbier clocks or Morez clocks, are a style of longcase clock made in the French region Franche-Comté (hence their name). Features distinguishing this style are a curving \\"potbellied\\" case and a greater use of curved lines. Often a heavy, elongated, highly ornamented pendulum bob extends up the case (see photo). Production of these clocks began in 1680 and continued for a period of about 230 years. During the peak production years (1850–1890) over 60,000 clocks were made each year. These clocks were very popular across the generations; they kept the time on farms throughout France. Many Comtoise clocks can be found in France but they are also frequently found in Spain, Germany, and other parts of Europe, less in the United States. Many Comtoise clocks were also exported to other countries in Europe and even further, to the Ottoman Empire and as far as Thailand. The metal mechanism was usually protected by a wooden sheath. =Bornholm clocks and Mora clocks= Bornholm clock made by Edvart Sonne, from Rønne, Bornholm in the late 1700s Bornholm clocks are Danish longcase clocks and were made on Bornholm from 1745 to 1900. In Sweden a special variety of longcase clocks was made in Mora, called Mora clocks. Bornholm clock-making began in the 1740s when an English ship, which had longcase clocks in its hold, was stranded. They were sent for repair to a turner named Poul Ottesen Arboe in Rønne and as a result of his repair of them he learned enough about clocks to begin to make his own.

He was the leader of the Manitoba Conservative Party from 1919 to 1922, and served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1922 until his death. Born in Lombardy, Ontario, Willis was educated at Smiths Falls High School and the University of Toronto. He later moved to Manitoba, and worked as a farmer. In 1891, he married Ella French. Willis was reeve of the Rural Municipality of Morton and mayor of Boissevain. In 1915, he co- nominated James Albert Manning Aikins to become the new leader of the provincial Conservative Party. Despite having little political experience, Willis was chosen leader of the Manitoba Conservatives on November 6, 1919, defeating future leader Major Fawcett Taylor. His victory was considered an upset, and can probably be credited to the increasingly strong presence of organized farmers in Manitoba. Some believe Conservative delegates were influenced by the recent election of Ernest Drury's United Farmers in Ontario. The Conservative Party had governed Manitoba from 1900 to 1915, but was sidelined by the emergence of farmer and labour radicalism in the late 1910s. It emerged as the fourth-largest parliamentary group in the 1920 election, behind the Liberals, Farmer candidates and Labour. Willis sought election in Turtle Mountain, but lost to incumbent Liberal George McDonald by 14 votes. He technically retained the leadership of the Manitoba Conservative Party until April 1922, but did not play a significant role in the party after his defeat. John Thomas Haig served as the party's leader in the legislature in 1921-22. Willis ran as the federal Conservative candidate in Souris for the federal election of 1921, but placed a poor third. He stepped down as provincial Conservative leader just before the 1922 provincial election, and was replaced by Taylor. Ironically, Willis's personal electoral fortunes improved after his resignation as leader. He was elected for Turtle Mountain in the 1922 provincial election, and was re-elected in 1927. Both elections were won by the United Farmers of Manitoba, and Willis sat with the Conservatives in opposition. He was still a member of the legislature when he died in Winnipeg in February 1929. His son, Errick Willis, served as leader of the Manitoba Conservative Party from 1936 to 1954.

This figure is obtained by combining the average discharge of the Clarks River at Benton,https://waterdata.usgs.gov/ky/nwis/annual/?format=sites_selection_links&search;_site_no=03610500&agency;_cd=USGS&referred_module=sw and the average discharge of the West Fork at Brewers.https://waterdata.usgs.gov/ky/nwis/annual/?format=sites_selection_links&search;_site_no=03610545&agency;_cd=USGS&referred_module=sw Two forks For the greater part of its length, it consists of two parallel forks of approximately equal size, the East Fork and the West Fork. The East Fork, shown on federal maps as the main stem of the river, begins south of Murray near the community of Puryear in Henry County, Tennessee and is paralleled by the Paducah, Tennessee and Alabama Railroad. The West Fork begins about west of Murray near the intersection of Jones-Sparkman and Butterworth Roads in Calloway County and flows through Kaler and Symsonia in Graves County before joining with the east fork at Oaks Station in McCracken County. Artifacts The Clarks River streams from Murray in Calloway County through Benton in Marshall County and ends in Paducah (McCracken County), where the mouth of the river intersects with the Ohio River. This river is full of wildlife and full of water moccasin. Documented evidence states that many Native American encampments and Indian tribes camped and lived along its banks. To this day artifacts have been found including spearheads, arrowheads and pottery. The river is the namesake for Clarks River Road in Paducah.

John Thomas Haig, PC John Thomas Haig, (December 15, 1877 - October 23, 1962) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served as parliamentary leader of the Manitoba Conservative Party in 1921–22. Born in Colborne, Ontario, Haig received his BA from the University of Manitoba, was called to the Manitoba bar in 1904 and worked as a Barrister-at-law. In 1907, he married Josephine M. Dickie. He was elected to the Winnipeg Public School Board in 1908, and continued to hold this position after entering provincial politics, also serving as board chairman. In 1927, Haig was named King's Counsel. He was president of the Manitoba Curling Association and of the Assiniboia Lawn- Bowling Club. Haig was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba for Assiniboia in 1914. He was soundly defeated in the Liberal landslide of 1915, but returned to the legislature in 1920 at the head of the Conservative Party list in Winnipeg. (Winnipeg elections were determined by a form of proportional representation at this time.); Jansen, The Single Transferable Vote in Alberta and Manitoba (available on-line) Conservative leader R.G. Willis was unable to win a seat in the 1920 election, and Haig was called to lead the eight-member caucus in parliament. He ran for the party's leadership in April 1922, but was defeated by Major Fawcett Taylor. Haig was re-elected to the legislature in 1922, 1927 and 1932, and remained an important voice for the party. In August 1935, he was appointed to the Senate of Canada on the recommendation of Prime Minister R.B. Bennett. From 1945 until 1957, Haig was Leader of the Opposition in the Senate for the Progressive Conservative Party. After the 1957 federal election, Haig joined the Cabinet of John George Diefenbaker, serving as Minister without portfolio and Leader of the Government in the Senate until May 11, 1958. He retired from the Senate on January 17, 1962 due to poor health. Haig died in Winnipeg at the age of 84. His son James Campbell Haig also served in the Senate.

Recorded between 2000 and 2003, it was released posthumously in the UK and Europe on Domino on October 18, 2004, and in the US the following day on October 19, 2004 through record label ANTI-. The album was initially planned as a double album, and was incomplete at the time of Smith's death. Many of the songs Smith intended for the album remained unfinished, in some cases only lacking vocals. Smith's family hired his former producer Rob Schnapf and ex-girlfriend Joanna Bolme to sort through and finish the batch of over thirty songs that were recorded for the album, although the estate retained final decision on which tracks to include. Many of the songs reference Smith's lifelong struggles with drug addiction and depression. His cause of death is officially unknown, as the coroner's report remarks that some aspects pointed to suicide and some to murder. The official nature of the case and statements from close friends state that his death is still under speculation. It has not been investigated further. From a Basement on the Hill became Smith's highest-charting album in the US and was praised by critics, with reviewers complimenting the album's attempts to expand Smith's sound, such as the incorporation of instrumental passages, as well as heavier, guitar-based material.  Background  On October 21, 2003, Elliott Smith died of two stab wounds, presumed by many to be self-inflicted. The wounds occurred following a heated argument at the Los Angeles home of his girlfriend, Jennifer Chiba. The coroner's determination was that the mode of death was undetermined and raised the possibility of homicide. Smith battled heavy drug addiction and severe depression for most of his life, although he was sober in his final days, seeking treatment at the Neurotransmitter Restoration Center in Beverly Hills and even giving up alcohol, caffeine, red meat, refined sugars and most of his prescribed psychiatric medications on his 34th birthday. Smith took to sobriety with the same intensity with which he took to intoxication, and he found himself suddenly face-to-face with a lifetime of depression and unmanaged emotional trauma.  Recording and production  The album was initially planned as a double album, due to contractual obligations with the DreamWorks label (now Interscope). Smith had over fifty songs on tape reel or digital hard drive. He completed mixing on nine of these tracks with several others lacking only minor revisions or final vocals. Smith's estate hired Schnapf and Bolme to complete mixing on these tracks and eventually chose fifteen for inclusion on the album, which was ultimately released on ANTI- label. During the recording period for the album, Smith had recorded with Steven Drozd and Russell Simins, drummers for The Flaming Lips and Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, respectively. Following Smith's death, Rob Schnapf, producer of Smith's earlier albums Either/Or, XO and Figure 8, was hired to mix and produce the album, along with Smith's former girlfriend Joanna Bolme. David McConnell, although present throughout much of the actual recording process, was not consulted during the mixing, nor was he asked for the extensive three years' worth of notes he and Smith had made while the album was being recorded. When asked why he personally took up the job of finishing the album, Schnapf stated, \\"I had a paternal, protective feeling. I didn't want anybody mucking it up.\\"  Content  \\"Coast to Coast\\" features poetry by Nelson Gary. Smith told Under the Radar in 2003: \\"I asked this friend of mine to make up something he could say as fast as he could in fifteen minutes about people healing themselves or being unable to heal themselves. While he's saying this thing there is a main vocal that goes over that.\\" The lyric \\"You're keeping me around, until I finally drag us both down\\" details a dysfunctional relationship. \\"Pretty (Ugly Before)\\" was previously released as a single in August 2003 on Suicide Squeeze Records, along with a different version of \\"A Distorted Reality Is Now a Necessity to Be Free\\". According to McConnell, Smith did not intend to have \\"Pretty (Ugly Before)\\" on the album. In \\"King's Crossing\\", where he sings \\"It's Christmas time and the needle's on the tree, the skinny Santa is bringing something to me\\", Smith alludes to using heroin, which he had many problems with. Schnapf noted that the track \\"Ostrich & Chirping\\", a short instrumental made from sampling and looping the noises made by a toy bird, had nothing to do with Smith and was something that McConnell had recorded by himself. McConnell said \\"don't ask me how this ended up on the record, I totally forgot I had put that on one of his reels.\\"  Release  From a Basement on the Hill was released on October 19, 2004, almost a year after Smith's death, through record label ANTI-, a sub- label of Epitaph. It peaked at No. 19 in the US, making it his highest- charting album in the US to date. The album has also been re-released by Kill Rock Stars, alongside a remastered reissue of his 1994 debut, Roman Candle. When asked what Smith would have thought of the album, McConnell told Benjamin Nugent, \\"I don't think he would have delivered [that] record. The record he would have delivered would have had more songs, would have had different mixes and [been] a little more in-your-face.\\" Schnapf also expressed that the final result that he and Bolme had produced was not the album that Smith would have made, simply because Elliott was not around to finish the album. Bolme also said that they did not add anything to the songs, and only mixed whatever had been recorded: \\"I would never presume to add anything. We didn't add anything.\\"  Reception  After his death and the release of From a Basement on the Hill, many critics and fans viewed the album as a suicide note. Sindri Eldon, a journalist for Reykjavík Grapevine wrote, \\"...the foreshadowing of his suicide is so strong that it's difficult to listen to\\". From a Basement on the Hill was well received by critics. On music review aggregator website Metacritic, the album holds an approval rating of 88/100 based on thirty-seven reviews; one of the highest-rated albums in the website's database. Many reviewers complimented the album's attempts to expand Smith's sound, such as the incorporation of instrumental passages, as well as heavier, guitar-based material. Pitchfork called it \\"perfectly coherent and cohesive, without any sense of being slapped together from half-finished parts.\\" E! Online called it \\"a beautiful swansong to one of this generation's best.\\" Filter called it \\"large and epic, but tense and claustrophobic as well, and, gratefully, it's as close to Elliott as we've ever been.\\" Billboard stated that \\"Smith bundles together subtlety and ferocity to create one of his heart-aching best... Consider it a 'fond farewell' to one of this generations most poignant and gifted songwriters.\\" Rolling Stone had some reservations, observing that \\"this is an album about the seductions of oblivion, and a few of the more densely arranged songs mimic the characters in the lyrics, stumbing around without quite connecting. More often though, Smith teases extraordinary wit and warmth from songs that float lazily toward happiness.\\" In the UK the album was received even more enthusiastically than in Smith's home country. Under a headline of \\"He saved his best for last. How tragic.\\", Q wrote, \\"Given that its backstory involves one of the grimmest deaths in music history, it's tempting to view this album darkly, but really, there's no denying the new twist here... Without wanting to second-guess his mindset, this music often sounds like the madness surrounding its creator – his heroin troubles, an allegedly turbulent relationship, his struggles against depression. So what dominates are these loud, wayward Los Angeles epics full of gothic grandeur, broken-glass emotions, bizarre soundscapes and heavy, early-'70s guitars.\\" The review concluded, \\"All posthumous releases receive garlands of praise but this would take your breath away whatever the circumstances\\". Other critics, however, were cautious about viewing the album as a suicide note: Mojo felt that \\"to do so would be to miss the crucial point – that From a Basement on the Hill is of a piece within a body of work that stretches back to the mid-'90s. If Smith's lyrical themes were pretty much constant, the point was only underlined by the survival of his abiding aesthetic. In very crude terms, he took the spirit of such White Album songs as \\"Long, Long, Long\\", \\"Julia\\" and \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", and re-rooted them in a lovelorn, druggy demi-monde... Smith, however, was no mere pasticheur. As ever, his chord changes and arrangements betray an inventiveness seemingly borne of brilliant instinct. Moreover, the songs that form this album's spine find him striding away, not only from his own influences, but the approach that had defined his last couple of records. Those who found Figure 8 and parts of XO too in thrall to the musical ways of the West Coast – slightly over-airbrushed, maybe a little too lush – will be cheered by the fractured, frankly grungey likes of \\"Don't Go Down\\" and \\"Coast to Coast\\": in their own controlled way, as messy and imperfect as the experiences described therein. The contrast between their music and Smith's ever-tender vocals makes for a compelling tension; here, he alights upon an approach that would have gone on to serve him admirably well.\\" NME observed that the opening track \\"Coast to Coast\\" \\"sets out the themes which run through the whole album: chronic self-doubt, poisonous sarcasm, a prevailing sense of having had enough of trying to fulfil other people's expectations\\", and went on to state that \\"while this is clearly not the record Smith intended to make, it's still an immensely gripping and cohesive piece of work. For all his experiments with grungier rock and spectral acoustics, From a Basement... holds together convincingly. It sounds like a completely finished album, and one which, remarkably, is a match for the very best in Smith's catalogue.\\"  Track listing   Personnel  * Elliott Smith – all instruments not listed below, production, recording, front cover handwriting ; Additional personnel * Sam Coomes – bass guitar and backing vocals (\\"Pretty (Ugly Before)\\") * Steven Drozd – drums (\\"Coast to Coast\\") * Aaron Embry – keyboards (\\"Pretty (Ugly Before)\\") * Scott McPherson – drums (\\"Pretty (Ugly Before)\\") * Fritz Michaud – drums (\\"King's Crossing\\") * Aaron Sperske – drums (\\"Coast to Coast\\") * Nelson Gary – poetry reading (\\"Coast to Coast\\") ; Technical * Autumn DeWilde – sleeve typography * Joanna Bolme – mixing * Rob Schnapf – mixing * Scott Wiley – engineering assistance * Ted Jensen – mastering * Andrew Beckman – recording (additional) * Chris Chandler – recording (additional) * David McConnell – recording (additional) * Dee Robb – recording (additional) * Fritz Michaud – recording (additional) * Jon Brion – recording (additional) * Matthew Ellard – recording (additional) * Pete Magdaleno – recording (additional) * Ryan Castle – recording (additional) * Tom Biller – recording (additional) * Valente Torres – recording (additional) * Nick Pritchard – sleeve design * Renaud Monfourny – front cover photograph * Ashley Welch – sleeve photography * Dominic DiSaia – sleeve photography * Paul Heartfield – sleeve photography  Chart positions  { class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:left; \\" ! scope=\\"col\\" Chart (2004) ! scope=\\"col\\" Peak position - ! scope=\\"row\\" Australian ARIA Albums Chart  style=\\"text-align: center; \\" 50 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Belgian Albums Chart (Vl)  style=\\"text-align: center; \\" 47 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Canadian Albums Chart  style=\\"text-align: center; \\" 33 - ! scope=\\"row\\" French SNEP Albums Chart  style=\\"text-align: center; \\" 45 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Irish Albums Chart  style=\\"text-align: center; \\" 11 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Norwegian Albums Chart  style=\\"text-align: center; \\" 37 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Swedish Albums Chart  style=\\"text-align: center; \\" 52 - ! scope=\\"row\\" UK Albums Chart  style=\\"text-align: center; \\" 41 - ! scope=\\"row\\" US Billboard 200  style=\\"text-align: center; \\" 19 - ! scope=\\"row\\" US Billboard Independent Albums  style=\\"text-align: center; \\" 1 }  References   External links  * Category:2004 albums Category:Elliott Smith albums Category:Anti- (record label) albums Category:Domino Recording Company albums Category:Albums published posthumously Category:Albums produced by Rob Schnapf ","title":"From a Basement on the Hill"},{"id":"852746","text":"An Alcyon bicycle constructed in 1904 The Alcyon was a French bicycle, automobile and motorcycle manufacturer between 1903 and 1954.  Origins  Alcyon originated from about 1890 when Edmond Gentil started the manufacture of bicycles in Neuilly, Seine. In 1902, this was complemented by motorcycle production and in 1906, the first cars were shown at the fair \\"Mondial de l'Automobile\\" in Paris, France. Also in 1906 it founded the professional Alcyon cycling team which was active until 1955, including winning the Tour de France 6 times. Motorcycle racing In 1912 Alcyon competed at the Isle of Man TT races with a 348cc single-cylinder engine featuring two inlet valves and two exhaust valves. Both bikes failed to finish the Junior TT race. Alcyon had local success in France during the 1920s, with riders such as Marc Jolly, Marcel Mourrier, Jean Durand and Lucien Lemasson winning races. During this time too, this bicycle brand got its nickname \\"l'intrépide Alcyon\\".  Voiturettes before the World War I  Two models were shown in 1906, one a two-seat light car with single-cylinder 950 cc engine and a larger four seat model with 1.4-litre four-cylinder engine. Both engines were bought in from Gentil. The cars were advanced models with 3-speed gearboxes and shaft drive. However, the single-cylinder models were dropped in 1912 and larger models of up to 2120 cc were added to the range. By then, most of the engines were obtained from Zurcher. The company moved to Courbevoie, Seine in 1912. In 1954 Peugeot absorbed Alcyon.  Cyclecars between wars  A 1925 Alcyon Touriste 350 JAP motorcycle In 1914, the company's name was changed to Automobiles Alcyon. After the war, the first model was a 1914 cc four-cylinder model, some examples of which were tuned and sold by the Lyons agent as Alycon-GLs and performed quite well in competition. However, the car was not a success and did not sell well, so in 1923, Alcyon moved into the production of cyclecars, using 500 cc two-stroke flat-twin engines in a design bought from SIMA-Violet. Later the company manufactured another cyclecar of similar design, thought this one featured a single-cylinder engine. This proved a complete flop, and the company failed in 1928. Alcyon never sold cars again.

He was a slaveholding planter in Maury County, Tennessee, and a second cousin of President James K. Polk. He resigned his ecclesiastical position to become a major general in the Confederate army, when he was called \\"Sewanee's Fighting Bishop\\". His official portrait at the University of the South depicts him dressed as a bishop with his army uniform hanging nearby. He is often erroneously referred to as \\"Leonidas K. Polk\\", but he had no middle name and never signed any documents as such. Polk was one of the more notable, yet controversial, political generals of the war. Recognizing his indispensable familiarity with the Mississippi Valley, Confederate President Jefferson Davis commissioned his elevation to a high military position regardless of his lack of prior combat experience. He commanded troops in the Battle of Shiloh, the Battle of Perryville, the Battle of Stones River, the Tullahoma Campaign, the Battle of Chickamauga, the Chattanooga Campaign, and the Atlanta Campaign. He is remembered for his bitter disagreements with his immediate superior, the likewise-controversial General Braxton Bragg of the Army of Tennessee, and for his general lack of success in combat. While serving under the command of General Joseph E. Johnston, he was killed in action in 1864 during the Atlanta Campaign. Antebellum life Polk was born in Raleigh, North Carolina, to Sarah Polk (née Hawkins) and Colonel William Polk, a Revolutionary War veteran and prosperous planter. He was of Scottish and Scots-Irish ancestry. Capitalizing on his position as chief surveyor of the central district of Tennessee, William was able to acquire about of land.Robins, p. 1537. Polk briefly attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill before entering the United States Military Academy at West Point. During his senior year, he joined the Episcopal Church and was baptized in the Academy Chapel by Chaplain Charles P. McIlvaine, who later became the Episcopal Bishop of Ohio. Polk had an impressive academic record, excelling in rhetoric and moral philosophy. He graduated eighth of 38 cadets on July 1, 1827, and was appointed a brevet second lieutenant in the artillery.Dupuy, p. 601. Polk resigned his commission on December 1, 1827, so that he could enter the Virginia Theological Seminary. He became an assistant to Bishop Richard Channing Moore at Monumental Church in Richmond, Virginia. Moore agreed to ordain Polk as a deacon in April 1830; however, on a visit to Raleigh in March it was discovered that he had never been confirmed as an Episcopalian. To remedy the fact, before his ordination, he was hastily confirmed at St. John's Episcopal Church in Fayetteville, NC. He was then ordained a deacon as planned and a priest the following year. On May 6, 1830, Polk married Frances Ann Devereux, daughter of John Devereux and Frances Pollock; her mother was the granddaughter of Puritan theologian Jonathan Edwards. The Polks had eight children who survived to adulthood.Robins, p. 1538.Mrs. Polk's memorial on Find a Grave St. John's Church at Ashwood In 1832, Polk moved his family to the vast Polk Rattle and Snap tract in Maury County, Tennessee, and constructed a massive Greek Revival home called Ashwood Hall. Polk was the largest slaveholder in the county in 1840, with 111 slaves. (By 1850, census records state that Polk owned 215 slaves, but other estimates are as high as 400.) With his four brothers in Maury County, he built a family chapel, St. John's Church, at Ashwood.St. John's later became famous for its connection to Confederate general Patrick Cleburne, who remarked that it would be \\"worth dying to be buried in a place so beautiful.\\" Two days later he was killed at the Battle of Franklin and was buried for six years at St. John's. He also served as priest of St. Peter's Church in Columbia, Tennessee. He was appointed Missionary Bishop of the Southwest in September 1838 and was elected first Bishop of Louisiana in October 1841. In 1848, he performed the marriage of his niece, Mary Bayard Devereux, to Major William John Clarke. Bishop Polk was the leading founder of the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, which he envisioned as a national university for the South and a New World equivalent to Oxford and Cambridge, both in England. (In his August 1856 letter to Bishop Elliott, he expounded on the secessionist motives for his university.) Polk laid and consecrated the cornerstone for the first building on October 9, 1860. Polk's foundational legacy at Sewanee is remembered always through his portrait Sword Over the Gown, painted by Eliphalet F. Andrews in 1900. After the original was vandalized in 1998, a copy by Connie Erickson was unveiled on June 1, 2003. The title refers to the answer given by Bishop Polk \\"when asked in Richmond if he was putting off the gown of an Episcopal bishop to take up the sword of a Confederate general, to which he replied, 'No, Sir, I am buckling the sword over the gown,'\\" indicating that he saw it was his duty as a bishop to take up arms. Civil War =Kentucky= At the outbreak of the Civil War, Polk pulled the Louisiana Convention out of the Episcopal Church of the United States to form the Protestant Episcopal Church in the Confederate States of America. Although he hoped that secession would result in a peaceful separation of the North and South, and suggested that he was reluctant to take up arms personally, he did not hesitate to write to his friend and former classmate at West Point, Jefferson Davis,McWhiney, p. 205. offering his services in the Confederate States Army. Polk was commissioned a major general on June 25, 1861, and ordered to command Department No. 2 (roughly, the area between the Mississippi River and the Tennessee River).Eicher, pp. 432-33. He committed one of the great blunders of the Civil War by dispatching troops to occupy Columbus, Kentucky, in September 1861; the critical border state of Kentucky had declared its neutrality between the Union and the Confederacy, but Polk's action was instrumental in prompting the Kentucky legislature to request Federal aid to resist his advance, ending the state's brief attempt at neutrality and effectively ceding it to Union control for the remainder of the war.Woodworth, Jefferson Davis, pp. 34-38; Noe, p. 8; Eicher, p. 432. During this period Polk argued about strategy with his subordinate, Pillow, and his superior, Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston, commander of Confederate forces in the Western Theater. Resentful that his former West Point roommate was giving him orders, he submitted a letter of resignation to President Davis on November 6, but Davis rejected the request.Woodworth, Jefferson Davis, pp. 58-60; Eicher, p. 432; Connelly, p. 21. Polk's command saw its first combat on November 7, 1861, in the minor, inconclusive Battle of Belmont between Polk's subordinate, Brig. Gen. Gideon Johnson Pillow and Union Brig. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant. Although not present on the battlefield himself, Polk was wounded nearby on November 11 when the largest cannon in his army, nicknamed \\"Lady Polk\\" in honor of his wife, exploded during demonstration firing. The explosion stunned Polk and blew his clothes off, requiring a convalescence of several weeks. =Army of Mississippi= In April 1862, Polk commanded the First Corps of Albert Sidney Johnston's Army of Mississippi at the Battle of Shiloh and continued in that role for much of the rest of the year under Beauregard, who had assumed command following the death of A. S. Johnston on the first day at Shiloh, and then under Gen. Braxton Bragg. At various times his command was considered a corps and at other times the \\"Right Wing\\" of the army. In the fall, during the invasion of Kentucky by Bragg and Maj. Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith, Polk was in temporary command of the Army of Mississippi while Bragg visited Frankfort to preside over the inauguration of a Confederate governor for the state. Polk disregarded an order from Bragg to attack the flank of the pursuing Union Army near Frankfort.McWhiney, pp. 230, 300-08. At the Battle of Perryville, Polk's right wing constituted the main attacking force against Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell's Army of the Ohio, but Polk was reluctant to attack the small portion of Buell's army that faced him until Bragg arrived at the battlefield. One of the enduring legends of the Civil War is that Polk witnessed his subordinate, Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Cheatham, advancing his division. Cheatham allegedly shouted, \\"Give 'em hell, boys!\\" and Polk, retaining the sensibility of his role as an Episcopal bishop, seconded the cheer: \\"Give it to 'em boys; give 'em what General Cheatham says!\\"McWhiney, pp. 314-16, McDonough, pp. 243-45. =Army of Tennessee= After Perryville, Polk began a year-long campaign to get Bragg relieved of command, hoping to use his close relationship with President Davis to accomplish his goal.McWhiney, pp. 328-29. Despite the failure of his Kentucky campaign, Bragg was retained in command, but this did nothing to reduce the enmity between Polk and Bragg. Polk was promoted to lieutenant general on October 11, 1862, with date of rank of October 10. He became the second most senior Confederate of that rank during the war, behind James Longstreet.Eicher, p. 808. Edmund Kirby Smith also outranked Polk (behind Longstreet), but he was later promoted to full general. In November, the Army of Mississippi was renamed the Army of Tennessee and Polk commanded its First Corps until September 1863.Eicher, pp. 433, 890. Polk fought under Bragg at the Battle of Stones River in late 1862 and once again Bragg's subordinates politicked to remove their army commander after an unsuccessful battle (the battle was tactically inconclusive, but Bragg was unable to stop the advance of the Union Army of the Cumberland under Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans and Bragg withdrew his army to Tullahoma, Tennessee). Bragg was also unsuccessful in resisting Rosecrans's advance in the Tullahoma Campaign, which began to threaten the important city of Chattanooga. In the face of Rosecrans's expert maneuvering of his army, Polk counseled Bragg to retreat rather than stand and fight in their Tullahoma fortifications.Woodworth, Six Armies, pp. 38-40; Connelly, pp. 130-32; McWhiney, pp. 377-79; Hallock, pp. 13-20. Rosecrans eventually maneuvered Bragg out of Chattanooga and the Army of Tennessee withdrew into the mountains of northwestern Georgia with the Army of the Cumberland in hot pursuit. Bragg planned to attack and destroy at least one of Rosecrans's corps, advancing separately over mountainous roads. He was infuriated when Polk's division under Maj. Gen. Thomas C. Hindman failed to attack an isolated Union corps at Davis's Cross Roads as ordered on September 11. Two days later, Polk disregarded orders from Bragg to attack another isolated corps, the second failed opportunity. At the Battle of Chickamauga, Polk was given command of the Right Wing and the responsibility for initiating the attack on the second day of battle (September 20). He failed to inform his subordinates of the plan and his wing was late in attacking, allowing the Union defenders time to complete their field fortifications. Bragg wrote after the war that if it were not for the loss of these hours, \\"our independence might have been won.\\"Woodworth, Six Armies, pp. 103, 106; Hallock, pp. 54-62, 71-74. Chickamauga was a great tactical victory for Bragg, but instead of pursuing and destroying the Union Army as it retreated, he laid siege to it in Chattanooga, concentrating his effort against the enemies inside his army instead of his enemies from the North. He demanded an explanation from Polk on the bishop's failure to attack in time on September 20 and Polk placed the blame entirely on one of his subordinates, Maj. Gen. D. H. Hill. Bragg wrote to President Davis, \\"Gen'l Polk by education and habit is unfit for executing the plans of others. He will convince himself his own are better and follow them without reflecting on the consequences.\\" Bragg relieved Polk of his command and ordered him to Atlanta to await further orders. Although Polk protested the \\"arbitrary and unlawful order\\" to the Secretary of War and demanded a court of inquiry, he was not restored to his position and Davis once again retained Bragg in army command, despite the protestations of a number of his subordinate generals.Hallock, pp. 89-92; Woodworth, Jefferson Davis, pp. 239-40; Connelly, pp. 247-48. =Mississippi= President Davis transferred his friend Polk to command the Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana (December 23, 1863 – January 28, 1864) and then the Department of Alabama and East Mississippi (January 28 – May 4, 1864), giving him effective command of the state of Mississippi following the departure of Gen. Joseph E. Johnston to replace Bragg in command of the Army of Tennessee. Polk unsuccessfully attempted to oppose Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman's raid against Meridian, Mississippi, in February 1864. In May, he was ordered to take his forces and join with Johnston in resisting Sherman's advance in the Atlanta Campaign. He assumed command of the Third Corps of the Army of Tennessee on May 4.Woodworth, Jefferson Davis, pp. 260, 274-75; Connelly, pp. 246-48, 294-95; Eicher, pp. 433, 891. His command remained commonly known as the \\"Army of Mississippi\\". =Atlanta Campaign and death= Polk brought more than 20,000 men with him to Georgia. Because of his elevated rank, he became the army's second in command under Johnston. By using successive flanking maneuvers, Sherman forced Johnston to withdraw his army from strong defensive positions to protect the Confederate line of communication. This forced Johnston ever closer to the critically important city of Atlanta.McMurray, p. 62; Woodworth, Jefferson Davis, p. 281. On June 14, 1864, Polk was scouting enemy positions near Marietta, Georgia, with his staff when he was killed in action by a Federal shell at Pine Mountain.Welsh, p. 174. The artillery fire was initiated when Sherman spotted a cluster of Confederate generals — Polk, William J. Hardee, and Johnston, with their staffs — in an exposed area. He pointed them out to Maj. Gen. Oliver Otis Howard, commander of the IV Corps, and ordered him to fire upon them. Battery I of the 1st Ohio Light Artillery, commanded by Capt. Hubert Dilger, obeyed the order within minutes. The first round from the battery came close and a second came even closer, causing the men to disperse. The third shell struck Polk's left arm, went through his chest, and exited hitting his right arm, then exploded against a tree; it nearly cut Polk in two.Smith, pp. 253-54. Foote, p. 356, credits Battery I, 1st Ohio Light Battery, commanded by Capt. Hubert Dilger. Polk's biographer, Joseph Parks, describes his death (pp. 382-83) without identifying the Union artillery responsible. Legacy Although his record as a field commander was poor, Polk was immensely popular with his troops, and his death was deeply mourned in the Army of Tennessee. Polk's funeral service at Saint Paul's Church in Augusta, Georgia, was one of the most elaborate during the war. His friend Bishop Stephen Elliott of Georgia presided at the service, delivering a stirring funeral oration. He was buried in a location under the present-day altar. The church has a monument to the bishop near the altar, and the original grave site can be visited. In 1945, his remains and those of his wife were reinterred at Christ Church Cathedral in New Orleans.Robins, p. 1538; Eicher, p. 433. His grave can be found in the front floor sanctuary, to the right of the pulpit. Fort Polk in Louisiana is named in Bishop Polk's memory. Polk's nephew, Lucius E. Polk, was also a Confederate general. Lucius E. Polk's son Rufus King Polk was a Congressman. Bishop Polk's son, William Mecklenburg Polk, was a physician and a Confederate captain, who later served as a First Lieutenant in the U.S. Army during World War I.Polk IV, Francis Devereux. \\"Confederate officer becomes officer in WWI\\". Confederate Veteran. March/April 2017. Page 53 He later authored his most flattering biography. William M. Polk's son, Frank Polk, served as counselor to the U.S. Department of State through World War I and later became the first Under Secretary of State. A brother of Bishop Polk, Lucius Junius Polk, married a grand-niece of Rachel Jackson, wife of U.S. President Andrew Jackson. U.S. President James K. Polk was Bishop Polk's first cousin twice removed. Polk's portrait, done by Cornelius Hankins, was donated to Christ Church Cathedral in Nashville, Tennessee, by his grandson W. Dudley Gate, in 1963. Military historian Steven E. Woodworth described the shell that killed Polk as \\"one of the worst shots fired for the Union cause during the entire course of the war\\", as Polk's incompetence made him far more valuable alive than dead: \\"Polk's incompetence and willful disobedience had consistently hamstrung Confederate operations west of the Appalachians, while his special relationship with the president made the bishop-general untouchable.\\" See also *Kentucky in the American Civil War *List of American Civil War generals (Confederate) Notes References * Connelly, Thomas L.

Michael, known to all simply as 'Binkley,' is a 10-year-old boy who lives at the Bloom County Boarding House with his father Tom (his mother, Margret, had divorced Tom and moved to Oakland with a Hells Angel). Binkley is in the same class as Milo Bloom, his best friend. Binkley introduces Opus to his group, at first believing him to be a dog. Binkley is described as \\"an airhead\\" by everyone who knows him (except Opus). Binkley is the first recurring child character after Milo to appear in the strip and largely replaced the dog Rabies as Milo's sounding board. Binkley originally appears as a player on Milo's elementary school football team. The coach is Major Bloom, who uses the team to live out his fantasy of being a great military commander. Binkley is originally depicted as a stereotypical nerd; he is much smaller than the other children and has thick glasses, bad skin, and messy hair. Soon afterwards, Binkley appears in his \\"classic\\" look (Opus at one point comments that Binkley looks like a carrot). Binkley's father initially calls him \\"Mad Dog\\" and hopes he will live out his failed dreams by becoming a star middle linebacker. Binkley, on the other hand, is interested in ballet, wants to dance the lead in Swan Lake, and dreams of being a hairdresser. He is a Star Wars fan and dreams of being a master Jedi. He constantly wakes up his easily irritated father in the middle of the night to talk to him about celebrity gossip, politics and random anxieties to the point where the father eventually cannot sleep without those interruptions. He also has a closet in his room where his anxieties dwell and plague him at night. Their leader is the Giant Purple Snorklewacker, but the anxieties can range from typical things like giant snakes to computer technology to politically themed ones like a pair of disagreeing macroeconomists. In one instance, the anxiety closet showed Binkley his future middle-aged self: a balding, paunchy, lifelong failure who gives grandiose nicknames to his wife, daughter, house, car, dog, etc. Binkley is infatuated with an African American girl named Blondie (scandalizing the rather conservative townsfolk, including his father). Binkley campaigns with the Meadow Party. In the Sunday strip Opus, it is revealed that Binkley had become a eunuch in Tibet after a disastrous first date. However, Binkley makes a sudden and unexplained reappearance in the June 3, 2007 Opus strip in which he is depicted in his \\"classic\\" incarnation.Breathed, Berkeley. Opus. June 3, 2007 .
