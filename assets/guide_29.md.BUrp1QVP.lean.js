It is located on the small island of Kinn. It is one of two churches for the Kinn parish which is part of the Sunnfjord prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bj√∏rgvin. The white, stone church was built in a rectangular style in the middle of the 12th century by an unknown architect. It is the oldest and the only one of its kind in the Sunnfjord region, and it is one of the most impressive medieval monuments in Western Norway. It was the main church in the parish of Kinn until 1882, when the new Flor√∏ Church was built in the newly founded town of Flor√∏. Since that time, the old stone church was taken out of regular use and it mostly used as a museum, although it is used for special occasions. History The earliest existing written historical records of the church date back to the year 1322, but the building was likely built in the second half of the 12th century. The building is constructed out of a type of sandstone from the island of Skorpa. According to tradition, the church was built by Borni, the sister to Saint Sunniva who is the patron saint of the Diocese of Bj√∏rgvin. In 1868‚Äì69, the church was renovated, including larger windows and lower roof angles. These changes were reversed in 1911‚Äì12 when the roof was rebuilt to match the historical design. Also at that time, the porch was demolished and rebuilt. Some of the interior was also rebuilt in the 1911 reconstruction. Building Currently, Kinn Church is used only during the summer months. The church itself is built in a Romanesque style with Roman-arched windows and doors. The municipality of Kinn bought the church in 1866, and in 1868‚Äì69, major repair work was carried out. Another restoration was carried out in 1911‚Äì12. The most recent restoration work was completed in the late 1960s. The \\"lectorium\\" constitutes the oldest part of the church. Research has shown that it most likely was built in the mid-13th century, and the wooden reliefs have been carved by artists at the royal court in Bergen at the time of H√•kon H√•konson. It is considered to be one of the finest gems from Norwegian medieval art. The altar in the chancel is made of soapstone, and in the stone slab on top there is a small hole covered with a marble lid. This is where the holy objects and relics were hidden. The three saint figures in the triptych on the south wall in the chancel are made in the Netherlands, perhaps a gift to the church in the early 16th century. At Kinn, these figures have been renamed Ingebj√∏rg, Borni, and Sunniva, all linked to local legends. The altarpiece was built in 1644, probably by Peter Negelsen who made altarpieces and other religious objects of art for many churches in this country.

Froia pursued a policy of acquiring and building castles along the Catalan frontier, even within the county and diocese of Barcelona.

Megarry is a game designer most notable for the board game Dungeon!. Megarry hosting a Dungeon! event Dave autographing a copy of The New Dungeon! Megarry leading a session of Dungeon! at Gary Con, on Dave Arneson's ping pong table Career= Early gaming and Blackmoor  Dave Megarry was a member of the Midwest Military Simulation Association (MMSA), along with Dave Arneson, David Wesely, Ken Fletcher, John and Richard Snider and others.Midwest Area Gaming Enthusiasts Jon Peterson identifies Megarry as playing the King of Prussia in their Napoleonic wargames campaigns. Megarry was also a member of Dave Arneson's original Twin Cities Blackmoor group. Megarry has brought to light Blackmoor gaming materials used in the early days of the game. These include regional maps, dungeon maps, and character matrices. The Blackmoor character matrices start in 1971, and cover approximately 20 characters played over time. The various attributes include Brains, Leadership, Courage, Health, Woodcraft, Horsemanship, Sailing, etc. They also include some history about each character, including the character's death. Megarry has described the character sheets as a \\"moving history.\\"  Development of Dungeon!  Megarry designed a one-off board game called Dungeon! where players trooped through a dungeon on a singular basis, a game that had ultimately derived from the Braunstein playing sessions with Arneson. Jon Peterson traces the development of Dungeon! to a short Blackmoor campaign hiatus in 1972, which resulted in other players running their own games, such as Greg Svenson, Pete Gaylord, and John Snider. Dave Megarry took the underworld component of Blackmoor and turned it into a dungeon exploration board game with randomly-selected monsters and treasure. One early version of this game was called The Dungeons of Pasha Cada. The earliest prototype dungeon board was preserved by Megarry, but the instructions are missing. The earliest complete version of The Dungeons of Pasha Cada was preserved by a friend who received a hand-made copy in 1973. This early version of the game includes 30 monsters, and the player characters are the standard Hero, Superhero, Wizard, and Elf. Some sources link the Dungeon! combat results table to Table T, in Charles Totten's 1880 book on military wargaming, Strategos, which was widely read and used by MMSA members. Table T was commonly implemented in Twin Cities Strategos-based games such as Strategos N.  Publication of Dungeon!  After developing the game, Megarry contacted Parker Brothers to see if they had interest in the game, but received a rejection letter. Also in 1972, Gary Gygax expressed an interest in Blackmoor and the dungeon board game, and invited Arneson to Megarry to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, to demonstrate their games. According to Jon Peterson, this was likely done with the understanding that this could lead to eventual publication by Guidon Games. In November 1972, Dave Arneson and Dave Megarry traveled to Lake Geneva to meet with Gary Gygax, to provide a demonstration of their games. While meeting at Gygax's house, Dave Arneson ran the Lake Geneva gamers through their first session of Blackmoor. Rob Kuntz describes Dave Arneson as the referee, and the Lake Geneva players as being Gary Gygax, Ernie Gygax, Terry Kuntz, and himself. Kuntz describes Dave Megarry as the de facto leader of the group, as he understood the Blackmoor game and campaign world.Robert Kuntz: \\"Dave Arneson was the judge, and the other players were: EGG, Terry Kuntz, Ernie Gygax and myself. Megarry was the de facto leader as he understood the campaign area and rules and so he was our overall integration point in the adventure which took place on EGG's dining table.\\" In Wargaming magazine, Rob Kuntz wrote a short summary of their first Blackmoor session: After Megarry showed his board game to Gygax, they continued to correspond about it. In 1973 they presented The Dungeons of Pasha Cada to various manufacturers, including Don Lowry of Guidon Games. Lowry was concerned that the dungeon maps would be too expensive to print. The game would eventually be published by TSR Hobbies as Dungeon! in 1975.  Work at TSR  Dave Megarry was hired by TSR in 1975, the same year they published his Dungeon! board game. Megarry called Bill Owen of Judges Guild to negotiate a formal license from September 4 ‚Äì November 22, 1976; this agreement required Judges Guild to pay a royalty to TSR for the right to place text on the cover of most products saying \\"Approved for use with Dungeons & Dragons\\". Arneson left TSR in 1976 over creative differences, and Megarry left around the same time.  Influence  Knucklebones magazine identified Megarry's Dungeon! as the first game in the genre of adventure board games.

Early life and education Jean Blashfield was born in Madison, Wisconsin, and raised in Evanston, Illinois. She received a B.A. in Experimental Psychology and English from the University of Michigan, and did graduate work in Science Education at the University of Chicago. Career After graduating from college, Blashfield was hired by Wallace Black at Children's Press in Chicago, where she started working on a 20-volume science encyclopedia. Within a few months, she was promoted to Managing Editor, and handled all the editing and production, managed a staff of 20, and wrote a number of articles for the encyclopedia. The Young People's Science Encyclopedia was first published in 1962. Blashfield commented, \\"The most exciting event of my professional career was the publishing of this first encyclopedia. With that job, I was ballooned into the mainstream of publishing before I had even known where I was heading. It was a thrilling, enriching experience ‚Äî being with experts in their fields, top consultants from many walks of life, and enjoying the concepts of the varied artists. I think being involved with the compiling of a major reference work of any kind is a stirring (and exhausting) experience.\\" In 1964, Blashfield took a job in London: \\"The logic of that move escapes me now, except there was no position in Chicago at the time that I was interested in, and the thought of moving to New York scared the wits out of me.\\" While in London, her first works for the company were published - a series of Gilbert and Sullivan operas illustrated and retold for children, also published in the United States by Franklin Watts. She comments: \\"I also wrote a book on scientific experiments, and served as American consultant on several adult 'coffee table books,' one of which was a book of photographs by Lord Snowden, Princess Margaret's ex-husband\\". In 1967, Wallace Black started his own company, New Horizons Publishers, and asked Blashfield to come back to Chicago as his editor-in-chief to create a 14-volume aviation and space encyclopedia: \\"It seemed like too good an opportunity to miss, so I left London and came back to the United States. It was quite a challenge overseeing the work on a science encyclopedia for high school students and adults. The science was much more involved than it had been on the earlier set, but there were a lot of benefits, too [...] The Air Force flew me to a number of special events, including the rollout of the C-5 aircraft where President Johnson spoke. I saw the launch of the first Saturn V rocket from Cape Kennedy, and I spent a lot of time in Washington, D.C.\\" Above and Beyond: The Encyclopedia of Aviation and Space Sciences was published in 1968. After that, Blashfield moved to Washington, D.C., and worked as a freelance editor and writer. In 1976, Wallace Black, now widowed, had come to Washington on business. \\"We got together for dinner one night [...] and three months later we were married.\\" The next year, the Blacks moved to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, and then had two children, a son, Winston, and a daughter, Chandelle. A friend introduced her to Rose Estes, who wrote a number of the early Endless Quest books for TSR. \\"I didn't know about TSR, even though it was only a few miles away. I had heard of the Dungeons & Dragons game, of course, but I had no idea it was published in Wisconsin.\\" As she was already an experienced industry editor, Jean Black was brought on as Education Editor for TSR's new education department, which was intended to sell classroom modules to teachers. She worked with Jim Ward to put together an education program. The education department ultimately failed because TSR decided not to hire educational sales staff; Black would later push other educational ideas, such as books that combined World War II history with wargames, but TSR did not take advantage of these educational opportunities. Black became the Managing Editor of TSR's new Book Department, and would use the success of TSR's gamebooks to aid in the release of the Dragonlance novels. Black picked Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis to write Dragons of Autumn Twilight (1984) and the rest of the Dragonlance Chronicles series. She also wrote a number of gamebooks, including Master of Ravenloft (AD&D; Adventure Gamebook #6), Ghost Tower (Super Endless Quest Book #2), and Villains of Volturnus (Endless Quest Book #8).

Dancey is a businessman who has worked primarily in the collectible card game and role-playing game industries. He was vice president in charge of Dungeons & Dragons at Wizards of the Coast. Career Dancey was part of Isomedia Inc, which was helping to fund Legend of the Five Rings (1995), and he joined in on the project. In 1996 the principals behind the game created a new, better-funded company, calling it Five Rings Publishing Group. Robert Abramowitz became the President of the new company, and Alderac Entertainment Group (AEG) and Isomedia each gave over their rights in Legend of the Five Rings for appropriate ownership, with Dancey becoming VP of Product Development and John Zinser of AEG becoming VP of Sales. In early 1997, TSR was on the verge of bankruptcy and looking for a buyer; Abramowitz and Dancey negotiated a deal for the purchase of TSR, which they brought to Peter Adkison at Wizards of the Coast, who purchased Five Rings Publishing along with TSR as part of the deal. At the end of 1998 the Five Rings group was dissolved as a separate entity, and Dancey became the business head of the roleplaying department at Wizards of the Coast (WOTC), where he became involved in the development of the third edition of Dungeons & Dragons. Adkison put Dancey in charge of TSR's business and marketing concerns. Dancey championed Wizards of the Coast's purchase of Last Unicorn Games in 2000, as he saw in them a smaller and more efficient RPG R&D; force that he wanted to bring in with Wizards' own RPG staff. Dancey largely conceived of the Open Gaming License (OGL) and d20 System Trademark License, based on his belief that the true strength of D&D; was in its gaming community. He said that TSR was far too aggressive looking for copyright violations and alienated fans. The OGL was published by WOTC in 2000 to license the System Reference Document (SRD) for D&D; in a move spearheaded by Dancey. Dancey also co-authored the Hero Builder's Guidebook (2000). Dancey later moved back to \\"consultant\\" status, and was among those laid off by Wizards toward the end of 2002. Dancey later worked for Icelandic video game producer CCP Games, which had purchased White Wolf Publishing. In 2011, Dancey began working on Goblinworks \\"Pathfinder Online\\" Sandbox MMORPG. In August 2015, Interim Goblinworks CEO Lisa Stevens announced that Ryan Dancey had left Goblinworks for personal reasons. In a separate letter to players, she indicated that Dancey was still involved, and would continue to consult on the project.

Calhoun's home in Clemson, South Carolina, see: Fort Hill (Clemson, South Carolina). The Calhoun Mansion is a Victorian house at 16 Meeting St., Charleston, South Carolina. The mansion is open for public tours.  History  George W. Williams bought the \\"Lowndes Lot\\" on Meeting Street and already had plans for a large house with attached conservatory, a hot house, extensive gardens, and an observatory atop the main house by 1873. The house was built in 1875 and 1876 for George W. Williams, a businessman, according to plans drawn by W.P. Russell by the Devereux Brothers as contractors. The cornerstone was laid April 26, 1875. George W. Williams' new house appeared in an illustrated guide to Charleston in 1875. The 24,000-square-foot house has thirty main rooms and many more smaller rooms. The main hall is 50 feet long and 14 feet wide. The house has a ballroom with a 45-foot-high ceiling. When Williams died, in 1903, his house was inherited by his son-in-law, Patrick Calhoun, a grandson of John C. Calhoun. It was from his ownership that the house derived its common name, the Calhoun Mansion. It opened as a hotel starting in 1914. In 1932, the rear portion of the property, which faces on Church Street to the east, was subdivided, and the original stables and servants' quarters were converted into the Louis Gourd House. Attorney Gedney Howe and his wife, Patricia, bought the house in 1976 and undertook a restoration. In 2000, Mr. Howe put the house up for sale, but it was still unsold by 2004, when he opted to advertise it for auction to occur on May 25, 2004. Before the auction, however, a private sale was arranged to lawyer and preservationist Howard Stahl. It currently is used to house and display Mr. Stahl's extensive collection of artifacts from the Gilded Age.  In popular culture  The house and grounds have appeared in ABC's mini-series North and South as the Hazards' mansion. It also appears in Gunfight at Branson Creek movie.Internet Movie Database ReferencesExternal links * Calhoun Mansion - official site Category:Houses in Charleston, South Carolina Category:Houses completed in 1876 Category:Calhoun family Category:Museums in Charleston, South Carolina Category:Historic house museums in South Carolina ","title":"Calhoun Mansion"},{"id":"41095470","text":"Public domain refers to works whose intellectual property rights have expired, have been forfeited, or are inapplicable.

Synopsis Saayad is the story of two generations living together, but experiencing the world in very different ways. Whereas the influence of a sincere, hardworking friend transforms the lives of a group of friends for the better, the arrogance of, and lack of guidance for the newer generation sets another group of friends on a track of drugs, death and destruction. The generational clash reveals how moral authority has become corrupted in Nepali society, and how the alienation of the younger generation is pushing them to anarchy.

Baker Creek tributaries include Thanksgiving, Gold Run, Eureka, and Pioneer creeks; Seattle Junior Creek is a tributary of Pioneer Creek. The Baker Creek diggings of the early 20th century were situated approximately south of Rampart. Geography The creek flows along the southwestern side of a large flat, broad in its widest part, and approximately long. Its longer extensions are northeast‚Äìsouthwest in the line of flow of Eureka and Hutlina creeks. Instead of sharp canyon-like valleys, the streams flow through open valleys, and where they flow in general parallel to the Baker-Minook divide‚Äîthat is, approaching a northeast‚Äìsouthwest or an east‚Äìwest direction‚Äîthe southern bank is steep, while the northern one is gently sloping, the creeks flowing close to the steeper side. Even along the broad Baker Flats, this feature is still prominent. The north side is a long gentle slope toward the divide, rising more sharply in its upper part, while across the flats the southern side may be seen rising abruptly from the valley floor. There are several main streams within the Baker Creek gold area. Eureka Creek, lying next to the Baker-Minook divide, flows southwesterly for about , then turns to the south. Pioneer Creek flows parallel to Eureka between to the southeast and joins it on Baker Flats. Rhode Island Creek flows in a southerly direction, about west of Eureka Creek, Omega Creek in the western part of the gold area. Into these creeks flow all of the smaller creeks of the area along the Baker-Minook divide. The streams are all small, many of the smaller ones being ordinarily dry during the summer and fall. The gradient of the larger streams is comparatively low and water reaches the benches with difficulty. History Baker Creek was named by Henry Tureman Allen in 1885; it is reportedly the same waterway as Ivan Petrof's Saklekageta of 1880. Gold was discovered in the Baker Creek area on Eureka Creek, where mining was begun during the winter of 1898-99 and a small amount was taken out. On Glenn Creek, gold was discovered in July, 1901, on the benches along Pioneer Creek in 1902, on Thanksgiving Creek in February, 1903, and other discoveries were made during the summer of 1904.

The New York Fed twice (November 1990 and December 1992) awarded him its President's Award for Excellence, in part for his work as a United States delegate to the United Nations Convention on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) in drafting the 1992 Model Law on International Credit Transfers, for which he also received a Letter of Commendation from the U.S. State Department (September 1991). Subsequently, he wrote books in each of these three areas. Bhala is a senior advisor to Dentons US LLP, where he specializes in international trade law and related matters.

In December 2014, he commented in a TV interview that the release of the U.S. Senate report on enhanced interrogation techniques (torture) by the CIA showed not only a disconnect between the myth and reality of American support for human rights, but also (ultimately) the strength of America and its commitment to the rule of law. In a New Zealand radio interview, Bhala spoke about the meaning of \\"enhanced interrogation techniques,\\" and the lack of any justification for torture. In December 2015, Bhala was one of 70 Kansas University Distinguished Professors to sign a letter of protest against a change in state law allowing the carrying of concealed weapons on campus.http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2015/dec/07/ku-chancellor-distinguished- professors-state-oppos/, KU Chancellor, Distinguished Professors State Opposition to Guns on Campus, Lawrence Journal World, Dec. 7, 2015; http://www.kansan.com/news/ku-distinguished-professors-endorse-kansas-state- professors-position-on- restricting/article_0a0548fe-9d20-11e5-bac2-bb8e64957771.html, 68 KU Distinguished Professors Endorse Kansas State Professors' Position on Restricting Concealed Weapons on Campus, University Daily Kansan, Dec. 7, 2015.

One article analyzes the tariff schedules of every Islamic country in the world, and points out few such countries use the GATT Article XX(a) public morality exception to ban importation of products, such as alcohol and pork, the consumption of which the Sharia forbids. Like non-Islamic countries, most of them impose tariffs on these products, possibly for moral, secularist, legal, or economic reasons. Other areas of Bhala's research are the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) and Indian trade law and policy.

Background On March 1, 2003, then-undisputed light heavyweight champion Roy Jones Jr. picked up a historic victory over John Ruiz that made him the WBA heavyweight champion. Following this, Jones' WBC, IBF, IBA, NBA and WBF light heavyweight titles were vacated and Antonio Tarver met former WBC light- heavyweight champion Montell Griffin (the only man to hold a victory over Jones at that point) to determine who would become the new WBC and IBF light- heavyweight champion. Tarver dominated Griffin throughout the fight, winning all 12 rounds en route to a clearcut unanimous decision victory. Though it was not immediately known if Jones would continue to fight at heavyweight or return to the light heavyweight division, Jones ultimately decided to return to light heavyweight and challenge Tarver, who had called Jones out following his victory over Ruiz at the post-fight press conference.Roy Jones Jr. out for vengeance against Tarver, Las Vegas Sun article, 2003-09-25, Retrieved on 2013-11-14 Originally, the bout was to be contested for both the WBC and IBF belts that Tarver held, but Tarver vacated the IBF title only a week before the match was to take place in anticipation that he would be unable to make a mandatory defense of the title.Jones concedes, will let Tarver enter ring last, USA Today article, 2003-11-05, Retrieved on 2013-11-14 Prior to the fight, there was controversy as to who would enter the ring and be introduced last. Tarver was officially the WBC light-heavyweight champion and tradition called for the champion to both enter the ring and be introduced last (a notable exception to this tradition had been the Larry Holmes‚ÄìGerry Cooney fight in 1982). Jones had his own titles and had not been beaten for the WBC title that Tarver now held, while Jones was still recognized as The Ring light-heavyweight champion, and he insisted that he be allowed to enter the ring last. However, Tarver refused to budge and the Nevada Athletic Commission stepped in and ordered the conflict be settled with a coin flip. When the time for the flip came, Jones relented and announced that he would allow Tarver to enter last.Jones concedes, will let Tarver enter ring last, USA Today article, 2003-11-05, Retrieved on 2013-11-14 The Fight Jones appeared weakened and slower after dropping a significant amount of weight in order to get back down to the 175 pound light heavyweight limit, while Tarver performed a lot better than most people expected, but Jones was nevertheless able to pick up a disputed majority decision victory. Although Tarver landed more punches than Jones, Jones landed a higher percentage of his punches. Tarver landed 175 of his 506 thrown punches for a 35% success rate, while Jones landed 167 of his 406 thrown punches for a 41% success rate. It was Jones who landed the more power punches, landing 94 of his 252 power punches thrown (37%), while Tarver landed 73 of his 255 power punches thrown (29%). By the latter part of the fight, Tarver had done noticeable damage to Jones' face as his left eye was swelled and he was bleeding from the nose. The fight then went to the judges' scorecards. One judge had the bout even at 114‚Äì114, but the other two judges had Jones clearly ahead with scores of 117‚Äì111 and 116‚Äì112. The Las Vegas crowd, thinking Tarver had done enough to win the fight, loudly booed after Michael Buffer announced the decision and chanted \\"bullshit\\" as Jones remained in the ring for his post-fight interview with Larry Merchant. Tarver also felt that he had defeated Jones and told Merchant \\"All you have to do is look at his face to know I won\\", while Jones told Merchant that Tarver was looking to steal rounds with well-timed flurries and that he (Jones) had landed the harder and cleaner shots, especially to the body. Unofficial HBO judge Harold Lederman scored the fight 116‚Äì112 for Jones, while the two BBC commentators John Rawling and Duke McKenzie had the fight respectively as a 114‚Äì114 draw and 115‚Äì113 for Tarver, with Rawling only having it a draw after giving Rounds 11 and 12 to Jones. Commenting on the judges' scorecards, Rawling said on commentary that he could understand 114‚Äì114, while calling the 116‚Äì112 and 117‚Äì111 scorecards for Jones a \\"complete disgrace\\", especially the 117‚Äì111.Jones's Reputation Takes Hit In Lackluster Victory for Title, N.Y.

Times article, 2003-11-10, Retrieved on 2013-11-16 Aftermath In his post-fight interview, Jones announced that the fight against Tarver would be his last fight at light-heavyweight and that he wanted to fight one more time at heavyweight with Mike Tyson as his opponent, and then retire. When questioned on what he would do if the fight against Tyson didn't happen, Jones said that he would retire straight away. As Jones was still the reigning WBA heavyweight champion, he had until February 20, 2004 to decide if he would return to heavyweight to defend the title. Ultimately, as the fight against Tyson fell through and with other options at heavyweight not being as attractive as he'd like, Jones decided to vacate the WBA heavyweight title and he eventually agreed to a rematch with Tarver at light-heavyweight, instead of retiring.

Internment Kimura and his family were interned in a War relocation center (or internment camp) during World War II, first at Tule Lake and later at Minidoka, due to their Japanese American heritage. Kimura was actually taken to the camp one day before his high school graduation.Northwest Asian Weekly, June 8: Taky Kimura, 85, graduates from high school, http://www.nwasianweekly.com/2009/07/june-8-taky-kimura-85-graduates-from- high-school/ Emerging from the internment camp after World War II, Kimura found himself to be downtrodden, broken down and lacking motivation. Because he was unable to graduate from high school due to being taken to the internment camp, and because his family had no money to pay for his college education, his family began to operate a supermarket store in Seattle, Washington. Bruce Lee and martial arts In his mid-thirties, during the year 1959, Kimura met a young, rising 18-year-old martial arts genius named Bruce Lee. Kimura joined Bruce's early kung-fu club where Lee taught Jun Fan Gung Fu, literally translating to Bruce Lee's Kung Fu and his version of Wing Chun, Kimura became Lee's student, assistant and at that time, his \\"best friend.\\" Together, they practiced, sparred, trained, and then founded Lee's first kung fu club (the Lee Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute) renting a small basement room with a half door entry from 8th Street in Seattle's Chinatown, where he became Lee's first Assistant Instructor.Bruce Lee Biography, Kimura was also the best man to Bruce Lee at Bruce's wedding to Linda Emery. Kimura is one of only three individuals to be personally certified by Lee to teach his martial arts, which include Jun Fan Gung Fu and Jeet Kune Do. The other two are Dan Inosanto and James Yimm Lee (no relation to Bruce Lee). After Bruce Lee's death on July 20, 1973, Kimura was also one of six pallbearers at his funeral, the other five being: Dan Inosanto,Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Peter Chin and Robert Lee, Bruce's brother. Kimura currently holds a 7th rank in Jun Fan Gung Fu. After Kimura was certified, he was allowed to teach small classes under the mantra of \\"keep the numbers low, but the quality high\\". Appearances in films and documentaries Kimura appeared as an actor in Bruce Lee's final film, Game of Death (1973). Kimura was initially asked by Lee to play the role of the \\"Guardian of the Second Floor,\\" a master of the Praying mantis kung fu style.

In June 2013, it was announced that the operators of Luna Park at Coney Island, Zamperla, would construct a new steel roller coaster which would utilize the Thunderbolt name. Due to the small footprint required for the coaster, the original plans called for the coaster to use an elevator instead of a lift hill for the initial incline. Published reports stated that Thunderbolt was expected to be completed and opened by Memorial Day 2014. This date was delayed to early June 2014; revised to open by June 6. In early June, the opening date was once again delayed for later that summer. On June 14, 2014, the Thunderbolt was opened.

His discoveries and inventions include the first wireless communication channel model to accurately predict the performance of advanced antenna systems, the MIMO-OFDM technology used in contemporary Wi-Fi and 4G wireless networks and devices, higher accuracy radiation beam therapy for cancer treatment, improved 3D surgery imaging, and a cloud-based Network Functions Virtualization platform for mobile network operators that enables users to customize and modify their smartphone services. Biography Raleigh received a B.S.E.E. degree from the California Polytechnic State University, an M.S.E.E. degree from Stanford University, and a Ph.D. from Stanford University. He joined Watkins-Johnson Company in 1984 as a Radio Engineer and rose to Chief Scientist and Vice President of Research and Development. Raleigh subsequently co-founded five companies: Clarity Wireless, Airgo Networks, Headwater Research, ItsOn, and Chilko Capital. In wireless communications, Raleigh developed a comprehensive and precise channel model that works with multiple antennas. He employed the model to develop smart antenna signal processing techniques for rapid fading, multipath propagation, and frequency-division duplex environments. As a result of this research, Raleigh found that multipath propagation could be exploited to greatly increase the capacity of wireless communications, enabling data rates competitive with wire-based networks. In a paper prepared for the 1996 GLOBECOM conference in London, Raleigh presented the first rigorous mathematical proof that in the presence of naturally occurring multipath propagation multiple antennas may be used with special signal processing techniques to transmit multiple data streams at the same time on the same frequency, multiplying the information-carrying capacity (data rate) of wireless links. From the time of Guglielmo Marconi, multipath propagation had always been treated as a problem to be overcome. The discovery that multipath can be harnessed to increase performance reversed a century of radio engineering practice. In subsequent papers, Raleigh proposed a series of enhancements including the use of OFDM with MIMO and techniques for space- frequency coding, space-frequency-time channel estimation, and MIMO synchronization. These inventions were incorporated into the LTE, WiMAX, 802.11n and 802.11ac standards. Raleigh, V.K. Jones, and Michael Pollack founded Clarity Wireless in 1996. Clarity built a MIMO demonstration link and developed a related technology, vector orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (V-OFDM). Clarity Wireless was acquired by Cisco Systems in 1998. Raleigh, Jones, and David Johnson founded Airgo Networks in 2001 to develop MIMO-OFDM chipsets for wireless LANs. Airgo Networks proposed MIMO as the best technology for meeting the performance goals of next-generation wireless LANs and contributed to the development of the IEEE 802.11n standard. The company began shipping the world‚Äôs first MIMO-OFDM chipsets in 2003. While at Airgo Networks, Raleigh was named to Network World‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe 50 most powerful people in networking.‚Äù Airgo Networks was purchased by Qualcomm in 2006. Raleigh co- founded the technology innovation firm Headwater Research in late 2008 with Charles Giancarlo and became Lead Director of its board. Raleigh‚Äôs inventions at Headwater have spanned the wireless and medical device fields. The inventions include mobile device operating system enhancements, improvements to radiation beam therapy for cancer treatment, enhanced 3-D imaging systems for surgery, and cloud-based network function virtualization (NFV) advances. Mobile OS controls and NFV are now widely deployed. In late 2009, Raleigh and Giancarlo spun out ItsOn to license and commercialize wireless technology, with Raleigh serving as the firm‚Äôs first CEO. ItsOn developed a cloud-based network function virtualization (NFV) platform that enables operators to implement intelligent, user context-aware policies including the ability for users to customize and manage their mobile phone services. ItsOn‚Äôs service, called Zact, launched in May 2013. Raleigh holds more than 200 US patents and over 150 international patents in the fields of radio communications, medical devices, mobile device operating systems, radar systems, and mobile network function virtualization.

Van Valkenburg quickly raised a company of one hundred and eight men, who elected him as their captain. This company served at the front, but were returned home after the Battle of Antietam and relegated to a reserve force. The company was eventually called out again and were stationed in Carlisle, Pennsylvania the night before the Battle of Gettysburg. After this Van Valkenburg volunteered to become a chaplain of the pioneer corps, where he accompanied General Sherman on his march through Georgia.

Van Valkenburg then returned home to Owego for a short period of time, and that April moved to Colorado on account of his worsening health. It was there that he settled in the town now known as Erie, and the house that he built there was the town's first. It was in this house that Van Valkenburg hold Sunday-school to a small number of pupils in his dining room. In Erie Van Valkenburg held many positions and offices, among them a judge, a police magistrate, town postmater, mayor, school board president, and representative to the state legislature from Weld County. Van Valkenburg also notably established the Masonic Erie Lodge and Longmont Lodge, in addition to serving as the Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Colorado.

The guitar was notable because of its small rectangular wood body that had \\"outrigger\\" aluminum tubes running parallel to the body. Popularized by Howard Leese, then guitarist for Heart, it was one of the two main guitars used by John Lennon during the recording of Double Fantasy. Other notable players were Ian Hunter and Wes Beech of the Plasmatics. The Sardonyx was made by luthier Jeff Levin, who worked for Matt Umanov's Lower Manhattan's guitar store. The body is made of wood. Inside the top aluminum tube is a smaller tube to which the strap is attached; it slides in and out, allowing the player to balance the guitar. A basic and a more upscale model were available, with Leese, Lennon, and Hunter playing the latter. Its electronics were highly complex: the guitar had two output channels, and the player could, via a set of mini-toggle switches, direct the sound from each of two DiMarzio humbucker pickups to either of the channels, with pickups set in series, parallel, or out of phase with each other. Levin also made a bass version. Umanov estimates that maybe two dozen guitars were built. Years later, Earnie Bailey (former guitar technician for Kurt Cobain and the Foo Fighters), built some 30 guitars and basses based on the Sardonyx, sold mostly to collectors.

It was originally built for the U.S. Interior Department and served in the United States Coast Guard (USCG) before being acquired by the U.S. Navy. History The North Star was built in 1932 by Berg Shipbuilding Company in Seattle, Washington as a wooden cutter for the U.S. Department of the Interior and was commissioned by the Interior Department in 1932. She served as a support ship during the United States Antarctic Service Expedition from 1939 to 1941. She transported the unique Antarctic Snow Cruiser for the expedition and evacuated members of the expedition upon its conclusion early in 1941. She was commissioned as the USCGC North Star (WPG-59) on 15 May 1941 and served on the Northeast Greenland Patrol starting on 1 July 1941. Although the United States was not yet at war, the Navy was providing convoy escorts to protect American shipping in the North Atlantic from attacks by German U-boats. The Northeast Greenland Patrol, was organized at Boston and consisted of Coast Guard cutters and the venerable , as well as the North Star. The South Greenland Patrol, consisting of cutters , , and , along with the former US Coast & Geodetic Survey (USCGS) sailing schooner USS Bowdoin (IX-50) (commanded by legendary Arctic explorer Donald B. MacMillan) was consolidated with the Northeast Patrol by October 1941 and the consolidated unit was re- designated as the Greenland Patrol. The duties of the Greenland Patrol were varied - protecting convoy routes; ice breaking and passages were found through it for the Greenland convoys; escorting merchant ship; rescuing survivors of submarine attacks; construction and maintenance of aids to navigation; reporting of weather and ice conditions; and conducting air and surface patrols. North Star was involved with the capture, on 12 September 1941, of the supposedly neutral Norwegian trawler Buskoe, which was, in fact, serving the Germans by supporting German radio and weather stations in Greenland. The captured trawler and her crew and passengers were transported to Boston by Bear for internment. With the official entry of the United States into the war on 8 December 1941, North Star continued her service with the Greenland Patrol. She was especially useful in supporting east Greenland stations between 13 August and 23 September 1942. She was attacked by a German reconnaissance aircraft north of Jan Mayen Island on 23 July 1943. The plane withdrew from the engagement and trailed heavy black smoke as it disappeared over the horizon. North Star also investigated a German outpost at Sabine Island, East Greenland on 31 August. North Star was reclassified as IX-148 (Miscellaneous Unclassified) on 15 December 1943 and was decommissioned by the U.S. Coast Guard on 13 January 1944. She was transferred to the US Navy on 15 January and placed in reduced commission. She was decommissioned on 15 June 1945 at Seattle and returned to the Department of the Interior on 18 June 1945. She was struck from the U.S. Naval Register on 11 July 1945.

The Hornets, led by ninth year head coach Lewis Jackson, played their home games at the Dunn‚ÄìOliver Acadome as members of the Southwestern Athletic Conference. They finished the season 19‚Äì13, 12‚Äì6 in SWAC play to finish in a tie for second place. They advanced to the semifinals of the SWAC Tournament where they lost to Texas Southern. They were invited to the CollegeInsider.com Tournament where they lost in the first round to Sam Houston State. Season=Preseason Head coach Lewis Jackson released the team's complete season schedule on September 27, 2013. Road games at Illinois and Bradley as part of the Global Sports Invitational, as well as participation in the Tulane Classic, highlighted the non-conference schedule. Per usual, the SWAC conference slate included one home game and one away game against each of the nine other members of the conference. November On November 8, the Hornets traveled to Champaign, Illinois to take on the Illinois Fighting Illini, a participant in the 2013 NCAA Tournament. Jamel Waters scored 27 points, nearly half of the Hornets' total (63), but a weak defensive effort by Alabama State allowed the Illini to shoot 44% from the floor and attempt 30 free throws. The Hornets ultimately fell, 63‚Äì80. The Hornets continued their brief road trip on the 10th when they went south to Peoria, Illinois to play Missouri Valley Conference member Bradley. Waters led the Hornets again with 14 points, but another poor defensive effort allowed the Braves to shoot 59% from the field while limiting Alabama State to just 38%, leading to an 85‚Äì59 victory for Bradley. The Hornets returned home to the Dunn‚ÄìOliver Acadome on November 13 to take on NAIA member Mobile. The Hornets got out to a quick lead that would never be relinquished as they dominated their lower-level foes throughout, en route to an 88‚Äì58 victory. The Hornets' next test was a road game against in-state foe Jacksonville State on November 16. The Hornets, who made 32 of 39 free throw attempts, were led by 16 points from Waters. The win increased Alabama State's record to 2‚Äì2, while dropping the Gamecocks to 0‚Äì4. Alabama State returned home to the Dunn‚ÄìOliver Acadome on November 18 to take on the Cougars of Chicago State. The Cougars defeated the Hornets, 54‚Äì67, in Chicago in 2012. Alabama State hit several clutch free throws with 55 seconds left to hold off a 7‚Äì0 run by the Cougars to gain the win, 79‚Äì75, on the strength of DeMarcus Robinson's 24 points. December The Hornets visited nearby Troy, Alabama, on December 7 for their rivalry match-up with Troy. While Robinson added a team-high 19 points, Troy had three 16+ point scorers and rolled to an easy 85‚Äì69 victory, revenge for the Hornets' victory in Montgomery in 2012. Alabama State made a quick pit-stop at home on December 16 with a home date against Western Illinois before heading off to the Tulane Classic. Waters had 15 points and six assists to lead the Hornets to a 59‚Äì52 win.

New York: Routledge, 2010. Like most types of feminist ethics, feminist justice ethics looks at how gender is left out of mainstream ethical considerations. Mainstream ethics are argued to be male- oriented. However, feminist justice ethics does differ considerably from other feminist ethics. A universal set of ethics is a significant part of feminist justice ethics.Hutchings, Kimberley. \\"Ethics.\\" In Gender Matters in Global Politics, edited by Laura J Shepherd, 69. New York: Routledge, 2010. Feminist justice ethics is clear in dividing \\"thick\\" morality from \\"thin\\" morality. Other ethical approaches that define themselves by differentiating groups from one another through culture or other phenomena are regarded as \\"thick\\" accounts of morality. Feminist justice ethics claims that \\"thick\\" accounts of morality, as opposed to \\"thin\\" accounts of morality, are intrinsically prone to eroding valid feminist critique.  Overview  Feminist justice ethics is part of a range of feminist ethical perspectives. Other popular feminist approaches to ethics include feminist ethics of care, and feminist postmodern ethics. The implementation of a feminist ethic of care often draws critique from feminist justice ethics. Feminist ethics of care is premised by the idea that morality is shaped by relational versions of our self. Our moral relations take precedence. Feminist justice ethics differs itself from feminist ethics of care by chastising such a perspective for its abandonment of universal values. In feminist justice ethics, legitimate ethical critique cannot be made without utilizing a universal set of ethics.Hutchings, Kimberley. \\"Ethics.\\" In Gender Matters in Global Politics, edited by Laura J Shepherd, 67. New York: Routledge, 2010. Meanwhile, feminist postmodern ethics puts forth an entirely different view. A feminist postmodern perspective will perceive androcentricity in many aspects of life, including epistemology. At the same time feminist postmodernism will deny the existence of objectivity within our world. This claim is based on the notion that knowledge is subjectively constructed. One feminist postmodern scholar has implicated the ethical outcomes of modern business norms as a result of this masculine- dominated society. Friction between feminist justice ethics and feminist postmodern ethics exists on the principle of universality. The former supports the idea of universal values, while the latter denies such values exist because it denies objectivity. Since a universal view on morality is typical in feminist justice ethics, the question arises: what specific values are actually universal? Nussbaum's capabilities approach attempts to tackle this question, and lists several traits she believes to be universal: # Life ‚Äì ability to live out a natural lifespan; # Bodily Health ‚Äì ability to have good health including reproductive health, adequate nourishment, shelter; # Bodily Integrity ‚Äì freedom of movement, security from physical violation, sexual and reproductive autonomy; # Senses, Imagination and Thought ‚Äì ability to use all of these fully in an educated way; # Emotions ‚Äì ability to be able to be attached to others, to have a capacity for love and affection; # Practical Reason ‚Äì to be able to reflect rationally, identify one's own conception of the good life and plan for it; # Affiliation ‚Äì ability to live with others in personal relationships and social communities; # Other Species ‚Äì ability to live in relation to nature; # Play ‚Äì ability to enjoy recreation; # Control over one's material and political environment ‚Äì ability to participate in political choices, ability to hold property, to work on equal terms with others.  Criticisms =Feminist ethics of care Feminist ethics of care disagrees with feminist justice ethics on some issues. Feminist ethics of care critiques feminist justice ethics with the claim that by lumping women into universal categories of being, the emphasis on distinct virtues that may be held primarily by women is lost. This loss of emphasis leads back to the masculine norms that feminist ethics are attempting to critique. Feminist postmodern ethics Feminist postmodern ethics may cite a number of factors. One source of concern would be the universality that is presented by many feminist justice ethicists. Feminist postmodern ethics is heavily reliant on deconstructing society and critiquing objectivity. Another point of concern regarding Nussbaum's argument in particular is that feminist justice ethics may ignore women who do not belong to Western cultures. By assuming ethics from a Western point of view, other views on ethics may be lost or seen as inferior.Hutchings, Kimberley. \\"Ethics.\\" In Gender Matters in Global Politics, edited by Laura J Shepherd, 69-70.

A year later, Elio was deposed by the new viceroy, Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros. Michelena was in Buenos Aires when the May Revolution broke out, and had accompanied to the General Joaquin de Soria to Montevideo. In an act of stupidity that will cost you dearly, the Primera Junta did not try to prevent who Soria, carry the naval fleet with him toward Montevideo, where they formed the most powerful realist centre. Michelena had helped disarm the revolutionary attempt engineered by Colonel Prudencio Murguiondo in the Banda Oriental.

When the Uruguayans took up arms early in the next year, Michelena could not prevent the sending reinforcements by the patriots porte√±os, but at least greatly delayed their progress.

Retired from active duty, Michelena established his residence in the town of Puerto Real. At the entrance of the French troops to the port of Cadiz, he put himself in command of Count Bordesoulle, who designates it to integrate the Navy of Sanl√∫car. In 1823, Juan √Ångel Michelena served to the orders of Guy-Victor Duperr√©, participating in the bombing against the port of C√°diz, in order to reinstate the regime of Ferdinand VII of Spain.

After receiving regular gigs at a theater disco lounge, the band was then joined by Dana's half brother, singer Max Surin with four other technical members. A year after their formation, Tokyo Square recorded a rendition of the song \\"Within You'll Remain\\" in 1985, a song originally performed by Hong Kong band Chyna, for the WEA Singapore compilation entitled Class Acts. Tokyo Square's version topped the charts in their home country and Thailand. Popularity of Tokyo Square is not confined to Singapore, as they have developed a following in many other Asian countries and also internationally with \\"Within You'll Remain\\" becoming a substantial radio hit in many other Southeast Asian countries throughout 1985 and 1986. History In 1984, Tokyo Square was first formed by lead singer Linda Elizabeth Dana and guitarist Peter Han in Singapore. The group started out as a cover band with regular gigs at Rainbow Lounge, Singapore's first theatre disco lounge. Dana's half brother, singer Max Surin, and four other members later joined the group, including: saxophonist Henry Pereira, drummer Tony Fonseca, keyboardist Clarence Tan and bassist Peter Idil. Being the band leader and also the only female member of group, Dana sees herself as \\"the mama of the family.\\" The success of \\"Within You'll Remain\\" \\"Within You'll Remain\\" was said to help set a high standard in the Singapore's recording quality and in terms of sales as well. In 1985, they recorded a rendition of \\"Within You'll Remain\\", a song written by Donald Ashley for his Hong Kong band Chyna, originally released in 1983. It was chosen and produced by Singaporean band The Quests member, the late producer-guitarist Reggie Verghese. Verghese was specifically looking for a song which sounded ethnic because he thought it would do well in the Singapore market. By adding their own \\"twist\\" to the original, the new version contains a guzheng opening riff with its mix of Oriental and Western instrumentation. \\"We just played around with it,\\" said bassist Peter Eidill. \\"We added in guitar, we added in drums, a bit of percussion and then I fooled around with a funky bass line.\\" \\"Within You'll Remain\\" and a new track called \\"Silent Talk\\", produced by Ken Lim, were later added to the WEA Singapore-released compilation called Class Acts, features works by home-grown bands like Gingerbread, Heritage, Zircon Lounge, and Speedway. At first, \\"Within You'll Remain\\" did not receive much airplay in Singapore when it was released. According to Surin, it was only after it topped Bangkok pop charts in January 1986 that the song became an \\"earworm\\" among the Singapore audience. Furthermore, it was so popular in their hometown that it remained on cable radio Rediffusion top 10 list for five straight weeks. The compilation then sold 23,000 copies within the three months of its release and is said to have gone Platinum with 500,000 units over the years. \\"We were shocked ourselves,\\" said Dana. \\"Never did we think that it could be the one-hit wonder that it is.\\" Keyboardist Gavin Cardozar found the song's melody to be very catchy: \\"From a two-year-old to a 90-year-old, they liked it. Everybody just liked it.\\" Singaporean music producer Leonard Soosay also thought their version was \\"a beautiful adaptation\\", stating: \\"They made it even better because they introduced elements of pop into it and it became more radio-friendly.\\" Singaporean publication The Straits Times claimed the track helped set a high standard in the country's recording quality and in terms of sales as well. \\"The media did a lot for [the album]. The Singapore Broadcasting Corporation was responsible for making \\"Within You'll Remain\\" a hit by playing all the time,\\" Surin commented. In 1986, Tokyo Square became the first rock group to perform in front of 50,000 people before Singapore National Day Parade occurs. Thanks to the success of the track, the band found themselves inundated with requests to play it every night when they were performing at Rainbow Lounge. They performed the song during television appearances and Surin remembers singing it from the top of a cherry picker at the monthly Orchard Road Street Party in the 1980s. On 9 August 1986, Tokyo Square became the first rock group been featured before the parade of Singapore National Day Parade. The band performed \\"Within You'll Remain\\" and changed the lyrics in the chorus to \\"Wo ai ni, Singapore,\\" which means \\"I Love You, Singapore\\" in Mandarin. \\"It was unbelievable. 50,000 people were singing to the chorus,\\" Cardoza recalls. \\"Everybody knew the chorus, it's so catchy.\\" During this time, \\"Within You'll Remain\\" was said to be a hit across many countries in Asia. Line-up changes and Surin's solo career Dana recalls the times after the success of the song: \\"There was no fortune, only fame.\\" Surin adds: \\"Each of us received the first one or two cheques and then, no more. It's not that the recording company didn't pay Tokyo Square... The fault was within the band.\\" It turned out that the contract between the band and the recording company had been signed by only one person and was not countersigned by the other members, so the signatory was not legally bound to distribute payment to the rest of the band members. \\"We were naive. We were too eager to cut our first song,\\" he says, adding that \\"the debacle is water under the bridge.\\" \\"I didn't take it personally. The album gave us a big break and helped my career. Instead of condemning this person, I should be thankful.\\" On 19 August 1986, they released two new tracks called \\"Oriental City\\" and \\"Without Your Love\\" in the second Class Acts album. After this, Surin and Dana appears on the compilation called Canton Rock, which was a collection of Cantonese tracks translated to English and \\"rocked up\\" to widen marketability. In December 1986, it was reported that Surin, Tony Fonseca and Peter Han had disbanded to form another pop-rock group, furthermore, their popularity also suffered at the time because they failed to produce another successful track like \\"Within You'll Remain\\". Dana later set about getting new members who \\"got to shape\\" pretty quickly. The group spent two years playing in Japan at the Rosemarie Club at Roppongi, Minato, Tokyo and Nanja Munja Club in Nagoya. Surin's relationship with the band was reportedly \\"strained and frayed\\" during this time. The band then extended only to a gig-to-gig basis. Surin stated: \\"I laid down terms to the band about this solo thing. There won't be any clashes.\\" However, he added: \\"I need Tokyo Square for night-club work.\\" The Government of Singapore then asked Surin to contribute his vocal in three public campaigns including the Singapore Air Force, a then-newly set-up kidney foundation and a song with the message of \\"The best that we can be\\". In 1987, Surin released his first solo album called True Words which features cover versions of hit songs from the America, Japan, (Germany), Indonesia with some original tracks. \\"The album also gave me a chance to prove myself. With it, I can do shows apart from Tokyo Square,\\" he said. After Surin struck out on his own with Ken Lim as his producer in early 1987, he continued recording different versions of the hit on his solo albums so as to gain recognition among his audience, which spanned different markets across Southeast Asia. \\"We had a techno version, a ballad version, a rock version and a Thai ethnic version. We replaced ‚ÄòI love you‚Äô in the chorus with ‚Äòchan rak kun‚Äô,\\" he says. He rejoined Tokyo Square in the same year. In 1993, John Choo, the band's former keyboardist, made headlines when he died of methanol poisoning at a drug rehabilitation center. Recent projects The group are still asked to perform \\"Within You‚Äôll Remain\\" at reunion gigs. At the Celebrate SG50 New Year countdown show at The Float at Marina Bay, Surin and Dana with helps from John Molina and Ann Hussein, performed \\"Within You‚Äôll Remain\\" at the concert. To celebrate SG50, Channel NewsAsia special national day series Reunions reunites former members of Tokyo Square on 3 August 2015. In May 2016, Warner Music Singapore released new remastered versions of two albums Class Acts and Class Acts 2.

It was built by Perry Oceanographic, Inc., of Riviera Beach, Florida, United States,The Telegraph (London), \\"Billionaire Elon Musk admits he bought James Bond's submarine car\\", Chris Irvine, 18 October 2013 (accessed 2013-11-13) specifically for the film, using a Lotus Esprit S1 bodyshell, for about $100,000 at the time. The wedge shape of the Esprit is designed to provide downforce, which would cause the submarine to dive. This undesirable force was compensated for by fins placed where the wheels would be in a conventional Esprit. The sub requires a crew of two to operate. It has four electric motors that allowed forward motion only. The interior bears no resemblance to that of a car, being just a platform for the scuba divers, and the equipment used to operate, drive, and power the sub.  Filming  During filming of \\"The Spy Who Loved Me\\", the submarine was piloted by ex-U.S. Navy SEAL Don Griffin. The fictional history of the car in the film was that it was developed by Q-Branch of MI6, and its blueprints were stolen by KGB agent Anya Amasova (after Bond asked Amasova \\"How did you know about that?\\" Amasova replied, \\"I stole the blueprints of this car two years ago\\"). In filming, six Esprits were used (tagged \\"PPW 306R\\"), though only one submarine. Three of the Esprits were just empty bodyshells which were used to show each phase of the car-to-submarine transformation. Two unpowered dummy cars fitted with wheels were used to show the Esprit entering and emerging from the sea; the first was designed to be fired from an air cannon off the end of the pier, the second was towed by a rope buried under the beach with a sweeping brush fitted to the underside to cover the rope up as the car was tugged out. When an additional road car was needed for the chase sequences the producers borrowed Lotus chairman Colin Chapman's personal vehicle.  Post-film life  Upon completion of filming, the submarine went on a promotional tour. Afterwards, it was shipped to Long Island, New York, and placed in storage. The storage unit was prepaid for 10 years; at the end of the lease, no one claimed the contents, so the contents of the storage locker were placed on auction. The buyer paid less than $100 for the unit. The buyers did not know the contents when they bought it, and from 1989 to 2013 occasionally exhibited the submarine. The then owner, also owner of a tool rental shop, had the exterior restored.

Z_0^{}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty}\\\\frac{dz}{c}e^{-i\\\\omega z/c}W_0^'(z) From this expression and the fact that the wake function is real, one can derive the property: Z^{*}(\\\\omega) = Z^{}(-\\\\omega) Important sources of impedance The impedance is defined at all positions along the beam trajectory. The beam travels through a vacuum chamber. Substantial impedance is generated in transitions, where the shape of the beam pipe changes. The RF cavities are another important source. Impedance models In the absence of detailed geometric modeling, one can use various models to represent different aspects of the accelerator beam pipe structure. One such model is the Broadband resonator For the longitudinal case, one has Z_{}(\\\\omega) = R_s \\\\frac{1-i Q(\\\\frac{\\\\omega_r}{\\\\omega}-\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{\\\\omega_r})}{1+Q^2\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\omega_r}{\\\\omega}-\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{\\\\omega_r}\\\\right)^2} with R_s the shunt impedance, Q, the quality factor, and \\\\omega_r the resonant frequency.

In general, impedance effects are classified under the category of \\"collective effects\\" due to the fact that the whole beam must be considered together, and not just a single particle. The whole beam may, however, cause particular changes in the dynamics of individual particles such as tune shifts and coupling. Whole beam changes include emittance growth and instabilities that can lead to beam loss.

It began in the 1990, principally in France. Its practitioners see it as a transdisciplinary movement, dispensing with the movement vocabulary of traditional dance to integrate or substitute that of other performing arts (theater, video, music, and plastic arts).  History  Most of the choreographers who developed non-dance came from the milieu of nouvelle danse fran√ßaise (also known as jeune danse fran√ßaise: \\"new\\" or \\"young\\" French dance) in which they participated as performers in the 1980s. They became choreographers in the 1990s, their work focusing increasingly on creating pieces where dance and dance movement disappear in favor of many other activities or theatrical techniques, including legitimate theater, lectures, plastic arts, music, and often video, film, or projections.Rosita Boisseau, Dans beaucoup de spectacles de danse, on ne danse plus, Le Monde, 25 April 2009 The resulting performances are akin to performance art; in some cases, dancers as such are not even necessary to the execution of the work: the choreographer-author speaking through other media and sometimes in places not originally intended for dance performances, such as museums.Danse ou non- danse: par o√π la danse? on the official site of the Centre Pompidou The precursor to this movement is Orazio Massaro (a dancer in the company of Dominique Bagouet from 1987 to 1990), who created the piece Volare for the Montpellier Dance Festival in 1990. In that piece, for the first time in the history of French contemporary dance, six dancers were deprived of choreography and become actors, in a critical look at dance through their autobiographical stories. Major choreographers associated with non-dance include Boris Charmatz, J√©r√¥me Bel, Herv√© Robbe, Xavier Le Roy, Alain Buffard, Beno√Æt Lachambre, Josef Nadj, Maguy Marin (in her recent pieces), Carlotta Sagna, Vahram Zaryan (in his recent mime and dance performances) and Wayn Traub.

J. Brill,1908-13 Description (Original description by M. Schepman) The height of the shell attains 9.5 mm, its diameter 11.5 mm. The rather thin shell has a depressed-conoidal shape. Its upper whorls are nacreous, with a very beautiful purple and green tinge, the last whorls whitish, adorned on the upper surface by rather broad, olivaceous streaks. The shell contains six whorls. The nucleus is smooth, followed by a 2nd and 3rd whorl, each with 6 spiral lirae of which the upper ones are slightly undulate. On the fourth whorl the lirae disappear, only the 'upper one remains and becomes beaded. It borders the broadly canaliculated suture, which in this and in the fifth whorl, is crossed by conspicuous striae, which run partly also on the convex, smooth, lower part of these whorls. Near the body whorl the beads disappear, the suture becomes less broad and deep. This body whorl is nearly smooth, except for most tender spiral and radiating striae, only visible under magnification, and a few remote deeper striae near the suture, being the continuation of the beads. It is strongly depressed, more convex above than below, with a blunt angle, but no keel. The umbilicus is funnel-shaped, moderately wide and pervious. Its walls are smooth, with only a few growth striae. It is bordered by a spiral ridge, which is indistinctly beaded. The aperture is rounded-triangular. The upper and basal margins are regularly rounded, the upper one being more curved. The columellar margin is nearly straight, slightly expanded at its upper end above the umbilicus, thickened below and forming a distinct angle with the basal margin, largely due to the ending of the umbilical ridge. Interior of aperture strongly iridescent. The thin operculum is corneous, with many whorls (about 10). The outer surface is hollow, with irregular, radiating striae, which are more numerous and regular near the sutural line. The inner surface is convex, and very smooth. The radula has about 26 rows of teeth and 7 median rows, with a large number of uncini. The rhachidian tooth has a subquadrate body with winged sides and a long triangular cusp with convex sides, which are serrated. The body of the first lateral is nearly quadrate, with a broad triangular cusp, serrated on the distal and part of the proximal margin. The second lateral is oblong and serrated like the first one. The third lateral has a quadrangular body, with a simple cusp. The fourth lateral is very large, its body irregular, its cusp long, serrated on both sides, but this is only visible on the upper side in its normal position. The uncini, the number of which I cannot ascertain, are long, slender, and apparently smooth, though in some of them, a few very small denticles are present, but they are only visible in an expanded position. The bodies of the median teeth are brown especially towards the centre. Distribution This marine species occurs in the Celebes Sea. References * Vilvens C. (2009).

The Tax Cut Now line gave Pataki a third ballot line, along with the Republican and Conservative Party of New York lines. Tax Cut Now was run in Albany, New York by the state Republican leadership. The ballot line was open only to Republican candidates, and its endorsements were identical to the Republican ballot line. Because the line drew more than 50,000 votes in the election, which Pataki won, it became eligible to run candidates for the next four years.

The episode was written by Caroline Dries and Holly Brix and directed by Jeffrey Hunt. Nina Dobrev received positive reviews about her portrayal of three different characters, Elena, Katherine and Amara. Plot Silas (Paul Wesley) is a mortal witch again and now he cannot wait to die so he can be with his one true love again. In order to do that, he has to first destroy the Other Side that Qetsiyah (Janina Gavankar) created to trap deceased supernatural beings. He has to destroy it so he will not get trapped there when he dies. He explains to Damon (Ian Somerhalder) and Elena (Nina Dobrev) that to do that, they have to first find the anchor that Qetsiyah bonded to the Other Side and destroy it and that this anchor is in New Jersey. Silas, Damon and Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) leave for New Jersey while Elena stays behind since Silas does not want her with them. Before they go, Elena makes sure to remind Silas that he has to bring Bonnie (Kat Graham) back to life before he dies and he promises that he will. Stefan wakes up at Tessa's cabin and seems confused. Tessa explains to him what happened and also tells him that he had a text she could not resist reading, and from it she knows Silas is mortal again and she can finally kill him. Tessa reminds Stefan that Silas knows where the anchor is due to his mind reading power so she has to kill him before he tries to destroy it. But when she tries to leave the cabin she cannot because Silas cast a spell on it. Tessa and Stefan are trapped in the cabin until the sundown. Elena does not know where Stefan is and tries to find him. She keeps calling him until Tessa answers his phone while he is in another room. Tessa tells Elena she slept with Stefan. Elena does not understand why Stefan prefers to be with Tessa, and Damon is forced to tell her what he and Silas did to him in order Silas get his power back so he can read Tessa's mind. Elena decides to go to Tessa‚Äôs house to check up on Stefan and when she walks through the front door she also falls victim to the spell. Silas, Damon and Jeremy arrive in New Jersey and start searching for the anchor but Silas does not know exactly where it is or what it looks like. While they are searching, Tessa calls Damon and demands he kill Silas before Silas can destroy the anchor, otherwise she will kill Elena. Damon, even though he promised Elena to bring Bonnie back, decides to do what Tessa asks of him so Elena won‚Äôt die. On his way to do it, Damon is attacked by two travelers who tell him they don‚Äôt want him to kill Silas yet. Damon kills both of them, then calls Tessa back to ask why the travelers would stop him since they hate Silas. Tessa tells him they want Silas because he is the only source of the cure now, and reveals to him that the anchor is not an object but a person - a person Silas won‚Äôt be able to hurt. Silas finds the anchor and is surprised to discover it is his true love, Amara, as he had believed she was dead. Qetsiyah had imprisoned her in stone for 2,000 years. He feeds her blood, to awaken her. As she revives, Amara is confused how he is still alive. He explains everything to her and when Amara hears that Silas took the cure, she stabs him and drains him because she does not want to live one more day. Damon finds Amara alone and confused and when he realizes that she is not immortal anymore, he captures her and takes her back to the Salvatore house to protect her, since she is the one thing keeping the Other Side - and Bonnie - existing. If Amara dies, the Other Side will be destroyed and Bonnie will never come back to life. Back in the cabin, Stefan is trying to cook something and he is very cozy with Tessa despite Elena's presence. Elena cannot understand why Stefan is acting that way. Stefan, in a moment where Tessa is not close enough to hear him, tells Elena he is trying to help her and he will not let Tessa kill her. He stabs Tessa at sundown and he and Elena manage to escape and return home. Damon and Jeremy are there too and Damon tells Elena and Jeremy that they have to protect Amara from now on. In the meantime, Katherine celebrates the fact that she is still alive, when she is surprised to discover a gray lock of hair. She does not know where to go for help since Damon does not want her and Stefan does not remember her, so she goes to Elena and Caroline's dorm room. Caroline (Candice Accola) is packing to leave when she realizes that the woman she is talking to is not Elena but Katherine. Katherine offers to help her discover what the professor is doing in exchange for letting her stay with her. They go to Maxfield's (Rick Cosnett) laboratory, tie him to a chair and start draining him to get the vervain out of his system. Once they can compel him, Maxfield tells them of a secret society on campus, and how the members were going to invite Elena to be a member until they began to suspect she was a vampire. Maxfield does not realize he is talking to Katherine and not Elena who tells Caroline it won't be very difficult to prove that Elena is not a vampire. Katherine shows up to the society party and enters the house without an invitation. This convinces the society members that Elena is not a vampire. Katherine sees Aaron (Shaun Sipos) there and while they are talking, she loses one of her teeth. She does not know what is happening to her and leaves the party immediately. Back at the laboratory, Caroline compels Maxfield to tell her about the secret society and why he covered Megan's death. He reveals that the name of the society is ‚ÄúAugustine‚Äù and that he covered the real reason of Megan's death because the vampire who killed her was Augustine. Before Caroline gets the chance to ask for more details, a member of the society knocks on the door. Caroline compels Maxfield to forget everything that happened over the last few hours and that she and Elena are vampires. Later, when Maxfield is alone, Katherine comes back and reveals to him that she is not Elena and asks for his help. She wants him to help her discover what is happening to her because she believes she is dying and she wants him to stop it; if he will not help her then she‚Äôll reveal to the whole campus what he has been doing in his laboratory (experimenting on vampires). The episode ends with Tessa and Stefan, where Tessa gives Stefan all his memories back to make him suffer after he betrayed her to help Elena.

The museum is currently located in the Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Gardens, Banarasi Bagh, Lucknow. The museum was established in 1863 from the collection of Colonel Abbot, and was given the status of ‚ÄòProvincial Museum‚Äô before being renamed the ‚ÄòState Museum‚Äô in 1950. The collection housed in the museum consists of objects from the prehistoric period, bronze age, plaster casts of famous figurines from the Indus Valley Civilization, as well as a rich collection of numismatics, paintings, manuscripts and textiles.  History  The museum began in 1863 with a collection of artifacts that were housed in the building of the Choti Chattar Manzil in Qaisar Bagh by the then commissioner of Lucknow, Colonel Abbott. This repository functioned as a municipal institution in its early days until 1883, when it was given the status of a ‚ÄòProvincial Museum‚Äô. The museum was shifted to a larger space in the erstwhile coronation hall of the Nawabs of Awadh, Lal Baradari in June, 1884. Building of the Choti Chattar Manzil, initial location of the Lucknow Provincial Museum. A special Archeological section for the museum was established in 1909 in the premises of the old Canning College in Qaiser Bagh. The museum was formally organized in the same year with the constitution of a Management Committee. Some important figures who also contributed to the formation of the museum from the colonial period include Mr. A.O. Hume, who was an important member of the management committee. In 1867 the first superintendent of the museum was Emanuel Bonavia, a surgeon. The first curator of the museum, archeologist Dr. A.A. Fuhrer was appointed on 30 March 1885. Fuhrer‚Äôs expertise and interest in the field of archeology was reflected in his first contribution to the collection of the museum, excavation at Kankali Mound at Mathura in three consecutive periods‚Äî 1888-89, 1889-90 and 1890-91. All the excavated antiquities recovered from the site were relocated to the erstwhile Provincial Museum. The museum undertook other important excavations including one at Ahichchatra in 1891-92, the 1912-12 at Kasia and subsequent excavations at Indor Khera, Sankisa, Unchgaon and Astabhuja. These excavations and subsequent collections from the same contributed to the important Archeological section of the museum. The museum was renamed the ‚ÄòState Museum‚Äô in 1950, with an expanded collection that necessitated better organization and a separate space. The museum was eventually shifted to an independent building in Banarasibagh. The building is located in the middle of the Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Gardens (formerly the Prince of Wales Zoological Gardens) and the new museum premises were inaugurated by the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in 1963.  Collection  Kumaragupta\\", hence 448 CE, is an important chronological marker for Gupta art. Mankuwar, District of Allahabad. Lucknow Museum.Mookerji, 143 The museum has a varied collection ranging from archeological to painting and a rich numismatic collection. These items are housed in specialized galleries based on the type of collection and display a select few objects. The history of the museum is rooted in practices of colonial collecting, with the vast number of archeological expeditions that had been undertaken by the museum corresponding to the primary collection of the institution. The archeological gallery therefore becomes an important part of the museum and is highlighted as a result of it being a primary and vast collection.  Archeological Collection  The archeological collection is considered to be the central most in the museum. It consists of antiquities from the prehistoric period, the bronze age, plaster casts of famous figurines from the Indus Valley, clay seals, inscriptions, pottery and other miscellaneous objects including bricks and weights. This collection is divided into two galleries, with the first containing early, medieval and late stone age implements from the Uttar Pradesh and Sindh area. The first archeological gallery includes objects of the Bronze Age from the Doab area, Mathura grey schist sculptures and friezes as well as sandstone sculptures, sculptures from the Mauryan dynasty and Sunga dynasty, Kushana period terracotta sculptures, terracottas from the Gupta period with significant objects being the inscribed clay tablets of Shravasti and Bhitargaon. The second archeological gallery includes Buddhist sculptures, narrative friezes, decapitated images of Bodhisattva, and an inscription bearing Buddhist sculpture from Shravasti. It displays examples of Gandharan art, such as a frieze of Buddha giving a sermon, and the head of Buddha. The gallery also houses images of Hindu gods such as Lakshmi and Shiva. It houses art of the medieval period including Pala art, as well as the Gajalakshmi from Bhitri, Durga from Sultanpur, Avalokiteshvara seated on a lion. Dr. N.P Joshi highlights the brahmanical sculptures in the museum in a two volume work and their importance in studying iconographic representations. Joshi was also the former director of the Museum in the 1970‚Äôs and uses this expertise and access to write two academically significant volumes specifically detailing the sculptural works of the museum. The museum guide mentions a reserve collection of stone and terracotta images, plaster casts, copper plates and royal inscriptions. The reserve collection houses some important and notable items including the Bhitri seal, Hadaha inscription, as well as more than four hundred metal sculptures with Jain, Buddhist and Hindu affiliations. These objects, however, are part of the museum collection but not regularly displayed in the museum.  Numismatics  The State Museum also contains the Uttar Pradesh Coin Committee‚Äôs headquarters, and the director of the museum is the ex-officio secretary of this committee. Therefore, the museum collection houses a vast number of coins, with most of them in the reserve collection. The collection is divided into three chronological sections‚Äî the first section containing coins between the 8th century BC to 2nd century AD, the second containing coins from the Mughal period and the last section displaying military medals awarded to British soldiers sent on missions. Coins from Panchal, Ayodhya as well as Indo-Greek kingdoms along with Indo-Parthian, Kushana and Gupta coins can be found in this collection. Coins from the Dutch East India Company, the British East India Company and the Provincial states of Awadh and Garhwal are part of this collection.  Paintings  The museum contains a large number of miniatures and paintings from various schools of the early medieval period. Some notable objects include a Jain Kalpasutra manuscript from the 15th - 16th centuries, Mughal miniature paintings bearing court and battle scenes, Pahari miniatures, Tangka and Tanjore paintings. The manuscript collection of the museum includes notable objects such as the 1593 Padmavat written by Jayasi and an Akbari period Harivamsa.  Weapons, Decorative Arts and Musical Instruments  Decorative arts are included separately in the Awadh gallery and are housed in the museum collection with objects including Jade items, wooden cabinets, embroidered or jewel encrusted garments and jewelry. Weapons housed in the museum‚Äôs collection include objects from the 16th to the 19th centuries including guns, canons, bow and arrow sets. The musical instruments is a relatively small collection with string instruments such as the veena, sarangi and muraina as well as percussion instruments like tabla, dholak, nagara and damroo, and wind instruments including the flute, conch shell and algoza.  The Awadh Gallery  This gallery houses items from the culturally unique phase that had been introduced during the reign of nawabs in Lucknow. The gallery is a precipitate of a temporary exhibition from 1985, and houses cultural objects from the area produced during the rule of Nawab Asif-ud-Daula and his successors. This section includes Bidri work objects such as hookah, spittoon, boxes and plates, gold and silver inlay works, ivory carving, glass work and samples of Chikan and Jamdani work.This section also includes miniature paintings from the Awadh school and oil paintings.

The Deputy Directors also function as members of the Academic branch because of their qualification as scholars, different from officials in the administrative branch. The deputy directors are in charge of museum collection, its expansion, rotation of exhibits and special programs of the museum. The Academic branch is located in the museum premises itself, allowing for those in charge to be in proximity to the museum‚Äôs collections as well as facilitating the day to day pedagogic functioning of the museum. The primary vision of the museum as defined by its academic branch is for educating the public. This goal of public oriented education drives the primary educational functions in the museum, including a highly popular annual Art Appreciation course where scholars are invited to lecture on different themes each year, often corresponding with the museum‚Äôs collections. The museum also organizes the V.S. Agarwala Memorial Lecture and the Director and Assistant Directors also impart lectures in the museum, although the art appreciation course enjoys a wider popularity and garners larger audiences in attendance. The museum‚Äôs primary function as imparting knowledge to the public around and about the collection it houses and preserves corresponds with their efforts to engage the public \\"from all walks of life\\" to participate in the same. The museum‚Äôs primary visitor, however, is the tourist or casual recreational visitor to the zoo premises, tying the role of this museum tightly with the recreational mode associated with a visit to a tourist attraction.  Facilities  The museum houses a library that is accessible on special request by scholars affiliated to educational institutions. The personal libraries of Prof. B.N. Puri and Dr. C.D. Chaterji are a part of the museum library. The Conservation Cell of the museum houses facilities of chemical treatment and restoration of stone, ceramic, terracotta, metal, wood, coins and ivory objects, The photographic library contains black and white and colour prints documenting objects in the museum. The publications counter of the museum contains catalogues and brochures of the museum, as well as research publications on specific collections. The auditorium of the museum is located on the ground floor, haring the capacity to house around two hundred people and its used most often to deliver lectures by scholars invited by the museum.

She was princess consort of Samtskhe as wife of Kaikhosro II Jaqeli (r. 1545‚Äì1573) and regent for her son Qvarqvare IV Jaqeli (r. 1573‚Äì1581). She played a leading role in a civil war that plagued Samtskhe from 1576 to 1578. After the Ottoman takeover of her principality, Dedisimedi retired to Kartli, leaving the government to her son, Manuchar II Jaqeli, who continued to rule as an Ottoman pasha.  Family background and name  Dedisimedi was born into the princely family of Mukhrani, the Mukhranbatoni, a collateral branch of the royal house of Kartli. The sources differ as to her parents. The 16th-century Chronicle of Meskhian Psalter as well as the 18th century Georgian historian Prince Vakhushti and a church inscription from Vale suggest that Dedisimedi's father was Bagrat, son of King Constantine II. In contrast, Vakhushti's contemporaneous editor of the Georgian Chronicles, Beri Egnatashvili, makes her, erroneously, daughter of Bagrat's son Ashotan and, hence, sister of Saint Ketevan the Martyr. As Egnatashvili claims, on her marriage into the Jaqeli family she was given the name Dedisimedi‚Äîliterally, \\"a mother's hope\\"‚Äîalready known in the family earlier: so was named a consort of Qvarqvare IV Jaqeli, who died in 1489. When relating events in her widowhood, one of the editions of the Georgian Chronicles refers to the dowager princess as \\"Deborah, formerly Dedisimedi\\". This gave rise to a hypothesis that, at some point of her life and probably after her husband's death in 1573, Dedisimedi might have become a nun under the name of Deborah. Many modern scholars such as K. Sharashenidze and Sh. Lomsadze have dismissed such a possibility on account of her energetic involvement in war and politics.  Marriage  Dedisimedi married Prince Kaikhosro II Jaqeli, a 22-year-old prince-atabag of Samtskhe, in 1545. Kaikhosro's rule over Samtskhe, one of the breakaway states of the Kingdom of Georgia, was marred by incessant Iranian‚ÄìOttoman rivalry over the territory, uneasy relations with neighboring Georgian polities, and internecine feuds. Installed through the Ottoman intervention, Kaikhosro ended up his reign, watching the western part of his principality being assimilated by the Ottomans and the eastern moiety‚Äîwhere he preferred to stay‚Äîbeing subjected to Iran. He died while visiting the court of Shah Tahmasp I at Qazvin in 1573. Not much is known about Dedisimedi's life during the turbulent years of Kaikhosro's rule. In a period of ascendancy of the Muslim empires, she patronized Christianity and rebuilt the Church of Theotokos of Vale in the years of 1561‚Äì1563. She is also credited to have been one of the authors of the Chronicle of the Meskhetian Psalter, a fragmented account of the 1561‚Äì1587 events in Samtskhe (Meskheti) attached to a Psalter manuscript.  Regency  The Caucasus in the 16th century. On the death of Kaikhosro, Qvarqvare IV, the eldest of his eight children with Dedisimedi, succeeded to the principate of Samtskhe. Since he was still young and inexperienced, the actual government of the country was taken over by Dedisimedi and the nobleman Varaza Shalikashvili, whose sister was a favorite wife in Shah Tahmasp's harem. In 1574, the Kakhetian nobleman Cholokashvili‚Äîin a quest to divert the shah's attention from the affairs of Kakheti‚Äîsuccessfully spread rumors to convince Dedisimedi of Shalikashvili's perfidy. The princess dowager‚Äîdescribed by the historian Vakhushti as imperious, jealous, and cruel‚Äîhad Shalikashvili murdered on charges of plotting with the Iranians. Shah Tahmasp reacted to the killing of his brother-in-law and ally by invading Samtskhe. Dedisimedi and her sons were put into flight to the mountains of Adjara and many of their castles were conferred on the murdered Shalikashvili's Islamized son, Kokola (Mahmud Khan). As the shah left, Dedisimedi was able to resume her reign, but an uprising and an attempt on Qvarqvare IV followed. From 1576 through 1578, civil war raged through eastern Samtskhe between the Jaqeli faction and the aristocratic opposition led by Kokola Shalikashvili, leaving towns such as Tmogvi in ruins. Dedisimedi was personally involved in fighting, directing operations at Queli and Tmogvi. Eventually, the Jaqeli prevailed, but the decimated country became an easy target for the powerful thrust of the Ottoman army under Lala Kara Mustafa Pasha's command in August 1578. The nobles of Samtskhe submitted after a token resistance and Lala Pasha made a common cause with Dedisimedi's more able and calculating son Manuchar, a co-regent with his mother. The Jaqeli accepted Ottoman suzerainty. Lala Pasha met Dedisimedi at her base at Okros Tsikhe (Altunkal'a) and politely made it clear that her elder sons should become Muslims. In 1579, both Qvarqvare and Manuchar repaired to Constantinople and the latter pompously converted to Islam under the name of Mustafa. Following Qvarqvare's death in 1581, Manuchar-Mustafa became an Ottoman governor of a reduced Samtskhe, that is, pasha of Childir. Dedisimedi left the Ottoman-occupied Samtskhe in 1585 and retired to Akhaldaba, in Kartli, where Manuchar, having revolted from the Ottoman authority, had also taken refuge. Early in 1586, Manuchar acceded to the Ottoman demands and sent Dedisimedi and her grandson, Kaikhosro's son, to Samtskhe. Thereafter, she disappears from the contemporary historical records, save for the Ottoman fiscal documents of 1595, listing the estates formerly belonging to her in Samtskhe.

It was published in the year 2012 by Grapevine India Publishers. It is set on the story of the 2011 Delhi High Court blasts. Though mentioned as a love story, it is more of a suspense thriller. There are seven characters mentioned in this book, with the main protagonist being Debashish (Deb), who hails from Bengal and is deeply scarred with haunting memories of the blast. The book has received average reviews from critics all over India.  Plot  The author starts off with memories of the blast day. Deb had survived the bomb attack that left eighty nine people injured and many people dead. He feels sick at home and could not help wipe away the evil memories of the day. He recites the tragic event repeatedly to Avantika, his girlfriend. Avantika loves him and also feels bad, but she tries her best to make him forget what had happened. Quoting from the book, Deb says, \\"It could have been me\\". Deb is said to work at a publishing house \\"that publishes trash novels\\". His co-worker is named as Shrey, who is addicted towards girls and cannot live without them. He finally recovers from it. He wants to seek redemption as he stood there, on the blast day, watching the victims die. He finds a diary while re-visiting the area, and the edge of the diary is burnt beyond recognition. He takes it home and reads it. The diary has \\"R.D\\" written on it. No name, or for that matter address, is provided. But Deb wants to return the diary to Ragini, who \\"R.D\\" loved. Most of the novel says us about the trio (Avantika, Shrey, Deb) and a girl named Tiya, travelling in an old car. They travel and the secrets come back to life. From Dehradun to Mumbai, the novel covers most of the Indian metropolitan cities. In the beginning of the novel we get to know about the trio's daily life. Shrey is reported to work at Grapevine India, and often goes out to \\"meet someone from the Times\\". Deb knows that Shrey is actually meeting new girls. It is also highlighted in the novel that Avantika, Deb's girlfriend, hates the company of Shrey's girlfriend Tiya. Tiya is said to be stupid and crazy. Deb doesn't reveal anything about the diary to anyone. He reads the diary and decides to find Ragini so she could know about R.D's true feelings. He plans a road trip with Shrey to Dehradun where R.D and his best friend were studying. They reach Dehradun where Deb goes to Imperial academy to search for R.D's best friend who was listed as an all rounder of that year. He finds his name is Piyush Makhija and an address of Haridwar. When he comes back to hotel he finds out that Tiya is crashing their trip and deeply misses Avantika. Next day they reach Haridwar, Avantika surprises Deb by coming their and spends time with him. She asks him what is he hiding from her and comes to know about the diary. She decides to join him in this journey to find Ragini. They go to the address only to find an abandoned house. They meet Piyush's father who gives them Piyush's contact and his office address in Bhopal. When they come back to the hotel they find out that Shrey and Tiya went on their separate road trip giving the reason that Tiya is not comfortable with Avantika's strict behaviour and views about drinking. Avantika gets upset about it and decides to return to Delhi. While Deb was waiting for her she changed her mind and abandoned her heavy luggage signifying that she is going to be the carefree Avantika during this road trip. They go to Bhopal in search of Piyush. They meet him and finds 'the dead guy's' name, Ritam Dey. Piyush informs them that he had absolutely no contact with Ritam after school as his girlfriend Sumi was in love with Ritam. Deb and Avantika travels to Gandhinagar where Ritam's disabled sister Nivedita was admitted in a mental asylum. Coincidentally when they are staying at a hotel in Gandhinagar, police raids their hotel because they found Shrey and Tiya having sex in the balcony. They saved them by stepping in and giving statement that Tiya isn't minor, they are from media and she is their intern. Deb and Avantika visits the mental asylum in the morning to meet Nivedita where they find out that she is not reacting to their treatment and will loose complete hope if no one will visit her. This ignites something inside Deb and Avantika to find Ragini as soon as possible. Apparently Shrey and Tiya followed Deb and Avantika as they were getting suspicious over this trip. Shrey takes the information from emergency contact list of Nivedita and confronts Deb about the diary. After listening the whole story Shrey and Tiya decide to join them in their quest. They take a train to Mumbai where Sumi(emergency contact of Nivedita) stays. Tiya contacts Sumi and they plan a meeting. Sumi is informed about Ritam's death over which she starts crying. Sumi confessed how she was very upset when she found that Ritam is in lovewith Ragini. She started avoiding him but one day she got a call from unknown number who turned out to be Ritam. They all knew it was Nigel's landline as Ritam had made a diary entry on that incident. They all travelled to bangalore where Ragini and Ritam came for internship as Ragini wanted to live with her boyfriend Nigel for summer vacation. They called to Nigel's house from where they came to know that Nigel is admitted into a rehabilitation center. They all visit Nigel where he shares how sorry he is for ruining Ragini's life by forcing her to start drinking and doing drugs. He said he knew Ritam loved her and told her about the same but she never took him seriously. Nigel gives them a greeting card which was from Ragini. The card was from Mumbai. They all travel back to Mumbai to the address written on the card. Everyone is shocked to see that the house belongs to Ritam and not Ragini. Apparently after the drug overdose Ragini was deeply ashamed by her actions and cut all the ties with Ritam. Ritam couldn't bear to keep his feelings bottled up and sent his diary to Ragini. Seeing that Ritam is alive everyone concludes that the one who died is not Ritam but Ragini. Ritam is devastated. After few months Deb receives a letter from Ritam where he describes how painful it is to live as Nivedita passed away too. The letter was written after he took a syringe of extremely strong drug and wrote that he is going to take another dose thus ending his life. Thinking Ritam is dead the gang decides to head to Mumbai. Before they could plan any further Deb receives call from Ritam much to everyone's shock. He said he is Delhi and wants to meet them all. When they reach to the house Deb observes that this is exactly the kind of house he imagined Ragini would live in. Ritam explains how his suicide attempt was failed and he took it as a sign that Ragini and Nivedita wants him alive. He called Ragini's parents after that and got to know that Ragini is alive. She survived the blast but was severely burnt. They all met Ragini who was burnt beyond recognition. Ritam said he was going to propose her soon even though she might reject as doctors predicted she won't survive long time. Epilogue shows how Shrey and Tiya are in love and shares a serious relationship. Ritam is still trying to convince Ragini and how Deb wrote the book on their story.

Critical review  If It's Not Forever received fairly average to good reviews. Youth24x7, on their review, said, \\"Looking at ‚ÄòIf it‚Äôs not forever, it‚Äôs not love‚Äô will definitely make one think that it is one of those mushy love stories but what distinguishes this book from them is the way Durjoy Datta and Nikita Singh have given a new sensitive angle to the story by presenting the protagonist as a bomb blast victim striving to achieve redemption\\". Online blogs state it as a book that should be read by readers who are patient enough. Justlife reviewer Heena Joshi wrote, \\"Love could not have better sketch ever than the one depicted in this novel. The novel obviously has the common facet of young love, relationships & sex. But what sets it apart from others is the humanity; humanity towards the loss of some unknown; empathy with that person‚Äôs life and plight; relevance to other‚Äôs dreams and a dream to fulfill that unknown‚Äôs dream, a pain for other‚Äôs plight and loving your loved ones and making them feel this coziness and warmth throughout your life so that you don‚Äôt need to repent or think, ‚ÄúWhy couldn‚Äôt I express them when I was alive‚Äù.\\" Stories In Moments gives 4 stars and writes, \\"It‚Äôs a captivating read. More than once I felt like jumping to the last chapter as it was getting difficult for me to wait to know about the fate of the diary. The ‚Äòpresent-tense-narration‚Äô makes the story more intriguing and mysterious. Also the real life mentions like Grapevine and company funds etc. make you feel more emotionally connected to the story. The swaps between Deb's story and Dead Man's story have been used wonderfully. There isn't a single episode when story loses its grip. But what sets the mercury soaring are the final 70 pages where every page greets you with a new revelation, a new heart break, and a new hope at the same time.\\"  References  Category:2012 Indian novels Category:Thriller novels Category:Romance novels Category:Indian romance novels Category:Novels set in Delhi ","title":"If It's Not Forever"},{"id":"41097595","text":"Et la lumi√®re fut (internationally released as And Then There Was Light) is a 1989 French drama film written and directed by Otar Iosseliani.

History On 1 April 2013, the Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012 brought together Scotland's eight territorial police services, the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency and the Scottish Police Services Authority into the new national police service, Police Scotland. At the same time the remit of the Police Complaints Commissioner for Scotland expanded to include investigations into the most serious incidents involving the police. To reflect this change, the Police Complaints Commissioner for Scotland was renamed the Police Investigations & Review Commissioner. In June 2014 Kate Frame was appointed as the new Police Investigations and Review Commissioner, taking up the post in August. Criticism The PIRC have previously been criticised for using 'oppressive and dehumanising tactics' as part of its investigations by the body which represents police officers in Scotland, who stated that its members were fast losing confidence in the 'effectiveness and genuine independence' of the organisation. This was raised at a meeting of the Justice Committee of the Scottish Parliament. In May 2018, prominent lawyer Aamer Anwar called on the Commissioner Kate Frame to resign after claiming that organisation had failed to adhere to its values of integrity, impartiality and respect in relation to the investigation into the death of Sheku Bayoh. Remit and jurisdiction The PIRC provides independent scrutiny of how police bodies respond to complaints from members of the public.

Many of them were of Christian origin.  Name  Yaya means \\"pedestrian\\" in Ottoman Turkish. It is of Turkic origin word.https://www.nisanyansozluk.com/?k=yaya&view;=annotated An alternative name, piyade, is derived from a Persian word with the same meaning. This latter name was also used in the series of dynasties that ruled the neighboring Persian state.  Background  The early Ottoman military forces consisted of irregular nomadic cavalry and volunteer light infantry. These units were efficient against local Byzantine feudal lords but were unable to capture fortified castles by direct assault. This was the reason for Alaeddin Pasha including the establishment of this unit in his proposal for reorganization the military of the Ottoman Empire made in the mid 1320s. His brother, sultan Orhan, accepted his proposal and established yaya. Yaya were precursors of the Janissary corps of the Ottoman military, which would become one of the most influential and increasingly political forces in the Ottoman state until the 19th century.Janissary Corps would be made of converted Christians from Balkans up to 1500(most of them Albanians, Bosnians and Eastern Romans). However by 1550s when the Devshirme was abolished \\" de facto\\" , the Janissary Corps would be dominated by muslim born Ottomans, majority of them being Muslim Albanians.  Organization  The commander of the Yaya unit was referred to as Yayabashi. Members of this units were both Christian and Muslim citizens of the Ottoman Empire who were sometimes granted land estates in the Balkans in exchange for military service. They were most irregular infantry Ottoman units because they usually served as armed laborers whose military skills were limited. Still, before Janissary units were established and expanded in 1380s and afterwards, yaya peasant infantry had important military function. By giving regular salary to yaya Ottomans acquired a standing army.  Engagements  Among notable engagements of yaya military units are battles of Marica (1371) and Nicopolis (1396) where Ottoman infantry units, including yaya, were used to bait enemy heavy cavalry into an ambush between two flanks of more maneuverable light Ottoman cavalry.

He has been called a polymath, being \\"proficient in astronomy, cartography, mathematics, geography, geology, geometry, military tactics, commerce, husbandry, oenology, metallurgy, languages, iconology, iconography, liturgy, painting, sculpture and drawing.\\" Biography Map of north-western New Mexico by Bernando de Miera y Pacheco, 1778. Miera was born in the Valle de Carriedo of Cantabria Spain. The son of a captain of the Cantabrian Cavalry, he was trained as a military engineer. Like many others, he emigrated to New Spain (in North and Central America). In 1741, he married Maria Estefania Dom√≠nguez de Mendoza in Chihuahua. They would have two sons, Anacl√©to (Cl√©to) and Manuel. In 1743, the family settled in El Paso. A man of many talents, he was variously a merchant, a debt collector, a rancher and a military officer. In the latter capacity, he served in five military campaigns. In 1747, Captain Miera led a military detachment accompanying Padre Juan Menchero on the latter's attempt to convert the Navajo and resettle them around Mount Taylor (formerly Ceboletta). Though Menchero was unsuccessful, Miera produced the first map of the territory they traversed. In 1749, he mapped the Rio Grande from El Paso downstream to its junction with the Rio Conchos. He was also a painter and carver. Some of his works survive in churches and museums; the Church of Cristo Rey in Santa Fe has \\"his masterpiece, the Castrense altar screen\\". In 1754 or 1756, he moved his family to Santa Fe. He was appointed alcalde of the pueblos of Pecos and Galisteo and participated in three campaigns against the Comanches. Map of New Mexico, 1760, drawn by Miera y Pacheco to Mar√≠n del Valle When the Viceroy of New Spain ordered that his northern governors produce maps of their territories, Francisco Antonio Mar√≠n del Valle, Governor and Captain General of New Mexico, turned to Miera. They went out into the field on this endeavor from late June to 1 December 1757. The influential map was completed by April 1758. Miera would go on to make at least two other maps for Mar√≠n. Miera was granted a league of land (about 4428 acres or 1792 hectares) around Ceboletta, which was subsequently reduced to 4107 acres or 1662 hectares. He also served as cartographer for the 1776 Dom√≠nguez‚ÄìEscalante expedition. Miera was often at odds with the other leaders of the group, and was also frequently ill. The expedition failed in its goal of finding a route north to Monterey, but Miera produced maps which would be invaluable to subsequent explorers. In 1779, Miera accompanied Governor of New Mexico Juan Bautista de Anza on a punitive expedition against the Comanches, who had been raiding Taos. As a result, he drew perhaps his last map, covering an area centered on the Rio Grande from Santa Fe up to the Arkansas River. On 4 or 11 April 1785, Bernardo de Miera y Pacheco died in Santa Fe. His wife, Estefania, had died less than a year and a half earlier, also in Santa Fe. Legacy His maps were examined by Alexander von Humboldt in 1803 to help prepare his own maps. Humboldt in turn shared the information with American President Thomas Jefferson a year later, and Miera's work was copied by American mapmakers. The original of his 1758 map disappeared some time after 1930 in Mexico City, but a copy was made in the 1970s from photographs of it.

It is the most widely distributed species of Polyergus in North America. It is an obligatory social parasite, unable to feed itself or look after the colony and reliant on ants of another species, Formica, to undertake these tasks. The parasitic ants are known as \\"dulotics\\" (from the Greek Œ¥Œø·ø¶ŒªŒøœÇ doulos, meaning a slave) and the ants they parasitise are the \\"hosts\\". Taxonomy In a revision of the genus Polyergus in 2013, Trager reinstated five species previously thought to be synonymous with Polyergus breviceps. P. mexicanus was one of these, a widely distributed species found in western North American and originally described by the Swiss myrmecologist Auguste Forel in 1899, the type locality being Mexico. It is likely that most species mentioned in scientific journals as P. breviceps are in fact P. mexicanus. Description P. mexicanus is somewhat variable across its range and averages in total length. The head is glossy in the south of its range and more matte in eastern and northern populations. The mesonotum is matte dorsally and usually shining laterally. The gaster is also shining but this is partially concealed by a covering of short erect hairs, especially dorsally. The colour is generally red with the posterior portion of the tergites being tinged with brown. The legs may be a slightly darker colour than the body, and the hairs on the dorsal surface are grey, never yellowish as they are in P. breviceps. This species also bears longer brownish macrosetae (hairs) but they often get worn away, leaving dark scars on the tergites. Distribution and habitat P. mexicanus is the most widely distributed species in the genus Polyergus in North America. It is native to the western United States and Canada, North Dakota, South Dakota, Arkansas and Mexico. It usually inhabits open woodland with little undergrowth or mixed wood and grassland habitats. Further south it is restricted to higher altitudes; in the Chiricahua Mountains of Mexico it occurs at and in Chihuahua is found at , typically in open coniferous forests. Behaviour P. mexicanus is an obligate parasite of other species of ant. These \\"hosts\\" are species of Formica ants in the groups F. fusca and F. neogagates. A newly mated female of P. mexicanus enters the nest of a potential host, employing pheromones to subdue the resident workers. She then kills the existing Formica queen and becomes accepted by the Formica workers. These then proceed to rear her brood as well as maintaining the nest and feeding the dulotic queen and the ants which develop from the eggs she lays. The dulotic ants are unable to carry out these tasks themselves. The workforce of the colony is periodically replenished by a raid being undertaken on another nearby colony of Formica ants. The raid is made by the Polyergus worker ants and usually takes place on a hot afternoon in the summer. A scout ant locates a suitable target nest and a column of dulotic ants move towards it. On arriving at the nest they may mill around for a while, perhaps clearing debris such as small stones or twigs away from the entrance. They then surge inside and quickly begin to emerge carrying host pupae, prepupae and sometimes late-stage larvae back to the dulotic nest. There, the host workers care for them as well as the dulotic young developing from eggs laid by the Polyergus queen. Newly mated female dulotics may take advantage of raids to enter host colonies during the chaotic situation that exists during a raid.

She is one of the most important members of the ‚ÄúK√∂lner Schule‚Äù in gerontology, whose credo is the ‚ÄúLebenslagekonzept‚Äù (circumstance concept) ‚Äì a concept for explaining, describing and evaluating living conditions of population groups, implementing material as well as immaterial characteristics. One further aim of this school is to identify the living situation of socially deprived and endangered population groups and, based on that, to offer propositions for improvement.  Biography  Margret Dieck is born in Bad Godesberg, a district of Bonn. She grows up in a doctor's family. After finishing school, Dieck studies economic and social sciences in Cologne, and finishes her studies as a diplom economist. Her first job is an academic associate's position at the ‚ÄúForschungsinstitut f√ºr Einkommenspolitik und Soziale Sicherung‚Äú (research institute for incomes policy and social security) in Cologne. Her first scientific works are on the theory of social regulation, social cybernetics and on the economical theory of the statutory health insurance. In 1966, Dieck changes to an academic assistant's position at the ‚ÄúForschungsst√§tte f√ºr √∂ffentliche Unternehmen‚Äú (research institution for public enterprises) at the University of Cologne. There, she soon assumes as well the business operations. After only one year, in 1967, she changes again, to an academic associate's position at the ‚ÄúSeminar f√ºr Sozialpolitik und Genossenschaftswesen‚Äú (seminar for social policy and cooperative system), that is as well part of the University of Cologne. This Seminar is led by Gerhard Weisser and, later, Otto Blume: those two teachers who probably influence Dieck's work the most. In this period, Margret Dieck concerns herself inter alia with financing and the promotion of public enterprises and with the economic operating of labour unions. Dieck achieves the title ‚ÄúDr. rer. pol.‚Äù (Doctor rerum politicarum ‚Äì Doctor of political and economic sciences) in the same year. The young academic is early concerned with the living situation of weak and endangered persons ‚Äì partly motivated by the respective preliminary work of Gerhard Weisser and Otto Blume. The results of the latter on questions of the living situation of elder people are the basis for Dieck's special interest in the social subjects of gerontology. This interest makes her change to the ‚ÄúKuratorium Deutsche Altershilfe‚Äù (KDA, curatorship of German seniority age) in 1969. She initiates there the foundation of an institute for senior housing, which she academically leads from 1970 on, and until she leaves for the ‚ÄûDeutsches Zentrum f√ºr Altersfragen e.V.‚Äú (DZA, German centre for aging questions) in 1974. In her KDA time, Dieck can note some considerable achievements: She is engaged in a survey report on the stationary treatment of aging illnesses and on cost absorption by statutory health insurances, published in 1974. This survey is a directory for experts then and now, and 1995/96 ‚Äì 20 years later ‚Äì becomes the basis for the rearrangement of covering in case of care dependency. Furthermore, she contributes to a DGB (‚ÄúDeutscher Gewerkschaftsbund‚Äù ‚Äì German Trade Union Federation) survey on the ‚ÄúLebenslage √§lterer Menschen von 1975‚Äù (living situation of the elderly, published in 1975). This document is the first extensive socio-politico-scientific analysis of the elderlies' living conditions in the German Federal Republic. It proves a new orientation in the labour unions' social policy of that time. As written before, Dieck changes to the ‚ÄúDeutschen Zentrum f√ºr Altersfragen e.V.‚Äù (DZA) in 1974. In her time there, she works initially as a divisional director for applied research and academic advice. In 1977, she becomes academic director of the DZA. Dieck remains in this position until she dies. The DZA advances under her guidance to one of the leading socio-politico-scientific research and documentation centres in Germany. For many, the name ‚ÄúMargret Dieck‚Äù becomes a synonym for the DZA. One considerable achievement of this time is a three-volume report on ‚ÄúAltwerden in Deutschland‚Äù (Aging in Germany), that is written by the ‚ÄúArbeitsgruppe Fachbericht √ºber Probleme des Alterns‚Äù (working group for the report on the problems of aging) under her academic aegis and published in 1982. On 28 November 1996, Margret Dieck dies after a short, heavy illness.  Work  Almost all of Margret Dieck's academic work concerns the topic of social disequilibria in seniority, what means: with the socially disadvantaged groups of the elderly. Her focus is not only to analyse, but to reach policy and society, and thus go beyond theory and to provide bases for implementation. Dieck's scientific aims are... ...to bring the social protection and security of the elderly on one level and on the same standards with the social protection of all other population groups. This aim provokes, inter alia, her engagement for the nursing care insurance and, eventually, for the financing of social services. ...to fight and to overcome the reasons and causes of social distress and of under-supply (so-called ‚Äúsocial weakness‚Äù) of the problematic seniority groups. ...to put constant effort in influencing policy and society, to let theory become practice. ...to strengthen the socio- politico-economic positions and ideas of the gerontological community in Germany. Concerning this, Dieck is occasionally blunt, sometimes even harsh in her diction. But she is always convinced of her concern's eligibility, being the social policy. ...to indirectly, and partly as well directly, represent the interests of those members of seniority, whose interests are only insufficiently observed. One important work beneath the already mentioned is ‚ÄúSozialpolitik f√ºr √§ltere Menschen‚Äù (Social Policy for the Elderly), published together with Gerhard Naegele in 1978: This work is considered the programmatic foundation of a socio-politico-scientific research area in the social gerontology. Another one is ‚ÄúWohnen und Wohnumfeld √§lterer Menschen in der Bundesrepublik‚Äù, on living conditions of the elderly in Germany, published in 1979. This monography is considered a benchmark of gerontological literature until today. Further publications of Dieck are on \\\\- women and aging, \\\\- family relations in higher age, \\\\- sanitary and custodial care of the elderly, \\\\- poverty and wealth in higher age, \\\\- elderly employees, \\\\- retirement and work-related ‚Äúdisposal‚Äù in higher age, \\\\- nursing care insurance, \\\\- social services and their financing.  Honorary work  Though being very much engaged in her jobs, Margret Dieck finds always some spare time for honorary work. For several years, she is ‚Äì together with Siegfried G√∂√üling ‚Äì chairman of the department VI of the German Society for Gerontology. From 1984 to 1986, she holds the position of its vice president, together with Ursula Lehr and Ingeborg Falck. Furthermore, Dieck is member of the expert committee on senior citizen policy of the AWO (‚ÄúArbeiterwohlfahrt‚Äù - Workers' Welfare Association) Federal Association. She is involved in the development of the 2nd seniority plan of the Federal State of Nordrhein-Westfalen and in the surveys on which this plan is based. She is member of the expert committee for the development of the first aging report of the Bundesregierung (German government) and expert in the investigation commission ‚ÄúDemographischer Wandel‚Äù (demographic change) of the German Bundestag (parliament). And she is member of the curatorship and the academic advisory board of the German research company for gerontology.

The district courts deal with infringement, whereas the Federal Patent Court (German: Bundespatentgericht) is in charge of deciding the validity of patents. Such a system is sometimes dubbed a \\"bifurcation system.\\" See also * Copyright law of Germany ReferencesExternal links * Patent Act * European Patent Convention ","title":"German patent law"},{"id":"41097976","text":"Harvey Township may refer to the following townships in the United States: * Harvey Township, Meeker County, Minnesota * Harvey Township, Cowley County, Kansas ","title":"Harvey Township"},{"id":"41097982","text":"Oecleini is planthopper tribe in the subfamily Cixiinae.

It derives its name from the Scottish family estate. Design Originally constructed in 1845 as a three-bay, Greek Revival brick town house, it consisted of two floors measuring 40'x40' above an English basement, with brick and wood walls, 15 fireplaces, two front parlors, living room and a kitchen outbuilding. Kenmure was expanded to three-stories in 1855 with a central one-bay dwarf portico, a rear addition and a low, hipped roof topped by a three-bay cupola. Its site was originally a half block, located next to the Elizabeth River, between Bute and Botetourt Streets. Original history Kenmure was built for Margaret Kerr Lamb (1811‚Äì1876) and William Wilson Lamb (1835-1909), a banker, shipper, cotton and rail merchant. The Lambs had two children, William Wilson Lamb (1835-1909) and Mary Content Lamb Donnell (1850‚Äì1924). Marking the second generation when Lambs served as mayor of Norfolk, William Wilson Lamb served as mayor of Norfolk from 1858 to 1862 during the Civil War. As Norfolk surrendered the city to Union soldiers, Lamb secreted Norfolk's historic silver mace -- which had been handed down from each mayor since first presented to Norfolk by Royal Lieutenant Governor Robert Dinwiddie in 1754 -- under the hearth stone of the upstairs children's room. Union soldiers would subsequently occupy the house, without discovering the hidden mace. Lamb's son Colonel William Lamb would later own Kenmure. As a noted Confederate States Army officer, he commanded the Confederate garrison at Fort Fisher during the Civil War; was badly wounded and was hospitalized and imprisoned at Fort Monroe at the southern tip of the Virginia Peninsula. and Accompanying photo Colonel Lamb and his wife, Sarah Anne Chaffee Lamb (1837-1892) had twelve children, and Colonel Lamb would later serve two terms as Norfolk's mayor. Colonel Lamb described Kenmure as \\"a typical southern home of these antebellum days, where besides the ‚Äòwhite folks‚Äô there was a colony of family servants from the pickaninnys just able to crawl to the old gray- headed mammy who nursed ‚Äòold massa.‚Äô It was an ideal home for a boy: sail and row boats on the shore for sailing and fishing, horses in the stable for riding and driving, peaches, pears, cherries, figs, pomegranates, raspberries, currants in the garden, and roses, pink lilacs, snow balls, hollyhock and all the dear old-time flowers with which to treat his girl and boy friends ‚Äì with a lovely lawn, bordered with crepe myrtles, bayberry and calycanthus between the mansion house and the river, upon which to romp and wrestle and to enjoy those outdoor games which the children of the founders of Norfolk town in 1682 brought from the motherland.‚Äù Later history The house was sold in 1894, 1897 and 1906, becoming a boarding house by 1918, and was unoccupied by the 1920s. In the 1930s Kenmure was subdivided into five apartments. It was occupied by vagrants when architect Frederick Herman (1924-2002) and his wife Dr. Lucy Spigel Herman, a learning disabilities specialist, purchased the house in 1976. The Hermans began its restoration, re-configuring the house as a single family residence above offices on the basement and first floor levels. In the 1980s the basement and first floor accommodated the architectural firm Herman had co-founded with his father-in-law Bernard (Bernie) Betzig Spigel (1895-1968) and August (Augie) Zinkl (1905-1990). The firm operated as Spigel, Carter, Zinkl and Herman, and later as Spigel Herman and Chapman with partner Donald E. Chapman. A basement-level antique store was operated by Sydney and Faith Nusbaum. Historic easements were added by the Hermans. Kenmure was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. It was purchased by Stephen and Vanessa Sigmon in 2007, who further restored the house, returning it to a single family residence.

Playing career Burgess, who started his SANFL career in 1980, was a full- back in West Adelaide's 1983 premiership team. Going into the Grand Final battling a hamstring injury, coach Neil Kerley assigned Burgess had the task of playing on Sturt's champion full-forward Rick Davies who was sitting on 149 goals for the season. In West Adelaide's two minor round games against Sturt in 1983, Kerley had tried Peter Winter on the man the called the \\"Jumbo Prince\\", and he had kicked 15 goals. Burgess managed to restrict Davies to two goals in the Grand Final at Football Park. With Davies regarded as Sturt's main danger, Burgess' effort on him played a large role in the Bloods' 34 point win, though he largely credits West Adelaide's backline for restricting Sturt and Davies and plays down his own roll on the day. During 1983, Burgess actually moved from Adelaide to Melbourne and trained with the Sydney Swans when they were in Melbourne before flying to Adelaide to take his place for West Adelaide. After West Adelaide missed the finals in 1984, Burgess signed with Collingwood to play in the VFL.

With a number of controversial books that disturbed the Japanese society and its erotic manga comics, the company has established itself like a source of provocative \\"subculture\\" items.  History  Ohta Publishing was created in 1985, when it separated from the publishing department of Ohta Production, a talent agency specializing in stand-up comedians. (Founded as a y≈´gen-gaisha, it has now, as of 2013, been converted to a kabushiki-gaisha.) Initially, from an outside perspective, Ohta Publishing did not seem like a serious company but rather a sort of a toy company of Takeshi Kitano (who was an Ohta Production artist back then). It released books that were of interest to Kitano himself. In 1989, Ohta published the famous book The Age of M by Akio Nakamori about serial child murderer Tsutomu Miyazaki and started establishing itself like a source of provocative \\"subculture\\" items. Around the same time the bi-monthly magazine QuickJapan was founded. In 1993 Ohta released the disturbing book The Complete Manual of Suicide and in 1999 Battle Royale, which shook the Japanese society. At the end of the 1990s, the company also started working with manga artist Naoki Yamamoto, dubbed the master of erotics, and founded the manga magazine Manga Erotics. Its successor Manga Erotics F now accounts for a large percentage of all company's manga sales.  Prominent titles  The company is best known for having published books like The Age of M (1989), The Complete Manual of Suicide (1993) and Battle Royale (1999) and numerous manga comics, including Tatami Galaxy and Eien no Zero.

Life and work  Pfrang studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich from 1974‚Äì79. Later he spent many years as an independent artist in Montepulciano, Val d‚ÄôOrcia and Catania, Italy, interrupted by stays in Munich and Augsburg. He presently lives and works in Berlin. Erwin Pfrang is the grandson of the Munich folk comedian Konstantin Pfrang. Carla Schulz-Hoffmann makes an attempt at characterising the painter: ‚ÄúAn artist such as Erwin Pfrang inhabits an alternative world, a tiny microcosm of subjectivity, and lives that life uncompromisingly, with all the limitations and hardships that it entails. Among twentieth-century artists a comparable stance can be encountered perhaps in Jean Fautrier, but certainly in Wols. The succinct characterization of the latter‚Äôs manner of working by his friend Henry Pierry Roch√© applies equally well to Pfrang: ‚ÄòWols sheds his drawings as a snail does its shell ‚Äì naturally and painfully.‚Äô‚ÄùCarla Schulz-Hoffmann, \\"Erwin Pfrang ‚Äì Die Bilder\\" in: Erwin Pfrang: Bilder, Exhibition Catalogue: Staatsgalerie moderner Kunst, M√ºnchen, Verlag Fred Jahn, M√ºnchen, 1999, p. 7 Erwin Pfrang is represented by gallerists Fred Jahn, Munich and David Nolan, New York.  Painting and Literature  Pfrang‚Äôs lifelong passion for literature becomes particularly evident in his involvement with the works of the Irish writer James Joyce. The result being three cycles of drawings about Dubliners and Ulysses. The New York Times called his drawings for the Circe episode of the novel: \\"a brilliant solo debut.\\"Michael Kimmelman, ‚ÄúJames Joyce‚Äôs 'Ulysses' Translated for the Eye‚Äù, The New York Times, September 13, 1991 Other drawings are dedicated to the tale Tubutsch by the German Expressionist writer Albert Ehrenstein and Gerald Barry's opera The Intelligence Park, libretto by Vincent Deane. La bambolaia  Representationalism  Pfrang comments on the role of representationalism in his work as follows: ‚ÄúNon-representational art presupposes the artist‚Äôs knowledge of what reality is. If reality as the result of our questionable sensory experiences, however, is not something we take for granted, we are obliged to \\"actually create reality\\" (G√ºnter Eich), to auscultate the world and its objects to discover their nature, and in the painter's case to sound it out with the blindman's stick of the brush.Erwin Pfrang, unpublished typescript.

The Charles Dickens School is part of the Barton Court Academy Trust (BCAT).

Kent retains a selective system where pupils sit an eleven-plus test. Pupils who pass the test go to the Grammar school and Charles Dickens takes pupils who haven't. The school is in Broadstairs, on the Thanet peninsula 30km from other centres of population. Thanet is surrounded on three sides by water. The school has difficulties in recruiting and retaining Teachers. it follows the Thinking Schools philosophy. It offers GCSEs and BTECs as programmes of study for pupils. The current metric, is success in the Progress 8 benchmark subjects. Academics Virtually all maintained schools and academies follow the National Curriculum, and are inspected by Ofsted on how well they succeed in delivering a 'broad and balanced curriculum'.  Key Stage 3  The school has to decided that Key Stage 3 in 2020 contains years 7, 8 . There are 3 learning pathways, that offer appropriate level courses for all students: # The English Baccalaureate (EBacc), ‚ÄúGrammar Stream‚Äù pathway. These are the only students to be offered a language- and thus the only students that will be eligible for Progress 8. # The ‚ÄúMain‚Äù pathway # The ‚ÄúSecondary Ready‚Äù pathway that does additional work on supporting numeracy and literacy \\"\\"It is important that every student follows the most appropriate learning pathway that meets their needs and reflects their prior attainment and progress to date. The learning pathway should provide sufficient pace and challenge to learning and reflect the student‚Äôs individual interest, talents and academic ability. All pathways provide each student with a broad and balanced curriculum at an appropriate pace and pitch of learning to ensure all students make expected or more than expected progress at KS3.\\"  Key Stage 4  The three level approach is continued, the pathways are now called the EBacc, the main and the technical. Every student follows the most appropriate learning pathway that meets their needs in KS5 and in the future and reflects their prior attainment and progress to date. The learning pathway should provide sufficient pace and challenge to learning and reflect the student‚Äôs individual interest, talents and academic ability, naturally the final programme of study chosen needs to be broad, balanced, relevant and enjoyable. It also meets the statutory requirements and adds to the school performance measures. To achieve an EBacc, students must gain a GSCE grade 9-5 in six subjects, a modern foreign language- in this case Spanish, the core subjects of Maths, English Language, two science, one of which may be computing and then history or geography which are referred to as a humanity. The EBacc pathway also studies English Literature, and two other academic or vocational subjects.. The main pathway studies a core of mathematics, English Language and Literature, combined Science (two GCSEs), and one subject from Geography or History. They study 3 additional options. The technical pathway study a core of mathematics, English Language and Literature, combined Science (two GCSEs) with 3 options, and additional mathematics and English.

It was won by the Labour candidate George Thomson. http://www.leighrayment.com/commons/Dcommons4.htm Background Thomas Cook had been an MP for Dundee East since its creation in 1950, having previously represented the old two-member Dundee seat. On 31 May 1952 he was travelling between Arbroath and Dundee when his car left the road, struck a tree and went over a low wall in to a field, killing him instantly. Reporting Cook's death, The Glasgow Herald speculated that Labour should fairly safely hold the seat in the by-election to follow, arguing that while until October 1951 the seat might have been considered marginal, Cook's holding of it against a strong campaign suggested that the seat could now be considered a safe one for Labour. However the newspaper opined that the strength of Labour's majority would give some indication as to the extent of the \\"alleged unpopularity\\" of the Conservative Government. Candidates Labour selected 31 year old George Morgan Thomson, who was originally from nearby Monifieth and had been educated at Broughty Ferry's Grove Academy. The Dundee Unionist and Liberal National Association selected Paul Cowcher, who had contested Glasgow Maryhill at the previous year's general election. Cowcher had previously served in the Royal Navy. The Scottish National Party's unsuccessful candidate, Donald Stewart, would later be the SNP's first MP elected at a General Election when he won the Western Isles seat at the 1970 general election. An independent candidate, E. G. MacFarlane described himself as the representative of the World Parliament Party and claimed to be the first candidate in world history to offer voters the chance of supporting the creation of an international federation. On the eve of the poll, both Thomson and the Conservative and National Liberal candidate Paul Cowcher declared themselves confident of victory. Stewart stated he had enjoyed his campaign and believed it would lead to the 'consolidation of nationalist activities' in Dundee. Thomson's final election meeting was held at Dundee's Premierland Boxing Stadium, where he wore boxing gloves and spoke from the ring. Result Thomson considered his victory and the fall in the Conservative vote represented a vote of no confidence in the Government. Crowcher blamed the fall in the Conservative vote on unemployment in the local textile industry and felt people had yet to realise that 'unpopular measures' taken by the Government were in their best interests. Stewart admitted to being 'a little disappointed' that people who had indicated they supported Scottish nationalism did not all vote for him.

Modernism is characterized by a self- conscious break with traditional styles of poetry and verse. Modernists experimented with literary form and expression, adhering to Ezra Pound's maxim to \\"Make it new\\".Pound, Ezra, Make it New, Essays, London, 1935 The modernist literary movement was driven by a conscious desire to overturn traditional modes of representation and express the new sensibilities of their time. It is debatable when the modernist literary movement began, though some have chosen 1910 as roughly marking the beginning and quote novelist Virginia Woolf, who declared that human nature underwent a fundamental change \\"on or about December 1910.\\"Virginia Woolf. \\"Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown.\\" Collected Essays.

The forest encompasses a total area of approximately . The larger portion of the forest in the Altai and Sayan Mountains runs across a latitude range that encompasses between 51.5 degrees to 56 degrees north latitude, and a longitude range running between 86 degrees to 95 degrees east longitude. The region overlaps with the Golden Mountains of Altai World Heritage Site. Ecological zones range from hemiboreal forest to a forest-steppe ecotone and include a wider variety of plant species than surrounding areas. Geography The southern Siberian rainforest is primarily located within the Altai and Sayan mountain ranges across a range of elevations. Geographic features that the forest extends onto include high mountains and ridges as well as valleys carved by glaciers\\"Katunsky Zapovednik.\\" Wild Russia.

The trees include a mix of coniferous and broadleaf tree species. These include Scots pine, silver birch, Eurasian aspen, Siberian pine, Siberian fir, Siberian spruce and Siberian linden. The hemiboreal zones are dominated by Scots Pine and silver birch in wet areas. Moss cover is present, but sparse. Dry areas are dominated by either Scots pine or Siberian larch depending on temperature. Siberian larch is typically more prevalent in cooler areas while warmer and drier areas favor Scots pine.Chytry, Milan, et al. \\"Diversity of Forest Vegetation Across a Strong Gradient of Climatic Continentality: Western Sayan Mountains, South Siberia.\\" Plant Ecology (2007). Siberian larch also dominates the forest- steppe ecotone. Epiphyte species include multiple genera of lichen.

Winter temperatures can be as low as -19 degrees Celsius (-2 degrees Fahrenheit) and summer temperatures can reach as high as 17 degrees (63 degrees Fahrenheit).New, M.G., M. Hulme and P.D. Jones, 1999: Representing 20th century space-time climate variability. I: Development of a 1961-1990 mean monthly terrestrial climatology. J. Climate. 12, 829-856. The region primarily gets precipitation from Atlantic air masses brought in by westerly winds. The climates are more moderate nearby Teletskoje lake and Baikal. Lake Baikal has the effect of cooling incoming air as it reaches the Khamar-Daban Mountains. The incoming air is forced over the mountains, causing moisture to precipitate out. This causes greater annual precipitation in this area than in the surrounding regions, and can exceed 1500 millimeters annually in some places. In addition, relative humidity can average as high as 75% on an annual basis. The region also loses more water to evapotranspiration than surrounding areas.Willmott, Cort J., and Matsuura Kenji (2001): Terrestrial Water Budget Data Archive: Monthly Time Series (1950-1999). Current climate change projections predict that local temperatures will increase, causing the forest to expand into nearby alpine tundra areas. Climate change is also expected to result in decreased precipitation in the region. Threats Conifer trees in the region have been industrially logged, sometimes illegally,\\"Altai-Sayan Ecoregion.\\" Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, n.d. Web. 14 Nov. 2013. for more than a century. Clear cutting was particularly common with Siberian pine, which was seen as particularly valuable.\\"\\"Western Siberian Hemiboral Forests.\\" worldwildlife.org. World Wildlife Fund, n.d. Web. 12 Nov 2013. The removal of these trees is a cause of increased soil erosion due to a lack of roots.\\"Sayan montant conifer forests.\\" Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment, n.d. Web. 14 Nov. 2013. Fire also is a disturbance that is most common in areas with Scots pine stands and is expected to increase in frequency as temperatures rise due to climate change. Forest regeneration in these areas is hindered by the faster growth and spread of grasses, particularly the genus Calamagrostis. Insect outbreaks are a threat to many of the tree species in the region. One example of this type of disturbance is the Siberian silkmoth, a species of moth that eats the leaves and needles of broadleaf and coniferous trees respectively. Its most recent outbreak was in 2002. Tree mortality from insect outbreaks and fungal infestations further increases the risk of forest fires due to the increase of combustible material from dead trees, including the trunks which can act as ladder fuel.

The line connected the Great North of England Railway (GNE) (later the York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway, YN&B;) near York to the Leeds and Thirsk Railway (L&TR;) at Knaresborough, with a route length of about . The line branched from the GNE from York station and passed through Poppleton, Hessay, Marston Moor, Hammerton, Cattal, Allerton and Goldsborough (originally Flaxby) to Knaresborough.Railway Magazine, v.39 (1916) The line's engineer was Thomas Grainger and the main stations (Poppleton, Marston Moor, Cattal, and Allerton) were built by Samuel Atack to Grainger's designs. Construction began in 1847, works including a tunnel under part of Knaresborough and a viaduct over the River Nidd. The line was double tracked with a length of . On 11 March 1848 the nearly completed viaduct over the Nidd collapsed, and a temporary wooden station was constructed east of Knaresborough on Hay-A-Park Lane to allow the line to partially opened on 30 October 1848. Originally backed by George Hudson, the company directors made an agreement with the rival L&TR;, which had begun proceedings to absorb the company. However, after the L&TR; backed out of the arrangement in the middle of 1848, the directors returned to Hudson and made arrangements for the YN&B; to work the line. After 1849 the line was worked with lighter engines from E. B. Wilson (Leeds) with payment on a worked miles basis, plus a percentage of revenue.Railway Magazine, v.39 (1916) quote:This section was first worked by the York, Newcastle and Berwick Company, but evidently their terms were too high, as in September, 1849, the Company appealed to them to reduce the working charges, and subsequently the line was worked by Messrs. E. B. Wilson & Co., of Leeds, on behalf of the Company, as an independent concern. The York and North Midland Railway (Y&NMR;) took over the line in July. The replacement four arch stone double track viaduct over the Nidd was completed at a cost of ¬£9,803 and the section over the River Nidd connecting to the L&TR; was opened on 1 October 1851.

It analyzes the National Endowment for Democracy's financing of the Otpor! resistance movement, together with the West's training of Serbian activists and politicians in Budapest and discusses the row between the government and the opposition concerning electoral fraud accusations.

A dal v≈°em n√°vod, jak se tomu vzep≈ô√≠t Parlamentn√≠ Listy As the concept of neoliberalism is explained in the film, from the teachings of Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig von Mises, to Milton Friedman and the Chicago Boys, and the spread of neoliberalism from the overthrow of Salvador Allende in the 1973 Chilean coup d'√©tat, which brought Augusto Pinochet to power, to Margaret Thatcher's reforms in the United Kingdom and Ronald Reagan's reforms in the United States,The Weight of Chains 2 NSPM.rs Malagurski argues that a 'shock-economy' based on the Washington Consensus led Serbia and other countries to the edge of existence,http://m.vesti- online.com/Dijaspora/drzava/Nemacka/Vesti/459852/Buntom-protiv-lanaca with the United States imposing these policies by installing puppet regimes. The film asserts that non-governmental organizations, with multimillion-dollar budgets and direct connections with Washington, help keep U.S.-friendly regimes in power and the people in line. Noting that Russia demanded that NGOs register as \\"foreign agents\\" in that country to solve this problem, Malagurski mentions that the United States also passed the Foreign Agents Registration Act. \\"Institutions like the International Monetary Fund\\", Malagurski said in a discussion, \\"act like hitmen\\", whose policies \\"destroyed the economies of many countries\\". The destruction of the education system in the former Yugoslavia is assessed in the film as well, with Malagurski arguing that adopting the neoliberal model led to a drastic decrease in quality of learning, combined with vulgar television shows that aim to dumb down the populace. Malagurski then briefly tackles the topic of the Yugoslav wars, claiming that Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá and Franjo Tuƒëman, leaders on opposite sides of the conflict, had several common banks abroad where they hid money that was stolen during the war. The film argues that Croatian general Ante Gotovina amassed enormous wealth during the war as well. Carla Del Ponte then discusses the case of Ramush Haradinaj, saying that he was freed because of political pressure from the United States. She also says that UNMIK refused to send evidence of organ theft in Kosovo, arguing that \\"since NATO and the Kosovo Liberation Army were partners during the war, they couldn't act against each other after the war.\\" The 2002 Venezuelan coup d'√©tat attempt is analyzed in the film, with Hugo Ch√°vez, who previously changed Venezuela's neoliberal constitution and defied the IMF, briefly being replaced with a President loyal to the United States, arguing that the coup d'√©tat failed because many people went to the streets to demand Ch√°vez back, with Ch√°vez quickly being re-installed as President. Malagurski then presents his recommendations for how a country can free itself from Western control ‚Äì by protecting local industry, as the film argues that foreign investments destroy local production (noting the examples of South Korea, which restricted foreign investments, as well as Finland from 1930 to 1980),What shocked Carla Del Ponte Politika creating a welfare state and making protesting a way of life.

Its historic significance lies in its unique architecture A Richardsonian Romanesque style facade of rough-cut brownstone with a metal gabled roof was added to the existing Italianate Style house. The facade is a two-bay, two-story structure with a full basement, while the main building is only two stories. The two bays of the facade are separated by a central stone chimney. The western side wall of the facade forms a rounded turret with a conical slate roof, and each story has triple one-by-one windows, round-headed on the lowest level and square-headed on the upper two floors. The eastern bay also has the triple windows motif, topped by a gable end with a round window. The front steps are on the east wall and recessed under an archway. The door has stained-glass panels and its landing is laid with colored tiles. The original building is brick Italianate, with a porch addition built in the 1890s, around the same time the facade was built. The building was deemed worthy of historical recognition as an example of the changing tastes in local architecture in the late 19th century, being a brick Italianate main house, with a Romanesque facade, a Queen Anne style side-porch and a western Colonial Revival porch.

It was built in 1633 by John Abel, and moved to its present location in 1859. It was then used as a private house until the 1930s, and is now once again a civic building.  Architecture  Some of the building's carvings The timber- framed building is extravagantly decorated with carvings, including mermaids, angels, animals, flowers and grotesque people.Council information panel at the house The entablature above the columns includes a number of carved texts. These read: * (\\"To God through life all men should raise their monument of thanks and praise And clean from sin should pass their days prepared to cross beyond always\\") * * (\\"Live in such a way that you may live hereafter\\")  When built by John Abel in 1633, the market hall was open at ground level, being supported on twelve oak columns. It was known as \\"the Butter Crosse\\". It has a stone tile roof, a bellcote, and a weathervane dated 1687.  Original site  John Varley I (1778‚Äì1842), showing the building in its original state and location The market house originally stood on the site of an earlier market building, at the junction of Broad Street, High Street, Church Street, Drapers' Lane, High Street and Burgess Street. In addition to public meetings, it was used for meetings of the town's nine guilds (bakers, butchers, dyers, glovers, mercers, shoemakers, tailors, walkers (fullers) and weavers) and Quarter Session courts, and the town council met there from 1750.  Rebuilding and later use  Eventually, congestion caused by the building's location at an important junction led to calls for its removal. The building was dismantled and stored in the mid-1850s. It was purchased at auction for ¬£95 by John Hungerford Arkwright, who offered the building to the council if they would re-erect it, but they refused. He moved the building himself and rebuilt it near the priory church in 1859. In the process, the ground floor was enclosed, a three-storey brick extension added at the rear, and the roof replaced. At some point two terracotta panels by the Leominster sculptor William Storr-Barber (died 1934) were added to the interior. In 1939, Leominster District Council acquired the building for ¬£3,000 through a compulsory purchase order, thereby thwarting an apparent plan by William Randolph Hearst to remove it for reuse as a gatehouse at St Donat's Castle. Until 2008, it was used as council offices by the District Council, and later Herefordshire County Council. In 2001, a campaign was started to raise money to restore the building. The work was completed in 2013 and the building, with a modern annexe, is now a community centre (a Community, Enterprise and Heritage Hub), owned by LARC Development Trust, a registered charity which purchased it from Herefordshire County Council for ¬£1 in June 2013, as an instance of community asset transfer. The building is Grade II* listed and is licensed for the conduct of civil marriage ceremonies.

However, in April 2013, Suresh confirmed that he is doing a Malayalam film with Joshiy and Mohanlal. The team met again in July to have further discussions on the project. On 16 November 2013, Mohanlal confirmed the project through his Facebook page. He announced the title as Lailaa O Lailaa and stated it would have Amala Paul in the lead and would be produced by Finecut Entertainments. It is the second collaboration of the trio Joshiy- Mohanlal-Amala after the success of Run Babby Run (2012). There were several reports in online news medias that Mohanlal would play an investigation officer in the film. Financing The film introduced a new concept of film financing in Malayalam cinema. The idea was developed by three NRIs based in the Middle East - Santhosh Kottayi, Bijou Antony and Preeta Nair. The trio formed the production company FineCut Entertainments Private Ltd. The funds for the film were collected through a fundraising technique known as equity crowdfunding, a popular idea in the west to raise funds for start-ups. The model permits anyone to invest in the production company, who can then expect preferential shares in return. The idea perceives film financing as a prospective investment venture. Unlike crowdfunding, where funds are mobilised from the public, equity funding allows investors to own shares and remain investors for a longer period, and they can benefit from the future production and distribution projects of the same company. Dividends are distributed to each investor based on the profitability of the company. The model ensures that the movie sails through the break-even point, its total budget realized, prior to its release. Bijou Antony, one of the directors, said, \\"We have moulded the concept of crowd-equity funding in such a way that our friends and colleagues, who are interested in our movie project, could be part of the venture by investing in it. The investments are capped at a maximum of Rs 5 lakh per investor, which is well within the risk appetite of the investor profile we have had so far\\". Casting Mohanlal is in the lead along with Amala Paul for the second time after Run Babby Run. Tamil actor Sathyaraj was chosen for a pivotal role in the film. Earlier there were speculations regarding the change in the heroine as soon as actress Amala Paul announced her wedding. Several reports suggested that Manju Warrier would replace Amala Paul, and that writer Suresh Nair was keen to cast Manju opposite Mohanlal. But no official confirmations came out, the production team remained silent leaving it as rumours only. Later in an interview, Amala confirmed that she would play the lead opposite Mohanlal and the shoot of the film would begin in August 2014. During the pre-production stage, there were reports about Sonu Sood playing the antagonist opposite Mohanlal. However, there was no official confirmation. In an interview Ramya Nambeeshan stated she would be a part of Lailaa O Lailaa in a cameo role. On 11 September 2014. Times of India reported that Ashvin Mathew had been cast in a role. It was also reported that Joy Mathew would be seen in the movie. It is the first time he is doing a film with Mohanlal. Bollywood actress Kainaat Arora is doing a pivotal role in the movie. \\"I really don't have the liberty to open up about my role. All I can say is that my character is pivotal to the story, and the central plot revolves around her. That's not all, I have a lot of combination scenes with Mohanlal,\\" she says.

Background  Derby had been represented by J.H. Thomas since 1910, a seat he held jointly with several other people because Derby was a two-member constituency until 1950. In 1936, Thomas was forced to resign from the government after being caught giving away secrets in the budget through coded messages. That was uncovered after he shouted \\"tee up\\" whilst golfing, to indicate a rise in tea tax. Thomas chose to step down from the House of Commons by being appointed as the Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds, an office of profit under the Crown which disqualifies MPs and causes a vacancy their constituency.  Election  National Labour selected Archibald Church to follow on as the Derby candidate. Church had previously been an MP for Leyton East and Wandsworth Central. Philip Noel-Baker was chosen to represent Labour and had the support of Liberal former Prime Minister David Lloyd George. The election was primarily fought on the issue of the British response to the Italian invasion of Abyssinia. Church's campaign had been damaged by Lord Allen of Hurtwood stating that \\"the National Government is no longer fit to represent the nation\\".

The Campaign to Fix the Debt was founded in July 2012 by Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson. In September 2012 they wrote, \\"If we can't get members of Congress to put aside their ultra-partisanship and pull together rather than apart, we face the most predictable economic crisis in history.\\" The Campaign comprises a variety of socio-economic and political views and engages business and government leaders alongside American citizens. Leadership Fix the Debt is chaired by Judd Gregg and Edward Rendell. In March 2017 they wrote of rising national debt, \\"Both parties have contributed to the problem, and leaders in both are unwilling to ruffle feathers and make the tough choices needed.\\" They said of gross national debt exceeding $22 trillion in February 2019, \\"This milestone is another sad reminder of the inexcusable tab our nation's leaders continue to run up and will leave for the next generation.\\" Steering committee As of 12 May 2017, the campaign's steering committee comprises the following members: * Michael Bloomberg * Phil Bredesen * Kent Conrad * David M. Cote * Pete Domenici * Vic Fazio * Jim McCrery * Sam Nunn * Michael Peterson * Steven Rattner * Alice Rivlin * Scott Smith * Antonio Villaraigosa * Robert Zoellick History The campaign was launched in late 2012 with print, digital, and outdoor advertisements and chapters across 17 states. One of the campaign's primary contributors was Peter George Peterson, a billionaire investor and former chairman and CEO of Lehman Brothers. Other early members included Ed Rendell, Judd Gregg, and Maya MacGuineas, who became the campaign's official spokesperson. In December 2012, MacGuineas said, ‚ÄúWe want a deal to happen, and want it to happen in a bipartisan way, because otherwise it‚Äôs not going to stick.‚Äù Over 300,000 people signed a petition demanding that policymakers fix the debt. The group's influence in the corporate sector quickly grew, as early members David M. Cote, Mark Bertolini, and Larry Fink began recruiting other big business associates. By November 2012, the organization's CEO Council was composed of approximately 150 executives. In the financial sector, Steven Rattner and James B. Lee, Jr. became the lead recruiters. The campaign proposed a July 4, 2013 deadline for a deficit reduction plan akin to the Simpson-Bowles plan, but was met with resistance at the grassroots and governmental levels. In a 2013 interview with the New Hampshire Union Leader, Cote identified the problem of debt reduction in the United States as being the fact that \\"Washington is ruled by fear of voters ... and the three 'h's' prevail‚Äîhysteria, histrionics and hyperbole\\". He also framed the options for deficit reduction in terms of increases in taxes and/or spending cuts.\\"Honeywell CEO, a Manchester native, takes on deficit, Social Security crisis\\". Dave Solomon, New Hampshire Union Leader, 11 February 2013. Retrieved 17 March 2015. In 2015, the campaign identified three goals in the 2016 presidential election: to incentivize candidates to create and follow through on fiscal strategies, to increase engagement with the public and the media on relevant issues, and to hold candidates responsible for statements made on fiscal policy. Following the November 2016 Presidential election and going into 2017, Rattner sought to explain growing divide within the campaign and the CEO Council's shifting focus from shrinking the debt to tax cuts as not being contradictory. Criticism The Fix the Debt campaign has been criticized since its inception for supporting corporate tax breaks while calling for cutting funds to Social Security and Medicare. Kevin Connor, director of the Public Accountability Initiative, as quoted in The New York Times, identified a possible conflict of interest between the broad objectives of the group and the reality of their day to day lobbying of Washington for favorable tax treatment of their own industries and continued government spending on programs that benefit their companies. He also pointed out that the group calls for a reduction in government spending on social security but not on defence spending, a major business area for Honeywell. \\"It‚Äôs easier to get face time in Washington as a deficit hawk than as a corporate hack,\\" he said, continuing \\"They are spending millions, but they are protecting billions in defense contracts and tax giveaways that would otherwise be on the chopping block.\\"\\"Public Goals, Private Interests in Debt Campaign\\" Nicholas Confessore, The New York Times, 9 January 2013.

It was recorded as the final song of side three of the LP on 19 September 1979, written by Lindsey Buckingham, whose sparser songwriting arrangements and the influence of punk rock and new wave were the leading creative force on it and other Tusk tracks. This was both the first and last song worked on for the Tusk album, and took almost a year to complete. Background While drummer Mick Fleetwood played drums on the track, Buckingham recorded another drum part on Kleenex boxes. In the 1970s, conventional drums were often in the forefront of the mix, which was something that Buckingham wanted to move away from when recording Tusk. Instead, Buckingham wanted to emulate what he heard on early rock and roll records, where the drums were more elusive. Cath Carroll, Fleetwood Mac biographer and author of a book on the creation of Rumours, likened the rhythm of \\"I Know I'm Not Wrong\\" to that of \\"The Ledge\\", another track from the Tusk album. \\"A silly little synth riff toward the end puts an odd-sounding date stamp on the piece and is, in its perky way, the most jarring element on the album. This song is another piece of brilliant concision, with a half-stated simple three-note chorus.\\"Carroll (2004) p. 189. She noted the track's \\"not-quite-there quality that Buckingham manages to coax out of his higher vocal register\\" which is common to several Tusk songs. The track \\"To Wild Homes\\" on The New Pornographers's record Mass Romantic features the melody of \\"I Know I'm Not Wrong\\" where A.C. Newman plays the song's melody over the fading chorus at the end of the track. Newman referred to it as \\"living proof that Tusk has haunted our music.\\" Other appearances A different mix of \\"I Know I'm Not Wrong\\" was included on the 2004 reissue of Tusk. This version features louder percussion and bass, additional guitars, and a harmonica layered over the synth solo. Along with this recording, three other early demos were included on the reissue; one was an early instrumental recorded at Buckingham's home studio, where Buckingham played all of the instruments. The two other recordings were both rough takes recorded with Fleetwood Mac. Many different outtakes of \\"I Know I'm Not Wrong\\" were also included on the 2015 reissue of Tusk, many of which had never been commercially released up to that point. \\"I Know I'm Not Wrong\\" was one of the many Tusk tracks rehearsed for the Tusk Tour, but was ultimately cut from the setlist for unknown reasons. However, Fleetwood Mac has performed the song on many recent tours. Its first appearance was in 2003 during the Say You Will Tour, replacing another Buckingham penned song, \\"Eyes of the World\\". On this tour, Mick Fleetwood's drum tech Steve Rinkov played additional drums on both songs. \\"I Know I'm Not Wrong\\" also appeared on their Unleashed Tour in 2009, and on the North American/European leg of their 2014/2015 tour On with the Show.

Vacancy The by-election was caused by the death of the sitting Conservative MP, George William Rickards on 27 November 1943. He had been MP here since holding the seat at the 1933 Skipton by-election. Election history Skipton had been won by the Conservatives at every election since 1918. At the 1933 by-election, the Conservatives had won on a minority vote in a four-way contest. The result at the last General election was as follows; Candidates *The local Conservatives selected 61-year-old local clothing manufacturer, Harry Riddiough. *The Labour party had reselected John Davies as their prospective parliamentary candidate for the general election expected to take place in 1939. He had contested the constituency at the previous general election in 1935. He had remained their candidate in waiting. At the outbreak of war, the Conservative, Liberal and Labour parties had agreed an electoral truce which meant that when a by-election occurred, the party that was defending the seat would not be opposed by an official candidate from the other two parties. When the Labour and Liberal parties joined the Coalition government, it was agreed that any by-election candidate defending a government seat would receive a letter of endorsement jointly signed by all the party leaders. *There was much irritation with the electoral truce within local Labour Party ranks. To this end, 57-year-old Mancunian Alderman Joseph Toole a former Labour MP for Salford South announced his candidature. He was a former Lord Mayor of Manchester from 1936-37. He stood as an Independent Labour candidate. He was promptly expelled from the Labour Party for breaking the war-time electoral truce. *On 9 December 1943 the Common Wealth Party put forward 31-year-old Leeds born engineer Lt. Hugh Lawson as their candidate. He had served in the Royal Engineers since 1940.‚ÄòLAWSON, Hugh McDowall‚Äô, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920‚Äì2014; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014 ; online edn, April 2014 accessed 4 September 2014 Campaign The writ was moved on 15 December 1943 and polling day was set for 7 January 1944, 41 days after the death of the previous MP. When nominations closed, it was to reveal a three horse race, Conservative candidate Harry Riddiough received a joint letter of endorsement from all the leaders of the parties in the coalition. His campaign was hopeful that support for those opposed to the Conservatives would be evenly split between his two opponents. As the only local candidate he hoped this would help his campaign. The Skipton District Labour Party decided to endorse Lawson, the Common Wealth candidate, in exchange for the guarantee that Lawson would stand down in favour of a Labour candidate at the next general election.By-Elections in British Politics by Cook and Ramsden This decision further isolated the candidacy of Joe Toole, the Independent Labour candidate. Toole's campaign was left with no local organisation.Trial By Ballot by Ivor RM Davies In contrast, the Lawson campaign took the shape of previous Common Wealth campaigns which had been successful at the 1943 Eddisbury by-election, organised by Kim MackayBy-Elections in British Politics by Cook and Ramsden and given the political direction of Richard Acland.Trial By Ballot by Ivor RM Davies In addition to full-time organisers, the Lawson campaign was supported by about 200 volunteers from outside the constituency.

The byelection was held due to the resignation of the incumbent Conservative MP, Henry Hunloke. Hunloke was the brother-in-law of Edward Cavendish, 10th Duke of Devonshire, who had held the seat from 1923 until 1938, when he succeeded to his title and was replaced by Hunloke. The seat had been held previously by Hunloke's father-in-law (1891-1908, before becoming the 9th Duke), and by the 9th Duke's brother-in-law, the future 6th Marquess of Lansdowne (1908-1918). This control by the Cavendish family had been interrupted in 1918-1923 by Charles Frederick White, who was elected as a Liberal. White died in 1923. His son, also Charles Frederick White, had stood for the seat in the 1938 by- election as a Labour candidate, but lost to Hunloke by 5,500 votes. The resignation of Hunloke was due to the imminent collapse of his marriage (he was divorced from his Cavendish wife the next year and remarried immediately). The Conservative Party then selected the Marquess of Hartington, the 10th Duke's eldest son & heir, as their candidate. The major parties had formed a national unity government during World War II and agreed that no by-elections would be contested during the war. In contravention of this agreement, Charles Frederick White stood in the by-election as an Independent Labour candidate.Paul Addison in Chris Cook & John Ramsden (eds.), By-elections in British Politics; UCL Press, 1997 pp. 142‚Äì144 In an acrimonious campaign, White pressed for social change, securing the support of local Labour activists.The Derbyshire Labour Movement: 1939-1945, accessed 14 May 2016 White won, defeating Cavendish by over 4,000 votes, a swing of 9,000 from 1938.

Williams was born in 1883. He was the eldest son of the chief editor at Reuters; both his brother and an uncle were also journalists. He replaced Austin Harrison as the Reuters correspondent in Berlin in 1905, aged 21. In 1908, he left Reuters to join the Daily Mail, filing stories from Paris and covering the Portuguese revolution of 1910. He was in the Balkans at the outbreak of World War I and became one of the first accredited war correspondents in March 1915. William Beach Thomas had been reporting the war for the Daily Mail in the period before official accreditations were granted. When the British government relented its opposition to the presence of journalists in 1915, having been warned by Theodore Roosevelt that reporting limitations were affecting public opinion in the United States, Williams stepped into the role. In December 1915, Williams enlisted for service in the Irish Guards and Beach Thomas took his place as an accredited reporter in France. Williams was awarded the Military Cross as a soldier and wrote two autobiographical books about his war-time experiences. In the aftermath of war, he travelled widely as a reporter, covering events such as the Versailles Peace Conference and the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamen, as well as events in America. Harold Nicolson met him in connection with events at Versailles and described in a diary entry that \\"He is far too intelligent to be employed by such a paper\\" (the Daily Mail). It was during this period that he began writing thrillers and around 1926 he gave up his post as Foreign Editor of the Daily Mail to pursue a full-time career as an author. Williams was too old for active service at the outbreak of World War II. He joined the Secret Intelligence Service, vetting potential new recruits such as Malcolm Muggeridge and Kim Philby. He was transferred to the British Embassy in Washington in 1941 but soon after left for Hollywood, where he worked as a scriptwriter for Twentieth-Century Fox and Metro-Goldwyn Mayer. Williams was married to Alice Crawford. He died in 1946.  Selected works  *, as by G.

Before the founding of the UK NHS, she said, \\"Families were forced to choose between buying medicine for their children or a loaf of bread... We must never ever go back to those days. She marched against welfare cuts, austerity and the closure of Whittington Hospital in North London. Biography  Bower was born in 1905 in Dalston, East London, when King Edward VII was the monarch and women were not given the right to vote in general elections. She was the seventh of ten children, and worked in schools, fashion, business and cinema. She founded the first women's association. As she grew older, she was inspired to campaign by her sister, Cissie Rimel. In 1923, aged 17, Bower joined the Labour Party. As a Labour party member, Bower participated in the 1926 General Strike and the Battle of Cable Street in 1936. Her husband was Reginald Bower. During World War II, Bower ran a refugee hostel for people departing Czechoslovakia. She was also a founding member of the Campaign For Nuclear Disarmament, better known as CND, in 1957. In her remaining years, she was invited to several political campaigning events. She enjoyed opera and liked listening to Caruso. She was 108 when she died, two months after giving a speech at the 2013 Labour Party Conference campaigning for peace and equal rights. Her last words were \\"Ban the bomb for ever\\". Upon her death, tributes were paid by Labour leader Ed Miliband, Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper and Green Party leader Natalie Bennett. She had met Miliband and Cooper at the 100th International Women's Day in 2011. The same year, The Guardian named her woman of the year.
