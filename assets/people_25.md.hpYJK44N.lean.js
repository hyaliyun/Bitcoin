The shoes are known for their small bow near the top of the vamp. History The shoes were designed by Henri Bendel, the nephew of Henri Bendel, the founder of the eponymous New York boutique. When the Bendel family sold the family's department store in 1955, Bendel established the Belgian Shoes boutique at 60 East 56th Street, Manhattan, before moving to the current address at 110 East 55th Street in 2001. Clients Belgian Shoes have been traditionally considered a status symbol among the Upper East Side and Hamptons social set, but have in the past several years become more widely worn. As early as the 1960s the shoe was considered notable as signifying a resistance to prevailing fashion trends, and there have been few significant changes to the range since then. Notable wearers of the shoe include Isaac Mizrahi. and Bernie Madoff. Awards For his efforts in reviving the Belgian shoe industry through the design and sale of the shoe, the Belgian government awarded Bendel the Knight of the Order of Leopold the First in 1964, and Knight Commander of the Order of Leopold the Second in 1970.

Its northern trailhead is at the point where the CN Waterloo Spur crosses Laurel Creek; it connects to the Laurel Trail there, and is close to Uptown Waterloo. Its southern trailhead is at Ahrens Street West near its intersection with Breithaupt Street, close to Kitchener station and downtown Kitchener. The trail is long, the entirety of which is paved. For its whole length, the trail runs parallel and to the north of the CN Waterloo Spur, stopping just short of where the Waterloo Spur joins the GO Transit Guelph Subdivision mainline at a junction just east of Kitchener station. History The Spurline Trail was established in 2016 through cooperation between regional and municipal governments, as well as Metrolinx, to formalize the existing, informal dirt trail running next to the Waterloo Spur, and to provide infrastructure upgrades such as lighting and a paved surface. In 2019, the City of Waterloo approved an additional trail improvement: a pedestrian island to be constructed in the middle of Union Street, in order to improve safety at the trail crossing point.

It was first assigned to the 16th Army just before the start of the winter counteroffensive west of Moscow before being very briefly reassigned to the 33rd Army and then to the 43rd Army during the fighting around Rzhev. In May, 1942 it was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for its services, one of the first rifle divisions to be so recognized. After partially rebuilding it was railed south to Southwestern Front to help meet the German summer offensive. It gave very creditable service in the 38th Army as an infantry division facing armored divisions but suffered significant losses before it was returned to the Moscow Military District in September. In November it was assigned to Kalinin Front and played an important role in the liberation of Velikiye Luki during the winter, primarily in helping to block several attempts to relieve the besieged city. It remained in that Front (renamed 1st Baltic Front in October, 1943) for most of the rest of the war, for the most part in both the 5th and 2nd Guards Rifle Corps, before moving with the latter to 6th Guards Army, where it remained for the duration, fighting through the Baltic states during the summer and autumn offensives of 1944. In March, 1945 it joined the Courland Group of Forces of Leningrad Front on the Baltic coast containing the German forces encircled in northwest Latvia. Following the German surrender it was disbanded later in 1945. Formation The division was officially raised to Guards status on November 26, 1941, although its sub- units would not be redesignated until February, 1942. Its order of battle, based on the last prewar (April 5, 1941) shtat (table of organization and equipment) for rifle divisions, was eventually as follows: * 18th Guards Rifle Regiment (from 40th Rifle Regiment) * 22nd Guards Rifle Regiment (from 258th Rifle Regiment) * 31st Guards Rifle Regiment (from 131st Rifle Regiment) * 28th Guards Artillery Regiment (from 159th Light Artillery Regiment)Charles C.

In his memoirs he recounted: Battle of Moscow The 78th was assigned to 16th Army at the time it was redesignated and was holding Istra on November 25 as the only division of the Army still on the west bank of the Istra River, straddling the road to Volokolamsk. By the end of November 26 forces of the 10th Panzer Division had been able to cross the river in some areas. The now-9th Guards fought for the city overnight, both within it and along the eastern bank of the river south of town along a line up to 15km in length. By 0400 hours on the next day it was forced to withdraw to Istra's eastern outskirts. On November 28 the division was forced to abandon the city entirely and fall back eastward to a line from Aleksino to Zhevnevo (6km west of Dedovsk) where it consolidated. During this fighting it came under regular bombing attacks from groups of 6‚Äì8 German aircraft. Over the following days the center and left flank forces of 16th Army, including the 9th Guards, were involved in heavy fighting in the area to the south of Solnechnogorsk and to the east of the Istra reservoir. The German panzer forces were seeking to break out of Kochergino and Yesipovo to the southeast. By the end of November 30 the division, along with the 8th and 7th Guards and 18th Rifle Divisions, was waging a fierce struggle along part of the line from Lyalovo to Alabushevo to Barantsevo to Zhevnevo. During December 2-3 the German forces managed to take Kryukovo after heavy street fighting but were unable to break through 16th Army's lines. The 9th Guards was engaged in heavy fighting with German infantry and tanks on the eastern outskirts of Nefedevo (3km north of Dedovsk) with the 36th Rifle Brigade arriving in support. Although this place was briefly given up, on December 5 a counterattack by the division, backed by the 17th Tank and 40th Rifle Brigades, retook it, as well as Turovo, by noon and continued to advance on Petrovskoe as the German forces began to go over to the defense.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of Moscow 1941-1942, ed. & trans. R. W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2015, Kindle ed., part III, ch. 3 =Winter Counteroffensive= On the evening of December 6 Lt. Gen. K. K. Rokossovsky, commander of 16th Army, reported to the Western Front command that the Army would go over to the attack at 1000 hours the next day and described his objectives (in part):The German forces put up fierce resistance along the entire front. The division was involved in heavy fighting for Rozhdestveno which involved bayonet attacks. The German forces, having consolidated in the houses and employing small arms and mortar fire, defended fiercely and the division's attack was unsuccessful. Despite such local successes the German forces as a whole began to withdraw to the west. On December 9 Rokossovsky created two shock groups to operate against the flanks and rear of the German forces; the second consisted of the 9th Guards, 17th Tank and 36th and 40th Rifle Brigades plus the 89th Tank Battalion to retake Istra and then attack to the north. The attack began the next day and by December 11 the pace of the German retreat was accelerating; 16th Army reached a line from Kurilovo to Maksimovka to Istra, which was liberated by the 9th Guards that day. Over the next five days the Army fought for possession of the Istra reservoir, which had its dyke destroyed by the German forces. The division made several attempts to cross to the western bank of the river which were unsuccessful in part due to its artillery falling behind due to the winter weather. By the end of the 13th it was better prepared to force a crossing. Overnight on December 14/15 it got two rifle regiments across the river covered by fire from the third and was fighting for Ilino and Yabedino, 5km west of Istra. By now the German positions along the Istra were deeply outflanked and their retreat continued, pursued by 16th Army towards Volokolamsk through to December 20. During this period the 9th Guards captured 199 motor vehicles, nine artillery pieces and nine tanks. By the 22nd it was closing up to the Ruza River, which formed the next German defense line. The next day the 16th Army regrouped to its right flank to resume the offensive on December 24, but the German line proved hard to crack and this effort gained little ground over the next days.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of Moscow, Kindle ed., part IV, ch. 2 At the start of January, 1942 the division was on its Army's left flank linking to 5th Army to its south. On January 2 it reached a line from Danilkovo to Zakhryapino and over the next two weeks advanced from that line to the southwest which helped to force the German defenders to fall back from the Ruza in the direction of Gzhatsk. The 9th Guards continued to pursue and by January 20 had taken the villages of Soslavino, Isakovo and Potapovo while advancing in the direction of Myshkino. In three weeks the 16th Army had advanced 15km along its center and from 22-25km along its flanks.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of Moscow, Kindle ed., part V, ch. 4, 6 Later in January the division was transferred to the 33rd Army, still in Western Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942, p. 27 =Rzhev-Vyasma Operation= At the time of the transfer a strike group of three rifle divisions of 33rd Army had penetrated the German front south of Medyn in an effort to seize Vyasma, a vital rail hub in the German rear.Svetlana Gerasimova, The Rzhev Slaughterhouse, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2013, pp. 38-39 9th Guards was ordered to force-march 150km in four days to reach Medyn, starting on January 27. At this time the rifle regiments were reduced to 250-300 personnel each, with several hundred horses missing and most of the motor transport in need of repair. Upon reaching Medyn General Beloborodov was ordered to join the battle from the march by entering a corridor up to 70km long and about 8km wide that led to the positions of the strike group. The leading 131st Rifle Regiment had entered the corridor on February 2 just as a counterstrike was launched by the 5th Panzer Division and other forces to cut it. Almost immediately Beloborodov received new orders moving the division to the command of 43rd Army; he was also to remove his forces from the corridor and strike back at the German pincers. In the event only one battalion of the 131st made it out while the other two and two companies of the sapper battalion were encircled.http://militera.lib.ru/memo/russian/beloborodov2/06.html. In Russian. Retrieved September 20, 2019. Over the next two weeks the remainder of the division fought a series of battles for the village of Zakharovo, which was the key to relieving the encircled troops. The initial attacks were stymied largely due to a shortage of ammunition for the divisional artillery. On February 11 shells started arriving, along with 250 experienced replacements. A new plan was put together the next day which involved an early afternoon attack with a more sophisticated artillery preparation, an outflanking move to the south by the 258th Regiment, and close cooperation with the flanking 1st Guards Motor and 17th Rifle Divisions. The attack began at 1400 hours on February 13 and soon the 3rd Battalion of the 258th, using a deep ravine for cover, broke into the eastern outskirts of the village. Soon after the 40th Regiment, with the 33rd Ski Battalion, entered its north side. In a decisive move at 1600 hours two companies of the 258th on skis bypassed the village and cut the garrison's road to the rear. A relief column of tanks, armored halftracks and trucks was engaged and largely destroyed by antitank rifles, antitank guns, and the indirect fire of the 210th Howitzer Artillery Regiment. By evening the village was completely liberated, with few German troops escaping to the west.http://militera.lib.ru/memo/russian/beloborodov2/06.html. In Russian. Retrieved September 20, 2019. Over the next ten days the German 17th Infantry Division, supported by tanks and aircraft, made several attempts to retake Zakharovo but these were held off while the 9th Guards continued to advance slowly towards the Vorya River into the former corridor. During this time the division received word that most of its sub-units had also been given Guards numbers. On February 27 the 18th and 22nd Guards Regiments began fighting for the village of Beryoza on the Vorya. The division was now approaching the area where the battalions of the now-31st Regiment had been encircled nearly a month earlier. Through tenuous communications the divisional command was aware that the survivors were still holding, and they began breaking out the following night as the division attacked towards the village of Berezki. Nearly all these men were evacuated to the field hospital, suffering from wounds, injuries or frostbite. In early March the division forced a bridgehead over the Vorya in cooperation with the 93rd and 415th Rifle Divisions and over the following days advanced towards the Ugra River in an effort to allow the still-encircled 33rd Army to escape westward. In the end only small groups and individuals were able to reach the 9th Guards sector, where the division remained until ordered to return to Medyn on April 16. As the division moved to the rear it was assigned to the 58th Army in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command and on April 22 it concentrated near the town of Kondrovo.http://militera.lib.ru/memo/russian/beloborodov2/06.html.

On June 22 the German 1st Panzer and 6th Armies launched Operation Fridericus II as a follow-up to the Kharkov fighting and to set the stage for the main summer offensive. The German advance was generally swift, but on June 24-25 the motorized infantry of 16th Panzer Division met methodical and determined resistance from the 9th Guards on the approaches to the Moskovka and Oskol rivers near Kupiansk:This stand, supported by the 6th Guards Tank Brigade and 1st Destroyer (Antitank) Division, helped the remnants of the Army's 162nd, 199th, 278th and 304th Rifle Divisions to escape from encirclement and across the Oskol to a new defense line.David M. Glantz, To the Gates of Stalingrad, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2009, pp. 98-102 When Army Group South launched the second phase of Operation Blue on July 6 the 38th Army faced XVII Army Corps and XXXX Panzer Corps. The panzers made a spectacular advance on the first day but soon ran short of fuel. With what little remained a battlegroup of 3rd Panzer Division captured the Kalitva River bridges at Rossosh. This effort unhinged the defenses of Southwestern Front and 38th Army was authorized to retreat from the Oskol to a line situated 35-40km to the east along the Aidar River. However the situation worsened when 3rd Panzer reached Olkhovatka on July 8. The 28th and 38th Armies were again threatened with envelopment and in response Moskalenko formed a combat group from the 9th Guards, 199th and 304th Rifle Divisions and 3rd Tank Brigade and dispatched it northward to form a covering screen between Rovenki and Kantemirovka, although the latter fell to XXXX Panzer before it could be reached. This move allowed these divisions to eventually withdraw north of the Don, and by August 1 the 9th Guards had been reassigned to 21st Army.Glantz, To the Gates of Stalingrad, pp. 171-76, 276 On July 21 the 18th Guards Rifle Regiment was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for its services.http://militera.lib.ru/memo/russian/beloborodov2/08.html.

After forcing a crossing of the Lovat River and bypassing Velikiye Luki to the southwest, its objective was to cut the rail lines from Velikiye Luki to Nevel and Velikiye Luki to Novosokolniki, and to link up with other forces of 3rd Shock advancing from the northeast to encircle the city. The 357th Rifle Division was to then storm the city from the west while the 9th Guards continued the advance on Novosokolniki. 46th Guards Rifle Division, on the left flank, was to cover the other two divisions against counterattacks from the southwest. On the eve of the offensive, forward detachments of all three divisions crossed the Lovat, suppressed the German advanced positions along the west bank, and then advanced to their main line along the Nevel railway; this reconnaissance-in- force both revealed much of the enemy fire plan and put artillery observers in position to direct fire against it in the opening preparation. As reinforcement, the 9th Guards was assigned the 36th Tank Regiment and the Corps' artillery regiment, the 41st Guards, consisting of 122mm guns and 152mm howitzers. Altogether, with its own assets and the divisional and regimental artillery, the Corps had about 45 barrels per kilometre on the breakthrough front.

The night of November 24 was foggy, which hindered German illumination flares as the Soviet forward detachments crossed the river and entered no-mans-land and the German advanced posts fell back to their main position. By 0800 hours on November 25 the Corps had seized a bridgehead of about 14 square kilometres, and the 18th Guards Regiment captured the villages of Pokorevo, Andreikino and Makarovo. However, the supporting tanks had fallen behind during the night approach. The fog lifted after 1000 hrs., allowing the 30-minute artillery preparation to begin. The infantry attack began at 1100 hrs., but developed slowly because the enemy fire system could not be fully suppressed. As the 357th Division attacked Peschanka it came under flanking fire from height 158.1, as did the 18th Guards advancing on Bogoroditskoye. The fighting for this village, dominated by a fortified schoolhouse, went on into the evening when three tanks finally arrived. This support and the direct fire of antitank guns helped clear the place by 2000 hours, after which the regiment advanced to the Velikiye Luki - Nevel railway. The 1st Battalion of the 22nd Guards Regiment seized height 158.1 and held it in the face of heavy German counterattacks. Meanwhile, the 508th Guards Rifle Regiment of the 46th Guards found a gap in the main German line, and over the next day exploited into the depth of their defense, with the 18th Guards Regiment ordered to support this advance early on November 26.http://militera.lib.ru/memo/russian/beloborodov2/08.html.

The division's push faced several German counterattacks, including one by two companies of infantry supported by seven tanks which broke into the division's rear at Bogoroditskoye. General Prostyakov was forced to throw his reserves (the training battalion and two platoons of the 12th Reconnaissance Company) into battle to drive them back. During the night of November 27 the division's formations were restructured; the 22nd Regiment took up the defensive on a wide front while the 31st Regiment was brought in to assist the 18th in the breakthrough. On the same night a group of scouts from the division penetrated into the German rear and took prisoners, confirming that a regiment of the 3rd Mountain Division had arrived from Novosokolniki and tanks of the 20th Panzergrenadier Division were appearing from Nevel. During fighting that day with German infantry and tanks the commander of the 31st Regiment, Col. Nikolai Gavrilovich Dokuchaev, was mortally wounded; he was replaced by his deputy, Maj. A. I. Belev. On November 28 the 9th Guards and 357th Divisions linked up with the 381st which created an inner pocket of the Velikiye Luki garrison and an outer pocket of the remaining defending forces, consisting of two regiments of 83rd Infantry Division and the 138th Mountain Regiment, which were holding out in and around the village of Shiripino.http://militera.lib.ru/memo/russian/beloborodov2/08.html.

The offensive, in which the 9th Guards had a leading role, began as planned and opened a gap on a 10 km front by the next day, and gained as much as 10 km in depth over 10 days of fighting, before the German forces were able to rebuild a continuous front.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, pp. 141-42 During this drive, on November 12 the 18-year-old Guards Sen. Sgt. Vladimir Efimovich Smirnov, a squad leader of the division, led the defense against German counterattacks on the village of Derebische, accounting for 12 German soldiers himself. Two days later, during a battle for a height near the village of Shumshino, Smirnov discovered a hidden German machine-gun post and flung himself upon it, at the cost of his life. On June 4, 1944 he was posthumously made a Hero of the Soviet Union.http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=12341. In Russian; English translation available. Retrieved September 30, 2019. 39th Army, this time with 5th Guards Corps in the lead, began another joint offensive with 43rd Army on December 19, again striking the defenses of 14th Infantry east of Vitebsk, on the Borok - Goriane sector, backed by nearly 100 tanks. The attack made very limited gains, and 5th Guards Corps was withdrawn and sent south of the Smolensk - Vyasma road on December 21, with the entire offensive shut down two days later. This redeployment was made in order to reinforce a new assault by 33rd Army on this sector, which began on December 23. 9th Guards was deployed on the Corps' left (south) flank, with the immediate objective of the village of Laputi, although the overall goal of the offensive was to link up with 4th Shock Army and encircle the German forces in Vitebsk. By December 26, 5th Guards Corps had advanced a mere 2‚Äì3 km, leading to a caustic telegram from the STAVKA to the 1st Baltic Front, demanding greater progress. Despite this, 39th Army only managed to gain another 1‚Äì2 km by December 28 before stalling completely, while 33rd Army soldiered on until January 6, 1944.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, pp. 231-34, 291-97 The offensive was renewed on January 8. 5th Guards Corps formed 39th Army's shock group on a 6 km-wide between the Smolensk - Vitebsk road and the village of Vaskova, facing the 206th Infantry Division. The division was in the first echelon, with 19th Guards and 91st Guards Rifle Divisions, backed by two tank brigades and the 17th Guards in second echelon. By now these divisions were at less than 40 percent of authorized strength. Although the German forces were similarly weakened, 5th Guards Corps' attack floundered after an advance of only about 1000m. Although 33rd and 5th Armies to the south made greater progress, it was at a heavy cost, and the offensive was finally shut down late in the month.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, pp. 320-21, 328-29 On January 30 General Prostyakov was given command of the 8th Guards Rifle Corps in 11th Guards Army, and was replaced by Col. Porfirii Martynovich Gudz. Through the rest of January and most of February 5th Guards Corps was in reserve in 39th Army, which had been reassigned to Western Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 40 Near the end of the month it was ordered the Karamidy region astride the familiar Smolensk - Vitebsk road. A new offensive began on February 29, but just prior to its start the German command withdrew several units east of Vitebsk, including the 206th Infantry, back to shorter and more defensible lines. The STAVKA took this as a preliminary to a full withdrawal from the Vitebsk salient, and ordered a pursuit. This soon turned into yet another bloody frontal assault against fixed defenses. 9th Guards was in the first echelon but even after the commitment of 19th Guards Division on March 5 it was clear that the operation was a failure, after gaining just several hundred metres (apart from the voluntary withdrawals) at heavy cost. This marked the end of major fighting on this sector until summer.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, pp. 320, 375-80 =Operation Bagration= Later in March the 9th Guards returned to 2nd Guards Corps which was now part of 6th Guards Army;Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 99 it would remain under these commands for the duration of the war. In preparation for the summer offensive the subunits of the division fought many small actions to gain information on German deployment and fire plans. On May 18 Jr. Lt. Anatoly Grigorevich Myagchilov was ordered to break through the German lines in the Idritsa district with his platoon of the 18th Guards Regiment to make a passage for a reconnaissance party and to then seize a hill to cover its withdrawal. The hill was taken but only Myagchilov and six of his men remained when their position came under artillery and mortar fire. During the following counterattacks 50 German infantrymen and two officers were killed or wounded. Myagchilov, who had been wounded in the face by mortar fragments, took his own life to avoid capture. On July 22 he was posthumously made a Hero of the Soviet Union.http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=13799. In Russian; English translation available. Retrieved September 30, 2019. On June 6 Colonel Gudz handed his command to Maj. Gen. Nikolai Ivanovich Babakhin, who had previously commanded the 71st Guards Rifle Division. In the three nights before the Soviet summer offensive the 6th Guards made an approach march of 110km to a new sector of 1st Baltic Front 30km wide that had been vacated by 43rd Army to the south. This move was not noticed by the German command until the battle began on June 22. 2nd Guards Corps was in the Army's second echelon and even on the second and third days was struggling to keep up with the lead elements which had reached the Western Dvina River but not yet broken through the German defenses there. This was left to 2nd Guards Corps on June 25 which forced a crossing at Beshankovichy with support from the 3rd Air Army, followed by the 1st Rifle Corps of 43rd Army. By June 28 there were two large gaps to the north and south of the retreating German IX Army Corps and the 6th Guards was pushing into both. The previous night the 2nd Guards Corps and 1st Tank Corps had attacked the 252nd Infantry Division and only 300 of its men had managed to escape. By the afternoon of June 29 the remnants of IX Corps were holding a small semi-circle about 75km southwest of Polotsk with a gap over 50km wide stretching to its north, giving 6th Guards Army free rein to advance towards the Baltic states.Dunn, Jr., Soviet Blitzkrieg, pp. 97, 102, 104, 106, 110-12 On the same day, while the 18th and 22nd Regiments were mopping up defeated German forces from the forests around Selishche and Zhuravno, General Babakhin was killed in the explosion of an antitank mine.Aleksander A. Maslov, Fallen Soviet Generals, Frank Cass Publishers, London, UK, 1998, pp. 145, 221. Note this source misnumbers the 18th Regiment as the 16th. He was replaced the following day by Col. Yakov Yakovlevich Verbov. Baltic Offensives As of July 8 the 9th Guards was located not far west of Polotsk, while most of its Army had advanced as far as Sharkawshchyna. On July 21 Colonel Verbov was succeeded in command by Col. Valerii Ivanovich Savchuk. During fighting for the village of Plusy, 20km north of Braslaw in Belarus on July 24 Guards Captain Ivan Nikitivich Volchkov, commander of a rifle platoon of the 22nd Guards Regiment, led the defense of an important height nearby during counterattacks by German infantry and tanks. Despite being wounded he refused to leave the battlefield and was eventually killed in a desperate attack at the head of five remaining men. On March 24, 1945 he was posthumously recognized as a Hero of the Soviet Union.http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=10758. In Russian, English translation available.

Two weeks later, when Operation Doppelkopf began, the division was on the defense north of Bir≈æai. Once this counteroffensive was dealt with the 9th Guards continued to advance westward into Lithuania during September and October.The Gamers, Inc., Baltic Gap, Multi-Man Publishing, Inc., Millersville, MD, 2009, pp. 14, 22, 27-28, 35 On October 31 the 31st Guards Rifle Regiment received recognition for its role in the liberation of ≈†iauliai with the award of the Order of the Red Banner. The division saw three more changes of command before the war ended. On November 2 Maj. Gen. Dmitrii Semenovich Kuropatenko succeeded Colonel Savchuk, but he in turn was replaced on December 21 by Lt. Col. Fyodor Girgorevich Krivomlin. Finally, on January 28, 1945 Col. Bauyrzhan Momyshuly took over command. Momyshuly was by now a minor celebrity in the USSR following the publication of Aleksandr Bek's novel Volokolamsk Highway the previous year; the main character is a lightly-fictionalized version of him serving as a battalion commander in the 316th Rifle Division in front of Moscow in October, 1941. 6th Guards Army moved to the Kurland Group in Leningrad Front in March, where it remained for the duration.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1945, p. 111 Following the German surrender the division carried the full title: 9th Guards Rifle, Order of the Red Banner Division.

Lorena was the thirteenth named storm and seventh hurricane of 2019 Pacific hurricane season. Lorena formed from the stronger of two disturbances off the coast of Mexico. The disturbance closest to Mexico became Tropical Storm Lorena, while the other disturbance became Tropical Storm Mario. Lorena strengthened in a favorable environment, and made landfall as a 75 mph Category 1 hurricane in southwestern Mexico on September 18, but weakened back to a tropical storm due to land interaction. However, after moving back over water between Baja California Sur and mainland Mexico, Lorena re-strengthened into a hurricane, and reached its peak intensity with 85 mph winds and a minimum barometric pressure of 986 millibars. Lorena made a second landfall on Baja California Sur, and quickly weakened thereafter. Lorena degenerated to a remnant low over the Gulf of California. The remnant low moved inland over Mexico and quickly dissipated.  Meteorological history  At 15:00 UTC September 11, the NHC noted the possibility of a low pressure region forming off of the Central American coast. At 6:00 UTC September 14, a low pressure area formed and slowly developed and by 15:00 UTC September 17, it developed into Tropical Storm Lorena off of the coast of Mexico. Lorena gradually moved northwest towards the coast of Mexico while strengthening and by 3:00 UTC September 19, Lorena reached an initial peak intensity of 75 mph. Interaction with land caused Lorena to weaken below hurricane status by 15:00 UTC September 19. Lorena continued moving west-northwestward and regained hurricane status by 15:00 UTC September 20. Lorena would intensify further and peak at 21:00 UTC September 20 with winds at 85 mph and a pressure of 985 millibars. By midday on September 21, Lorena's structure began to deteriorate. Due to increasing wind shear and weakening caused by the mountainous terrain of Baja California, Lorena degenerated into a tropical depression by mid- morning on September 22, becoming a remnant low by that evening. Tropical Storm Mario (left) and Lorena (right) situated off the Mexican coast on September 19 Preparations and Impact =Guerrero and Michoac√°n= On Wednesday, September 18, Lorena greatly affected the states of Guerrero and Michoac√°n. There were reports of heavy rainfall and downed trees. =Colima and Jalisco= Lorena moved very close to shore and interacted with land in the states of Colima and Jalisco. Flooded streets, washed out roads, minor slides in 10 municipalities, and dozens of downed trees were reported. Power was knocked out in some areas. Governor of Colima, Jos√© Ignacio Peralta, stated that nearly 8 inches of rain fell over the course of 24 hours, and more than 7,400 acres of crops such as bananas and papayas were damaged statewide. He also reported that no one had died due to Lorena. Governor of Jalisco, Enrique Alfaro Ram√≠rez, stated on Twitter that Civil Protection services and the navy are attending to people in need, but there have been no reports of loss of life. The Cuixmala River broke its banks in the municipality of La Huerta and flooded agricultural land. Damage in Jalisco were calculated at 17.7 million pesos (US$910,000). =Baja California Sur= Once Lorena moved along the southwestern coast of Mexico, the government of Mexico issued a hurricane watch for the southern coast of Baja California as the storm was expected to make landfall there as a hurricane. Once it moves away from the coast and started moving closer to Baja California Sur, people started to barricade doors and windows and pull their boats from the ocean in preparation for Lorena's inevitable impacts. Government officials closed down schools and will convert it to shelters if conditions warrants. As Lorena started to move parallel to the peninsula's coast, authorities in Los Cabos said that 787 people have taken refuge in 18 shelters; however, many tourists did not take precautions and still traveled to Los Cabos despite Lorena. Many flights in and out of Los Cabos International Airport were canceled on Friday. The Coordinaci√≥n Nacional de Protecci√≥n Civil declared a state of emergency in La Paz and Los Cabos, Baja California Sur on September 22. In Los Cabos, a father and son were swept out to sea by a large wave. The father ultimately drowned while trying to save his son. =Arizona= The remnants of Hurricane Lorena brought locally heavy rain to parts of Arizona on September 22‚Äì24. Precipitation peaked at near Phoenix. On September 23, a supercell thunderstorm produced a brief EF0 tornado in New River in Maricopa County.

Snodgrass owns and manages a strategic advisory firm in Northern Virginia, serving government and tech industry clients. His book Holding the Line: Inside Trump's Pentagon with Secretary Mattis was released in October 2019. The book details key decisions and moments during Mattis' time as Secretary of Defense and provides the author's first-hand look into the relationship between Mattis and Trump, the Pentagon, The White House, and American national security decision making.  Early life  A native of Colleyville, Texas, Guy Snodgrass attended Grapevine High School. He graduated with honors from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1998 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. Immediately following graduation, he attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he earned two master's degrees (master's thesis was ‚ÄúBenchmark Test Problem for Measuring Anomalous Dissipation in Shock Hydrodynamics Simulations,‚Äù conducted with Los Alamos National Laboratory).  Military career  A career F/A-18 Hornet pilot, Snodgrass flew combat sorties from an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf in direct support of Operation Iraqi Freedom during his first tour of duty with Strike Fighter Squadron 131. Following this tour, he was selected to serve as a TOPGUN instructor at the US Navy Strike Fighter Weapons School located in Fallon, Nevada. From 2008 to 2011, he served as a training officer and department head with Strike Fighter Squadron 102 based at Naval Air Facility Atsugi, located in Ayase, Japan. During this tour, Snodgrass was selected as the 2008 Strike Fighter Wing Pacific Pilot of the Year, 2009 Strike Fighter Wing Pacific Tactical Aviator of the Year, 2010 Naval Air Forces Michael G. Hoff Attack Aviator of the Year, and received the 2010 Naval Air Forces Pacific Navy and Marine Corps Leadership Award. He was also selected as a national finalist for the White House Fellows program. In 2011, Snodgrass attended the United States Naval War College located in Newport, Rhode Island, earning a Master of Arts in national security and strategic studies. Snodgrass was subsequently selected for the U.S. Navy's 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review team, where he assessed U.S. Navy force structure and made recommendations regarding future fleet design. During this tour, he was selected to serve as speechwriter to Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jonathan Greenert in the Pentagon in 2012. In the autumn 2014 edition of the Naval War College Review, Snodgrass published \\"Keep a Weather Eye on the Horizon: A Navy Officer Retention Study.\\" The study and associated writings grabbed the attention of junior officers and senior leaders across the Navy. Snodgrass' findings and assertions changed the retention conversation and helped launch early talent management conversations in the Navy and across DoD. Following his Pentagon tour, Snodgrass returned overseas to Naval Air Facility Atsugi, Japan, to assume command of Strike Fighter Squadron 195. During this time, he created the 2015 Far East Commanders Conference, later renamed to the Pacific Warfighter Symposium, when it became hosted by the United States Pacific Fleet in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. He also created and hosted the Benkyoukai Initiative, a partnership between US Navy fighter squadrons based in Japan and the Japanese Air Self Defense Force to exchange knowledge and practice aerial war fighting. His command subsequently earned the US Navy's Battle Efficiency award, presented annually to the finest US Navy F/A-18 squadron in the Western Hemisphere. Snodgrass served as Chief Speechwriter and Director of Communications to Secretary of Defense James Mattis from April 2017 to August 2018. He is the author of the Department of Defense's officially released Unclassified Summary of the 2018 National Defense Strategy. = Holding the Line = Released in October 2019, Holding the Line: Inside the Pentagon With General Mattis is a book written based on Snodgrass's time as Mattis's speechwriter and Chief of Communications. It was submitted to the Pentagon's censors in April 2019. Snodgrass' manuscript was initially stonewalled and delayed during the Pentagon review process, leading him to take legal action against his former employer. He won a complex First Amendment fight concerning the release of a book regarding his time at the Pentagon. While the book contains no classified information, it was being held up because of the military's discomfort with the description of non-classified discussions in Pentagon conference rooms. In August 2019, Snodgrass sued the Pentagon, alleging that they had baselessly stalled the release of his book, trying to delay it so that Mattis's own book would be released first. Released emails from the suit show that the Pentagon told Snodgrass, \\"Senior leaders have directed my office to hold our response pending the outcome of high level discussions,\\" The Pentagon released the book for publication in September 2019, a week after Mattis's book release.  Civilian career  Snodgrass is the Chief Executive Officer of Defense Analytics, a strategic advisory firm in Washington, DC and is a regular contributor to the Washington Post, Politico, Fox Business, CNN, USA Today, and elsewhere. He is a member of numerous professional societies and organizations including the U.S. Naval Institute Board of Directors.www.usni.org/about-us/board-directors (as of October 30, 2019)  Personal life  Snodgrass lives in the Washington metropolitan area.

It serves as an arterial highway between the Aomori Prefecture Route 27 and the central district of the city. The road is managed by the government of Aomori Prefecture. Route description National Route 4 Starting from its southern terminus at an intersection with Aomori Prefecture Route 27, Aomori Prefecture Route 120 travels north towards the central district of Aomori.

Continuing north, the road travels through a heavily commercialized area with access to many restaurants, a mall, and pachinko parlors. The road then crosses into the central district of Aomori when it is carried by a bridge over the Aoimori Railway Line. This bridge, the , was the site of toll booths that were removed in 2006. The Route 120 next has an intersection with National Route 4 where it joins it heading towards Aomori Station. While running concurrently with National Route 4, the National Highway ends and transitions to National Route 7. Shortly after this transition, Route 120 leaves the concurrency, heading north to its northern terminus at an intersection with Aomori Prefecture Route 16 (Shinmachi Street) just east of Aomori Station. History The route was established in 1961 as a prefecture-maintained route. In 1986 the road was upgraded to a tolled road called the Aomori-ch≈´≈ç ≈åhashi Toll Road.

The song is a hillbilly folk song, the foundation of early country music. The song became a hit in 1929. The song is a sad tale of a love that had been lost far across the sea, set to traditional English folk music. The song peaked at #10 on the national pop music charts. Due to the song's popularity and historical importance, many have covered the song. Some artist shorten the title to Broken Ties or Broken Vows or Broken Hearted Lovers. In February of 1939 on XET Station, Mexico, Sara Carter dedicated the song to her long lost boyfriend Coy Bays, who was in Washington State at the time. On February 20, 1939 Sara Carter and Coy Bayes married at Brackettville, Texas. Mother Maybelle used the Carter Family picking on the song, which was new at the time, the bass notes are played with her thumb and she strums with her other fingers.

She was the sister of Alfred Deakin, to whom she was very close. He served as Prime Minister of Australia. Early life and education Catherine Deakin was born in Adelaide, South Australia in 1850. Her parents were William and Sarah Bill Deakin. In 1851, the family moved to Fitzroy, outside of Melbourne. Her brother, Alfred Deakin, was born in 1856. From 1858-1862, Deakin attended school in Kyneton at Miss Thomson's School and from 1863 until 1865 she attended Miss Thomson's School in South Yarra. It was at these schools where Deakin learned to play piano. Deakin studied at Presbyterian Ladies' College, Melbourne before matriculating to the University of Melbourne. At the time, she was the only woman to pass the matriculation examination. She graduated from the Melbourne School of Music in 1882. Career and adult life Deakin taught piano and music theory privately, including to her brother Alfred's daughters, Ivy, Vera and Stella. She taught the children at The Elms, where Deakin lived with her parents. She was fluent in French and was \\"extremely well read\\" in politics and literature. She was in the same social circle as Ferdinand von Mueller. Deakin never married. However, she was in love with John Henning Thompson, a school master. Her family disapproved of their relationship. =Relationship with her brother, Alfred Deakin= Deakin remained close with her brother her entire life. Alfred frequently referred to Deakin in his diary, calling her \\"K\\". Historian Marjorie R. Theobald described Deakin as the most important person in Alfred's life. She advised Alfred on political and intellectual matters, influencing his role as Australian prime minister. Deakin served as a pseudo- surrogate mother to Deakin's daughters, specifically when they were travelling internationally. She travelled regularly with the girls, accompanying them to Berlin and Budapest for studies. Later life and legacy Deakin died at The Elms on 3 November 1937. She is buried at St Kilda Cemetery.

It operated from about 1860 to about 1906. It was the last Welsh slate quarry connected only to a trans- shipment point instead of directly to a railway.  History  Extract from the 1887 Ordnance Survey map, showing Cwm Ebol quarry = Cwmebol Slab and Slate= Cwm Ebol quarry started working on a small scale around 1860, worked by the Cwmebol Slab and Slate Co. Ltd. An open pit was dug into the slate vein, and initially slabs were worked in the mill next to the pit. The mill was powered by a waterwheel. In 1870 there were calls for a railway station to be built at Pennal, partly in anticipation of the output of Cwm Ebol. In early 1874, the company failed and the quarry was put up for sale. There was a fatal accident at the quarry on 30 April 1874, when quarryman Jacob Davies was crushed by a falling rock while working to clear an earlier fall. = New Cwmebol Slate and Slab= In 1875 the quarry was taken over by the New Cwmebol Slate and Slab Co. Ltd. The company built a new, lower mill which was completed in 1876, and they were exploring a second vein which they hoped could be worked to produce roofing slates. The company chairman was F. Thompson, and the quarry manager was R. G. Elwes. = John Jenkins = By 1883, the quarry had been purchased by John Jenkins of Aberystwyth. He remained the owner for the rest of the quarry's history. In 1885, the quarry produced just 257 tons of finished product. There was another fatal accident on 26 June 1894. Hugh Owen was repairing a drive pelt in the mill, when he got pulled into the machinery and was crushed. He died on 1 July of head injuries.  Decline and closure  The quarry, never a great success, struggled in the late 1890s. In 1898 only twelve workers were employed there. In 1900, 19-year-old Llewelyn Jones lost an arm during blasting operations. A fuse had failed to go off, and Jones had been inspecting it when the charge ignited. Evan Jones, the quarry manager was subsequently fined ¬£2 10s (equivalent to ¬£ in 2018) for not properly enforcing the blasting rules. In July 1903, Jenkins was charged with not paying the rates due on the quarry and ordered to pay the ¬£14 due for 1902 and 1903. The quarry was down to just eight workers in 1903. The quarry closed in 1906 and in 1907, the company was advertising the quarry machinery for sale.  Transport  During the 1860s, slate from Cwm Ebol was carted to a wharf at Llyn y Bwtri, on the north bank of the Afon Dyfi, to the south of Pennal. In 1865, the company built a long tramway to connect the quarry with the wharf. The tramway was originally built to gauge, both internally within the quarry complex, and for the longer line which was nearly long. It was later converted to gauge. It originally crossed the Machynlleth to Aberdyfi road at Pennal to reach the river wharf. By 1887, the tramway terminated at the road with slate being loaded onto the Cambrian Railways at Machynlleth. It was the last Welsh slate quarry connected only to a trans- shipment point instead of directly to a railway or to a sea port. The lower trackbed of the tramway was re-used between 1918 and 1920 for another gauge tramway that served timber felling operations at Cwm Dwr, north of Pennal.  Quarry reservoir  A large reservoir was built above the quarry, damning the Nant Cwm Ebol. The reservoir provided water to power the mill machinery in the quarry, initially by waterwheel and later using a Pelton wheel. The reservoir was maintained after the quarry closed. In 2012, after prolonged heavy rains across Mid Wales, the dam wall was breached. 600 residents of Pennal and surrounding houses were evacuated, and a controlled release of water took place to reduce the level in the reservoir. A permanent channel was cut into the dam to prevent a recurrence of the problem.

Finn Devold led the proclamation from Finnsbu in the southeastern area. Finn Devold (born 24 April 1902 in Bergen, died 26 May 1977) was a Norwegian Arctic explorer, marine biologist and meteorologist. His father was parish priest Harald Ophus Devold. Together with his brother Hallvard Devold, Finn shared the same interest in the Arctic areas and in the expansion of Norwegian sovereignty in Greenland. Biography Finn interrupted his science studies and traveled to the Arctic in 1923. Together with his brother Hallvard he worked at the Kvadehuken meteorology station in Svalbard which had been established in 1920 by the Geophysical Institute of Troms√∏. While there he took part in a rescue operation of two English airmen whose aircraft had crash-landed nearby. In October 1924 the Kvadehuken facility was closed up for financial reasons and less than two years later he and his brother moved to the meteorological station in Jan Mayen. In 1927 Finn measured the elevation of Beerenberg, a volcano that is the island's highest point. After leaving Jan Mayen in 1928 Finn traveled to northeastern Greenland with his brother, who was a leader of the \\"Greenland case\\" (Gr√∏nlandssaken), a movement that sought to bring large swathes of East Greenland under Norwegian sovereignty. During that time (1927‚Äì28) he also became Fridtjof Nansen's assistant.Ingolf R√∏ttingen, lengre omtale fra Havforskningsinstituttet og kronikk i Bergens Tidende (24.4.2002) =Norwegian claims in East Greenland= Finn took an active part in the 1931‚Äì33 Norwegian territorial claim movement in Greenland led from Myggbukta Station, where his brother was leader of expeditions that were undertaken with the station as a base. By 1932 about 80 cabins manned by Norwegian trappers and fishermen had been built in different areas of East Greenland, including some in the distant King Frederick VI Coast and Storfjord Station in the Kangerlussuaq Fjord in between. Finn Devold led the actions in southeastern Greenland, where he had established the Finnsbu radio station. 12 July 1932 the Norwegian flag was raised at Myggbukta in the northeastern claim of Norway, where Helge Ingstad was named governor. At the same time Finn Devold was asked to formally raise the flag at Finnsbu in Southeast Greenland.Spencer Apollonio, Lands That Hold One Spellbound: A Story of East Greenland, 2008, pp. 188-189 Denmark protested and brought the case to the Permanent Court of International Justice in The Hague. Following the 1933 resolution of the court awarding Greenland to the Danish government, Norway's claims in Greenland were given up and most Norwegian outposts were closed. Finn left Greenland on relief ship Signalhorn, which evacuated the staff of the stations in the Storfjord and Finnsbu areas and brought them back to Norway in August 1933. Even then, some of the stations, such as Jonsbu at the northern end and Torgilsbu at the southern, continued operation for a few years under Danish jurisdiction and restrictions.Spencer Apollonio, Lands That Hold One Spellbound: A Story of East Greenland, 2008, p. 192 =Later life= In 1936 Finn was hired by the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research. He left involvement in politics and concentrated in his studies, obtaining a degree in mathematics and science in 1940. In 1943 he became a fisheries consultant at the Institute. He specialized in Atlantic herring fisheries and in 1950 he followed herring migrations on the new vessel \\"GO Sars\\". Finn carefully surveyed Atlantic herring's migration patterns before winter herring fishing. He published some of the results of his research in the Norwegian press and in time his work became internationally recognized. Towards the final part of his career Finn became concerned about herring overfishing that led to the depletion of Norwegian spring spawning herring populations after the 1960s.Finn Devold, Sildemysterier i vitenskapelig belysning i VG (25.3.1950) Although he retired in 1972, Finn Devold continued his research on herring fisheries.

Her research in pure mathematics has concerned topics \\"at the intersection of analysis, geometry and topology\\"; she has also worked on more applied topics in data science and image classification. Hunsicker grew up in Iowa City, and was inspired to do mathematics in part by a high school teacher who was married to a mathematics professor at the University of Iowa. She went to Haverford College, where she was mentored by mathematician Curtis Greene, including two summers of mathematical research with Greene. She also visited the University of Oxford as an exchange student, and earned an honorable mention for the 1992 Alice T. Schafer Prize for excellence in mathematics by an undergraduate woman, won that year by Zvezdelina Stankova. Hunsicker graduated from Haverford magna cum laude in 1992, and went on to graduate study at the University of Chicago, supported in part by a fellowship from the American Association of University Women. Her 1999 dissertation, L(2)-Cohomology and L(2)-Harmonic Forms for Complete Noncompact K√§hler and Warped Product Metrics, was jointly supervised by Melvin G. Rothenberg and Kevin Corlette. She went straight from her doctorate to a faculty position at Lawrence University, a liberal arts college focused primarily on undergraduate teaching, but five years later found herself missing the research life, and after earning tenure she went on the academic job market again. She applied to Loughborough \\"almost on a whim\\" after a honeymoon visit to England, and moved there in 2006. Hunsicker won the Trevor Evans Award of the Mathematical Association of America in 2003 for her work with Laura Taalman on the mathematics of modular architecture. In 2018, as Chair of the London Mathematical Society Women in Maths Committee, Hunsicker worked with filmmaker Irina Linke to produce a short film on Faces of Women in Mathematics.

Gross in Papers of the Anglo-Jewish Historical Exhibition, pp. 182-190. Worcester and Winchester were two of the 26 Jewish centres of the time to have archae. The introduction of archae in Worcester was part of the reorganization of English Jewry ordered by King Richard I in light of the massacres of Jews that took place in 1189-1190 at, and shortly following, his coronation. These massacres resulted in a heavy loss of Crown revenue partly thanks to the destruction result of Jewish financial records by the murderous mob (in order to conceal evidence of debts due to the Jews). The archae were intended to safeguard the royal rights in case of future disorder. All Jewish possessions and credits were to be registered and several cities were designated as centres for all Jewish business operations and registration of Jewish financial transactions. In each centre, a bureau was set up consisting of two reputable Jews and two Christian clerks, under the supervision of a representative of the newly established central authority that became known as the Exchequer of the Jews.

Not much is known from this type of ship, apart from the fact that it also used oar beside the sails to propel it,Nugroho (2011). p. 299.Hikayat Banjar, 6.2: \\"And that malangbang was adorned with marquetry of gold; its sails were of the finest cloth; the clew- lines, the stays and the sheets were of silk and had tassels of pearls; the rudder was of timbaga suasa (a copper and gold alloy), the oars of iron-wood with bands of gold and the anchor gear of undamascened steel. The ships sailing behind her were also fully dressed. and was a \\"medium-sized\\" ship, between the size of jong and kelulus, larger and faster than pilang (pelang).Hikayat Banjar, 1.2: \\"Then Ampu Djatmaka sailed with the same boat following it. Kapal and pilang are not as speedy as Si Prabayaksa; the size and the length and the ornamentation [of them] does not surpass Si Prabayaksa.\\" Lambu Mangkurat of Banjarmasin used a malangbang named Si Prabayaksa to travel to Majapahit.Ras (1968), p. 292, quoting Hikayat Banjar: \\"Ask to repair the malangbang ship, Si Prabayaksa is the name, and that and gurap and gali, galliot and galleon, tongkang and talamba and lambu and frigate.

Biography  He initially studied biology in Switzerland, but also taught himself how to paint and decided to pursue art as a career instead. After some time in Munich, he went to Berlin, where he became an assistant in the studios of Lovis Corinth. In 1906, he married the sculptor and painter, Margarethe Haeffner. The following year, they went to Paris, where he made the acquaintance of Henri Matisse and became an habitu√© of Le D√¥me Caf√©. As a result he, Margarethe and their friend Hans Purrmann participated in creating the short-lived Acad√©mie Matisse. During the war, he lived in Berlin and was among the first members of the November Group. He was also a member of the Free Secession. In 1918, he became a Professor at the . He succeeded August Endell as its Director in 1925 and served until its closure in 1932, following the emergency decrees issued by Heinrich Br√ºning. He then transferred to the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf, but was there for only a year when he was defamed and dismissed for being a purveyor of \\"degenerate art\\".Ernst Klee: Das Kulturlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945. S. Fischer, Frankfurt am Main 2007, , pg.415. A planned exhibition of his works was closed by the Nazi government in 1935. Two years later, thirty-five of his works were confiscated and displayed at the propagandistic Degenerate Art Exhibition in Munich. In 1936, he and Margarethe had settled into a reclusive life in Berlin, but their home and studio, along with numerous paintings, some by Matisse and Picasso, were destroyed during an air raid in 1943. They attempted to find refuge in his hometown, but were forced to return to Berlin in 1945 when the Red Army occupied that area. He died in Berlin in 1947 Recently, the has begun a research project devoted to his works.

It aired on October 9, 2019, on the cable network FX. The episode was written by Jay Beattie, and directed by Jennifer Lynch. Plot Through flashbacks, it is revealed that Montana and Ramirez became lovers after meeting at Montana's aerobics class. At that time she enlisted Ramirez to murder Brooke as revenge for the death of Montana's brother at Brooke's wedding. In the present, Xavier seeks out Bertie, the camp cook, for assistance, but Richter discovers them. Richter locks Xavier in the oven and turns it on, though a fatally wounded Bertie saves him. Now severely burnt, Xavier mercifully kills Bertie. Brooke, meanwhile, falls into a trap set by Donna. Ramirez tracks Brooke down after being tipped off by Montana, but Richter appears. Ramirez and Richter fight, with Brooke escaping during the chaos and Ramirez apparently being killed. Richter visits Margaret, who reveals she was the actual killer in 1970 following bullying at the hands of the other campers. Richter, blamed for the killings, was subsequently subjected to terrible treatments during his time in the asylum. Margaret shoots Richter. Trevor arrives after hearing the gunshots, and Margaret kills him. Xavier, after encountering a wounded and apparently merciful Richter, is found by Brooke. They meet up with Chet, Montana, and Margaret, who lies that Richter killed Trevor. Elsewhere, Donna witnesses Ramirez being revived by a supernatural power. Reception \\"True Killers\\" was watched by 1.29 million people during its original broadcast, and gained a 0.6 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49. The episode received largely positive reviews. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, \\"True Killers\\" holds a 94% approval rating, based on 16 reviews with an average rating of 7.08/10. The critical consensus reads: \\"The plot twists keep coming in the shocking, \\"True Killers,\\" but the addition of supernatural elements keep the momentum high in this sensational season.\\" Ron Hogan of Den of Geek gave the episode a 4/5, saying, \\"American Horror Story is about immediate and intense gratification. \\"True Killers\\" carries on that tradition, blowing through a lot of twists and turns. This is blood-splattered, burned, stabbed, shot, slashed, and smashed episode that unpacks the secrets of Camp Redwood.\\" He added, \\"This isn't a show that leans towards subtlety, and a lot of the twists in this episode are foreshadowed very effectively throughout the run thus far. That AHS isn't even trying to extend out the plot suggests that they're fine with burning off the incredibly long night of the killing spree and have something in their pockets for the latter half of the season.\\" He also praised the script, commenting that \\"Jay Beattie's script does a solid job of peppering the quippy jokes throughout and keeping the laugh lines coming without sacrificing any of the scary business.\\", and the directing, noticing that \\"Director Jennifer Lynch [...] seems to have a particular talent for creepy imagery, and making the most of her jump-scares.\\" Kat Rosenfield of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B+ rating. She praised Tara Karsian's Chef Bertie in this episode, and compared the scene where Xavier is trapped in the oven to Doctor Thredson's self- immolation scene from Asylum. She also enjoyed the different twists and reveals of the episode, especially the one about Margaret's true nature. She compared the faceoff between the Night Stalker and Jingles to Freddy vs. Jason, commenting that it was \\"so much lamer\\". Finally, Rosenfield gave some positive comments about the episode cliffhanger, saying \\"this is American Horror Story; even when the bodies hit the floor, they rarely stay there!\\" Variety Andrea Reiher gave a positive review, as she compared the episode to a \\"good slasher camp movie\\". She also commented that \\"It was also a little jarring for the show to seemingly burn through so much plot (and so many characters!) by the end of Episode 4. This season is 10 episodes long; what are the remaining six going to look like?\\" References External links * Category:American Horror Story: 1984 episodes ","title":"True Killers"},{"id":"61820799","text":"\\"Red Dawn\\" is the fifth episode of the ninth season of the anthology television series American Horror Story. It aired on October 16, 2019, on the cable network FX. The episode was written by Dan Dworkin, and directed by Gwyneth Horder-Payton. Plot =1980= Donna, staking out his apartment complex, sees her father and a woman enter the building. Donna breaks inside and is shocked to find the woman tied up and disembowelled. Donna tries to help the woman but her father enters the bedroom, carrying a knife. He claims that he‚Äôs always had darkness inside him. Donna promises that she can help him, but he commits suicide by stabbing himself in the neck. =1984= Richard Ramirez explains to a bewildered Donna that Satan resurrected him. Her father‚Äôs ghost appears and encourages Donna to embrace the darkness inside her. Xavier lights a stick on fire and threatens to burn the camp to the ground. Margaret knocks him out and the group retreats to a cabin. Margaret suggests that they take a boat to reach campers at the other side of the lake and Montana proposes that Chet accompany her. Alone with Brooke, Montana prepares to kill her, but Brooke leaves when she sees Ray through a window. In the middle of the lake, Margaret strikes Chet with an oar, ties an anchor to his ankle, slices his ear off, and pushes him into the water. Brooke and Ray run to the mess hall. Brooke tells Ray about her past and the two end up having sex. Donna admits to Montana and Xavier that she released Mr. Jingles. Xavier attacks Donna and chases her out of the cabin. Brooke confides to Ray that he took her virginity. She then finds Ray‚Äôs head in the refrigerator and runs back to Montana. Montana strikes her in the head and explains that she is avenging her brother‚Äôs death. Richter finds Margaret in the archery arena and grabs her by the throat. Xavier appears and shoots several arrows into Richter's chest. Xavier tends to Margaret and she suddenly attacks and kills him. Ramirez appears to a dying Richter and asks if he accepts Satan as his master. Richter accepts. Brooke and Montana brawl until dawn when the campers pull up in a school bus and witness Brooke stabbing Montana to death. The police are called and Brooke is wrongfully arrested for the murders of the past night. Ramirez and Richter steal a cop car and the two speed away to Los Angeles. After Montana kills a policeman, she, Ray, and the hitchhiker reminisce about their ghosts being trapped on the camp property. Reception \\"Red Dawn\\" was watched by 1.09 million people during its original broadcast, and gained a 0.5 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49. The episode received largely positive reviews. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, \\"Red Dawn\\" holds a 88% approval rating, based on 16 reviews with an average rating of 8.25/10. The critical consensus reads: \\"The mystery of Camp Redwood comes to a head in the wicked and gory \\"Red Dawn.\\" Ron Hogan of Den of Geek gave the episode a 4/5, saying, \\"American Horror Story devolves into mostly people running around with weapons, screaming at one another and trying to kill one another, yet at no time does it feel difficult to follow. Camp Redwood has a physical presence, and that helps make the action feel cohesive.\\" He added, \\"Given the presence of multiple ghosts on the property, and the ‚Äúnext week on‚Äù sneak preview, Camp Redwood isn't quite done yet, even if Brooke seems done. Four episodes is a lot of time in which to spin off a second story, particularly with established characters. What they do with that time remains to be seen; whatever it might be, I have no doubt it'll be wildly entertaining and lots of people will die as a result.\\" He also praised Ross and Lourd's performances, commenting that \\"Angelica Ross again does a wonderful job in her dramatic scenes, both confronting her father and confronting the truth about herself via Richard Ramirez's magical resurrection. Billy Lourd, as per usual, is a real treat as Montana.\\" Kat Rosenfield of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B+ rating. She enjoyed the fight between Brooke and Montana, especially the death scene of Lourd's character. She also appreciated the origin story for Ross' Donna Chambers, commenting that \\"This certainly explains Donna's fascination with killers\\". Even though she criticized Ray and his motive, she had a positive opinion about his and Brooke's \\"intimate moment\\", and the twist at the end of it. She also praised the new dynamics and relationship between Ramirez and Jingles, comparing their last scene to Thelma and Louise. Overall, Rosenfield really enjoyed the episode as she concluded her review by \\"With a satisfying cap like that, American Horror Story could've ended its ninth season right here.\\" Variety Andrea Reiher gave a positive review, and said \\"American Horror Story is nothing if not full of twists, and with four episodes left, there are surely a lot more details to come that will turn this story on its head.\\" References External links * Category:American Horror Story: 1984 episodes ","title":"Red Dawn (American Horror Story)"},{"id":"61820800","text":"Ostroglyadovo () is a rural locality (a selo) in Starodubsky District, Bryansk Oblast, Russia.

It is widely cultivated, particularly in Europe, as an ornamental. Its sporadic distribution in its natural range and certain of its morphological characters leads authorities to consider it a probable naturally occurring hybrid, with its most likely parents being Crataegus succulenta (fleshy hawthorn) and Crataegus crus-galli (cockspur hawthorn). It is a tetraploid. Some populations may be self-perpetuating. Its 'Prunifolia' cultivar has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit, and is considered one of its top 5 trees for smaller gardens. Description Consistent with the hypothesis that C. persimilis is a relatively newly arisen hybrid species, there is quite a bit of variation in botanical characters between individuals. The variable traits include the shapes of the leaves, hairs and scales (or the lack thereof) on inflorescences, number of stamens, the color of the anthers, and pitting and other ornamentation (or lack thereof) of the pyrenas. The type specimen, collected along the Genesee River near Rochester, New York, has the narrowest leaves, and the most stamens (10 to 20), of any described specimen. It also has pink anthers, sparsely pubescent corymbs, and deeply pitted pyrenas. The cultivated 'Prunifolia' has a much broader leaves as well as densely pubescent or nearly tomentose corymbs, and only ten pink anthers. C. persimilis are shrubs or trees, 5 to 6m tall and spreading with a dome-like growth form to about the same width. New twigs and stems are glabrous, with one year old bark a brownish purple, older growth is dull gray. The thorns found on twigs can be straight or recurved. Once the thorns have been on the tree for two years they are a shiny purplish black, and 4 to 7cm long. Typically older branches and the trunk do not have thorns. Its deciduous leaves are glabrous and coriaceous. The dark green leaf blades are more or less narrowly obovate to broadly elliptic or rhombic- elliptic, 4 to 5cm long, with serrate margins. The flowers are five-petaled and are white, with cream or pink anthers. The fruits are pomes, and bright scarlet when mature. They flower in May and fruit much later, in September or October. In autumn the leaves take on a striking range of colors from deep yellow to a fiery orange to scarlet and on to purple. Uses The C. persimilis cultivar 'Prunifolia' is used as a street tree, and is often used in gardens as an ornamental, especially for its spectacular autumn display. It is dense enough to use as a hedge or windbreak. Pest and diseases C. persimilis is susceptible to fire blight (Erwinia amylovora) but has some resistance. It is affected by hawthorn sawfly leaf miners (Profenusa canadensis), but they seldom cause serious damage to healthy plants. It may also be afflicted by leaf spot (Diplocarpon mespili), caterpillars, gall mites and aphids.

The Philippine region is seismically active and has been progressively constructed by plates converging towards each other in multiple directions. The region is bounded by subduction zones, where surrounding oceanic plates to the east and west slide towards the centre of the Philippine archipelago. Subduction results in deep oceanic trenches, such as the Philippine Trench and Manila Trench, bounding the eastern and western sides of the Philippine archipelago, respectively. The Philippine archipelago is also cut along its length by a left-lateral strike-slip fault known as the Philippine Fault. The region is also known as the Philippine mobile belt due to its complex tectonic setting. Active subduction disturbs the crust, leading to volcanic activity, earthquakes and tsunamis, making the Philippines one of the most hazard-prone regions on Earth.  Tectonic units  = Philippine Sea Plate = Philippine Sea Plate is an oceanic plate surrounded by subduction zones. The plate is moving northwest at a rate of 6 ‚Äì 8 cm/year towards the Eurasian Plate. Ranken and Cardwell (1984) showed that the rate of convergence increases southwards along the trench. The plate rotates with respect to the pole closed to the triple junction of the Philippine Sea, Eurasian, and Pacific Plates at the northern tip of Philippine Sea Plate. The rate of rotation is about 0.5Àö/million years (Ma), yielding a total of approximately 90Àö rotation since early Tertiary. It is generally suggested that the plate motion was kept about constant since 3 ‚Äì 5 Ma, but some study argued that the direction of plate propagation changed at about 1 Ma. = Philippine Mobile Belt = The Philippine Mobile Belt (also called as Taiwan-Luzon-Mindoro Mobile Belt ) is a complex tectonic zone which sits at the convergence zone of the Eurasian Plate, Philippine Sea Plate and Indo- Australian Plate. It covers the whole Philippine archipelago and extends southwards to the Molucca Sea and eastern Indonesia. The belt is seismically active associated with frequent earthquakes and active volcanism. The Philippine mobile belt is bounded by convergence zones of different polarities: east-dipping subduction at Manila trench, Negros Trench, Sulu Trench and Cotabato Trench to the west; west-dipping subduction at Philippine Trench and East Luzon Trough mark its eastern boundary. The belt is tectonically separated from surrounding plates, it is also regarded as an \\"independent block\\" or \\"microplate\\" in the Philippines. Regardless of the uncoupling with surrounding tectonic units, the Philippine Mobile Belt has an affinity to both the Eurasian Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate. It contains volcanic arc materials from the Philippine Sea Plate, as well as crustal materials from the Eurasian Plate. It is very difficult to define a clear tectonic boundary as much information along the Philippine Mobile Belt is swept away by a strike-slip fault (Philippine Fault) traversing the mobile belt.  Active Zones in the Philippine Mobile Belt  The Philippine Mobile Belt can be separated into two active zones: the \\"western active zone\\" and the \\"eastern active zone\\". The western active zone is bounded to the west by east-dipping subduction zone like the Manila Trench, whilst the eastern active zone is bounded to the east by west-dipping subduction zone like the Philippine Trench. As the Philippine Mobile Belt sits in between the bipolar subduction of Eurasian Plate to the west and the Philippine Sea Plate to the east, the belt experiences East-West compression, resulting folds and thrusts zones. = Philippine Fault Zone = The Philippine Fault is a left-lateral strike-slip fault which cuts across the Philippine archipelago behind the subduction zone. It is an NW-SE trending fault, which aligns subparallel to the Philippine Trench, extends from northern Luzon to Mindanao. It is an important component in the Philippine Trench system in controlling regional geodynamics and kinematics. R. Hall (1987) predicts the average velocity along the strike-slip fault is 0.5 cm/year, while some of the other models predict the velocity of 2 ‚Äì 3 cm/year. However, models also agreed with the onset of Philippine Fault in between 2 ‚Äì 4 Ma, and propagates southwards to the present southern termination at the northeast of Halmahera.  Shear Partitioning Mechanism  352x352px Shear partitioning mechanism in the Philippine fault- trench system was first proposed by Fitch in 1972. In his model, the motion of plate convergence is partitioned into two components: Parallel to the fault, and perpendicular to the trench subduction. He suggested that the strike-slip fault is responsible for taking up stresses that cannot be accommodated by the subduction systems surrounding the Philippine Mobile Belt. In the case of the Philippine Trench system, as the Philippine Sea Plate propagates towards the trench obliquely, the vector of displacement is broken down into two components: northward lateral motion of the \\"western active zone\\" of the Philippine Mobile Belt, and the westward subduction perpendicular of the Philippine Sea Plate. The hypothesis of shear partitioning mechanism was agreed by Aurelio (2000), by tracking crustal movement using Global Positioning System (GPS) data. It has been hypothesised that the trench and fault formed in a synchronised manner, both the trench and fault may propagate southwards since middle to late Miocene. More branching is observed over the northern and southern segments of the fault zone, which implies the Luzon and Mindanao‚ÄìMoluccas regions are associated with a more complex tectonic setting. = Palawan Microcontinental Block = The Palawan block is an aseismic microcontinent to the west of the Philippine Mobile Belt. It originated from the southeastern continental margin of the Eurasian Plate. The Palawan continental block broke off from the Eurasian Plate during late Eocene, and started colliding the Philippine Mobile Belt between Oligocene and Late Miocene. Geographically, Mindoro, Palawan Islands, northwestern Panay, Romblon Islands are also considered as the Palawan Microcontinental Block. Some models argued that the convergence of the two microcontinents, is thought to be the initiation of the development of the east-dipping subduction at Manila Trench and Negros Trench in Early Miocene, and subsequence the formation of the Philippine Fault Zone and Philippine Trench.  Active subduction tectonics  371x371pxSubduction zones in the Philippine mobile belt can be characterised into two major groups: east-dipping subduction to the western boundary, and west-dipping subduction to the eastern boundary. = Manila Trench = The Manila Trench results from eastward subduction of the Eurasian Plate (Sundaland Block) beneath the Philippine Mobile Belt. Subduction along the north-trending trench started in late-Oligocene to early-Miocene. It has an average subduction rate at 1 ‚Äì 2 cm/year, slowing towards the north. It has a thick profile of sediment deposition in the well-developed forearc basin, this promoted the formation of accretionary wedge along the trench during compression. Accretionary wedge could not be found in trenches over the eastern side of the Philippine mobile belt (e.g. along the Philippine Trench). Several east-dipping trenches could be found to the South of Manila Trench like Negros Trench and Cotabato Trench, they are formed after Manila Trench during middle-Miocene to late-Miocene, the sequence of initiation is from the North to South.  Luzon Volcanic Arc  Luzon arc is a1200-km-long volcanic belt extending from Taiwan to southern Mindanao. It results from the subduction of Eurasian Plate beneath the Philippine Mobile Belt along the Manila Trench since early Miocene. The age of volcanoes young towards the south from Taiwan. Subduction started in Taiwan 16 million years ago, but there were still young volcanoes which are dated up to quaternary in Mindanao.  Palawan‚ÄìCentral Philippines collision zone  The collision between Palawan block and the central Philippine was initiated during early to middle Miocene. There are altogether three observed collision zones developed at different times, which are: # Romblon Island collision-related accretionary complex (Early Miocene) # Mindoro ophiolite complex (Middle Miocene‚ÄìPliocene) # South of Mindanao (Present) It is agreed that Romblon Island was the front- line of collision. Collision zone between the Palawan microcontinental block and the Philippine mobile belt shows southwestern propagation through time. The mechanism behind the translation of the collision zone is still unidentified. = Philippine Trench = 404x404px Philippine Trench results from the westward subduction of Philippine Sea Plate beneath the Philippine Mobile Belt. The north-trending trench extends from the southeastern Luzon (15Àö30‚ÄôN) to the northeast of Halmahera (2ÀöN), with a total length of 1,800 km (1,118 miles), and a maximum depth of 10,540 meters (6,549 miles). It is linked to another east-dipping subduction zone to the north in the East Luzon Trough with an E-W trending strike-slip fault. The Philippine propagates northwards in the segment of East Luzon Trench. The age of the Philippine Trench is not well-defined, some believed that the trench is 5 Ma or younger, while some are 8 ‚Äì 9 Ma. However, researchers agree that the Philippine Trench is the youngest trench in the Philippine subduction system. The Philippine Sea Plate moves towards the trench oblique way, force comes from the plate convergence cannot be accommodated by the trench itself solely, therefore, the activity of the trench is coupled with the strike-slip Philippine Fault. It is believed that the Philippine Trench and fault zone formed and propagates southwards in a synchronised manner, where they both formed during early Pliocene. Subduction rate increases southwards, with the highest convergence near the southern termination in northeast Halmahera at a rate of 10 cm/year. Its origin is related to the collision between Palawan Microcontinental Block and the Philippine Mobile Belt, which activated the Manila Trench and subsequently initiated the Philippine Trench. = Volcanic arcs = 398x398px Ancient arc and recent arc systems can be identified in the Philippine archipelago. Magmatic events in the archipelago are related to plate subduction as reflected in the geochemistry of rocks. Rock composition along the major volcanic arc composition are generally calc-alkaline to tholeiitic magma series. There was also some reported occurrence of adakite, which is often associated with partial melting of basaltic component in subduction zone. Dating arc-derived rocks can constrain the timing for trench formation along with the tectonic evolution in Cenozoic. The geochemistry of recent arc formation since Oligocene is similar. The volcanic rocks also include high- potassium calc-alkaline series rocks, which reflect the island arc originality. Volcanic arc formation also favours mineral deposits. Copper, gold and nickel mines are found in the Philippines. = Ophiolitic belt = Ophiolites are suggested to be formed in subduction events in oceanic basins. The occurrence of ophiolite is common in the Philippines. Studying ophiolite can help unveil the tectonic evolution of the Philippines. The majority of ophiolite in the Philippines was formed in Cretaceous, with a minority formed in Tertiary. Ophiolite in Philippines is zoned into four groups geographically: (i) Palawan zone; (ii) Western zone; (iii) Central zone; (iv) Eastern zone. Dating of the ophiolitic belts shows a progressive younging trend from east to west, which formed in lower Cretaceous in the eastern belt to Eocene in the western belt. This shows the sequence of accretionary wedge formation from east to west. The youngest western ophiolitic zone is formed in the Sundaland ‚Äì Philippine Mobile Belt boundary, while the older ophiolite is formed in proto-Philippine Plate, which is the basal rock in the Philippine Mobile Belt.  Formation of the Philippine archipelago  = Late Oligocene ‚Äì Early Miocene = The west-dipping east-Luzon trough ceased activity during the late Oligocene. During Early Miocene, the Manila Trench was initiated, which is thought to be caused by the counterclockwise rotation of Luzon, subsequently led to the collision of Palawan microcontinental block and the Philippine mobile belt. The Philippine mobile belt was accreted to the South China Sea block, forming the Manila Trench. The model was supported by structural and geological evidence. First, the suture zone, which is observed as metamorphic belts, marks the boundary between the Palawan block and the Philippine mobile belt. This indicates the NE verging Palawan block in Miocene. Moreover, ophiolite emplacement is experienced in islands to the northeastern of Palawan. Ophiolite emplacement is a process when ophiolite is blended into the continental margin, which is thought to be collision-related. Furthermore, a gap of volcanism in the central Philippines is recorded, which is also known to be caused by a collision event to the west of the Philippine mobile belt. And lastly, the coral reef bed was uplifted during the hypothesised collision episode, which reassures the collision event. = Formation of Philippine Trench = 427x427px The collision of Palawan Block to the Philippine Mobile Belt was related to the formation of the Philippine Trench. It is argued that the formation of the Philippine Trench was to entertain the stress resulted from the Palawan collision. Adding compressional stresses to the incipient subduction, it progressively developed into a subduction zone. The Philippine trench is known to be formed by recent subduction. It is deduced by the shallow subduction slab reflected by shallow seismicity and considering its subduction rate at the same time. Another hypothesis is that the Philippine Trench was originated near Bicol (around 13ÀöN) and propagates southwards to present termination abruptly at northeast Halmahera (2ÀöN). This is supported by evidence such as variation of the age of volcanoes along the trench, depth of subduction slap and geometry of the trench. The hypothesis is supported by evidence of the age of arc volcanism along the Eastern magmatic arc. The oldest volcano is located in Bicol, with age of 6.5 Ma. The progressive southwards younging trend of volcanoes along the trench from Bicol is observed, where the youngest subduction-related volcanic activities are observed right at the northeastern Halmahera. The younging trend is also observed northwards from Bicol to the northern termination of East Luzon Trough. Supporting the hypothesis of northwards and southwards propagation of Philippine Trench from Bicol. The geometry of the trench also gives evidence supporting the hypothesis of both northwards and southwards propagation. Lallemand et al. (1990) proposed that the trench was first formed near 9ÀöN then propagated towards north and south, resulting in a relatively symmetrical geometry to the north and south of 9ÀöN. The deepest part of the trench could be found around 9ÀöN, where the average depth of the trench is over 10,000 meters. The trench depth is progressively shallower to the north and to the south, with the depth near 8,000 meters at the southern terminal and around 6,000 meters at the northern terminal. 321x321px  Tectonic hazards in the Philippines  = Volcanoes = The Philippine archipelago is bounded by subduction zones which makes the region volcanically active. The most active volcano in the Philippines is the Mayon Volcano located in southeastern Luzon. It is related to the subduction of Philippine Sea Plate beneath the Philippine mobile belt. thumb Earthquakes (mag >6.0) occurred in the Philippines.Blue circles indicate magnitude 6.0-6.9 Green circles indicate magnitude 7.0 7.9 Orange circles indicate magnitude above 8.0315x315px = Earthquakes = Owing to the complex tectonic setting on the Philippine mobile belt, the Philippine archipelago is seismically active. Faults and subduction zones are the seismic origins. Among subduction zones in the Philippines, subduction along the Philippine Trench produces the most active and frequent seismic activities to the region. However, as Philippine Trench is a young subduction system, the majority are shallow earthquakes (< 30 km).

He is best known for his pulp post-apocalyptic series \\"The Outrider\\", which he published under the pseudonym Richard Harding. He also penned several movie novelizations based on a slew of 80s and 90s blockbusters like Footloose, Basic Instinct or Universal Soldier. Life He was born Robert S. Tine in Providence, Rhode Island, and he grew up in Barrington, the Bahamas, Wales, South Africa, Swaziland, and Argentina. He was a graduate of Columbia University in New York. He also lived in Italy in the 1980s, where two of his novels were set: State of Grace (1980) and Black Market (1992). In 2005 he moved from New York to Newburyport, Massachusetts, where he died in 2019. Work Throughout his life Tine published six novels of mainstream fiction, the latter of which garnered good reviews‚Äîparticularly Black Market, set during the liberation of Rome in 1944). Publishers Weekly, in its review of Black Market, called Tine \\"a genius at characterization.\\" However, Tine's larger output by far was in the field of novelizations from movies (mostly science fiction, action, and neo-noir, but also four tie-ins to the John Hughes' Beethoven franchise) and TV shows such as JAG and Touched by an Angel. =\\"The Outrider\\"= Tine is most remembered today for his hard-boiled \\"Outrider\\" series, comprising five mass-market survival fiction novels published by Pinnacle in 1984 and 1985 under the pseudonym Richard Harding (not to be confused with author and war reporter Richard Harding Davis, 1864-1916). Heavily inspired by George Miller's 1979 film Mad Max, \\"The Outrider\\" series is set in what is left of a dystopian United States following a nuclear apocalypse. The hero, the lonesome, rugged survivalist Bonner, is based in the ruins of Chicago, although his adventures take him through much of the ravaged country.

It was the second station to operate in the state, originally based in Vida, later moving to Wolf Point. After several frequency and city changes, KGCX moved to 1480 kHz and Sidney in 1941 and 1942, where it would remain for the next 51 years until being closed in 1993. History =Vida and Wolf Point= KGCX took to the air in October 1926 as the second radio station in Montana. At launch, it prided itself on being the smallest broadcasting station in the world; it was located in Vida, a town with a population of 50. The first licensee was the First State Bank of Vida. Broadcasting with 10 watts on 1250 and then 1230 kHz, General Order 40 sent the station to 1420 kHz, where it remained just six months before relocating to 1310 in May 1929. The station was moved to the larger town of Wolf Point in 1929, contingent on a power increase to 250 watts day and 100 night. In 1933, the station's license was transferred to E.E. Krebsbach, who had previously been connected with the bank. KGCX moved frequencies two more times, to 1450 kHz in 1936 and to 1480 kHz upon NARBA coming into effect in 1941. =Move to Sidney= 1942 saw KGCX move from Wolf Point to Sidney, a move of ; the station's facilities were disassembled in Wolf Point and relocated to their new site, with the station beginning operations in Sidney on August 28. Successive power increases brought the station to 5,000 watts day and night by 1948. In programming, KGCX was a rare American affiliate of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation between 1936 and 1945, when it hooked up with the Mutual Broadcasting System instead, an affiliation it would maintain for the rest of its history. In the late 1950s, it moved its studios to the LaLonde Hotel from the Suksdorf Building, where it first set up when it moved from Wolf Point. The station also established auxiliary studios in Williston, North Dakota in 1945 and in Plentywood, Montana, and Watford City, North Dakota, in 1958. =Sale to the Halvorson and Folkvard families= Krebsbach owned the station until his death of cancer in 1970; by this time, he also owned a new station in Wolf Point, KVCK. Krebsbach's son, E. Clair, sold KGCX two years later for more than $300,000 to the Halvorson and Folkvard families; his other son, Keith, who was the station's general manager, had died when he was struck by lightning in 1964. August 9, 1981, brought KGCX a sister station, 100,000-watt KGCH-FM 93.1, and their first competitor, KSDY-FM 95.1, followed that November. At this time, KGCX broadcast a country format, with the new FM station airing adult contemporary music. 1987 saw two crucial changes in the landscape. In March, KSDY folded amid financial troubles in a slow regional economy, while August saw KGCH-FM shift to country and KGCX to classic country. In 1992, the Folkvards sold their shares to Ted and Kay Tescher, but a year later, KGCX and KGCH-FM called it quits. The Halvorsons opted to shutter the radio stations at 11 p.m. on the night of August 2, 1993; the stations went off the air as normal but never returned. 11 people were put out of work; even though sales manager Arch Ellwein and a local economic development group offered to buy the stations, their bids were turned down. The closure of KGCX and KGCH-FM left Sidney without any local radio stations; when the town's high school won a state football championship, listeners had to hear their games on a Williston station. The AM frequency was not reactivated, but local radio in Sidney eventually returned with the launch of KTHC in December 1996. The 93.1 frequency formerly belonging to KGCH-FM reemerged on June 1, 2004 as a new station with the KGCX call letters formerly on 1480 AM.

The match was won by Glenelg who defeated Port Adelaide by 28 points to win their first Premiership since 1986 and their 5th overall.  Background  Glenelg finished the 2019 SANFL season as the minor premiers for the first time since 2009 SANFL season. It was also Glenelg's first finals campaign since 2011 SANFL season. Port Adelaide were solid for most of the 2019 SANFL season, especially towards the second half where they won 10 out of 11 matches going into the finals.Glenelg was the only team to beat Port Adelaide in the that last 11 matches and the only team to beat Port Adelaide twice during the season. Glenelg had the first week off of the finals as minor premiers.Norwood beat Sturt in an Elimination Final, and Port Adelaide ran over Adelaide during the last quarter of a Showdown Qualifying Final. Week 2 of the finals Norwood got rolled by Adelaide in a one-sided affair during the Semi Final, while Glenelg looked flat after the week off and it dropped its first game to Port Adelaide for the year narrowly losing in the last quarter, as the game was sealed with a Billy Frampton freakish goal. So the stage was set for a cracking Preliminary Final between Glenelg and Adelaide. Glenelg broke the game open early leaving the Adelaide behind in the contest all match and eventually run over Adelaide 105 to 78. This set up a exciting grand final for the SANFL as Port Adelaide and Glenelg have shared a intense rivalry for decades.Glenelg beat Port Adelaide in its first Premiership year during the 1934 SANFL Grand Final, however Port Adelaide have had the wood over the Bays for the remainder of their future Grand Final meetings beating them in 1977 SANFL Grand Final, 1981 SANFL Grand Final, 1988 SANFL Grand Final, 1990 SANFL Grand Final, 1992 SANFL Grand Final. This was sure set to be a great contest for bothy clubs. The day was Cold and wet early on, creating rough conditions for a clean skilled match. Like the Preliminary Final Glenelg found voice early on and kicked the first 4 goals of the match. This set the tone early on in which Glenelg had entire control of the game and run out winners 11.7 (73) d 6.9 (45), winner their first premiership in 33 Years and first one over Port Adelaide in 85 Years. This Premiership broke a long and painful drought for Glenelg in which they lost 1987 SANFL Grand Final, 1988 SANFL Grand Final, 1990 SANFL Grand Final, 2008 SANFL Grand Final, but it also took the monkey off its back with Port Adelaide and its inability to beat them on the big stage.

It has mostly smooth bark, lance-shaped leaves, flower buds in groups of between seven and eleven, white flowers and cup-shaped to cylindrical fruit. Description Eucalyptus √ó macmahonii is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth reddish brown bark, sometimes with a few ribbons of loose bark near the base. Young plants and coppice regrowth have leaves that are arranged alternately, elliptic to lance-shaped, long and wide. Adult leaves are lance-shaped to slightly curved, the same glossy green on both sides, long and wide on a petiole up to long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven, nine or eleven on an unbranched peduncle up to long, the individual buds sessile or on short pedicels. Mature buds oval to club-shaped, up to long and wide with a conical operculum. The flowers are white and the fruit is a woody, cup-shaped to more or less cylindrical capsule long and wide with the valves below the level of the rim. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus √ó macmahonii was first formally described in 1997 by Kevin Rule from a specimen collected on the southern side of Mount Arapiles. Rule gave it the name Eucalyptus macmahonii and published the description in the journal Muelleria. The specific epithet (mcmahonii) honours \\"Dr Don McMahon who is credited with the discovery of this new species\\". The Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria suggests that this species is a stabilised hybrid between E. phenax and E. wimmerensis.

He became well known as a whistleblower within the nuclear reactor Petten. Nowadays Schaap works as a journalist.  Whistleblower  In 2001 Schaap was a Deputy Chief of Staff at the nuclear reactor in Petten. Schaap noticed that the reactor had very tight supply contracts, which resulted in the reactor continuously running even after malfunctions. Schaap addressed this internally in a so-called blackbook, with no result. After that, Schaap decided to address the security problems externally, to the director of the Kernfysische Dienst. Even after promises from the director to let Schaap stay anonymous in the matter, his name became publicly known, which led to a labor dispute. After the conflict, the company he was then working for decided to offer him another job, but this time not at the reactor. It was a daytime job, compared to the nightshifts he previously worked, which would have complications as he also worked at a news agency. Next to that, Schaap also liked working at the reactor facility. This led to him declining the job offer. While having acquired a lot of sympathy, appreciation and attention from the press, Schaap still lost his job. The judge handling the whistleblower case of Schaap concluded that Schaap could not get the status of a whistleblower because he didn't take enough internal action to address the problem and he also went to the press too early. This matter led to Schaap not being able to return to his old function. After the dilemma Schaap filed a claim of ‚Ç¨800,000 at the VROM as compensation for loss of income and pension breach. He eventually got ‚Ç¨200,000 as repayment for loss of retirement benefits. In 2016 Schaap cooperated in the documentary Stank voor dank, where multiple whistleblowers tell their stories about their experiences with going public about wrongdoings of their former employers.

A decorated army veteran of the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War, he transferred to the Air Force after being handicapped by battle wounds. He trained to become a bomber pilot and fought in the Battle of Yijiangshan Islands. He rose rapidly during the Cultural Revolution, and was appointed Commander of the PLAAF in 1973 following the Lin Biao incident. After the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976, he was removed from the command for his association with the radical Gang of Four.  Early life and army career  Ma Ning was born in Qinyang, Henan, Republic of China. During the Second Sino- Japanese War, he enlisted in the Communist Eighth Route Army in 1938 and later also fought in the Chinese Civil War. Wounded five times in battle, he underwent major surgeries in his abdomen and leg, which resulted in his left leg being shorter than the right one. He was awarded the decoration of \\"War Hero\\" by the Second Field Army.  Transfer to the Air Force  After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Ma received treatment at a hospital in Chongqing. There he read Boris Polevoy's novel Story of a Real Man, based on the life of the Soviet aviator Aleksey Maresyev, a double amputee who overcame his handicap to become a flying ace. Inspired by the story, Ma resolved to become a pilot. With the help of Wu Faxian, then Director of the Political Department of the PLA Air Force, Ma transferred to the Air Force in 1949 and trained as a bomber pilot. In 1955, he fought in the Battle of Yijiangshan Islands, the first battle in PRC history that involved the army, navy, and air force. He was awarded the rank of air force colonel in the same year, and was promoted to senior colonel in 1960 and major general in 1964. Ma served as Commander of the 21st Air Force Division in Shanghai until 1967, when he transferred to Changchun in the Shenyang Military Region. During the Cultural Revolution, he served as a Standing Committee member of the Revolutionary Committee of Jilin province in 1968, and later Deputy Commander of the Lanzhou Military Region Air Force.  Air Force Commander  After the Lin Biao incident in September 1971, the PLAAF commander Wu Faxian was implicated and imprisoned. The air force had no commander for almost two years, with General Li Desheng temporarily supervising the force. Although a relatively junior officer, Ma was appointed Commander of the PLAAF in 1973. Several more senior air force officers were passed over for the post because they were suspected of being followers of Lin Biao, whereas Ma had never served in the PLAAF headquarters, Lin's power base. Ma was the first pilot to become a PLAAF commander. Ma's rapid rise to top leadership of the air force coincided with a period of radical influence of the Gang of Four, and he likely supported the radicals. When the Gang of Four was overthrown in 1976 at the end of the Cultural Revolution, Ma was promptly relieved of his command, and formally replaced by Zhang Tingfa in the spring of 1977. However, he was not purged from the Communist Party, and was allowed to retire in 1984 with the rank of a deputy corps commander. Ma died in Beijing on 3 December 2010, aged 88.

He held the Belgian title between 1926 and 1927, and again between 1935 and 1936, and the International Boxing Union (IBU) European title for three periods, from 1929 to 1931, 1932 to 1933, and 1935 to 1936. Career Charles made his professional debut in April 1922, as a light heavyweight, losing on points over four rounds to Maurice Hennaut. Up to the end of 1925, he had a mixed record, including a run of five straight losses, but from November that year, through to October 1926, he was beaten only once (by Hans Breitenstraeter), including a draw with Ludwig Haymann. In November 1926 he beat Jack Humbeeck on points to become Belgian heavyweight champion. Over the next six months he had seven fights, including two draws with Gipsy Daniels. He made a successful defence of his Belgian title against Humbeeck in May 1927, but the following month suffered his first loss in almost a year when he was beaten on points by Phil Scott at the Royal Albert Hall. In September that year, he again defended his Belgian title against Humbeeck, this time losing on points. In early 1928 he travelled to the United States for a series of fights. After fighting a draw against Jack DeMave in January, he stopped Jack McCann in the first round in March, but was again beaten by Scott later that month. He beat Bud Gorman in June,\\"Bud Gorman Beaten by Pierre Charles; Belgian Heavyweight Gets Decision in 10 Rounds at NewarkVelodrome.\\", The New York Times, 13 June 1928, p. 22 (Sports section) but suffered the second defeat of his spell in the US in August to Otto von Porat, also losing his last fight in America, George Godfrey knocking him out in the second round at the end of the month. He had been set to fight Jack Sharkey, but the fight was cancelled when Sharkey injured his knee.\\"Jack Sharkey to Box Pierre Charles\\", Delaware County Daily Times, 3 August 1928, p. 14 Charles returned home, and in February 1929 faced Haymann at the Westfalenhalle, Dortmund, for the European heavyweight title vacated by Paulino Uzcudun; Charles took a points decision to become champion of Europe. He successfully defended the European title against Santa Camar√£o, Giacomo Panfilo, Franz Diener, and S√∏ren Petersen. In February 1930 he travelled to the US once again, to face NYSAC world light heavyweight champion Tommy Loughran, a fight he lost on points. Charles made two more successful defences of his European title, against Roberto Roberti and Piet van der Veer, before returning to the US for a further series of fights in 1931. On this visit he won all three fights, against Jack Renault, Paul Pantaleo, and Frankie Simms. In July 1931 he made a further defence of his European title against Maurice Griselle, but after seven successful defences, lost it in on points in August to Hein M√ºller. In December 1931 he regained the title, knocking out Innocente Baiguera in the fourth round. In January 1932 he beat Gipsy Daniels, but was beaten by Primo Carnera (who was 65 lbs heavier) on points in February.Page, Joseph S. (2010) Primo Carnera: The Life and Career of the Heavyweight Boxing Champion, McFarland & Co., , p. 80 He defended the European title in May against Mueller, but lost it for a second time in May 1933 when Uzcudun took a split decision win in Madrid. In October 1935, Charles faced George Godfrey once again, for the vacant IBU world heavyweight title in Brussels; Godfrey again won, on points. Uzcudun subsequently pursued the world title and relinquished the European title, giving Charles the chance to regain it against Vincenz Hower, Charles taking a points decision to become European champion for the third time. He defended the European title against fellow Belgian Gustave Limousin in November 1935, with the Belgian title also at stake; Charles won by a wide unanimous points decision, taking the Belgian title for the second time. Charles was stripped of the European title in April 1936 after failing to defend it within the specified time period. He fought Arno K√∂lblin for the vacant title in Charlottenburg in March 1937, but lost on points. Charles was then out of the ring for over two years, before returning to fight Romanian champion Motzi Spakow in May 1939. Charles lost on points in what proved to be his final fight.

He was the founder of the MADYLAM Scientific Interest Group, for \\"MAgn√©toDYnamique des Liquides, Applications √† la M√©tallurgie\\", which became the EPM group (for Elaboration par Proc√©d√©s Magn√©tiques) of the Laboratoire Science et Ing√©nierie des Mat√©riaux et des Proc√©d√©s (SIMaP). He has been a member of the French Academy of Sciences since 1993 and a member of the Academy of Technology since 2000. He is the author of numerous publications, a monograph \\"Magnetohydrodynamics\\" (Springer, 1990) and a popular science book \\"Air and Water\\" (EDP sciences, 2013). He was the founding editor of the Springer Fluid Mechanics and Its Applications collection. He is now one of the editors of the Encyclopedia of the Environment, an open access website that went online in October 2016.  Fields of scientific activity  His main contributions concern the magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) of liquid metals, a field in which he has supervised more than 40 doctoral students, many of whom have now become his colleagues, in France or abroad. In this vast scientific field, he focused his attention on MHD turbulence, MHD convection, Hartmann layers, Alfven waves in liquid metals and applications in metallurgy. At the University of Grenoble, in 1978 he founded the MADYLAM laboratory (for: \\"MAgn√©toDYnamique des Liquides. Applications to Metallurgy\\"), whose current name is EPM (for \\"Electromagnetic Processes of Materials\\"). He has published more than 100 articles in leading scientific journals and a book (Magnetohydrodynamics, Kluwer Acad. Pub. 1990). A list of his most recent publications is given below. He was the founder of the international association \\"HYDROMAG\\", of which he was the first President (1995-2000). He is the scientific editor of the \\"Fluid Mechanics and Its Applications\\" monograph series published by Springer, and has been editor, or associate editor, of several major scientific journals (J. de M√©canique, European J. of Mechanics: B/Fluids, CRAS).

Political beginnings  Smith began attending Communist Party meetings at University College London in 1947. By his own admission, he was attracted to the \\"systematic way [of] understand[ing] the world\\" that Stalinism provided. He quickly became disillusioned, however, during the Lysenko affair, which led to him turning his attention towards the works of Leon Trotsky.  Break with \\"Leninist Marxism\\"  Starting in 1987, Smith began to examine what he was beginning to feel was the distortion of Marx's ideas by his own followers. This project first manifested itself in a small booklet titled Communist Society and Marxist Theory. While well aware of its limitations, Smith hoped that the work would begin a dialogue on the subject rather than be the final word. To his dismay, rather than beginning a discussion, the work ended communication entirely with many in his organization. This inspired Smith to probe deeper and work on a more complete account of the matter, a project that Smith would dedicate the remainder of his academic career to in one way or another. Later in life, Smith would look back on his years as a Trotskyist as necessary for his political trajectory, but years that he put behind himself happily. > ...it [was] important to have seriously participated in the attempt to build > the Fourth International and to grasp its ideas; it was also vital to have > subsequently and equally seriously ceased to hold to those ideas.  Marx at the Millennium In 1996, Smith published the results of years of study and examination, the book Marx at the Millennium. Described by Smith as an attempt to discover \\"what Marx was trying to do,\\" it is as much a critique of how others have attempted to answer that question as it is a presentation of Smith's own answer. Setting his work apart from others of its type, however, is that Smith's critiques were aimed at the views of Marx's followers themselves. For Smith, the degeneration of Marxist thought he believed to have come about was as much, if not more so, the fault of Marxists as it was Marx's right-wing and liberal detractors. > Many people these days will tell you ‚ÄòMarxism is dead‚Äô, usually with the > collapse of the USSR in mind. There are still several varieties of ‚ÄòMarxist‚Äô > who deny it, of course. However, neither side shows much inclination to talk > about the actual ideas whose death or survival are being disputed. In his studies, Smith came to the conclusion that there was no basis in the writings of Karl Marx for a \\"Leninist party\\" or a \\"workers' state,\\" putting him sharply at odds with the views of his former comrades and those that he had earlier himself held. Most controversially, Smith argued that Marx was \\"not a sociologist or an economist, nor a social scientist or political scientist of any kind... .\\" This position led to a years long debate with the Marxist-humanist journal Hobgoblin.  Karl Marx and the Future of the Human  Smith's second book, Karl Marx and the Future of the Human, was an attempt to continue his project of examining the differences he found between views commonly held by Marxists and those expressed by Marx himself. Smith described the work as being his second attempt at \\"rereading\\" Marx. Namely, he attempted here to fix what he believed was his earlier mistake of attempting to \\"absolve Engels of all blame for the distortion of Marx,\\" as well as sharpen his critique of the \\"old orthodoxy.\\" In this work, Smith puts forward his most direct summary of what he believed the general \\"outlook\\" of Marx's work was: > (1) In class society, individual humans are governed by social forms that > are alien to their humanity. This is insane. (2) These forms condition the > way that they think about themselves and about their social life. (3) When > science theorizes social problems, its categories give the alien forms their > highest expression. (4) The critique of these categories breaks up their > appearance of being ‚Äònatural‚Äô, and so opens the way for conscious social > practice to release their human content.

Breda was abandoned by its garrison early in December and occupied by a Russian force. With Breda being the strategic link between the French garrisons of Gorinchem and Antwerp, and to hold control over the main road between Breda and Antwerp, the French began a counterattack. Meanwhile, Allied reinforcements were underway. After a scramble for the town and a three-day siege, the French withdrew back to Antwerp, and Breda became a distribution point for Allied troops and supplies.  Background  After the Battle of Leipzig in October 1813, the Allied troops advanced further towards Holland. A Russian force of 5,000 troops under general Count Alexander von Benckendorff crossed the border early in November, leading to a panicked flight of the French troops, who gathered themselves in a number of strong garrisons.http://www.grenadiercompagnie.nl/Bestanden/2.4%20Russen%20in%20Nederland.pdf The cossack regiments of Benckendorffs' command advanced deep into the Netherlands, and reached as far as Amsterdam, Den Helder and the Hague.  The French retreat  A cossack detachment under Major-general Stahl advanced towards Breda. By having civilian volunteers spread the rumour that 3,000 cossacks were on their way, and more Prussian infantry following them, the French garrison abandoned the town, and Stahl could march into Breda unopposed on December 10. Two days later, the town officials declared their allegiance to the Prince of Orange and raised a volunteer corps of 500 men. Benckendorff arrived with his main force in Breda. Realising the defensive works of Breda were in a sorry state, and his force -consisting mostly of cossacks and cavalry- would not be able to withstand a French counterattack, he requested that infantry and artillery reinforcements would be sent immediately. However, the Prussian III Corps under Von B√ºlow were engaged at the siege of Gorinchem and the British troops were still in Zeeland.G.J.W. Koolemans Beijnen (ed.), \\"Historische Gedenkboek der Herstelling van Neerlands Onafhankelijkheid in 1813\\", part 1. Published by De erven H. Boon, Haarlem 1913 The Provisional Government in The Hague was eager to help: two ships with guns and ammunition, a coastal artillery company and a battalion of four companies from the infantry regiment of Colonel Phaff were sent to help defend Breda.http://www.grenadiercompagnie.nl/Bestanden/2.7%20Beleg%20van%20Breda.pdf  The French counterattack  Since Breda formed the link between Gorinchem and Antwerp, a French force was gathered to recapture the town. 12,000 men and 26 cannon under generals Rouget and Lefebvre-Desnouettes began their advance from Antwerp over the main road towards Breda on December 19. This force easily chased away the cossack advanced posts near Zundert and reached Breda the following day. Since the buildings around the town had not been demolished to create a clear line of fire, the French were able to safely take up positions near the town walls. After a demand to surrender the town was declined, the French began their bombardment. Meanhwhile, a Prussian Streifkorps under Major Von Colomb which had screened the French advance, entered the town on the other side, having advanced towards Breda on a parallel road. Although the French had not yet encircled the town, they immediately began a first attack on the Antwerp Gate, which was defended by 250 Russian light infantrymen of the 2nd Egersky Regiment. During the attack, the Dutch battalion arrived and was immediately directed towards the Antwerp Gate. The first French attack had been fought off, but it was clear there were not enough troops to withstand the French once they had encircled the town. The French even had managed to set up a position on the glacis, which meant they could fire on the defenders and launch a new attack.  The siege  The ships with cannon and ammunition were nearby, but the crews had seen French patrols and were afraid to go near Breda. Upon hearing this, a patrol of 200 cossacks was sent out to chase the French cavaly away and guide the ships into Breda. In the evening, the ships arrived, bringing nine 12- and 24 lbs cannon and 60,000 lbs gunpowder and projectiles. Russians, Cossacks, Prussians and Dutch troops, aided by civilians, worked frantically all night to build artillery emplacements and strengthen the defences, which was hampered by the French continued bombardments, as well as by the inexperience of those involved, and the language problems (Von Colomb mentioned in his memoires that it was reminiscent of \\"the building of the Tower of Babel)\\". Nevertheless, the hard work paid off: when the French resumed their bombardment on the 21st, it was answered by a counter bombardment, which caused the loss of several French guns. The French launched attacks against the Antwerp Gate and Water Gate, but also managed to move a detachment even further around the town and attack the Bosch Gate, which was not covered by artillery. 150 Dutch infantry and the Breda Volunteers were sent over to counter this surprise attack. The fighting continued all day until nightfall. During the night, the bridge before the Antwerp Gate was demolished by the defenders, and the French advanced post on the glacis swept away by four Russian artillery pieces. The French continued their bombardment the following day, but realising they had lost the momentum, retreated towards Antwerp the next day, plundering the countryside. The Prussian and Russian cavalry followed them closely.  Aftermath  Once the Prussians of B√ºlow's Corps arrived in the town, the inhabitants were relieved that there would be no more French attacks. Breda would be used as a transit point for Allied troops and provisions for the siege of Antwerp. The defences of Breda were rebuilt, the town being once again an important defensive stronghold.

Featuring Australian Football League (AFL) player Adam Goodes, the film examines Australian Aboriginal identity and racism in modern Australia, with the sustained booing of Goodes by spectators as a starting point. It was written by award-winning journalist Stan Grant and directed by British director Daniel Gordon, and won the AACTA Award for best feature documentary in the 2019 series of the awards. Synopsis =Background= Goodes, an Aboriginal Australian of Adnyamathanha and Narungga heritage, was drafted by the Sydney Swans in the 1997 AFL Draft and went on to have a successful career with the Swans, being awarded a number of accolades for his performance including the AFL Rising Star award in 1999, the Brownlow Medal (2003 and 2006), the Bob Skilton Medal (2003, 2006 and 2011), and All Australian selection (2003, 2006, 2009 and 2011). In 2014 he was named Australian of the Year in recognition of his community work supporting Indigenous Australian youth, the efforts of the Go Foundation (co-founded with his Sydney Swans teammate Michael O'Loughlin), and his efforts to combat racism. On 24 May 2013, during the AFL's annual Indigenous Round (the Sir Doug Nicholls Round), a 13-year-old Collingwood supporter called Goodes an \\"ape\\". Upon hearing the abuse, Goodes pointed the girl out to security, who ejected her from the stadium.\\"Ejected teenage fan didn't know 'ape' was racist\\". Sydney Morning Herald. Goodes was deeply affected by the incident, but said repeatedly that the girl should not be blamed; the environment that she grew up in had shaped her response. The girl phoned to apologise, saying that she hadn't realised the impact of her words. Over the following years, and particularly in 2015, Goodes was repeatedly and loudly booed by opposition fans at most matches. The motivation for, and acceptability of, the booing generated wide public debate, which dominated media coverage from both sports and political commentators for weeks at a time. During a match against in May 2015, again during the Indigenous Round, Goodes celebrated a goal by performing an Aboriginal war dance, in which he mimed throwing a spear in the direction of the Carlton cheer squad. Goodes said after the incident that the dance was based on one he learned from under-16s Indigenous team the Flying Boomerangs, and that it was intended as an expression of Indigenous pride during Indigenous Round, not as a means of offending or intimidating the crowd. The booing of Goodes intensified in the months after the war dance. Goodes took indefinite leave from the game in August of the 2015 season. Many clubs and players in the AFL supported Goodes in the week of his leave. He returned the following week and played for the remainder of the season after an outpouring of support from fans, actors, politicians, celebrities and teammates, including two spontaneous standing ovations. Goodes retired from AFL in September 2015. He did not attend the Grand Final, where retiring players traditionally take part in a parade, one of only a handful of players to decline this invitation since the parade for retiring players was established. =The film= The Australian Dream tells the story of Goodes' life, from before he became a professional footballer through to his later career as an activist for Indigenous rights in Australia. It includes archival footage of as well as recent interviews with a range of Australians, including Indigenous and non-Indigenous people ‚Äì politicians, sportspeople, politicians, media commentators and Grant himself. With Grant commenting on or explaining each segment of the film, it is only at the end that the title is explained, when it includes his 2016 address at the 2019 IQ2 debate, which went viral. In it, he delivers a powerful message about how discrimination and colonisation are the base on which the ‚ÄúAustralian dream‚Äù is built. Cast All as themselves: *Adam Goodes *Stan Grant *Nova Peris *Linda Burney *Michael O'Loughlin *Nicky Winmar *Gilbert McAdam *Tracey Holmes *John Longmire *Natalie Goodes *Nathan Buckley *Paul Roos *Brett Goodes *Eddie McGuire *Andrew Bolt Themes The film looks broadly at the part played by race and identity in Australian history and today's society. It questions \\"what it means to be Australian\\" and \\"If the Australian Dream is rooted in racism, what can be done to redefine it for the next generation?\\". Production The Australian Dream was written and partly narrated by the Aboriginal Australian journalist Stan Grant, and directed by British director Daniel Gordon. The person at the centre of the themes explored in the film, footballer Adam Goodes, participated in the making of the film, as did most of the rest of the cast. It was co-created by British production company Passion Pictures and local outfit Good Thing Productions, with funding from the Australian Government, Screen Australia and Film Victoria. Release The film had its world premiere at the Melbourne International Film Festival (MIFF) on 3 August 2019, and was released in Australian cinemas on 22 August 2019. It was also presented at the Toronto (TIFF 2019) (5 to 15 September 2019), Telluride Film Festival (31 September‚Äì2 October 2019), BFI London (2‚Äì13 October 2019), International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (November 2019) and the Palm Springs Film Festival (7 January 2020). It is being shown on ABC TV in Australia on 23 February 2020, and is available online for Australian audiences as well as on the streaming service Kayo. Critical response The film was among the best-reviewed, most-publicised Australian films of 2019. The film's website cites five-star ratings by the Herald Sun and Student Edge, and four and a half from The Age and Switch. The Guardian gives the film four stars. Like several other reviewers, it makes mention of the other 2019 documentary film on the same topic, The Final Quarter, saying that commentators Andrew Bolt and Eddie McGuire get more screen time in The Australian Dream, giving them a platform they do not deserve to justify their contrary views, but overall \\"it speaks loudly and articulately\\" on an important topic. InDaily called it \\"a brilliant exploration of racism in this country\\", and a \\"more comprehensive analysis\\" of the treatment of Goodes than The Final Quarter. Regarding it as essential viewing for all Australians, the reviewer says that the Indigenous voices in the film are not trying to divide Australia, but rather \\"seeking unity and reconciliation through truth and respect\\". The US magazine Variety called it a \\"smart, solutions-oriented essay film\\" and \\"an urgent and engaging call to action\\", and noted parallels with racism in the United States. The Telegraph UK gave the film 4/5 stars describing the documentary as ‚Äúa thoughtful, but ultimately depressing documentary‚Äù which tackles ‚Äúthe ugly race storm‚Äù at the heart of Australia‚Äôs national game. at The Telegraph UK, 9 August 2020. Retrieved 23 August 2020. Audience response and box office The film earned a 10-minute standing ovation after its first showing at the Melbourne International Film Festival, which is very unusual, but it did not do well at the box office in Australia after its release in late August. This was attributed partly to the earlier release of another documentary on the same topic, The Final Quarter, partly to the general unwillingness of audiences to engage with the topic or expose themselves to an alternative viewpoint, and other factors. The manager of a Melbourne cinema where the film attracted big audiences suggested that \\"progressive audiences are receptive to the film and its message\\", but in some markets there was probably \\"a resistance to engage with a message that will be, for many, uncomfortable viewing\\". It won the Audience Award for Best Documentary Feature at MIFF. Accolades The film won the 2019 AACTA Award for best feature documentary. As mentioned above, it won the Audience Award for Best Documentary Feature at MIFF.

He is best known for creating the second Treaty Seal of the United States in 1825. Masi was born in Frascati, Italy, and worked from 1822-1870 as a silversmith and jeweler in Washington. In 1822 he advertised in the Washington Directory as a \\"Watchmaker and Jeweler\\" who sold silver work, spectacles and \\"a variety of other fancy goods.\\" In 1827 he was listed in the city directory as having his shop on the north side of Pennsylvania Avenue between 4 1/2 and 6 West. He married Catherine Agnes Bradford on November 8, 1825, and was buried in the Mount Olivet Cemetery in Washington. A letter from the United States Treasury Department, dated March 22, 1884, i.e., shortly after his death, appears to indicate that he had been receiving a pension as a veteran of the War of 1812. Masi's most famous work was the second Treaty Seal of the United States, 1825, his version of the Great Seal of the United States. It was used for making red-wax pendant seals for treaties until 1871, when the government ceased using pendant seals and retired the die. On May 5, 1825, the United States Department of State paid him $406 \\"for Treaty Boxes & a great Seal.\\" It is now in the National Archives collection. Each wax pendant seal was protected within a circular metal skippet, usually sterling silver, although a few were solid gold; the skippet cover bore a replica of the seal. In addition to his other creations, Masi also held a contract to attend, regulate, and repair the clocks of the United States Senate. His work is collected in the De Young Museum, National Archives, Winterthur Museum, and Yale University Art Gallery.

This C2 structure ranges from the political strategic level to the tactical level. At the military/civilian strategic level, missions are commanded by an operation headquarters (OHQ). For all civilian missions the Civilian Planning and Conduct Capability (CPCC) serves this purpose. For each military mission an OHQ is chosen from a list of available facilities. The EU does not have a permanent military command structure along the lines of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) Allied Command Operations (ACO), although it has been agreed that ACO resources may be used for the conduct of the EU's CSDP missions. The Military Planning and Conduct Capability (MPCC), established in 2017 and to be strengthened in 2020, does however represent the EU's first step in developing a permanent OHQ. The MPCC and CPCC are counterparts that cooperate through the Joint Support Coordination Cell (JSCC). The CPCC, MPCC and JSCC are all part of the External Action Service (EEAS), and situated in the Kortenberg building in Brussels, Belgium. Overview Civilian missions =Strategic level= All civilian missions are directed on the strategic level by the Civilian Planning and Conduct Capability (CPCC), a directorate of the External Action Service (EEAS) in Brussels, Belgium. The Director of the CPCC acts as Civilian Operation Commander (Civ OpCdr). =Operational level= The CPCC directs the subordinate Head of Mission (HoM), who administers the mission on the operational level. Military missions and operations =Strategic level= Command options for EU-led missions For each military mission (certain missions are also referred to as operation), the Council nominates a dedicated OHQ. This section outlines the main options for OHQ. =Autonomous operations and missions= * Military Planning and Conduct Capability (MPCC) of the EEAS' Military Staff (EUMS) in Brussels, Belgium Established in 2017, the MPCC is the EU's first permanent OHQ and supersedes the previous EU OPCEN.

SHAPE‚Äôs main building also flies the EU flag, reflecting the Berlin Plus agreement. *: An OHQ would be set up within the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) in Mons, Belgium. SHAPE is the main headquarters of Allied Command Operations (ACO). The Berlin Plus agreement requires that the use of NATO assets by the EU is subject to a \\"right of first refusal\\", i.e. NATO must first decline to intervene in a given crisis,Heritage Foundation report, March 24, 2008. and contingent on unanimous approval among NATO states, including those outside of the EU. For example, Turkish reservations about Operation Concordia using NATO assets delayed its deployment by more than five months.Bram Boxhoorn, Broad Support for NATO in the Netherlands, 21-09-2005, Operation Commander Each OHQ is led by an Operation Commander (OpCdr). When the MPCC acts as OHQ, the OpCdr is the MPCC Director, who is also Director General of the European Union Military Staff (EUMS). When the NCS provides the OHQ, the OpCdr is the Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe (DSACEUR). =Operational level= The OHQ directs the subordinate Force Headquarters (FHQ), which carries out the operation on the tactical level (i.e. on the ground). The FHQ is led by a Force Commander (FCdr). In case the MPCC acts as OHQ, the FHQ is termed Mission Force Headquarters (MFHQ) instead. The MFHQ is led by a Mission Force Commander (MFCdr). =Tactical level= The FCdr/MFCdr directs Component Commanders (CCs) for all service branches that may be required as part of the operation. The military forces within each component is subordinate to the CC. Civilian-military coordination In the event that both a military and civilian mission are in the field, the military OHQ and its Operation Commander (OpCdr) coordinate relations on the strategic level horizontally with the Civilian Planning and Conduct Capability (CPCC) and its Civilian Operation Commander (Civ OpCdr). Equally, on the tactical level the military Force Headquarters (FHQ) and its Force Commander (FCdr) coordinate relations horizontally with the civilian Head of Mission (HoM). If the Military Planning and Conduct Capability acts as OHQ, it will coordinate its relations with the CPCC through the Joint Support Coordination Cell (JSCC).

Set in the same universe as Fran Bow, the game revolves around the titular character Misfortune, who, guided by a voice in her head, seeks the prize of eternal happiness for her mother.  Gameplay  Set in a 2.5D perspective, the player may only move forward or backwards. At certain points in the game the player has to make choices for Misfortune, which may trigger special animated cutscenes. The game will also prompt the player to guide Misfortune's hand to perform certain actions or play minigames, such as fixing a broken vase or playing Whac-A-Mole.  Plot  Set in 1993, 8-year-old Misfortune Ramirez Hernandez lives alone with her parents in the outskirts of the fictional town of Openfields, Sweden. The narrator announces that today is the day that Misfortune will die but is surprised when Misfortune says that she can hear him. The voice invites Misfortune to play a game where she will make choices, and that \\"there is no right or wrong, only consequences.\\" When she beats the game, she will be rewarded with the prize of eternal happiness. Misfortune accepts, and the voice tells her that her first mission is to leave the house. Following his commands, Misfortune is guided through the streets of Openfields, encountering an anthropomorphic fox several times whom the narrator warns her against, and who flees when Misfortune gets too close. Pursuing the fox, Misfortune discovers a book that explains the narrator as an other-dimensional being named \\"Morgo\\". The fox is evidently a \\"protector\\" who strives to protect children from Morgo but is forbidden to interact with them directly. Escaping Morgo, Misfortune finds herself in her backyard, seeing her own corpse having been run over by a car. The fox leads her through a portal where she encounters death, who tells her that they had been expecting her.  Development  By the end of 2015, Killmonday had completed their first game, Fran Bow. It had been greenlit and was to be released on Steam. It had taken much more time than anticipated and Killmonday Games were out of money. The sales of the game were crucial for them to be able to continue developing. After the success of Fran Bow, Killmonday started work on their then \\"secret game\\", which would later become Little Misfortune. On the 13th of July 2018, Killmonday announced the title of their new game. In the following months updates on the progress of the game were uploaded to their YouTube channel, by the time of the release they had uploaded 26 weekly updates. On the 2nd of September Killmonday announced that the game would be released in just a little under three weeks, the 18th of September 2019. The day before release it was announced that owners of Fran Bow would receive a 10% discount on Little Misfortune.  Reception  Little Misfortune received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the game's art-style and thematic aspects but criticised the game's lack of gameplay, mishandling of certain themes such as the naivety of children, and relatively short length. On Metacritic the game has a score of 57 out of 100, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". CD-Action gave the game a 45/100, writing \\"The story made me uneasy not because I thought: 'those are the kind of things that shouldn't be said out loud' but because I thought: it's unsettling how poorly it is written, how badly they depicted a child's naivety and how everything is just too over the top.\\" Rock, Paper, Shotgun gave the game a mixed review, saying \\"some topics, like abuse, underpin the entire narrative and broadly work to give it a grounding in true unpleasantness. But others, like suicide, feel tossed in for shock value before never being addressed again. That feeling isn't helped by the tonal mismatch that places these adult fears alongside much more juvenile humour. Jamming a poop joke after an instance of animal death does little but ensure that they trip one another up, where landing one on its feet alone was already tricky.\\" Kotaku gave the game a more positive review, saying \\"While Little Misfortune's adventure isn't long (it took me about 2.5 hours to emerge from the other side), it is very meaningful. Misfortune is a bundle of pure joy, and she's a delight to spend time with, even if her adventures come to an abrupt end. While Misfortune breezes and bluffs her way past the darker parts of her story, including a journey through a racy hamster nightclub, players will be all too aware of the sinister world that she dances in.\\" Adventure Gamers gave the game 3.5 out of 5 praising the games voice acting and story, while criticizing lack of interactivity and moderation in \\"over-the-top awfulness\\". GamersPack gave the game a positive review saying \\"The game might be a little light on challenges or traditional gameplay, but it's full of (dark) humor and heart. Little Misfortune continues along the same grim path Killmonday Games started on with Fran Bow, so if you‚Äôre into the mix of the cute and the macabre, this one is for you.\\" Footnotes  References   External links  * Category:2019 video games Category:Adventure games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Dark fantasy video games Category:IOS games Category:Linux games Category:MacOS games Category:Single- player video games Category:Video games developed in Sweden Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Video games set in 1993 Category:Video games set in Sweden Category:Windows games Category:Unity (game engine) games ","title":"Little Misfortune"},{"id":"61823186","text":"The Victoria Falls Classic was a golf tournament on the South African Tour from 1976 to 1978.

Career and work  Newman was elected a fellow of Balliol College in 1854 and lectured for the literae humaniores and modern history and law schools from 1858; he developed a reputation as one of the foremost lecturers of his generation at Oxford. In 1868, he was appointed to a university readership, but retired two years later owing to ill health. He retained his fellowship at Balliol until his death, but declined to receive the stipend \\"for many years\\". He was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1867. While at Oxford, Newman published only one chapter, on land reform, in Questions for a Reformed Parliament (1867); he also advocated reforming the professoriate at Oxford when he gave evidence to a parliamentary select committee that year. In retirement, however, he began work on an edition of Aristotle's Politics, which appeared in four volumes, the first two in 1887 and the last in 1902. This would be \\"his principal monument\\", according to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: the \\"whole work belonged to the grand, leisurely type of scholarship, in which even notes have a literary quality ... for soundness of interpretation, copiousness of illustration, and mature wisdom its value was permanent\\".

The square, bordering the Calle Mayor, houses some of the oldest buildings still around in the city.  History and description  It lies in the Palacio neighborhood, part of the Centro District. Casa de la Villa (late 17th-century). It was known as \\"Plaza de San Salvador\\" in ancient times, as it was located near the (now defunct) Church of San Salvador, in whose atrium the primitive municipal council convened (the church was demolished in 1842). In 1463 Henry IV of Castile granted a market day in the square on Tuesdays. The Casa de los Lujanes (with its adjacent tower), dated from the 15th-century, is the oldest civil building in Madrid. The tradition states the tower was the location where Francis I of France was held captive after his capture in the 1525 Battle of Pavia. Other buildings in the square are the 16th-century Casa de Cisneros and the old city hall, the Casa de la Villa de Madrid. The primitive (or Fuente de la Villa), located in the centre of the square, also disappeared. In 1888, a statue of √Ålvaro de Baz√°n by sculptor Mariano Benlliure was commissioned for the 300th anniversary of his death; the square was chosen as location both because of its centrality and because of its small size the sculpture would stand out the most; the inauguration took place on 19 December 1891.

It forms part of the Chazey Court Farm complex and is situated close to the Thames at the western end of The Warren in the suburb of Caversham. The barn is a large 7 bay building with a steep roof, built of red brick. It displays a very similar construction style to Mapledurham House, an Elizabethan stately home some to the north-west of the barn. The barn is categorised by English Heritage as being in very bad condition, subject to immediate risk of further rapid deterioration or loss of fabric, and with no solution agreed with the owners. It is not in use, and has visible structural cracking, whilst the gable has temporary shoring. In early 2020 it was reported that the owners were to be issued with a final notice by Reading Borough Council, indicating that if necessary the council would carry out the necessary works on behalf of the owner and pass on the costs to them. Work undertaken by Oxford Archaeology and using dendrochronology techniques dates the construction of the barn to 1611 or shortly thereafter, and also indicates that the other buildings of the farm complex date from a similar date or later. Research undertaken by the Oxfordshire Record Society in 1925 suggest that the farmhouse was the site of the Manor of Mapledurham Chazey, acquired in 1582 by the owners of the adjoining estate of Mapledurham Gurney in order to create the current Mapledurham estate. They surmise that the new owners, who also built Mapledurham House at around the same time, demolished the old manorial buildings and replaced them with new farm buildings.

Some of the kinds of entities an identifier might denote include variables, types, labels, subroutines, and packages. Which character sequences constitute identifiers depends on the lexical grammar of the language. A common rule is alphanumeric sequences, with underscore also allowed (in some languages, _ is not allowed), and with the condition that it not begin with a numerical digit (to simplify lexing by avoiding confusing with integer literals) ‚Äì so \`foo, foo1, foo_bar, _foo\` are allowed, but \`1foo\` is not ‚Äì this is the definition used in earlier versions of C and C++, Python, and many other languages. Later versions of these languages, along with many other modern languages, support many more Unicode characters in an identifier. However, a common restriction is not to permit whitespace characters and language operators; this simplifies tokenization by making it free-form and context-free. For example, forbidding \`+\` in identifiers due to its use as a binary operation means that \`a+b\` and \`a + b\` can be tokenized the same, while if it were allowed, \`a+b\` would be an identifier, not an addition. Whitespace in identifier is particularly problematic, as if spaces are allowed in identifiers, then a clause such as \`if rainy day then 1\` is legal, with \`rainy day\` as an identifier, but tokenizing this requires the phrasal context of being in the condition of an if clause. Some languages do allow spaces in identifiers, however, such as ALGOL 68 and some ALGOL variants ‚Äì for example, the following is a valid statement: \`real half pi;\` which could be entered as \`.real. half pi;\` (keywords are represented in boldface, concretely via stropping). In ALGOL this was possible because keywords are syntactically differentiated, so there is no risk of collision or ambiguity, spaces are eliminated during the line reconstruction phase, and the source was processed via scannerless parsing, so lexing could be context-sensitive. In most languages, some character sequences have the lexical form of an identifier but are known as keywords ‚Äì for example, \`if\` is frequently a keyword for an if clause, but lexically is of the same form as \`ig\` or \`foo\` namely a sequence of letters. This overlap can be handled in various ways: these may be forbidden from being identifiers ‚Äì which simplifies tokenization and parsing ‚Äì in which case they are reserved words; they may both be allowed but distinguished in other ways, such as via stropping; or keyword sequences may be allowed as identifiers and which sense is determined from context, which requires a context-sensitive lexer. Non-keywords may also be reserved words (forbidden as identifiers), particularly for forward compatibility, in case a word may become a keyword in future. In a few languages, e.g., PL/1, the distinction is not clear. The scope, or accessibility within a program of an identifier can be either local or global. A global identifier is declared outside of functions and is available throughout the program. A local identifier is declared within a specific function and only available within that function. For implementations of programming languages that are using a compiler, identifiers are often only compile time entities. That is, at runtime the compiled program contains references to memory addresses and offsets rather than the textual identifier tokens (these memory addresses, or offsets, having been assigned by the compiler to each identifier). In languages that support reflection, such as interactive evaluation of source code (using an interpreter or an incremental compiler), identifiers are also runtime entities, sometimes even as first-class objects that can be freely manipulated and evaluated. In Lisp, these are called symbols. Compilers and interpreters do not usually assign any semantic meaning to an identifier based on the actual character sequence used. However, there are exceptions. For example: * In Perl a variable is indicated using a prefix called a sigil, which specifies aspects of how the variable is interpreted in expressions. * In Ruby a variable is automatically considered immutable if its identifier starts with a capital letter. * In Fortran, the first letter in a variable's name indicates whether by default it is created as an integer or floating point variable. * In Go, the capitalization of the first letter of a variable's name determines its visibility (uppercase for public, lowercase for private). In some languages such as Go, identifiers uniqueness is based on their spelling and their visibility. In HTML an identifier is one of the possible attributes of an HTML element. It is unique within the document.

After the war he returned to the Leichhardt Rowing Club and he was selected at three in the New South Wales men's eight in 1920 when Interstate eight-oared championships recommenced, now racing for the same King's Cup he had won at Henley. He again competed in New South Wales King's Cup eights in 1922 and 1923. War service McGill enlisted in the AIF aged 22 in May 1915. He joined the 20th Battalion and embarked from Sydney on HMAT A61 Konowna in June 1915. In actions on the Western Front he was three times seriously wounded. He'd been promoted from Private to Sergeant by the time he was on the front line at Pozieres where he led digging parties under fire.Patterson, Scott (2019) The Oarsmen, Hardie Grant Books By 1917 at 2nd Bullecourt he was a Second Lieutenant when he suffered bullet wounds in the arm and face suffering a complete loss of his teeth. At Ypres in October 1917 he received a gunshot wound to the thigh and was evacuated to London. He was back in the line again by January 1918 and three month's later was hit by shrapnel and spent months recovering at the AIF Base Hospital in Le Havre. His citation for the Military Medal in September 1916 commended his \\"valuable work and good leadership greatly assisted success of the undertaking at Pozieres. Also consistent devotion to duty\\". At war's end McGill rowed in the three seat of the AIF #1 eight at the 1919 Peace Regatta at Henley-on-Thames, the crew which won the King's Cup which in time, became the trophy for the men's eight event contested annually at the Australian Interstate Regatta. McGill was seated in the AIF#2 crew for most of the training period leading up to the July 1919 Peace Regatta. Along with George Mettam and Arthur Scott he was one of the final three crew changes made to the AIF #1 eight just ten days before the event. Later that month he again raced in the Australian AIF eight when they competed at the Inter-Allied Regatta on the Seine in Paris. Post war After repatriation, McGill returned to Sydney where he worked in his family's haulage and trucking business. He had a long association with the Leichhardt Rowing Club and the Old Oarsmen's Association. He married Dorothy Rapp and they had two sons. He died in August 1979.

The engagement occurred after a failed Parliamentarian siege of nearby Royalist- held Sherborne. After the Parliamentarians retreated to Yeovil, a force of around 350 Royalists was sent to reconnoitre their movements. Under the command of Sir Ralph Hopton, the Royalist detachment established itself on Babylon Hill, on the outskirts of Yeovil. Around half an hour before sunset, the Royalists decided to withdraw and began marching their infantry off the hill. As they were doing so, they spotted Parliamentarian soldiers approaching, and Hopton hurriedly recalled the infantry and set his men to meet the attack. The battle became chaotic, mostly due to the inexperience of the soldiers involved. The Parliamentarian force, which also numbered around 350, made a three pronged cavalry attack, which the Royalists were able to repel, though sections of both forces were routed. In the confusion, they were eventually able to pull back under the cover of darkness. Neither side suffered heavy casualties; although both sides claimed they had killed sixty or more, a modern estimate suggests that the Royalists lost around twenty, and the Parliamentarians five. The Parliamentarians subsequently withdrew from Yeovil to Dorchester to the south, while around two weeks later the Royalists retreated from the area entirely. Background Tension between Parliament and King Charles escalated sharply during 1642 after the King had attempted to arrest five members of Parliament. The King appointed the Marquess of Hertford as commander of his forces in the West Country, supported by Sir Ralph Hopton, a local member of Parliament (MP) and an experienced army officer. The county of Somerset was generally more sympathetic towards Parliament than towards the King, and after the Royalists established quarters at Wells they were constantly under threat. They won a minor skirmish at Marshall's Elm, where their superior cavalry and leadership helped them defeat a much larger Parliamentarian force, but they were forced to leave Wells on 6 August when the local population rose against them, wielding makeshift weapons such as pitchforks. Hertford retreated to Sherborne in Dorset, where he garrisoned the castle, with just under 1,500 men. Dorset was split in its sympathies: most of the larger towns favoured Parliament; but in more rural areas, and to the north of the county generally, the Royalists had more support. The alt=An oil painting of the Earl of Bedford from around 1640 A Parliamentarian army of between 3,500 and 7,000, led by William Russell, 5th Earl of Bedford, besieged Sherborne on 2 September 1642. On the first day, the Royalists had the better of several skirmishes in the town itself, but were unable to prevent the Parliamentarian bombardment of the town and castle. Hopton led his dragoons in small raids on the enemy camp each night, in conjunction with retaliatory artillery attacks on the besieging army. The inexperienced Parliamentarian army suffered from heavy desertions, culminating in a reported 800 on the night of 5/6 September. Bedford's army had dwindled to between 1,200 and 1,500, and he withdrew to Yeovil, chased by a small skirmishing detachment led by Hopton. Prelude The day after the siege had been lifted, Hertford sent Hopton with around 350 men‚Äî150 horse (both cavalry and dragoons) and 200 foot soldiers‚Äîto scout the enemy's movements in Yeovil. On their approach to Yeovil, Hopton established himself on Babylon Hill, which he identified as a suitable location to watch the town, due to hedge-lined gullies which allowed his troops to climb the hill unobserved. Wary of attack, Hopton set musketeers and dragoons along the approaches to the summit, where he gathered his cavalry and remaining musketeers. Bedford had posted a guard, consisting of both infantry and artillery, on Yeovil Bridge, which spanned the River Yeo. Hopton's men had a good view of this guard and for over an hour his musketeers shot down at the guards with little effect. Battle As evening approached, Hopton consulted with his commanders and decided to retire to Sherborne for the night, and at 6pm, around half an hour before sunset, began withdrawing the infantry while the cavalry and dragoons covered the rear. Before all of the infantry had left Babylon Hill a Royalist officer, Colonel Lawdy, spotted an enemy party approaching over the fields by \\"a secret way\\". Rather than climb the hill via the gullies which Hopton had defended, the Parliamentarians cut straight through the fields, avoiding Hopton's ambushes. According to a Parliamentarian account of the battle, the Royalists had set \\"six musketeers on each side the way to entertain us, but they missed us all.\\" In his memoirs of the war, Hopton states that he had twenty musketeers guarding the right- hand gully, and all of his dragoons hidden in the hedges on the left-hand gully. Ralph Hopton led the Royalist forces at Babylon Hill.alt=A 1626 oil painting of Ralph Hopton Hopton summoned the infantry back, and brought his cavalry into battle formation to face the approaching Parliamentarians. The historian Richard Brooks described the ensuing fight as \\"more muddle than battle.\\" Hopton sent two troops to charge the approaching Parliamentarians, the first led by Captain Edward Stowell, and the second (Hopton's troop) by Captain Henry Moreton. According to Hopton, Stowell was successful in routing the approaching enemy, but his inexperienced cavalry were outnumbered and themselves routed, their flight causing panic and retreat among Moreton's men as well. The Parliamentarian account of the battle said that the first of their three cavalry troops to reach the Royalists was commanded by Captain Aiscogh, and it \\"charged one of the troops through and through, and charged the second, but then was glad to wheel about.\\" The account records that when Captain Tomson's cavalry reached the fighting things got chaotic, which concurs with Hopton's recollection that \\"in very short time, all the horse on both sides were in confusion.\\" Another group of Parliamentarians had made it to the top of the hill by going up one of the gullies on the right of Hopton's forces, which had been left unguarded after the musketeers had been recalled: Hopton blamed Sir Thomas Lunsford, who commanded the infantry for \\"having forgotten to put a party of musketeers as before.\\" In total, the Parliamentarians committed a similar number, around 350 men, to the fight as the Royalists. In a letter written by the prominent Royalist Sir Edward Nicholas, he described how on reaching the summit, the Parliamentarian captain‚Äîa son of William Balfour, Parliament's lieutenant-general of horse‚Äî\\"rode out single from his troop brandishing his sword, as if he would dare somebody to combat with him.\\" John Stowell rode to meet the challenge, and after Balfour shot his pistol from distance, Stowell held his fire until he was close enough to be accurate. His shot hit Balfour on the chest, and Stowell finished him off with his sword. Hopton's description of the incident differs slightly, suggesting that another Royalist soldier, James Colborne, shot Balfour with a fowling piece, simultaneous to Stowell's lone charge. In either case, Balfour was disabled and his troop routed. Royalist reports claimed that Balfour had been killed in the fight, but the Parliamentarian dispatch does not mention him, saying only that \\"all but one of the slain are of Captain Aiscogh's troop\\". In his account of the battle, the historian Robert Morris suggests that Balfour was only stunned, and was active in later engagements that year. Seizing upon the confusion, Hopton chose to withdraw his infantry again, \\"covered by a few gentlemen\\", and in the darkness the entire Royalist detachment were able to make good their retreat. As the Royalists made their way off the hill, Hopton records that they came across around 16 of the Parliamentarians who had earlier been routed. His men killed a few of the soldiers, but most were taken prisoner, and escorted by the Royalists back to Sherborne. It is difficult to ascertain the losses for either side; Royalist propaganda claimed that they had killed between 100 and 140 while only losing 16 men, a figure which included one officer who was taken prisoner. In contrast, the Parliamentarians suggested that only three of their men had died, and that as many as 60 of Hopton's soldiers had been killed. In his history of Somerset during the civil war, David Underdown suggests that the Parliamentarians lost five, and the Royalists around twenty. Another historian, Tim Goodwin provides higher estimates, quoting losses of 15 or 16 for the Parliamentarians, and 50 to 60 for the Royalists. Among the Royalist losses were two infantry officers; Lieutenant Hall and Captain Hussey, the latter of whom was said to have gone into the battle \\"clad in plush\\". Aftermath As described by Hopton, the Earl of Bedford withdrew his army from Yeovil to Dorchester. The Royalist forces remained at Sherborne for almost two weeks after the battle, before learning that Portsmouth had been captured by the Parliamentarians. Hertford, against the advice of Hopton, decided to retreat to Minehead where they would escape by boat to Wales. The Royalists suffered heavy desertions during the long march through country predominantly sympathetic towards Parliament, during which they were chased by Bedford's army. At Minehead, they found that there were only two boats, and so Hertford sailed with the infantry and artillery to Wales, while Hopton and around 160 horse escaped through north Devon to Cornwall. Both sides tried to claim victory in the propaganda war; on Parliament's side, a pamphlet entitled Happy newes from Sherborn said that \\"God cast upon the cavaliers a spirit of fearfulness, that they ran like mice into every hole.\\" In contrast, Hopton said that after the battle \\"the enemy liked their bargain so ill, that they marched clear away from Yeovil\\". Brooks summarises the skirmish as \\"pretty much a draw\\", though he lists the Parliamentarians as winners, as does Stephen Manganiello in his encyclopedia of the war. The engagement was heartening to the Parliamentarians, showing that the Royalist cavalry could be beaten, and that their leaders were not infallible.

It affected the cities of Echinus and Tarphe.Antonopoulos, 1980 Background During the 4th century, an earthquake took place in the Gulf of Corinth. It caused thousands of deaths and reportedly damaged the cities of Chaeronea, Coroneia, Naupactus, and Patras. The city of Corinth itself was probably also damaged, though this in not directly stated in the primary sources.Antonopoulos, 1980 According to the 6th-century historian Procopius, this earthquake created new chasms. They reportedly remained open and \\"formed steps\\". Transportation between the local settlements became more difficult, with Procopius reporting a requirement of many detours to reach one's destination.Antonopoulos, 1980 A similar deformation of the ground is mentioned by the 5th-century historian Evagrius Scholasticus.Antonopoulos, 1980 Based on their description, the event marked a fault break which extended to the surface of the ground.Antonopoulos, 1980 Main event According to Procopius, in 551 the region of the Malian Gulf was shaken by a new earthquake. The earthquake was then followed by a seismic sea-wave (tsunami). There reportedly was a sudden \\"influx of the sea\\" in the gulf between the regions of Thessaly and Boeotia. The cities of Echinus and Tarphe were flooded by the tsunami, and were immediately \\"levelled\\".Antonopoulos, 1980 Procopius reports that the islands of the Gulf became reachable to pedestrians, since the sea had abandoned them. But when the sea returned to its proper place, it left behind fish on the ground.Antonopoulos, 1980 There is some doubt on whether Procopius was conflating two different earthquakes, one which took place in the Gulf of Corinth, and another in the Malian Gulf. The geophysicist August Heinrich Sieberg (20th century) considered this to have been a single earthquake, but geophysicist Angelos Galanopoulos (20th century) considered this a description of two earthquakes. The journal Annals of Geophysics considered the second option more likely, because a singular earthquake of that magnitude would have affected more cities.Antonopoulos, 1980 This was likely the same earthquake which Procopius reported as causing a collapse in the fortifications of Thermopylae.Antonopoulos, 1980 Procopius reports that the earthquake coincided in time with a military expedition of the general Narses against the Ostrogoths, dating the event to the final years of the Gothic War.Antonopoulos, 1980 While Procopius connected this earthquake to pre-existing seismic faults, the journal Annals of Geophysics considered another possible cause for it. Submarine landslides within the Malian Gulf may have been triggered by the initial earthquake. The stability of the local slopes was apparently sufficiently disturbed to cause subsequent events, such slumping of the coasts.Antonopoulos, 1980 Surrounding events The year 551 included several other earthquakes in the regions of Greece, Anatolia, and the Middle East.

History Construction of the complex began in the 1960s and all tower blocks were completed in 1967. Like many housing complexes in Nottingham, they were built following slum clearances in the area. However the tower blocks faced many problems, including bad insulation, unaffordable heating costs and other technical failures. Demolition In 2011, it was announced by Nottingham City Council of plans to demolish the Lenton Flats due to being increasingly expensive to maintain for the blocks to have improved living standards. Demolition of the complex started in 2013, with Lenton Court being the first to be demolished in November. Following the demolition of Digby and Abbey Court in 2014, the construction process of modern Low-rise houses and flats began as part of a construction of a new housing estate. Willoughby Court was then demolished by June 2015, followed by Newgate Court in May 2016. The construction of the new low-rise housing estate was complete by 2018.

Nicholson grew up in the East End of London, and worked as a docker. He joined the Transport and General Workers' Union (TGWU), and by 1968 was a member of the executive of its No.1 Docks Group. In this role, he was a vocal opponent of racism and fascism, speaking out in particular against the support of some dockers for Enoch Powell. This theme was prominent in his 1974 pamphlet, Racialism, Fascism and the Trade Unions. By 1972, Nicholson was a member of TGWU's executive, regarded as being on the left wing of the union, and a vice-chair of the Institute for Workers' Control. In 1975, Nicholson advocated industrial action against containerisation at Tilbury Docks. A strike took place, but it was poorly organised and supported, and after unions members voted to return to work without gaining any concesions, Nicholson accepted the decision. During the strike, Nicholson secretly passed information on union tactics to MI5. This was revealed in 2001, at which time Nicholson claimed that he was playing games with the secret service, and only told them things which were not significant. By 1978, he chaired the joint union committee for the London Docks, and had become more cautious about strike action. In 1982, Nicholson stood to become the chairman of the TGWU, but was defeated by a more left-wing docker, Walter Greendale, instead becoming deputy chairman. In 1983, the TGWU was given five automatic seats on the General Council of the Trades Union Congress, and Nicholson was appointed to one of them. Four years later, Greendale was defeated for re-election to the union's executive, and therefore could no longer serve as chair. On this occasion, Nicholson won election to the post, defeating the more left-wing Daniel Duffy. In 1988, Nicholson was up for re-election to the TGWU executive, but was beaten into third place, with the militant Steve Riley winning the post. Nicholson's supporters claimed that Riley's membership payments were in arrears and so he should be disqualified, but this argument was rejected. Nicholson stood again for the executive in 1990, but was beaten by three other candidates. Nicholson was involved in a 1989 against the abolition of the National Dock Labour Board, following which he was sacked. An industrial tribunal found that he and 18 other union activists had been unlawfully dismissed, and were entitled to compensation, but they were not re-employed. He instead began running a club for retired dockers, in East London.

This legal announcement is also published in Gil Blas and Le Journal of the same day and in Le Monde artistique of August 20, 1905 Campton appeared in a number of 'breeches roles', including in the revue Entente Cordiale (1905) by Robert de Flers, in which she played a British Lord opposite Mlle Marie Marville as Madame de France at the Th√©√¢tre des Capucines. During 1904 to 1907 she was at the Moulin Rouge, in 1904 in the revue La Revue du Moulin with music by Gustave Goublier, and in 1907 in the operetta Le toreador. In 1906 she was in Une Revue au Palais-Royal, while in 1907 she acted in the comedy Souper d‚ÄôAdieu at the Th√©√¢tre des Capucines. From 1907 to 1910 she was in the annual Folies Berg√®re revue by Flers. With Louis Maurel she sang 'Entrevue de Marienbad' at the Folies Berg√®re, which was recorded and which betrays her English accent while singing in French. In about 1908 Campton appeared in the revue Pomme d‚Äôamour while in 1911 she was at the Th√©√¢tre des Ambassadeurs. Between October 1911 and February 1912 she played alongside Ren√© Hervil the Th√©√¢tre des Capucines in Et voil√†! by Robert Dieudonn√© and Gently! by Hugues Delorme. In the following year he would cast her as the lead in his Maud series of films. During 1911 to 1913 Campton was at La Cigale in La revue sans culotte (1911); the comedy Miss Alice des P.T.T. by Tristan Bernard (1912-1913) and in En scene‚Ä¶ mon president (1913), both with Maurice Claudius as her on-stage partner. In 1913 she performed in revues at the Th√©√¢tre Marigny, including in La revue de Marigny by Andr√© Barde and Michel-Antoine Carr√©. From 1912 to 1915 she was on film sets for the studio Urban-Eclipse in Paris where she created the title role in the Maud series under the direction of Ren√© Hervil.

After World War I Campton's career began to fail.

In 1923 she appeared in Blanc et Noir at the Th√©√¢tre des Vari√©t√©s and in the same year at the same theatre she had a supporting part in Un Jour de Folie by Andr√© Birabeau.

Slim has written about the nature of contemporary conflict, the protection of civilians and the ethics of humanitarian aid. He is currently a Senior Research Fellow at the Institute of Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict in the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford. Early life and education Slim is a son of John Slim, 2nd Viscount Slim, and Elisabeth ‚ÄúBuffy‚Äù Slim, n√©e Spinney. He was educated at Broadlands Primary School in Hereford and St George's School, Windsor before going to Eton College and then to St John's College, Oxford where he studied Theology. He received his PhD (on the basis of published work) from Oxford Brookes University in 2002. Contribution to ethics Slim's writing on war is distinct for its determined focus on the civilian experience of war and the moral arguments he uses to justify the ‚Äúcivilian ethic‚Äù in armed conflict. His book, Killing Civilians (2007) used a historical perspective to establish ‚Äúseven spheres of suffering‚Äù that are typical for civilians in war, and criticised a spectrum of ‚Äúanti-civilian ideologies‚Äù in political and military policy that deliberately drive this suffering. Slim has also pioneered a new turn in the applied ethics of Humanitarian Action. This began with a paper \\"Doing the Right Thing: Relief Agencies, Moral Dilemmas and Moral Responsibility in Political Emergencies and War\\" (Disasters 21:3, 1997). His book, Humanitarian Ethics: The Morality of Aid in War and Disaster (2015) framed a new field of practical humanitarian ethics. This has influenced scholars, policymakers and practitioners in humanitarian aid who are now using and critiquing Slim's approach. Life and career Slim has combined a career in academia, policy and practice. He started his career in 1983 with Save the Children UK, working in Morocco, Sudan and Ethiopia and as a field officer for the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General in Ethiopia. Returning to the UK, he worked on Save the Children's Middle East Desk during the first Intifada and the Iraqi Kurdish refugee crisis in Turkey, before becoming Senior Research Officer from 1992 to 1994. He was appointed Senior Lecturer at Oxford Brookes University in 1994 to co-lead the new Masters in Development and Humanitarian Practice with Nabeel Hamdi at the Centre for Development and Emergency Practice (CENDEP). In 2001, Hamdi and Slim won a Queen's Anniversary Prize for Higher Education for their \\"exceptional innovation in the education of humanitarian professionals.\\" Slim has since worked at the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue in Geneva and as a Senior Research Fellow at the Institute of Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict (ELAC) at the University of Oxford where he co-founded the Oxford Consortium for Human Rights with Professor Cheyney Ryan and other US academics. From 2015 to 2020, he was Head of Policy at the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva. Slim has been a Trustee of Oxfam GB and the Catholic Agency for Overseas Development (CAFOD) and a Visiting Professor at the University of Oregon and the Graduate Institute in Geneva. Personal life Slim is married to Asma Khaliq Awan, an international humanitarian worker from Pakistan. He has two children from his first marriage to the writer and journalist, Rebecca Abrams.

These drugs are used to treat asthma, relieve individuals of seasonal allergies rhinitis and prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. There are currently three different types of drugs within the CysLT1 family, zafirlukast which was first on the market being released in 1996, montelukast which was released in 1998 and pranlukast which was released in 2007. __TOC__  Medical Uses  The medical uses for Cysteinyl-leukotriene type 1 receptor antagonists are for chronic and prophylactic treatment of asthma. Other indications have been approved by the FDA for montelukast and they are used for the prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB), relief of symptoms of allergic rhinitis (AR) that is for relief of seasonal allergic rhinitis and perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR). Adverse effects The actions of CysLT1 receptor antagonists (montelukast, zafirlukast and pranlukast) are competitive, as such they hinder the actions of leukotrienes. They prevent different types of asthmatic responses as well as having effects on bronchoconstriction and inflammation. Adverse effects often follow the use of these medications. = Montelukast = Montelukast has been tested in clinical trials under different conditions to observe different adverse effects. The most common side effects for montelukast are, for example, respiratory infection, fever, headache, cough, abdominal pain, otitis media, rhinorrhea, sinusitis and more. = Zafirlukast = The adverse effects of zafirlukast are very similar to montelukast. There is a database for safety which incorporates more than 4000 volunteers and 1723 patients which were asthmatic. Some of the side effects are similar to that of montelukast for example headache, infection, abdominal pain, fever, and multiple others. Mechanism of action The biosynthesis for leukotrienes as well as the mechanism of action of cysteinyl leukotriene receptor type 1 antagonists The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) are powerful inflammatory inducing eicosanoids that are produced and released by various cells of the immune system. Leukotrienes are produced from arachidonic acid by 5-lipoxygenase (which is made from phospholipids in the cell membrane) and other various enzymes. The cells of the immune system that release leukotrienes are basophils, eosinophils, mast cells and macrophages following various stimuli for example allergens. They bind to cysteinyl leukotriene receptors (CysLT). One of those receptors is CysLT type-1 (CysLT1) and can be found in many different parts of the human airway as well as on pro-inflammatory cells. The CysLT receptors have been linked to the pathophysiology of allergic rhinitis and asthma. Zafirlukast and montelukast are powerful CysLT type-1 receptor antagonists. The primary actions of these drugs are that they block the action of leukotrienes, by binding to the receptor with antagonistic action without having an agonistic effect. The primary purpose of the antagonists is to block the actions of leukotriene D4 (LTD4) By competing with LTD4 it will result in reduced effect by the leukotrienes, for example, LTD4 which has bronchoconstriction and vasoconstricting effect, as well as bronchial asthma and inflammation. Pharmacokinetics When comparing the pharmacokinetic properties of montelukast and zafirlukast the two drugs have many similarities. The peak plasma concentrations are around 2,5-4 hours depending on what form is given. Both drugs are plasma protein-bound (-99%) and in vitro studies with rats have indicated low distribution across the blood-brain- barrier. Metabolism of montelukast and zafirlukast are extensive. Montelukast is mainly metabolized CYP2C8 and zafirlukast by CYP2C9. The half-life of montelukast is 2,7-5,5 hours and zafirlukast 8-16 hours. Structure Activity Relationships (SAR) 288x288pxWhen looking for leukotriene receptor antagonists, researchers began without any assistance of ligand-receptor binding data and approached the issue in three different ways. Those approaches included the structural design of leukotriene analogues, quinoline analogues, and the randomized screening of compounds. Those combined efforts led to a simple SAR: The lipophilic tetraene tail of LTD4 can be imitated by several of more stable aromatic rings, the sulfide of the glycyl-cysteine dipeptide can be supplanted by an alkyl carboxylic acid, and the C1 Carboxylate of LTD4 must be maintained. Further research prioritizing on the three-dimensional demands for antagonist binding to the CysLT receptors elucidated that the pharmacophore requires an acidic negative ionizable usable group, a hydrogen-bond acceptor role, and three hydrophobic regions. From this research, synthetic endeavours lead to the development of montelukast and zafirlukast as cysteinyl-leukotriene type 1 receptor antagonists. Quinolines were shown to be good moiety for CysLT1 receptor antagonist. From weak antagonistic derivatives of quinolines, montelukast was developed. Several changes to the structure can be made without the loss of activity. Among these changes are reducing the quinoline ring, replacing the chlorine with fluorine, inserting an ether linkage in between the two aromatic rings instead of the double bound and adding an amide group for the sulfur. Replacement of the quinoline by benzothiazole, dichlorothienopyridines or alkyl-substituted thiazoles is possible but none of these is superior. 288x288px Zafirlukast is an indole derivative that satisfies the pharmacophore need for an ionizable moiety with a sulfonamide group. Numerous analogues have been organized; nonetheless, everyone of them resulted in diminishing antagonistic activity. Like montelukast, zafirlukast antagonizes bronchoconstrictive by selectively antagonising the CysLT1 receptor and affects all of the leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4). The qualitative structural requirements and pharmacophore for CysLT1 antagonists were designed from the structural similarity of the agonist LTD4. But that has its limitations as agonist and antagonist do not necessarily bind in the same manner nor to the same site. So the importance of certain moiety may be overestimated and some moieties may be overlooked. Synthesis An example for the synthesis of montelukast sodiumAn example for the synthesis of montelukast An example for the synthesis of zafirlukast none History The receptor for cysteinyl leukotrienes LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4 are a viable target because of the importance of cysteinyl leukotrienes in mediating the responses in asthma. It has been discovered that two types of said receptor exist, the CysLT1 receptor as well as the CysLT2 receptor. Leukotriene-receptor antagonists is a special class of drug, formulated as tablets that have both an anti-inflammatory effect as well as a bronchodilating effect. The development of leukotriene receptor antagonist started with screening a large number of compounds and designing quinoline and structural analogues. An example of a CysLT1 receptor antagonists is montelukast which is a quinoline derivative and zafirlukast which is an indole derivative. Both CysLT1 selective antagonists. Zafirlukast was the first approved CysLT1 receptor antagonist in the USA in September 26th 1996. There are 2 other main medications that have been approved across the world, for example, montelukast which was approved February 2nd, 1996 and pranlukast which was approved March 15th, 2007. There hasn‚Äôt just been interest in the CysLT1 receptor, there has also been interest in the CysLT2 receptor which can be found in smooth muscle cells in the airways, as well as inflammatory cells and endothelial cells, which may be a useful target for asthma patients. There have been discoveries of dual CysLT1 and CysLT2 receptor antagonists, for example, Gemilukast which could be a useful therapeutic agent for asthma patients which are non-responsive to montelukast, zafirlukast and pranlukast.

The DMEK technique involves the removal of a very thin sheet of tissue from the posterior side of a person's cornea, replacing it with the two innermost layers of corneal tissue from a donor's eyeball. The two corneal layers which are exchanged are the Descemet's membrane and the corneal endothelium. The person's corneal tissue is gently excised and replaced with the donor tissue via small 'clear corneal incisions' (small corneal incisions just anterior to the corneal limbus. The donor tissue is tamponaded against the person's exposed posterior corneal stroma by injecting a small air bubble into the anterior chamber. To ensure the air tamponade is effective, it is necessary for people to strictly posture so that they are looking up at the ceiling during the recovery period and until the air bubble has fully resorbed.  Medical uses  Indications for DMEK include: * Corneal dystrophy involving the corneal endothelial layer, e.g.: ** Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy ** Posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy *Pseudophakic bullous keratopathy *Iridocorneal endothelial syndrome  Nomenclature  A minor variation to DMEK is the Descemet Membrane Automated Endothelial Keratoplasty (DMAEK), which involves automated preparation of donor tissue, using a microkeratome or femtosecond laser.

Born on the lower Oldpark road in north Belfast, Freeman was raised a Presbyterian. His father Samuel fought in the 2nd World war with the Scottish Cameronian rifles and was shot and captured in Belgium. He spent nearly five years in Poland as a prisoner of war. Samuel was a life long christian and member of all the loyal orders. Freeman had an older sister Stella and a younger brother Edward. They were educated at the Model Primary School on Cliftonville Road, leaving at the age of fourteen. During the war years his mother Mary worked in the local mill making munitions. He undertook a variety of jobs before emigrating to Australia in 1955, to work as a labourer. He returned to Belfast in 1962, and found himself unable to work at Short and Harland because he was not a member of the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers' Union (ATGWU). He instead found employment in a warehouse, but joined the ATGWU and soon moved to work at Short and Harland as a labourer. Freeman became an ATGWU shop steward, then won election as the convenor of shop stewards at the works. He also won election to the union's national general executive council. Freeman opposed internment of suspected Irish republicans in 1971, and faced intimidation from the Loyalist Association of Workers. He was forced to leave his job, but the ATGWU found him full-time employment as a union organiser. He proved successful, and in 1974 was appointed as the union's regional secretary for Ireland. In the role, he aimed to avoid involvement in sectarian issues, and was involved in the creation of the Enkalon Foundation. He also represented the union at the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU), and from 1995 to 1997 served as President of the ICTU. Freeman retired in 1998, and died in 2011. He was predeceased by his wife Ellen whom he was devoted to.

The first such vessel, , was a packet steamer requisitioned for service during the First Schleswig War in 1848, though she returned to civilian duty after the war. In 1850, the Prussians ordered a pair of small vessels‚Äîthe ‚Äîfrom Britain; like Preussicher Adler, these were both paddle steamers. The first screw-driven aviso followed in 1856: the French- built . Another paddle steamer, , was laid down in 1858, the first vessel of the type built in a German shipyard. Many of these vessels served as yachts for the royal and later imperial family.

The Germans thereafter built light cruisers that fulfilled the roles occupied by the avisos; the first of these, the , combined the best features of Hela with those of contemporary unprotected cruisers. Hela was, herself, sunk in September 1914 during World War I; the other vessels still in service saw little active use during the war and were all broken up afterward. One final vessel, , was built in the mid-1930s for use as a yacht for Adolf Hitler. During World War II, she was used as a minelayer, a training ship, and a stationary headquarters ship in Norway before being seized by Britain. She was sold after the war to a private owner and was ultimately scrapped in 1951. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"float: right; margin: 0 0 0 1em;\\" + Key - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Armament  The number and type of guns in the primary armament - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Displacement  Ship displacement at full combat load - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Propulsion  Number of shafts, type of propulsion system, and top speed generated - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Service  The dates work began and finished on the ship and its ultimate fate - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Laid down  The date the keel assembly commenced - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Commissioned  The date the ship was commissioned } Preussischer Adler Painting of Preussischer Adler by Christopher Rave Preussischer Adler was an iron-hulled paddle steamer originally built for the Prussian postal service to operate on the packet route between Prussia and Russia in the mid-1840s. At the time, the Prussian Navy was an anemic force consisting of a handful of small sailing vessels and cannon-armed yawls. The ship was requisitioned early in her career during the First Schleswig War to defend the Prussian coast from the more powerful Danish Navy that imposed a blockade on Prussia's and the other German states' ports. She took part in a short battle with the Danish brig , the first engagement involving the Prussian fleet. She returned to commercial duties after the war and served in that capacity uneventfully until 1862, when the expansion of the Prussian Eastern Railway rendered her superfluous. Purchased by the Prussian Navy, she was in the Mediterranean Sea with a pair of gunboats on the eve of the Second Schleswig War. The ships were recalled to Prussia but arrived after the outbreak of war. They joined a pair of Austrian screw frigates to attack the Danish blockade squadron in the Battle of Heligoland, though the Austrians bore the brunt of Danish fire. She served as the flagship of Prussian vessels in the Baltic Sea during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì1871, but saw no action. Reduced to subsidiary duties in 1872, including as a training ship and fisheries protection vessel, she was ultimately decommissioned in April 1877 and sunk as a target two years later in June 1879. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Preussischer Adler class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2 √ó 25-pound mortars   2 √ó paddle wheels, 1 √ó marine steam engine,  1846  1846  Sunk as a target, 26 June 1879 } Nix class The two Nix-class avisos were ordered in the immediate aftermath of the First Schleswig War as part of a program intended to strengthen the Prussian fleet. Prince Adalbert of Prussia, one of the leading advocates for a larger navy, initially sought to have the ships built in Prussia, but domestic shipbuilders had little experience with steam ships, and so contracted with a British firm to build the vessels in 1850. The ships' careers in Prussian service proved to be short and uneventful, apart from repeated boiler fires aboard Nix. The Prussians were not satisfied with the ships, in part a result of Nixs fires and general unfamiliarity with operating steamships. They sold the vessels to Britain in exchange for the sail frigate in 1855; Nix and Salamander became HMS Weser and Recruit, respectively. The former saw action during the Crimean War at the Battle of Kinburn later that year, but both ships thereafter saw little use in the Royal Navy. Both were out of service by the mid-1860s, with Recruit being sold for scrap in 1869 and Weser following her to the breaker's yard in 1873. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Nix class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   rowspan=\\"2\\"  4 √ó 25-pound mortars  rowspan=\\"2\\"   rowspan=\\"2\\"  2 √ó paddle wheels, 2 √ó marine steam engines,  rowspan=\\"2\\"  1850  rowspan=\\"2\\"  1850  Broken up, 1873 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   Broken up, 1869 } Grille Grille in her original configuration Grille was ordered in 1855 as part of Adalbert's fleet expansion program; she was the first steam ship to use screw propellers rather than the paddle wheels of earlier vessels. She was initially unarmed, being used as a royal yacht until the outbreak of the Second Schleswig War. She sortied on 16 April with Adalbert aboard to attack the Danish blockade squadron in the Baltic, resulting in an inconclusive encounter with the Danish ship of the line and the steam frigate . She next engaged the steam frigate on 24 April. She sortied twice more by early May, but on both occasions encountered far superior Danish forces and withdrew without attacking. Grille served as a yacht after the war, taking Crown Prince Friedrich to the opening ceremonies for the Suez Canal in 1867. During the Franco-Prussian War, she once again served in the Baltic, and she engaged a French blockade squadron on 17 July, interrupting French plans to attack Swinem√ºnde. Grille remained in service through the early 1910s, serving in a variety of roles, including as a fleet scout, a tender, and a training vessel. She ended her career as a tender for the cruiser as part of the training establishment for the M√ºrwik Naval School. Decommissioned for the last time in 1918, she was the longest-serving vessel of the Imperial Navy, having been on active service for sixty-two years. She was then sold for scrap in 1920. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Grille class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2 √ó 12-pound guns   1 √ó screw propeller, 1 √ó marine steam engine, 13 knots  1856  3 June 1858  Broken up, 1920 } Loreley Loreley in her later configuration With Grille serving as a yacht in the 1850s, the navy decided it needed another aviso to serve as a flagship for the gunboat flotillas defending the country's Baltic coast. The designers reverted to paddle wheels and a wooden hull, as they were not convinced of the long-term utility of iron hulls or screw propulsion. The ship went to the Mediterranean in 1860 to protect Prussian nationals in Italy during the Second Italian War of Independence. She served in her intended role during the Second Schleswig War, and saw action at the Battle of Jasmund against the Danish blockade squadron in March 1864, where she was hit only once. She was decommissioned after the war and saw no further service for the rest of the decade. In poor condition by the late 1860s, Loreley was heavily rebuilt in 1869‚Äì1873, leading some historians to treat the vessel as two different ships. In 1879, the ship was sent to Constantinople, the capital of the Ottoman Empire, to serve as the station ship there, a right enjoyed by all of the European Great Powers after the Crimean War (which was intended to counter Russian expansionism at the expense of the Ottomans). She served there for the rest of her career. During this period, she helped to protect German interests in Egypt during the 'Urabi revolt in 1882, conducted training cruises in the Mediterranean, and sent men ashore in 1895 to protect Germans from domestic unrest in the Ottoman Empire. Worn out by 1896, she was decommissioned and sold later that year, but her ultimate fate is unknown. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align: center;\\" + Summary of the Loreley class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2 √ó 12-pounder guns   2 √ó paddle wheels, 1 √ó marine steam engine, 10.5 knots  1 February 1858  28 September 1859  Unknown } Falke Falke was originally built as a speculative project by her British constructors, who intended to sell the vessel to the Confederate States Navy for use as a blockade runner during the American Civil War. By the time work on the vessel was completed, however, the war was over, leaving the shipyard without a buyer. A private shipowner in the Netherlands purchased the vessel, renamed it Heinrich Heister, and left it idle in Rotterdam for the next five years. She was purchased by what was now the North German Federal Navy in August 1870, shortly after the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, but she was accidentally rammed by the turret ship shortly after entering service as Falke, causing serious damage that ended her wartime career. She operated with the fleet during the 1870s, but suffered repeated machinery breakdowns, thereafter serving as a tender for the Marinestation der Nordsee (North Sea Naval Station) in the early 1880s. Later in the decade, she was used for fisheries protection before being decommissioned in 1888, struck from the naval register in 1890, and sold for scrap in 1892. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Falke class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2 √ó breechloading guns   2 √ó paddle wheels, 1 √ó marine steam engine,  1865  4 October 1870  Broken up, 1892 } Pommerania Pommerania in 1887 Pommerania was built for the Prussian postal service as a packet steamer, though the exact nature of her design and construction is uncertain. The navy's chief designer prepared the plans for the ship and the navy subsidized construction costs, which led the naval historians Hans Hildebrand, Albert R√∂hr, and Hans-Otto Steinmetz to suggest that the navy wanted to have a steamship it could requisition when needed but would not have to maintain. The navy brought the ship into commission during the Franco- Prussian War but crew shortages delayed conversion until after the war. She was used for fishing surveys in 1871 and 1872, with this work providing the scientific basis for the German Fisheries Act passed in 1874. She went to the Mediterranean with the ironclad training squadron in 1876 in response to the murder of a German diplomat in Salonika. She remained in the region after the outbreak of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì1878, staying in Constantinople with Loreley. After returning to Germany, she served as a tender to the Marinestation der Nordsee from 1881 to 1884, thereafter seeing service as a fisheries protection vessel and survey ship. Decommissioned in 1889 and struck in 1890, she was sold to a shipping company, converted into a sailing schooner, and renamed Adler. She was lost in a storm on her maiden voyage on 20 January 1894. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Pommerania class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2 √ó hoop guns   2 √ó paddle wheels, 1 √ó marine steam engine,  1864  27 April 1871  Converted to merchant ship, sank in a storm, 20 January 1894 } Zieten Zieten Beginning in 1869, the North German Federal Navy, under the direction of Albrecht von Stosch, began to consider the new self-propelled Whitehead torpedoes; Stosch authorized construction of a new aviso to test the weapons in 1873. Laid down at the Thames Iron Works, Zieten was the last major warship of the Imperial German fleet to be built overseas. Zieten proved to be highly influential, as experiments with the new torpedoes not only led to further construction of torpedo-armed warships, but also inspired similar vessels in the French, Italian, and Austro-Hungarian fleets. The Austro-Hungarian chief of construction, Josef von Romako, based his design of the s directly on that of Zieten. Future admiral Otto von Diederichs served aboard the ship during her first year in service, which involved tests of the bow torpedo tubes that demonstrated that the bow tube, located in the hull below the waterline, was not satisfactory; Diederichs arranged for the tube to be moved to a swivel mount on the deck. Another future admiral, Alfred von Tirpitz, took command of the vessel in 1878; during training exercises in 1880, Tirpitz arranged a demonstration of the vessel's effectiveness by sinking the old paddle steamer . Zieten went to the Mediterranean during the 'Urabi revolt in 1882 along with several other vessels. She saw limited service in the 1890s, including as a fisheries vessel until the start of World War I in 1914, after which she was used as a guard ship. She was ultimately sold for scrap in 1921. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align: center;\\" + Summary of the Zieten class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2 √ó torpedo tubes   2 √ó screw propellers, 2 √ó marine steam engines,  1875  1 August 1876  Broken up, 1921 } Blitz class Pfeil in 1899 The Blitz-class ships were the first modern avisos built for the German fleet; they were the first German vessels of any type with steel hulls, and they abandoned traditional sailing rigs. They provided the basis for future developments that ultimately produced the light cruisers of the . The ships were initially armed with a gun and a torpedo tube, though their armament was improved in the early 1890s, including the addition of two more torpedo tubes. The ships had extensive careers, remaining in active service for more than thirty years. Blitz spent much of her career as a flotilla leader for torpedo boats, while Pfeil served with the training squadron and the main fleet. Pfeil was deployed to German East Africa in 1889 to suppress the Abushiri revolt, returning to Germany in 1890. Throughout the 1890s, the ships served with the fleet, conducting a yearly routine of exercises and training cruises. They served in a variety of additional roles during the 1890s and 1900s, including as tenders, fishery protection vessels, and training ships. They operated as dedicated tenders to the battle squadrons of the High Seas Fleet by the mid-1900s, filling that role through the start of World War I. Blitz took part in Operation Albion in the Baltic Sea in late 1917 and Pfeil was later used as a training ship for U-boat crews. Both ships were discarded in the early 1920s. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Blitz class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   rowspan=\\"2\\"  1 √ó K L/23 gun 1 √ó torpedo tube  rowspan=\\"2\\"   rowspan=\\"2\\"  2 √ó screw propellers, 2 √ó marine steam engines,  1881  28 March 1883  Broken up, 1921 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   1881  25 November 1884  Broken up, 1922 } Greif Greif Greif was designed at a time where torpedoes had become effective weapons and spurred the development of the Jeune √âcole concept, which held that cheap torpedo boats could destroy large, expensive battleships. She was intended to guard the capital ships of the fleet against torpedo boat attacks, and for this role, she carried a battery of and guns. Unlike other German avisos of the period, she carried no torpedo tubes. Greif was not a successful warship, however, and she spent much of her career laid up, out of service. Completed in 1887, Greif was not commissioned until 1889. She remained in service with the fleet only until October 1890, when she was tasked with torpedo testing, a role she filled until 1894 when she was decommissioned. Recommissioned in May 1897, she served as a fleet scout for the next two years, thereafter being reduced to secondary roles once again, including as a training ship, before being decommissioned for the last time in September 1900. Greif was struck from the naval register in 1912, hulked in 1915 during World War I, and used as a mine storage hulk in 1917. After the war, she was sold to ship breakers in 1921 and dismantled in Hamburg. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Greif class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2 √ó L/35 guns   2 √ó screws, 2 √ó marine steam engines,  1885  9 July 1887  Broken up, 1921 } Wacht class Wacht in 1899 Following the appointment of General Leo von Caprivi as the German admiralty chief in 1883, the navy began to experiment more seriously with torpedo boats. Caprivi embraced some of the ideas of the Jeune √âcole doctrine, mostly importantly the theory that cheap torpedo boats could be used for coastal defense instead of larger, more expensive ironclads. This strategy found favor in the Reichstag (Imperial Diet), which generally opposed expanding the naval budget. Caprivi ordered the next pair of avisos‚Äîthe Wacht class‚Äîwith characteristics that would allow them to operate offensively with the torpedo boat flotillas. Their high speed came at the expense of gun armament and size (and thus seakeeping), discarding the more balanced Blitz design. As a result, the Wachts were disappointments in service. The two ships spent most of their careers with the main fleet. Wacht went on a major cruise to the Mediterranean Sea in 1889. Jagd was the first ship to pass through the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal in 1895 before the canal officially opened. Badly worn out by mid-1901, Jagd was decommissioned in August. The following month, Wacht was accidentally rammed and sunk by the ironclad , though her entire crew was safely evacuated. Jagd was struck from the register in 1910 and used as a torpedo training platform until 1920, when she was sold for scrap. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Wacht class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   rowspan=\\"2\\"  3 √ó 10.5 cm L/35 guns 3 √ó 35 cm torpedo tubes  rowspan=\\"2\\"   rowspan=\\"2\\"  2 √ó screws, 2 √ó marine steam engines,  1886  9 August 1888  Sunk in collision, 1901 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   1887  25 June 1889  Broken up, 1920 } Meteor class Meteor at anchor Unlike earlier avisos built for the fleet, which were designed to fill a variety of roles, the Meteor class was intended to protect the fleet's capital ships from torpedo boat attacks. They were armed with a battery of four quick-firing guns. Both vessels suffered from serious problems that rendered them unfit for service, namely poor seakeeping and excessive vibration of their propeller shafts. As a result, they saw little service, with Comets only periods in commission being to test what were unsuccessful attempts to correct the problems. Meteor had a somewhat more active career, serving with the fleet in 1893‚Äì1894 and then as a fishery protection ship in 1895‚Äì1896, but she, too, spent most of her existence laid up. Both vessels were decommissioned in 1896 and struck from the naval register in 1911. Meteor was then used as a barracks ship, while Comet became a storage hulk; the two ships were broken up in 1919 and 1921, respectively. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Meteor class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   rowspan=\\"2\\"  4 √ó 8.8 cm guns 3 √ó 35 cm torpedo tubes   rowspan=\\"2\\"  2 √ó screws, 2 √ó marine steam engines,  1888  19 May 1891  Broken up, 1919 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"    1890  29 April 1893  Broken up, 1920 } Hela 1902 lithograph of Hela Helas design was intended to correct many of the deficiencies in the Wacht and Meteor classes, mainly through an increase in size that would produce improved seaworthiness. She was also a knot faster, which increased her usefulness as a fleet scout. She nevertheless proved to be too weakly armed for fleet service, and the next cruising-type vessels to be built in Germany were the Gazelle-class light cruisers; they were the first vessels of that type to be built, and they incorporated the best aspects of Hela and the unprotected cruisers that had been built in the 1880s and 1890s. The ship served with the fleet from 1898 to 1902, and during this period, from mid-1900 to mid-1901, she was deployed as part of an expeditionary force sent to help suppress the Boxer Rebellion in Qing China. The naval command decided her armament was insufficient for front-line use, so she was extensively modernized between 1903 and 1910, thereafter serving as a tender until the outbreak of World War I. She was then assigned to support the patrols in the German Bight. She was present at the Battle of Helgoland Bight in August 1914 but was not directly engaged. The following month, she was torpedoed and sunk by the British submarine while steaming off Helgoland, though only two men were lost in the sinking. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align: center;\\" + Summary of the Hela class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   4 √ó 8.8 cm guns 3 √ó torpedo tubes   2 √ó screws, 2 √ó triple-expansion steam engines,  1893  3 May 1896  Sunk, 13 September 1914 } Grille Grille in the 1930s Grille, the last aviso built in Germany, was ordered as a state yacht for dictator Adolf Hitler and other elements of the Nazi regime. She was fitted with experimental high-pressure steam turbines to evaluate them for future warships. The ship was used in a variety of roles during her career with the Kriegsmarine (War Navy); in the late 1930s, in addition to her duties as a yacht, she was employed as a training ship and a target for torpedo training. After the start of World War II, she was used as an auxiliary minelayer, and was briefly assigned to participate in Operation Sea Lion in that capacity before it was cancelled in September 1940. She was also used to lay minefields during the German invasion of the Soviet Union‚ÄîOperation Barbarossa‚Äîin mid-1941. She was then used as a training ship until March 1942, when she was reduced to a headquarters ship for naval forces in Norway. She filled that role until the end of the war in May 1945, when she was seized by British forces. Grille was then sold to a Lebanese businessman, and, after arriving in Beirut, was attacked by Jewish commandos in 1947 because they incorrectly suspected that it would be used against Jewish forces during the ongoing civil war in Palestine. Grille was ultimately sold to ship-breakers in the United States and dismantled in 1951. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Grille class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   3 √ó SK C/34 guns   2 √ó screws, 2 √ó geared turbines,  June 1934  19 May 1935  Broken up, 1951 } Notes References      Category:Avisos of the Imperial German Navy Avisos ","title":"List of avisos of Germany"},{"id":"61825067","text":"Abraham \\"Abe\\" Michael Orpen (February 9, 1854 ‚Äì September 22, 1937) was a Canadian businessman, best known for his ownership of several horse-racing tracks in Ontario, Canada. Born in Toronto, Orpen first worked as a carpenter, became a hotel keeper, owned several construction-related businesses, then branched into horse-racing. He owned the Dufferin Park Racetrack, Hillcrest Racetrack and Long Branch Racetrack, and was a partner in the Kenilworth Park Racetrack at Windsor, Ontario, and the Thorncliffe Park Raceway in Leaside, Ontario. Orpen was well known as a facilitator of gambling, first at his hotel, and eventually at a casino in Mimico, Ontario. After his death, his family continued the horse-racing businesses until the 1950s, when they sold their tracks during a time of consolidation of racetracks in Ontario. Early life Orpen was born in Toronto in 1854, at the family home at Oxford Street and Spadina Avenue. He was one of six children. His parents both came from northern Ireland; his father Samuel Orpen was a railway paymaster from Kilmairn, Killowen, and his mother Sarah was from McGuire's Bridge, Enniskillen. After his father died in 1863, his mother operated a hotel at Queen's Wharf at Bathurst and Front Streets. After finishing public school, Abraham would work as a carpenter. Disliking carpentry, Orpen quit and worked as a dishwasher in the hotel. Orpen was a cousin of painter William Orpen. Career After marrying Isabella Wrigley of Newmarket in 1874, Orpen bought the Alhambra Hotel, located on the south-west corner of Church Street and King Street East. It had three bedrooms and a bar. It became a den for poker, dice and bookmaking. According to Orpen, keeping a book and writing a sheet for Toronto bookies \\"was not legal, and not quite illegal\\" at the time. Orpen tried several businesses, including the Simpson Brick Company, a lumber company and mining properties. Although all of his non-gambling businesses failed, he was able to build his home in 1900 at Sherbourne and Carlton Streets using bricks from his brick company. Orpen's first venture into horse- racing was the purchase of several horses. It went badly; three out of four horses died after falls. He got out of owning horses but did not get out of the gambling business. In 1907, he and Thomas Hare launched Dufferin Park Racetrack on land leased for 20 years. The Orpen-Hare partnership was built out of necessity. Orpen was ill when the venture launched and Hare became the operator, the two splitting the profits. The two were dead set against paper contracts and worked without one until 1929 when another Orpen illness necessitated a statement of their business association. The two detested the idea of using separate lawyers and compromised by using two from the same law firm. When the original Dufferin Park charter was revoked, Orpen went directly to Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier, who personally authorized a new charter immediately. The second race track that Orpen invested in was Hillcrest in Toronto, at Bathurst and Davenport. Opened in 1912, it operated only until 1916. During World War I, race tracks were closed and Orpen was forced to sell the property. The site is now the largest vehicle yard of the Toronto Transit Commission. \\"The Race of the Age\\" In 1916, Orpen, along with partners Thomas Hare, Charles Millar and H. D. Brown opened the Kenilworth Park Racetrack in Windsor, Ontario. In 1920, Orpen out-bid several racetracks to land a match race between Man o' War and Triple Crown winner Sir Barton at the track. The event was so highly anticipated that it became the first horserace to be filmed in its entirety, with the resulting footage later shown in movie theatres across the country. The race was originally intended to be a face-off between the three great horses of the time: Man o' War, Sir Barton and Exterminator. However, the owners of Sir Barton and Man o' War agreed to a distance of miles, which was too short for Exterminator to run his best, and agreed to a weight-for-age format, under which the older Exterminator would concede weight to Man o' War. Therefore, Exterminator was not entered, and in fact, raced that same day on a different track. Orpen put up a $75,000 purse and a $5,000 gold cup, designed by Tiffany & Co. of New York. (The gold cup, now known as the Man o' War Cup, continues to be used, presented to the winner of the Travers Stakes at Saratoga Race Course since 1936.) The crowd at the track for the race was estimated at more than 30,000 and it bet $220,00 on the race. The track held its last meet in 1935. The grandstand was demolished in 1939 and the site was developed as a housing subdivision. In the 1920s, Orpen established the National Sporting Club gambling casino in Mimico, just outside the Toronto city limits on Lakeshore Road west of the Humber River. According to Orpen, the police always tipped him off when a raid was occurring. \\"Club members had keys; the police were the only ones that rang the doorbell.\\" In 1924, Orpen bought land in Etobicoke Township west of Toronto and opened the Long Branch Racetrack. Although its opening caused a dispute with the Government of Ontario, Orpen and Hare owned the track until Orpen's death in 1937 and Hare's death in 1938. Orpen's sons operated the track until it was sold along with Dufferin Park in the 1950s. In 1935, Orpen, his son Fred and Hare arranged to hold races in London, Ontario, leasing the track at the Queen's Park fairgrounds. In 1937, Orpen arrived at the National Sporting Club early one Monday morning. When he arrived, he was held hostage by three men who had broken in but could not crack the safe. Orpen could not open the safe, not knowing the combination. The robbers then demanded $5000. Orpen negotiated with them, promising them $1000 and that he would not reveal their identities. They went to his bank and Orpen withdrew the money. Orpen never revealed their identities. He is reputed to have told them to get another job and return to his club, where he could potentially recover his losses. Character Orpen was well known for his many small acts of philanthropy and charity. He financed the operation of a soup kitchen for two years, although he shut it down after people complained that the soup was not good enough. Orpen opened his office on Fridays to whoever needed help. On one such occasion, when Canadian boxer Sammy Luftspring could not afford to go to the 1935 Canadian Boxing Championship, Orpen gave him $50. On several occasions, Orpen refunded a gambler's losses when it became known that the gambler had gambled their rent or food money away. Orpen never recommended that people gamble; only that he would take their bets if they wished to bet. In 1890, sports writer William Hewitt bet with Orpen at amounts he could not afford. Told that Hewitt made $9 a week, Orpen offered to let Hemitt bet privately with him for one month, betting on any horse in North America at 2‚Äì1 odds, one bet a day. After one month, Hewitt owed $18, or half his salary, which Orpen offered to forgive. Hewitt paid the debt and learned his lesson, \\"It was a cheap lesson and saved me thousands,\\" wrote Hewitt. Although Orpen was involved in gambling when it was illegal, his gambling club and racetracks did not open on Sundays when opening on Sundays in Toronto was illegal. Orpen was also known for his lack of racial discrimination. Blacks and whites worked side by side at the Orpen tracks. Facilities were the same for both. On his 80th birthday, Orpen received congratulations from the Mayor of Toronto, the Premier of Ontario and the Prime Minister of Canada. Orpen was quoted as saying \\"I will start to think I am a respectable citizen if this keeps up.\\" Death On July 31, 1937, Orpen had a heart seizure while in the Metropolitan Racing Association (MRA) offices at King and Bay Streets. On September 22, 1937, Orpen died in the family home at the corner of Carlton Street and Sherbourne Street after a lingering illness. At the time of his death, Orpen and his wife Isabella had been married for 63 years. Orpen's funeral service was held at the Cathedral Church of St. James and he was interred in St. James Cemetery. When the MRA vacated its offices at King and Bay in December 1938, they kept the hat rack and hats that Abe had left the day he had the heart attack and placed it in their new office in the Crown Life building. Fred kept it in the office until the MRA was sold. Abraham and Isabella were the parents of nine children. At the time of Orpen's death, his wife, two sons, Abraham Jr and Fred, and a daughter, Mrs T. Ambrose Woods, survived him. The two sons took over the racing businesses and operated them until they were sold in 1955 to the Ontario Jockey Club. The Orpen home at 380 Sherbourne Street is a designated heritage property. It has been converted into an apartment building. Legacy Two stakes races that originated at the Orpen tracks continue to be run. The Canadian International Stakes and the Cup and Saucer Stakes, originally the Mrs. Orpen's Cup and Saucer Stakes. In 1954, the Orpen Memorial wading pool in Dufferin Grove Park was opened, donated by his son Fred Orpen. In 1980, Orpen was inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame.

Career  While he was at university Bogolyubov decided to go to the people\\", and spent several months trying to radicalise peasants around Taganrog, and Rostov-on-Don, in south Russia. On 6 December 1876, he was arrested during a student demonstration in Kazan Square, St-Petersburg. According to contemporary accounts, he was not one of the organisers of the demonstration, did not take any part, but arrived after the meeting had been forcibly dispersed by the police. The experienced revolutionaries had collectively decided that they should not expose themselves to arrest by demonstrating, and according to what Bogolyubov later told a fellow prisoner, \\"to avoid temptation, at the time of the demonstration I had gone to take part in other activities, namely to practise firearms.\\" But the police believed he was one of the students involved in a fight that broke out after the demonstration, and he was sentenced to fifteen years hard labour.  In Prison  In July 1877, Bogolyubov was being held in the Preventative Detention Centre in St Petersburg, along with dozens of political prisoners who would appear as defendants in the Trial of the 193, and was exercising in a prison yard during a visit by Fyodor Trepov, the governor general of St Petersburg. Trepov was enraged when Bogolyubov failed to take off his cap, and knocked it off his head, setting off a loud and violent protest by prisoners watching from their cells. Trepov ordered that Bogolyubov was to be flogged. The flogging was carried three hours later. This was the first flogging in the 20th century to be inflicted on a member of the Russian intelligentsia, and was so violent that it drove him insane. According to a contemporary account, he was kept in prison, under the same conditions as other prisoners, although: In retaliation, Bogolyubov's old comrades in south Russia organised a squad of six men to assassinate Trepov. They were beaten to it by Vera Zasulich, who shot and wounded him in his office on 24 January 1878. This act was the start of the wave of political violence that culminated in the assassination of the Tsar Alexander II. Bogolyubov was transferred to Kharkov central prison, then at the end of 1880, to a psychiatric hospital in Kazan. It is not known when he died, but it was \\"a few years\\" after being flogged.

It was founded in 1880 by Charles Drouant. The restaurant has been receiving the jury of the Prix Goncourt every year since 1914, as well as the jury of the Prix Renaudot since 1926. Drouant's cuisine is led by chef √âmile Cotte.  History  Drouant in 1956 The establishment was founded as a bar and tobacco shop by Charles Drouant in 1880. At the turn of the century, it gained popularity thanks to its fresh oysters delivered by Drouant's brother-in-law, who farmed them in Brittany. The restaurant was taken over by Charles Drouant's son Jean Drouant in 1914, then by Jean's nephew ‚Äìalso named Jean‚Äì from 1946 to 1976. The latter sold the restaurant to Robert Pascal, a bougnat from Aveyron who had been working at Drouant for forty years. The establishment changed hands several times between 1986 and 2006. Thanks to chef Louis Gondard, the restaurant was awarded 1 star by the Michelin Guide in 1988, then 2 stars in 2005. In 2006, the 3-star Alsatian chef Antoine Westermann, a parent of the Drouant family, became the chef and owner of the restaurant. The establishment was officially renamed Drouant par Antoine Westermann.. In 2018, the restaurant was bought by the Gardinier brothers from the Gardinier & Fils company.  Cuisine  Since 2018, √âmile Cotte has been the chef of Drouant. He offers French dishes made of seasonal products.

It is worn in the center of a knot of hair. The headdress derives its name from chuda (Hindi:‡§ö‡•Ç‡§°‡§º‡§æ) meaning 'bundle of hair', and mani (Hindi:‡§Æ‡§£‡§ø) meaning 'jewel'. Chudamani may also refer to ivory bangles worn by brides during wedding ceremonies in Gujarat. When a Chudamani is studded with rubies, it is known as an Aruna Chudamani. Legend In Hindu mythology, the goddess Ratnakar Nandini was born during Samudra Manthan. Upon seeing God Vishnu, Ratnakar Nandini devoted herself to him. When she met Vishnu, he gave her a jewel-studded ornament named Chudamani. Mahalakshmi in her heart wedded to Vishnu and Ratnakar Nandini was left wandering. Understanding her feeling Vishnu advised her to go to Trikut Mountain and meditate there during Dvapara Yuga and Treta Yuga, blessing and fulfilling devotees wishes and in Kali Yuga, in the incarnation of Kalki, Vishnu will marry her. While setting out for penance Ratnakar Nandini gave Chudamani as a souvenir to Vishnu. On watching this, Indra was tempted to get the Chudamani. Vishnu gave it to him, who in turn placed it in the hair of Indrani (Indra's wife). When the native of Indra, Swarga (Heaven) was attacked by a Demon named Shambarasur, Indra sought help from Dashratha. Dasharatha along with Kaikeyi came to the rescue of Indra and defeated Shambarasur. As a token of appreciation, Indra gifted wings of four swans belonging to Mandakini. Indrani gifted her Chudamani to Kaikeyi and gave the boon that the lady wearing this will remain Akhand Saubhagyawati (she will die with married bliss) and the kingdom she lives in will remain unconquered.  Raghavan Chudamani  Raghavan Chudamani was an Indian writer writing in Tamil. She also wrote short stories in English as Chudamani Raghavan. Her name also appears as Choodamani. She was born in Chennai and grew up there. Because of a physical disability, she was schooled at home. She published her first story \\"Kaveri\\" in 1957. Kaikeyi gifted it to Sumitra who in turn gave it to Seeta, Shree Ramachandra's wife. Seeta gave it to Mahaveer Hanuman as a signage when he returned from Lanka to Shree Ramachandra after finding Sita. History The Chudamani has been worn since the Satavahana dynasty. Sculptures of Amaravati and Nagarjunakonda can be seen wearing Chudamani. Gujarat In Gujarat, ivory bangles are known as Chuda or Chudamani.

It was discovered in a Citrus aurantium peel in 1932 by E. Aline Fenner, who proposed a new genus Mycotypha to accommodate it. Mycotypha africana, which is another species in the genus Mycotypha, is closely related to M. microspora. The fungus has subsequently been isolated from both outdoor and indoor settings around the world, and is typically found in soil and dung. The species rarely causes infections in humans, but has recently been involved in the clinical manifestation of the life-threatening disease mucormycosis. Morphology and growth conditions Mycotypha microspora is a filamentous fungus whose genus name is derived from the cattail-like appearance of its fructifications and tiny spores. It has a dense granular protoplasm and is composed of several hyphae and vacuoles. The structure is highly branched, with mycelium of varying diameters. It consists of two kinds of unispored sporangia: an inner layer containing globose spores and an outer layer with obovoid or cylindrical spores. During the growth period, the fruiting body is coenocytic. After the fungus gradually matures, septation occurs at approximately the same time as sporulation. Mycotypha microspora colonies grow rapidly and abundantly on nutrient-rich media, such as carrot agar and potato dextrose. However, no growth occurs on low pH media. M. microspora is mesophilic, with optimal growth of cultures occurring at a temperature of , with a threshold of under which growth is inhibited. The fructifications typically form at night and thus respond unfavourably to light. Geographical distribution and habitat Other species present in the genus Mycotypha include M. africana, and M. indica. These species are distributed worldwide and have been geographically collected from countries including Japan, India, Finland, Zimbabwe, and certain states in the U.S. such as Arizona, Washington D.C., Kansas, California, and Iowa. These fungi are predominantly found in soil and faeces. M. microspora was initially extracted from a Citrus aurantium peel in the Netherlands, where it was found to be pathogenic. Additionally, it has reportedly been found in decaying wood and a hospital washroom in Germany. One specific case noted its presence in stool samples from a child with leukaemia. Mycotypha microspora is an intestinal symbiont of the silverfish species Thermobia domestica. Deposited with the feces of the silverfish, the fungus was found to be responsible for arrestment and aggregation behaviour in Thermobia domestica and in the related silverfish Ctenolepisma longicaudata, but not in Lepisma saccharina. Thermobia domestica does not seem to sense the presence of M. microspora itself, but rather the fungus‚Äò metabolites (such as glucose) of its enzymatic digestion of cellulose. Pathogenicity  Only a few reported cases exist where the species has been found to cause an infection in humans. M. microspora has recently been implicated as a causative factor in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal mucormycosis in humans, which is a rare disease caused by fungi of the order Mucorales. Mucormycosis is a potentially fatal disease characterised by tissue necrosis that results from aggressive infiltration of blood vessels and subsequent formation of blood clots. The disease develops due to the binding of spore coating (CotH) proteins from the fungus to glucose regulator protein 78 (GRP78) host receptors in endothelial cells. Tissue necrosis blocks the entry of antifungals to infected sites, therefore preventing clearance and promoting circulation of the disease. Mucormycosis is highly susceptible in immunocompromised patients, and can mainly infect the body at pulmonary, rhinocerebral, cutaneous, and gastrointestinal sites. Factors that put an individual at risk for manifestation of the disease include corticosteroid use, diabetes, and ongoing neutropenia. Treatment Given that the disease is rare, there is a lack of experimental findings assessing the efficacy of specific treatment regimens for mucormycosis. The most reliable antifungal agent against mucormycosis is amphotericin, however the use of this in combination with voriconazole led to acute kidney injury upon admission of a 41-year-old man who was dually infected by Aspergillus fumigatus and M. microspora. In order to prevent permanent kidney damage, therapy was switched to administering the broad spectrum antifungal isavuconazole for 15 days, however this also led to complications in the patient. Ultimately, his gastrointestinal Mycotypha infection was treated with a combination of posaconazole and micafungin, which proved to be more effective than monotherapy, and he was eventually cured of the disease by surgically removing a part of his stomach in order to manage the gastrointestinal bleeding. This rare case provides some insight into potential treatment protocols for M. microspora and A. fumigatus infections in humans, however, further research that focuses on infections caused solely by M. microspora is essential in formulating a specific treatment regimen against this species. CotH proteins are found in fungi of the order Mucorales, and blocking their function weakens their ability to invade endothelial cells, and reduces mucormycosis presentation in mice.

Its perception is based on consonance, a concept whose definition has changed various times throughout Western music. In a physiological approach, consonance is a continuous variable. Consonant pitch relationships are described as sounding more pleasant, euphonious, and beautiful than dissonant relationships which sound unpleasant, discordant, or rough. The harmonicity of chords is encoded by the brain in a number of areas, including the inferior colliculus and the cortex.  Features contributing to perception  A number of features contribute to the perception of a chord's harmony. = Tonal fusion = Tonal fusion contributes to the perceived consonance of a chord, describing the degree to which multiple pitches are heard as a single, unitary tone. Chords which have more coinciding partials (frequency components) are perceived as more consonant, such as the octave and perfect fifth. The spectra of these intervals resemble that of a uniform tone. According to this definition, a major triad fuses better than a minor triad and a major-minor seventh chord fuses better than a major-major seventh or minor-minor seventh. These differences may not be readily apparent in tempered contexts but can explain why major triads are generally more prevalent than minor triads and major-minor sevenths are generally more prevalent than other sevenths (in spite of the dissonance of the tritone interval) in mainstream tonal music. = Roughness = When adjacent harmonics in complex tones interfere with one another, they create the perception of what is known as \\"beating\\" or \\"roughness\\". These precepts are closely related to the perceived dissonance of chords. To interfere, partials must lie within a critical bandwidth, which is a measure of the ear's ability to separate different frequencies. Critical bandwidth lies between 2 and 3 semitones at high frequencies and becomes larger at lower frequencies. The roughest interval in the chromatic scale is the minor second and its inversion, the major seventh. For typical spectral envelopes in the central range, the second roughest interval is the major second and minor seventh, followed by the tritone, the minor third (major sixth), the major third (minor sixth) and the perfect fourth (fifth). = Familiarity = Familiarity also contributes to the perceived harmony of an interval. Chords that have often been heard in musical contexts tend to sound more consonant. This principle explains the gradual historical increase in harmonic complexity of Western music. For example, around 1600 unprepared seventh chords gradually became familiar and were therefore gradually perceived as more consonant. Individual characteristics such as age and musical experience also have an effect on harmony perception.  Neural correlates of harmony  The inferior colliculus is a mid-brain structure which is the first site of binaural auditory integration, processing auditory information from the left and right ears. Frequency following responses (FFRs) recorded from the mid-brain exhibit peaks in activity which correspond to the frequency components of a tonal stimulus. The extent to which FFRs accurately represent the harmonic information of a chord is called neural salience, and this value is correlated with behavioral ratings of the perceived pleasantness of chords. In response to harmonic intervals, cortical activity also distinguishes chords by their consonance, responding more robustly to chords with greater consonance.

Daniel Barnes, Ph.D., a sociocultural anthropologist. It is part of the Families in Focus series from Rutgers University Press and was first published in December 2015. The book was considered for an NAACP award in 2015 and received an American Sociological Association Distinguished Book Award in 2017.  Development  Barnes developed this book project when she met multiple Black middle-class moms at a story-time session in Atlanta, Georgia. It was the middle of the day and she wondered why so many of these moms were able to care for their young ones during the workday.  Synopsis  In the book Barnes examines \\"how black, married career women juggle their relationships with their extended and nuclear families, the expectations of the black community, and their desires to raise healthy, independent children\\". While investigating she discovered that the women based their decisions on more than their own situation, as they took into account the past struggles black women had to go through and how their actions could impact the wider black community. Key ideas developed and explored are \\"Black Strategic Mothering,\\" a term developed by Barnes to provide a conceptual framework for understanding the history of Black women's work, family, and community decision-making strategies. Barnes also explores what she calls, the \\"neo-politics of respectability\\" a framework developed from that of Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham's \\"politics of respectability\\" developed in her book Righteous Discontent to describe the tactics used by turn of the 20th century Black women who were leaders in the Black Women's Club Movement.  Critical reception  Critical reception for Raising the Race has been positive. In a review for the Journal of African American History Diana Slaughter Kotzin praised the book's accessibility to both \\"scholars and laypersons desirous of either introductory or updated information about the lifestyles of educated and wealthy African American women,\\" and noted that \\"[t]he rich comparisons and contrasts with extant literature on similar topics focused on African American women make this book a very useful bibliographic reference.\\" Winnifred Brown-Glaude, a sociologist at the College of New Jersey, reviewed Raising the Race for the Journal of Anthropological Research. She explained that \\"the strength of the book lies in its ethnographic approach, which illuminates the complexity of black professional women‚Äôs experiences as they decide how to navigate work and families. . . Students and scholars interested in ‚Äúwomen and work,‚Äù ‚Äúintersectionality,‚Äù and ‚Äúblack women‚Äôs labor‚Äù will find this work useful and accessible for an undergraduate course. Krista Lynn Minnotte states, in the Journal of Family Theory and Review, that Raising The Race \\"should serve as a call to action, encouraging us to broaden our conversations about work and family to ensure that they reflect the diverse experiences of people across race, class, and gender.\\" In Sociology of Race and Ethnicity, cultural anthropologist Anthony Kwame Harrison described Raising the Raise as a \\"first- of-its-kind interrogation of important issues\\" that \\"significantly advances our understandings of these complex social dynamics.\\" = Awards = Raising The Race received the 2017 Distinguished Book Award for the Race, Gender, and Class section of the American Sociological Association and was also considered for an NAACP Image Award when it first came out in December 2015.

It was designed to better reflect the stresses of a combat environment, to address the poor physical fitness of recruits, and to reduce the risk of musculoskeletal injuries for service members. It consists of six events and is graded on a scale with a maximum score of 600. The test is scheduled to take full effect as the US Army's fitness test of record as of October 2020. Development The ACFT was developed to more closely measure \\"combat-readiness\\", after it was found that more battlefield evacuations were performed during the Iraq War and the War in Afghanistan due to musculoskeletal injuries, than were due to the ongoing fighting. Such injures may also be a significant contributing factor in the attrition rate for current service members. It was also designed to address the \\"declining health and fitness standards of incoming recruits\\". Studies leading up to the release of the new standard indicated an \\"increase of overweight recruits who can't pass entry-level physical fitness tests\\" as well as an increase in injuries resulting from the poor physical condition of new soldiers. The ACFT began development in 2013, and was based on a set of 113 essential \\"warrior tasks and drills\\" laid out in army doctrine, as well as feedback from those who had completed tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. The test is currently undergoing testing and refinement, and scheduled to replace the United States Army Physical Fitness Test as of October 2020. In 2019 the new test was fielded with 63 Reserve and National Guard units. It is the first change in the US Army physical fitness test in four decades. Description US Army instructional video for the ACFT The ACFT is intended to more closely mimic physical tasks and stresses associated with combat. It is designed to measure \\"power, speed, agility ... balance [and] muscular and aerobic endurance\\". The test consists of six events completed over the course of 50 minutes: # Three-rep deadlift of between and # A backward and overhead medicine ball throw # Hand-release push-ups over a period of two minutes # shuttle run referred to as the \\"sprint-drag-carry\\" # Hanging leg tucks over a period of two minutes # run It is graded in a scale with a maximum score of 600 points. In August 2019, a member of the 22nd Chemical Battalion became the first soldier to record a perfect score, beating out the previous record of 597, set in June by a member of the Kentucky Army National Guard. Unlike its predecessor, the ACFT does not adjust standards based on age or gender. Instead, soldiers are assigned to one of three tiers based on their military occupational specialty.

He killed at least two victims, and tried to hide his crimes by decapitating his victims. Because of Pr√©vost's profession as a policeman in his neighborhood where he committed his crimes, his military past in a renowned elite corps and what he did with the victims' bodies, his case caused a great impact on the contemporary public: \\"Since the Abadie trial,L'affaire Abadie dans le Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe si√®cle no criminal case had interested the public as much.\\"  Biography  = Youth and apprenticeship = Victor Joseph Pr√©vost was born in Mormant, Seine-et-Marne, France on December 11, 1836. His father, Pierre, was a coachman, and his mother, Barbe (n√©e Griette), was unemployed. He had two older brothers: Leon and Adolphe, four and two years older respectively. From birth, Pr√©vost was afflicted with bulimia, particularly inherited from his father, which remained with him for the rest of his life. At the age of 14, Pr√©vost's parents placed him as an apprentice at a trellis manufacturer on Rue Saint-Jacques in Paris. Although surrounded by young girls at an early age, young Pr√©vost was treated harshly, sleeping on a bed without a mattress and had to work as much as an adult. Pr√©vost's boss brutalized him and, to punish him for his bulimia, which he mistook for simple greed, reduced his daily food portions. Then, hungry, Victor stole a piece of bread, but was caught and punished by being struck with a whip reserved for the dog. That same evening, while Pr√©vost helped his employer to put up fences over a small yard, he made it swing through a frame whose piece of glass plowed his hands and face. From that moment, Pr√©vost had only one idea in mind: to escape his ordeal. Contemporary butcher's clothing Pr√©vost was naturally kind and considerate. While in the Jardin du Luxembourg, he saw a large boy steal a toy accordion from a smaller one, which he managed to get back and return to the child. Aware of his strength, Pr√©vost never hesitated to help push carriages that many had difficulties in moving up the steep slope of the Rue de la Montagne-Sainte-Genevi√®ve. One day, while running an errand for his boss, Pr√©vost saw the cart of a milkman hit a boy of his age carrying a rack full of meat. While the milkman ran away, Pr√©vost helped the young victim get up and, finding that the boy was no longer in shape to resume his service, he loaded the heavy piece of meat on his head effortlessly and then delivered it to its recipient, a butcher holding a shop on Rue Mouffetard. This incident gave him the idea of his Herculean strength while he was still a teenager. There are different versions of what happened next. According to Ernest Raynaud, Pr√©vost was suddenly taken with a passion for the bloody universe he discovered then: the clerks were cutting up the animals that had just been slaughtered and it was a debauchery of cut flesh and blood. Pr√©vost was fascinated and couldn't help himself but participate in the carnage: he took a knife and, although a novice, cut off a shred of veal. According to Gustave Mac√©, things happened in a simpler manner: the delivery brought by Pr√©vost to the butcher had came from consumption-stricken cows, which were prohibited from sale and would have landed Pr√©vost in trouble if he was caught by police. Whichever case might be, the butcher was delighted when young Pr√©vost asked him for a job. Soon after, his employer and the butcher had a meeting and agreed to exchange apprentices. The following day, Victor began his apprenticeship as a butcher. In the butcher shop, masters and clerks alike had huge appetites, regularly eating meat and bread, drinking wine and even liquors, which were also available at their discretion, which was perfect for Pr√©vost's ogre appetite. The task was tough, as the apprentices had to transfer heavy loads between Les Halles or private slaughterhouses and retailers, sometimes over long distances, but Victor did not lack the strength. He quickly learned how to butcher animals, and became an expert in skinning and deboning. He loved the smell of blood, and seemed to experience a real pleasure to handle meat. In the shop, he spoke Louch√©bem and behaved rather freely, with the cashier (a mistress of the boss) and one of the female servants quickly becoming attracted to the handsome apprentice. Violent jealousies soon followed, resulting in Victor's dismissal. Shortly after, he found work in a school on Rue Saint-Honor√©. As soon as he arrived, he again began to be swarmed by female attention, which earned him the nickname \\"The Handsome Man\\" among his colleagues. In fact, it is rather him who succumbed to the domestic workers' advances, that he did nothing to provoke. = Cuirassier and cent-garde = Cent-garde in full uniform Pr√©vost was enlisted as a conscript for a 6-year military service on April 11, 1855, replacing his older brother. Being of large stature and burly, he was incorporated into the 4th Cuirassiers regiment before moving on October 14, 1856 to the 2nd Cuirassier Regiment of the Imperial Guard and the 12th Cuirassier Regiment, with whom he participated in the Italian campaign, for which he received the commemorative medal. On December 31, 1861, he was released and given a certificate of good conduct. His returned to civilian life was short, as he signed a 7-year-old contract on October 14, 1862 and returned to the 2nd regiment. Because of his experience with the cuirassiers, his good service and height of 1,84 (at the time, the average size of men was about 1,65), he entered the very strict recruitment criteriaAt the time of his recruitment, in addition to irreproachable conduct and morality, it was necessary to be at least 1,80 meters tall, to have at least two years of seniority in the cuirassiers and commitment to remain for at least three years. of the prestigious cent-gardes Squadron that he joined on January 20, 1866, and was assigned the number 418. Consisting exclusively of large, experienced cavalry, the squadron of cent- gardes escorted the emperor Napoleon III on horseback in his public appearances, and assured his and his family's safety in the imperial palaces. Their large size and their brilliant uniforms gave them very high prestige, and one of their peculiarities was to remain in all circumstances impeccably fixed, like statues, which earned them the nickname \\"caryatids of power\\". Their immobility was legendary: the young Prince Imperial, still a child, mischievously emptied a box of dragees into the boot of a sentry on watch, whom did not flinch.,Louis Alphonse Hyrvoix theorized that same cent-garde was indeed Pr√©vost (). Their unusual build, imposing appearance, and their beautiful uniforms enamored women, and many of them succumbed to the charm of the handsome horsemen: The reputation of the cent-gardes in this area was of a joking manner: a humorous engraving at the time, published by the Le Bon March√©, was that of a cent-gardes officer, back at his quarters at the end to the Court, busy emptying his boots filled with love letters by admirers while he was standing still. It seemed that Pr√©vost was particularly noticed for his physique: \\"He represented the physical beauty and we could've molded the other hundred guards like him.\\"Louis Alphonse Hyrvoix, former police director at the imperial residences ().Allusion to the Parisian Shepherd in a passage from the op√©ra bouffe La belle H√©l√®ne. At the end of his service, Pr√©vost was released on April 14, 1869 with, for a second time, a certificate of good conduct. = Career and behavior in the police force = Paris Peacekeepers Uniforms between 1873 and 1894 From July 1, 1869, he was hired by the municipal police in Paris on the recommendation of one its leader, Sergeant de Ville, and tenured a year later on June 30, 1870. But the body was soon dissolved on September 10, the day after the fall of the Second Empire. It was almost immediately recreated under another name, and Pr√©vost engaged, on November 8, 1870, as a peacekeeper. He was attached to the post at Rue de l'√âvangile, located in Quartier de La Chapelle of the 18th arrondissement of Paris. If his behavior was irreproachable during his stays in the army, it was not the same when Victor joined the municipal police. On September 18, 1871, Pr√©vost was reprimanded for negligence in his service. On September 11, 1876, he was blamed for abandoning the block he was supposed to watch, and on the 15th he was subjected to a deduction of salary for spending his time at a wine merchant. However, on April 16, 1876, he was commended for having mastered, at the peril of his life, a runaway horse which earned him a bonus. Pr√©vost was not easy to converse with: He was nonetheless very helpful, and loved children. Besides his working hours, he happened to escort home stray kids, offering them treats he purchased on the way. His appearance varied greatly according to his uniform: His success with the fair sex complicated the life of his boss: Because of this, Pr√©vost was exiled as a monitor in Gare du Nord, where there were only men.  Crimes and punishment  = Murder of Alexandre Lenoble = Pr√©vost dispersing of Lenoble's body parts On September 10, 1879, at about 8 o'clock in the evening, Madame Thi√©ry, a resident of the district which was deserted at this hour, saw at the corner of the Rue de La Chapelle and Rue du Pr√© maudit the tall figure of a man, dressed in a cattle driver's gown and a silk cap, leaning over the stream that passed there. Intrigued, she watched him from a distance and ended up seeing him walk away towards Ney Boulevard. Madame Thi√©ry cautiously approached the place he abandoned and discovered, half stuck in a manhole, a packet containing freshly cut meat. At that moment, a peacekeeper named Hardy came by and she asked him for help. They immediately decided to take the package to the police station, but took the advice of a butcher and a pharmacist, who recognized fragments from a skinned human arm. Research was immediately undertaken and 77 additional pieces were discovered, three of which were recovered from a ragpicker who was about to sell them for consumption. Other parts, including a hand and \\"the parts of a person who belongs to the male sex\\"were found in a ditch near the fortifications near the Poterne des Poisonniers. At the Paris morgue, where the pieces were transferred, efforts were made to reconstitute the body of the victim by reassembly, as to when they were discovered, that still remained a secret. In the end, only the head was missing, as well as a piece that could never be found because a poor man had probably \\"picked up it carefully, packaged it, like a piece of veal falling from the net of a housewife, cooked it in his hut and enjoyed it with the family.\\" The next morning, Madame Thi√©ry went to the police station to make a statement. When asked to describe the suspect, she said that she did not know him, but using the light from a street lamp, she found that he bore a resemblance to the well-known peacekeeper in the neighborhood, known under the soubriquet of \\"The Handsome Man\\". Madame Thi√©ry was also convinced that he had been her neighbor on Rue des Roses in 1877. Pr√©vost seemed like an unlikely suspect for Commissioner Lef√©bure, but he still summoned him in the presence of his accuser. Pr√©vost denied involvement, stating the following: The commissioner immediately responded: Embarrassed, Pr√©vost replied that he was at home due to indisposition. This was another lie, as the day before, at around 21 o'clock, wearing a blouse and carrying a bucket covered with a cloth, he met a colleague to whom he said he was tired because he had just helped a friend move. Overwhelmed, Pr√©vost went silent. When Lef√©bure asked him where is the head, Victor replied \\"at home, in a cauldron\\". The victim was a certain Lenoble, a jeweler. Accused, Pr√©vost confessed:His guilt being proven, Victor was first sent to the lock-up before being incarcerated in Mazas Prison to await trial. Alexandre Lenoble was a 38-year-old jewelry broker who had just recently established his own business. He left behind a widow and two children, aged 11 and 6, respectively. The butcher knife used by Pr√©vost to dismember the victim is kept at the Mus√©e de la pr√©fecture de police in Paris. = Murder of Ad√®le Blondin = Ad√®le Blondin Pr√©vost also had a mistress named Ad√®le Blondin.Sometimes mistakenly called \\"Marguerite Blondin\\" in the newspapers She had been at length the governess of a rich old man who, to thank her, had left her a sum of 30,000 francs. Blondin sometimes helped her financially poor sister but, being economical, she lived on a monthly income of 1,500 francs from its capital placed in state annuity. Ad√®le bought a business and began earning a few thousand francs worth of money. Being suspicious, she usually hid her values, money and main jewelry. On Sunday, February 27, 1876, she went to lunch at Pr√©vost's house, who at the time lived at 22 Rue de l'√âvangile, in front of the police station where he worked. Her landlady saw her leaving, adorned with her jewels and wrapped with a Scottish shawl. The connection was obvious. The objects, jewels and clothes of the disappeared, especially her Scottish shawl, were found at Pr√©vost's home. At first he had claimed that she had forgotten her umbrella, but took her shawl. When confronted with overwhelming evidence, he began denying the claims, saying that they were gifts from Blondin and that he was mistaken in stating that he had taken her shawl. When brought to his former home on Rue de l'√âvangile where Blondin had been seen for the last time, the discovery of blood droplets led Pr√©vost to confess his crime:In the afternoon, Pr√©vost guided the investigators to the place where he buried the head. Quickly, a laborer dug up the fragmented skull of the unfortunate victim. = Suspect in two other disappearances = In early October, following the discovery of Pr√©vost second murder, a rumor spread of a third possible crime. Pr√©vost is suspected of having previously murdered another peacekeeper, who disappeared without a trace four years before, an act which he categorically denied. To put an end to an inquiry with uncertain results that promised to be long, while the authorities wanted to finish quickly, he was made to write a written statement in which he expressed his repentance for his two confirmed crimes. Victor swore that if he was guilty of anything, he would confess without hesitation. Ball at the Tuileries in 1867 In his work concerning Pr√©vost, Gustave Mass√© talked about his discussions with Louis- Alphonse Hyrvoix, former chief of Napoleon III's cent-gardes who, as such, watched the guests at the balls, parties and receptions that took place at the Tuileries Palace. Despite the precautions, undesirables and women of \\"high gallantry\\" managed to slip in. At the Ball of Tuileries in 1867, Hyrvoix noticed a fair-skinned woman, dressed in a simple but tasteful manner, on the arm of an embassy attach√© to whom she asked many questions, while taking notes in a small notebook. Located by police officers who escorted her out of the ball, she was subjected to an interrogation, to which she bowed with good grace: it turned out that the young woman was a 35-year-old rich widow from a good family, who traveled all over Europe, sometimes in male costumes, who sorted all of her travels in a chronicle she addressed to a Parisian newspaper under the pseudyonym \\"Furet\\". She had persuaded her lover to giver her the means to enter the palace, which she had wanted to visit. As a result, the young embassy attach√© had to resign from his post. Supervised by the imperial police, it was established that the woman was free of many manners: she had had multiple adventures with handsome men, who to her were only tools for pleasure. Thus, it was discovered that she regularly invited Pr√©vost over in a private office, located in a restaurant on the avenue de Neuilly. A short time later, the lady disappeared without a trace and was never seen or heard from again. The evening of her disappearance, she had had supper with Victor Pr√©vost. At that time, nobody cared: the lady was an adventuress, as frivolous as she was unpredictable, who traveled a lot. As no complaint for her disappearance was filed for a while, the handsome cent-gardes, petticoat rider but with an irreproachable behavior, had no reason to be suspected. It was only at the time of his arrest and the revelation of his two killings that the few people still aware of the strange disappearance, then 12 years old, made the connection with a possible additional murder. But investigators, who weren't aware of the suspicious against Pr√©vost prior to his trial and that the possible crime, being impossible to prove, was prescribed to him anyway. A few minutes before his execution, when Pr√©vost was asked for the last time if he had anything else to say, he replied: \\"I confessed to the two crimes I committed. That's enough, unfortunately. I did not make other mistakes in my life...\\". =Gold or silver?= A gold pocketwatch Pr√©vost did not disdain the money the money taken from his victims, but at the same time, he did not seek wealth or even an easier lifestyle. The opinion of his colleagues and friend Dor√© was unambigious: \\"Pr√©vost had only one word to say: to swim in opulence. He was a lady's man. He frequented around very rich people who would have been happy to sacrifice their fortune to him, but if he accepted attendance at diners and parties, he rejected money and gifts. He would see himself as dishonored by accepting them. You should have seen the indignant air with which he exclaimed 'Do they take me for a barbel?'\\"In slang terms: a pimp, a mackerel At the moment when he murdered Lenoble for some gold jewelry, and him being a demimonde, who was very much in the mood for a castle in the provinces. He had nagged Pr√©vost about his modest home, while Alexandre had a splendid carriage and was covered in diamonds, whose value far exceeded that of Pr√©vost. On the other hand, Pr√©vost was fascinated by gold, with a particular interest for precious watches that his means did not allow him to possess. = Trial = Victor Pr√©vost's trial was held before the cour d'assises in Seine, chaired by Mr. Hardouin and two assessors, on December 7, 1879. At quarter past eleven, the accused entered, accompanied by eight guards. The defence was provided by Mr. Bouchot, while the Attorney General was Mr. Lefebvre de Biefville. While reading through the indictment, which included details and the way in which the two murders were committed, Pr√©vost stood upright and remained calm, but his discouragement could be felt. He then answered questions from the judge, who made him confirm the facts and clarify details. It was then when the witnesses were called, confirming the depositions made during the instruction. Then following the indictment, during which Pr√©vost seemed to accuse the police of a cover-up, and pleaded to his lawyer. After a summary of the debates by the judge, the jury met to deliberate and answer all the questions posed in just twenty minutes. The court then withdrew to establish their verdict before pronouncing, unsurprisingly, the death sentence against Victor Pr√©vost for crimes of premeditated murder. During the statement, he showed no emotion. = Execution = Execution of Victor Pr√©vost in front of La Roquette Prison. Contrary to what the engraving suggests, at the time of the execution it was still almost night: \\"But it is still so dark, that we see only one group in which nothing is distinguished.\\" The day after his trial, on December 9 in the afternoon, Pr√©vost was transferred to the La Roquette Grand Prison, a unique detention center in which death row inmates were executed since 1851. On December 13, he was visited by Father Crozes, the prison almoner and, from that moment, he showed an interest in pracitising religion. The next day he asked to attend mass and, on the following January 11th, he expressed to the abbot his wish to make his First Communion which he hadn't received in his childhood, a sacrament which he received on January 16th at 7 o'clock in the morning, in the prison chapel. On the evening of the ceremony, he wrote a last letter to his brother Adolphe, in which he acknowledged his errors, expressed his desire for repentance and demanded \\"a thousand pardons\\". On December 26, 1879, an appeal was dismissed by the Criminal Division of the cour d'assises. The next day, his lawyer made him sign a petition for a pardon. The then-president, Jules Gr√©vy, generally wasn't very reluctant to grant pardons to those sentenced to death, but followed the recommendations of the commissions of pardons, which concluded that justice must follow its course because of the particularly sordid crimes and Pr√©vost's profession. Gr√©vy justified his decision to the condemned lawyer in the following letter: The pardon was formally rejected on January 18th, and Louis Deibler, recently appointed chief executioner on May 15, was summoned to the prosecutor's office of the Republic and issued the ultimate requisition: Order is given to the chief executioner of criminal judgments to seize Victor Pr√©vost, sentenced to death by the cour d'assises of Seine, on December 8, 1879, and proceed with his execution in public on Monday, January 19, 1880, at seven o'clock in the morning.. On the scheduled date and time, Pr√©vost was executed publicly in front of the prison, in the freezing cold (-5¬∞C). It had previously snowed, and two huge snow mounds surrounded the square, plunging into near darkness. Since six o'clock in the morning, a hundred republican guards, fifty horsemen, and three hundred peacekeepers had taken their places to keep at a distance those who had come to watch the execution. Warned that his execution would take place at 6:30, Pr√©vost was asked to put on a white shirt, which he refused, and to keep his slippers on, because the boots would hurt his feet. He obeyed all the preparatory procedures for implementation, and walked worthily to the scaffold. Between his identification and his execution, it took a little more than four months. As for the executioner Louis Deibler, that was his first execution in Paris, as he had previously practised his job in the provinces. For this first time, he was to be assisted by his first deputy designate, Alphonse-L√©on Berger (later chief executioner of Corsica, 1870-1875), whom was dismissed from Pr√©vost's execution, which caused a lasting quarrel between the two men. = Autopsy and scientific studies = Burial at Ivry Cemetery Pr√©vost's family did not claim his body, so he was put at the disposal of the dean for the Faculty of Forensic Medicine, for the purpose of an autopsy and phrenological studies. However, legal procedures required a mock burial in the cemetery. Immediately after the execution, the coffin containing Pr√©vost's body and headed was loaded with a bran container into a van that went off on the field with a great trot, escorted by mounted gendarmes, to go to the hospice cemeteries which adjoined Ivry Cemetery. It was followed by three cars, carrying the chaplain, accompanied by the head of the security services and the journalists. At precisely 7:45, the van stopped near an open pit surrounded by gravediggers. Pr√©vost's body was exhumed from the coffin, placed in a light wooden coffin, with his head slipped between his legs. Father Crozes recited a final prayer before the coffin was temporarily closed with two nails. Ultimately, the pit become bloodied, which came from the bottom of the coffin. At the end of the brief ceremony, the coffin was loaded into a medical van, which immediately left towards the medical faculty. At half-past eight, only an hour and a half after his execution, Pr√©vost's still-warm body was disposed of in Professor Charles-Philippe Robin's laboratory at the Practical School in the Faculty of Medicine in Paris. Immediately, the teacher, the doctors and the students engaged in various experiments. At 10 o'clock, with the arrival of a dozen other doctors, there were excitations of the muscles with the help of an electric battery. The sensitivity of the body decreasing, the reactions to shocks was tested. These macabre experiments completed, the fifteen or so experimentalists of all ages began to dissect and dismember the remains of the deceased. \\"All these observers seem happy at the opportunity to study at leisure, under the microscope, studies on the body of a man who, a few hours earlier, was in good health. [...] At noon, there remained of the old body only packets of crumbling flesh, emptied of blood, shapeless and scattered.\\". Shortly after, Professor Paul Broca published a study entitled \\"The Brain of the Killer Pr√©vost\\". From his analysis, with assorted scholarly considerations, Pr√©vost as put in the category of \\"smart murderers\\", but functional defects in the brain made it \\"very abnormal\\".These conclusions are relative, because of the very empirical knowledge at the time on the functioning of the human brain. Despite the use of various means of sophisticated studies such as genetic testing, the predisposition to crime remained a very controversial hypothesis: Justine Canonne, https://le-cercle- psy.scienceshumaines.com/le-retour-du-criminel-ne_sh_31303, Archived August 21, 2013 Another scholar, Louis B√©li√®res, resumed this study in 1909 by comparing Pr√©vost's brain to those of other criminals.  Bulimia  From a very young age, Victor Pr√©vost suffered from insatiable bulimia, inherited from his father, which manifested itself throughout his life: \\"I have a good appetite, I eat well; but do not gain weight.\\", he wrote in prison. The autopsy notes anomalies present on his digestive prison that could perhaps have a link with his perpetual munching, but no study was conducted beyond simple observations. During a banquet organized by the Friendly Association of the Ancient Cent-Gardes, Brigadier Valentin recounted having surprised Pr√©vost, while he was stealing from the squadron's raw meat supplies. Several of his ex-comrades confirmed that he had declared: \\"to the human appetite\\".  In popular culture  A certain expression came from his lips: \\"Cut the cab√®che, that's velvet, with chocolate.\\" At the time, the expression circulated in police stations without gaining much mainstream attention, but it was entered into popular language and even taken up by Oscar M√©t√©nier in Act II of his macabre drama Lui!, played for the first time on September 11, 1897 at the Grand Guignol Theatre: \\"Ah!...Cut someone's head! That's velvet!...That's chocolate!\\".

Born in West Ham, Baldwin grew up in Basildon, where he was educated at Laindon Road Secondary School. He joined the Royal Navy in 1938, later moving to serve in the Royal Marines, seeing action in numerous events from the Dunkirk evacuation to the D-day landings. He left the Marines in 1948, and soon became a steel erector, joining the Constructional Engineering Union (CEU). Baldwin came to prominence in the CEU, becoming a shop steward, and then a convener. In 1957, he began working full-time for the union as an organiser, and in 1969 he was elected as its assistant general secretary. In 1971, the CEU became the Construction Section of the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers (AUEW), retaining considerable autonomy. He became general secretary of the section in 1976. He was initially seen as a left-winger, and despite his commitment to the Labour Party, he was also supported by the Communist Party of Great Britain. However, in 1980 he became frustrated with striking laggers on the Isle of Grain, and broke the strike by personally driving a bus through the picket line. He also worked on a scheme to move bargaining on pay and conditions from the site level to the national or regional level, believing that this would increase union authority, while also reducing the number of industrial disputes. In 1984, following disputes in the AUEW, the Construction Section became a core part of the union, and Baldwin became its National Secretary (Construction), serving until his retirement in 1988. In 1978, Baldwin was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire.

South Road Properties is mostly reclaimed land, but Kawit Island is natural. The project, which is expected to include restaurants, bars, a mall, convention center, casino, park, theater, and at least three hotels, is a joint venture of the Cebu City Government and Universal Hotels and Resorts Inc. The project is slated for completion in 2021. Name The project is named after former Cebu City Bantay Dagat project director Elpidio \\"Jojo\\" dela Victoria, who was murdered in Talisay City on April 12, 2006, for his role in the fight against illegal fishing. History In a press conference on November 7, 2017, Tomas Osme√±a, the mayor of Cebu City, announced that Universal Hotels and Resorts Inc (UHRI), a subsidiary of JG Summit Holdings, had agreed to invest PHP 18 billion to develop Kawit Island in South Road Properties into an integrated resort and casino facility. UHRI would lease the property for 50 years and the city would receive 60% of the annual gross receipts. Osme√±a said the project would generate 8,000 jobs and increase the appraisal rates for the lots in the area. City councilors and the opposition questioned Osme√±a's announcement and cited his \\"favoritism\\" of investors in SRP while blocking the 2015 sale of a lot. A five-man committee was formed by Cebu City Council to scrutinize the deal's financial, technical, and legal aspects. A joint venture agreement was signed on August 17, 2018 by Mayor Osme√±a and UHRI president Frederick Go. Several attempts to halt the project implementation were made, all of which were unsuccessful. =Later developments= Upon the 2019 election of vice mayor Edgardo Labella as the new Mayor of Cebu City, Labella vowed to review the Isla dela Victoria project after calling the deal entered by Osme√±a with UHRI \\"disadvantageous\\" to the city. His administration was caught off-guard when two of the four buildings on Kawit Island were demolished in the project's first phase. SRP Management Office Head and former city councilor Jose Daluz III demanded an explanation from UHRI about the demolition but it was laid down in the joint venture agreement signed by the previous administration with UHRI that the latter would have to replicate the buildings on a property owned by the city in front of the Cebu City Hall. The new administration also lobbied to UHRI for an increase in the city's share of the projects' annual gross receipts from 90-10 to 60-40, according to Daluz. UHRI's counter-offer to increase its investment from PHP 18 billion to PHP 25 billion instead of increasing the city's share, prompted Labella to reverse course and agree to allow UHRI to continue the project.

Like the other field of medicine, medical genetics also face ethical issues. The availability of direct to consumer (DTC) genetic testing to analyses the genetic variants which predispose the individuals to medical conditions like breast cancer and ovarian cancer demands the review of the guidelines which are based on the ethical issues associated with the clinical setup. Ethics principles, which are based on the physician-patient relationship, like respect for the autonomy of persons, beneficence, non- maleficence, and justice applied in medical field cover most of the ethical issues in medical genetics. However, due to the fact that the genetic information is shared by the family members and the information which is generated for a patient could involve those who are predisposed to the genetic condition, medical genetic ethics require additional measures.  ELSI program  The Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications of Human Genetics Research (ELSI) program was developed in 1990 and funded by the agencies which funded human genome project to look into the ethical, legal and social implications which will arise after the completion of human genome project and large scale availability of the genetic information. ELSI program focussed on the high priority areas, like privacy and fairness in the use and interpretation of genomic information, clinical integration of genetic technologies. which are relevant to the medical genetic ethics.  WHO guideline  In 1995, the World Health Organization published the first guideline on ethical issues in medical genetics. During the time of the guideline, the genetic analysis was confined to the clinical setup and mostly to the developed nations but with the completion of human genome project in 2003 and the advent of high throughput sequencing techniques, the human genome has become accessible to both developed and developing nations and the regular household.

She founded the Portland Rose Society in 1888. The society's annual rose show grew into a rose parade and pageant by 1906, and was the foundation for the Portland Rose Festival. Pittock was actively involved in charities and cultural organizations in Portland from the 1870s through the early 1900s.  Early life  Pittock was born in 1845 in Clarke County, Missouri. Her family emigrated from Missouri to Oregon in 1854, traveling by wagon on the Oregon Trail. According to Burton family lore, young Georgiana was picked up by local Native Americans, when she became separated from her party while crossing the plains. She was returned to her family along with an offer to purchase the girl, which the family declined. The family continued on to Oregon without further mishap. When they reached Oregon, the family initially settled in Milwaukie, Oregon before moving to Portland in 1857. Pittock attended Portland Academy. While in her teens, Pittock became engaged to Henry Pittock, a typesetter for The Weekly Oregonian. The young couple married in June, 1860. Henry became the owner and publisher of the newspaper during this time period. Between 1861 and 1878, Georgiana gave birth to nine children, six of whom reached adulthood. The couple built homes on a large parcel of land that Henry had purchased in 1856, in an area that is now called the Pittock Block in downtown Portland. The family built and lived in two cottages before moving into a larger home in 1864, a home the family would live in for the next fifty years. Community involvement =Portland Rose Society= Pittock founded the Portland Rose Society as an informal club of rose gardeners in 1888, and is considered the founder of the Portland Rose Festival. The first rose competition was hosted by Pittock in her large garden in Portland. She established the gardening club after a holiday of touring rose gardens and rose competitions in England. The next year, Pittock turned her backyard rose competition into a fundraiser for her church. She added a judging tent to her garden and charged admission to the event. This annual event would later include a city parade. Local gardeners would empty their gardens of roses to decorate horses, floats and wagons. From these early beginnings, the Portland Rose Festival was born. The group officially established the Portland Rose Society, the oldest rose society in the United States as a formal gardening organization in 1907, and established the annual tradition of a judged, flower competition. =Charities= Pittock was actively involved with local women's and children's organizations. She founded the Ladies Sewing Society in 1887, which eventually became the Women's Relief Society. Members would sew baby clothes and sell them at local events to raise money to support other charities in town. Pittock's favorite charity was The Baby Home, a Portland orphanage for abandoned babies. She supported the Boys and Girls Aid Society, a home for abandoned and abused children. She was also involved in the Parry Center for Children, which began as a home for children orphaned on the Oregon Trail. She was actively involved with the Fruit and Flower Daycare Center, the first daycare center in Oregon, which opened in 1906, and is still in operation today. Pittock joined the Portland Women‚Äôs Union in 1912 as a suffragette. The organization's mission was to support single working women. Pittock was a board member, chairman of the finance committee and the fourth president of the organization. She was also instrumental in establishing the Martha Washington Hotel, a hotel residence for single working women. By 1911, the hotel had more demand for rooms than the building could provide, and a new hotel was built. Later years In 1909, at the age of sixty four, Pittock and her husband, Henry, hired architect Edward T. Foulkes to design a 16,000-square-foot, French-Renaissance style mansion for the couple and their extended family on their 46-acre estate. The wooded property was in the West Hills area of Portland known as Imperial Heights. The home was built 1,000 feet above sea level, with commanding views of Mount St. Helens and Mount Hood. Oregon craftsmen and artisans were hired to construct the home, mainly using materials from the Pacific Northwest. Construction was begun in 1909 and completed in 1914. Pittock suffered a stroke that left her partially paralyzed in 1913. An elevator was hastily added to the construction plans, so that Pittock could move easily around the large mansion. Four years later, on June 12, 1918, Pittock died from complications of the earlier stroke. Her husband, Henry, survived her by only a few months, dying in January, 1919. They are both buried in River View Cemetery in Portland. Pittock family members continued to live in the mansion until 1958. The mansion was badly damaged during a storm in 1962, and was eventually abandoned. Scheduled to be demolished by developers, the home was purchased by the City of Portland in 1964. Today, the Pittock Mansion is open to the public.

He is said to have represented the Jewish people in several lawsuits brought against them, recounted in the Gemara.  Lawsuit by the Africans  A group of African Canaanites brought a claim before Alexander the Great that the land of Canaan belonged to them, citing Numbers 34:2 ‚ÄúThis is the land that shall fall to you as an inheritance, the land of Canaan according to its borders‚Äù. Geviha ben Pesisa offered to serve as advocate for the Jews, and the Sages permitted him to do so. Ben Pesisa also cited the Torah to counter their argument, stating: ‚ÄúAnd he said: Cursed will be Canaan; a slave of slaves shall he be to his brethren‚Äù (Genesis 9:25). The Africans asked Alexander for three days to come up with a response to Geviha ben Pesisa, but they were unable to provide one and subsequently fled their fields and vineyards.  Lawsuit by the Egyptians  Another lawsuit in which Geviha ben Pesisa represented the Jewish people was by the people of Egypt, who claimed that they were owed the gold and silver \\"borrowed\\" by the Israelites during the Exodus from Egypt. Geviha ben Pesisa argued that the gold and silver were wages owed the Israelites for their hard labor during 430 years of enslavement by Egypt. Like the Canaanites, they asked Alexander the Great, the presiding judge, for three days to respond, but they were likewise unable to come up with a counterargument.  Lawsuit by the Ishmaelites  On another occasion, a group of Ishmaelites claimed that since the land of Canaan was promised to Abraham, it should be divided equally among Abraham's descendants. Geviha ben Pesisa responded \\"And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac. But to the sons of the concubines that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and he sent them away from his son, while he yet lived, eastward, to the east country‚Äù. He argued that since Abraham himself had designated the land as belonging solely to Isaac, the children of Ishmael had no claim to it. As for the gifts which Abraham provided to his sons by Hagar and Keturah, Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba claimed that Abraham gave them the secrets of witchcraft.

Ryegaard and neighbouring Trudsholm is owned by the Rosenkrantz/Skeel families since the year 1735. The two estates add up to a combined area of 1,228 hectares. History Ryegaard is first mentioned in 1350when Folmer Folmersen acquired it from the Crown in exchange for other property. The next owner was Jakob Olufsen Lunge and the estate then remained in the hands of the Lunge family until Sophie Folmersdatter Lunge, by marriage, transferred it to Claus Serlin. After his death, Ryegaard passed to Otte Alretsen Selin and then to his daughter Sophie Clausdatter Serlin. She married David Arildsen in 1452. Having no children, they bequeathed Ryeg√•rd to a grandson of Serlin, Niels Clausen, who was Bishop of Aarhus. The next owner was Erik Eriksen Banner. His son, Frantz Banner, inherited the estate in 1554. He began the constructed of a new main building after the old one was destroyed by fire in 1569. He also increased the size of the estate through the acquisition of more land. In 1573, Banner ceded Ryegaard to the Crown in exchange for property in Jutland. The Crown later that same year sold Ryegaard to Johanne Oxe. Ryegaard had at some point been granted status of a birk but Frants Banner had unlawfully retained this authority and the estate therefore lost its status of birk in 1586. It is unclear what happened to Ryegaard after Johanne Oxe's death in 1586 but the estate was most likely ceded to either Johan Barnekow or his widow Anne Pedersdatter Bille since it is known that it was later owned by their daughter Sophie Barnekow. Sophie Barnekow's husband, Eiler Gyldenstiernes, sold the estate to Axel Urne in 1622. Axel Urne's widow, Birgitte Gyldenstierne, sold it in 1640, The new owner was Niels Trolle. He once again increased the size of the estate through the acquisition of more land. He also restored Ryegaard's status as a birk. After Niels Trolle's death, Ryegaard passed to his son, Holger Trolle, who once again added more land. After Holger Trolle's death, Ryegaard passed to his son and daughter-in- law. Their son, Knud Trolle, sold the estate in 1735. The new owner was Iver Rosenkrantz. His widow, Charlotte Amalie Skeel, kept the estate after her husband's death in 1745. Their son, Frederik Christian Rosenkrantz, who later served as prime minister, inherited the estate after his mother's death in 1763. He was also the owner of Krabbesholm, Egholm, Barritskov and Trudsholm. He endowed his estates to Niels Rosenkrantz with an obligation to establish a stamhus (family trust) from the estates. Stamhuset Rosenkrantz was established from Ryegaard, Barritskov and Trudsholm while Egholm and Krabbesholm were sold to his brother Marcus G√∏ye Rosenkrantz. Niels Rosenkrantz died without children in 1824. Stamhuset Rosenkrantz was therefore passed to his relative Henrik J√∏rgen Scheel. He was succeeded by his son Frederik Christian Rosenkrantz Scheel. He replaced the old main building with a new one. After Frederik Christian Rosenkrantz Scheel's death, in 1912, stamhuset Rosenkrantz passed to his son, Henrik J√∏rgen Scheel, who died in 1917 and was succeeded by Frederik Christian Scheel. The adoption of the lensafl√∏sningslov in 1919 meant that Stamhuset Rosenkrantz was dissolved with effect from 1923. As another consequence of the act, Ryegaard also had to cede 158.1 hectare of land to the government in 1921 and another 29.9 hectares in 1926. Today Ryegaard and Trudsholm are today owned by Johan Christian Rosenkrantz Scheel. The two estates have a combined area of 1,228 hectares.

He is owner and operator of the Tin Man Studio, part gallery and part studio, in Selma.  Life  Charlie Lucas was born in Birmingham, Alabama on October 12, 1951. He is a descendant of six generations of craftspeople. His mother and grandmother were skilled quilters and ceramicists while his maternal grandfather and great-grandfather were blacksmiths. In fact, his great-grandfather, King Lucas, made sculptures of his own from discarded metal. Other members of his family were basket weavers and woodcarvers. Lucas studied blacksmithing and metal works, in general, with his grandfather. It was through him that Lucas learned to make toys for other children and decided to pursue art as a career. However, after Lucas completed the fourth grade in Elmo County, Alabama, he was scorned and ridiculed by a teacher for having the desire to be an artist. After this humiliation, Lucas ran away from home at fourteen and began performing technical labor, such as landscaping, car mechanics, truck driving, and construction. Three years later, at seventeen, he had settled in Florida working for a food manufacturer. At twenty-years-old, he returned to Alabama and began building a house in Prattville, Alabama, across the street from his grandmother's house. The same year, he married Annie Marie Lykes. Together they had four sons and two daughters, some of whom help him construct his sculptures today. After their children grew up, Annie Marie and Lucas divorced, but he maintains a studio on their property in Prattville, where Annie Marie also works as an artist.  Career  Lucas was the eldest of many siblings, and he spent much of his childhood entertaining and making toys for other children. In 1984, at 33-years-old, Lucas fell off of the back of a truck on a construction site and was left permanently disabled. He was bed-ridden for nearly three years. Through his recovery, he found his artistic practice once again. He calls his artistic process \\"recycling himself\\" and his humanoid figures sculpted from recycled mechanical parts echo his sentiment. He refers to his sculptures as \\"toys,\\" continuing the practice he began in childhood, and he refers to himself as \\"The Tin Man\\". He now owns and operates Tin Man Studio, a small gallery and studio, in Selma, Alabama. Although he now lives in Selma, he maintains his five-acre property in Prattville. His property stretches across both sides of the road that runs through Pink Lily. His family home sits on one side and on the other sits sprawling fields and rolling hills where Lucas has built a sculpture garden within a subsistence garden. His sculptures of giant masks and dinosaurs sit among corn, squash, and peanut crops. = Inspiration = Lucas's main artistic concern is communication. Growing up with dyslexia, which rendered him illiterate until recently, forced Lucas to rely on visual and aural ways of communication. According to him, this is what has made him the artist and storyteller he is. Lucas makes his art \\"as toys to play with\\" through which he hopes \\"his culture, passion for mankind, and desire for 'social unity'\\" shine through. He also makes these sculptures as friends, with which he can share his own dialogue, \\"and who can teach him lessons about life.\\" = Materials = Lucas's largest sculptures are of people and animals constructed from welded metal bands. The negative space between the metal bands give the works a \\"light and airy appearance.\\" An example of this work is an eight-foot tall reptilian sculpture displayed on Lucas's property in Prattville. The smaller sculptures are made from welded recycled automobile and bicycle parts. Lucas frequently used bicycle wheels to convey stunted social and physical mobility, as evidenced by Three Way Bicycle and Old Wheel Don't Roll No More. Though his abstract paintings are less well known compared to his sculptures, he has made over one hundred paintings. He paints with house paint on canvas or used boards. = Exhibitions and permanent collections = Lucas's work has been featured in the following exhibitions: #Redemption Songs: Outsider Art from the Black Diaspora.

She is a senior investigator in the skeletal biology section at the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research.  Education  Robey received her B.A. in biology from Susquehanna University in 1974. She completed a M.S. in biochemistry in 1977 and a Ph.D. in cell biology in 1979 from the Catholic University of America. Her Master's graduate thesis was titled The isolation, purification and characterization of A/J skin collagen and the effects of dexamethasone on skin collegen metabolism. Her 1979 dissertation was titled Studies on the Collagenous Component of a Tumor Basement Membrane. She did her post-doctoral work at the National Institute of Arthritis, Metabolism and Digestive Diseases on the role of defective phosphorylation of enzymes leading to lysosomal storage disease, and a staff fellowship in the National Eye Institute, where she studied retinal and ocular connective tissue diseases.  Career  Robey joined NIDCR in 1983 and established reproducible methods for culturing human bone-forming cells, in order to study the development of mineralized matrix formation. In 1992, Robey was appointed chief of Skeletal Biology Section. Robey has served as a co-coordinator of the NIH Bone Marrow Stromal Cell Transplantation Center (2008-2013), and is currently the acting Scientific Director of the NIH Stem Cell Characterization Facility. She is a senior investigator in the skeletal biology section at NIDCR. = Research interests = Robey focuses on four main areas in skeletal cell biology: 1) determination of the characteristics and the biological properties of post- natal bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), a subset of which are multipotent skeletal stem cells (SSCs), able to recreate cartilage, bone, cells that support blood formation and fat cells in the marrow; 2) elucidation of the role of enzymatic matrix remodeling in the maintenance of SSC function; 3) characterization of the role that BMSCs/SSCs play in skeletal diseases; and, 4) development of techniques for cartilage and bone regeneration in human patients with skeletal defects. In addition to using BMSCs for tissue engineering, Dr. Robey and her group also explore the potential of pluripotent stem cells to differentiate into cartilage and bone as another source of cells for skeletal regeneration.

Historical sources suggest that the death toll may have been as high as 20,000, although modern scholars suggest that this figure is likely an exaggeration. The earthquake gave the helots an opportunity to revolt against the Spartans, and the Athenians were called to their aid. Their immediate dismissal upon arrival is said to have been a key event that lead up to the First Peloponnesian War.  Tectonic setting  Seismicity around Greece between 1990-2000Sparta was located on what is currently called the Hellenic Arc which is predisposed to large seismic activity due to the convergence and subduction of the African Plate beneath the Aegean Sea Plate. The convergent and subduction of these plates are also seen in the geographical landscape in present-day Greece with large mountain ranges as well as many islands and the lands drop off into the Mediterranean Sea. Seen in the image to the right, present day Greece still experiences seismic activity regularly however is usually much more mild than the one felt in the year 464 BCE.  Effects  Accounts of the earthquake and its consequences are based on only a few often unreliable historical sources, specifically the writings of Strabo, Pausanias, Plutarch, and Thucydides. As there is little recorded about the earthquake itself in contemporary records, it is difficult to judge the exact epicenter and magnitude of the event. However, the earthquake is believed to have been 'medium to large' according to many historians and occurred due to movement on a fault near the Taygetus Mountains. A 1991 study attempted to locate the fault responsible for the event and estimate the magnitude of the earthquake based on satellite imagery and fieldwork. The authors of the study conclude that if the 464 BC event took place along the fault whose scarp they identified, its magnitude would have been approximately 7.2 on the surface wave magnitude scale. Due to the lack of proper infrastructure and seismic engineering knowledge during this time casualties were originally thought to be very high with some contemporary sources believing the death toll to be around 20,000. However, modern scholars believe this might be an exaggeration due to the fact that at the time the city was relatively small and spread out, with most buildings being one floor and constructed from wood or sun-baked brick making it hard to believe that casualties could have been so high. The lack of detailed population records, coupled with flight of survivors to other areas, may have contributed to the uncertainty, as it can today. In such a catastrophic earthquake, it is also unlikely that a number of the anecdotal tales from the time could be true, such as the Spartan king Archidamus leading the Spartan army out of the city to safety. Regardless of the exact death toll, there was some destruction, and the helots, the slave class in Spartan society, took advantage of this moment to rise in rebellion.  Historical significance  The 464 BCE Sparta earthquake is marked by scholars as one of the key events that led to the First Peloponnesian War. However, according to Thucydides, the ancient Greek chronicler of the Peloponnesian War, Sparta had already decided to invade Attica when the earthquake struck. In the aftermath of the earthquake, the helots and various Messenian subjects of Sparta revolted; Sparta invoked the aid of other Greek cities to put down the rebellion, which they were obliged to help in accordance with the alliance. Athens, whose aid the Spartans sought because of their \\"reputed experience in siege operations,\\" sent approximately 4,000 hoplites under the leadership of Cimon, but this contingent was sent back to Athens, while those from other cities were allowed to stay. By Thucydides's account (History of the Peloponnesian War, I.101‚Äì102), the Spartans were concerned that the Athenians would switch sides and assist the helots; from the Spartan perspective, the Athenians had an \\"enterprising and revolutionary character,\\" and by this fact alone posed a threat to the oligarchic regime of Sparta. The Athenians were insulted, and therefore repudiated their alliance with Sparta. Once the uprising was put down, some of the surviving rebels fled to Athens, which settled them at Naupactus on the strategically important Corinthian Gulf. The alliance between Sparta and Athens was never revived, and disagreements continued to intensify until the outbreak of war in 460 BC. Since the Helot population used the earthquake as their opportunity to rebel, the Spartans were forced to wait to reform their society until after they had suppressed the Helots.  Popular Culture  In Rick Riordan's Trials of Apollo: The Hidden Oracle, Apollo claims that he was the one who caused the 464 BC Spartan earthquake: \\"It was a desperate idea, but I‚Äôd had success bringing down buildings with arrows before. In 464 BCE, I caused an earthquake that wiped out most of Sparta by hitting a fault line at the right angle. (I never liked the Spartans much.)\\"https://www.booktrust.org.uk/globalassets/resources/bookbuzz/2018/book- extracts/9780141363929_thehiddenoracle_txt.pdf  See also  * List of earthquakes in Greece * List of historical earthquakes  References  Sparta Category:1st-millennium BC earthquakes Category:Sparta Category:Classical Greece Category:464 BC Category:1st-millennium BC natural events ","title":"464 BC Sparta earthquake"},{"id":"61826780","text":"Margaret Priest (born 1944) is an Toronto based artist, educator and arts advocate. Priest‚Äôs artistic practice of 50 years includes painting, print- making, sculpture and public art projects, and she is known and recognized for drawing the interiors and exteriors of the modern, urban built environment. Her work has been exhibited across Canada and internationally in solo and group exhibitions since 1970. Priest is a Professor Emeritus at the University of Guelph, where she taught in the School of Fine Art and Music from 1983 to 2001, and has guest lectured extensively in Canada, England and the United States. Priest has been living and working in Toronto since 1976, after relocating from England with her husband, the Canadian-born painter Tony Scherman. They have three children, Leo, Georgia and Claudia.  Biography Priest was born at Tyringham Hall, England, then a war-time maternity hospital for people evacuated from the bombing of London in World War II. She grew up in the family council house in Becontree, Dagenham. Her father Arthur was a railway employee; her mother Gertrude Tommason was the daughter of a stonemason. Priest studied at the South West Essex Technical College and School of Art in 1963 and 1964 before entering Maidstone College of Art. From 1967 she attended the Royal College of Art in London and graduated with a master's degree in 1970. In the same year, her photolithograph Picture Palace III, 1969, was included in Studio International magazine's Prints and Lithographs supplement. Priest‚Äôs first solo exhibition was at the Arnolfini in Bristol in 1970, which hosted a second show in 1974. Priest was a lecturer at Saint Martin's School of Art in London from 1972 to 1976, when she moved to Canada. Priest was Professor in the School of Fine Art and Music at the University of Guelph from 1983 to 2001, and is now Professor Emeritus. In 1996, the Art Gallery of Hamilton and the Macdonald Stewart Art Centre co- organized a two-site career survey exhibition including drawing, painting, printwork and sculpture. In October 2019, the Art Gallery of Ontario will present her work focused around the recently acquired suite of prints for The Monument to Construction Workers.  Work  Priest‚Äôs work is not overtly feminist or political, but issues of gender and social class have had a critical role in her approach and thinking. In an interview with Rozsika Parker she articulated her awareness of the still male-dominated art world as a student in the 1960s and into the 1970s, and also remained conscious of her working-class background. Griselda Pollock has noted Priest's choice of drawing as a medium as a conscious decision to embrace a typically feminine art form on her own terms. = Architecture as source and subject matter = Modern and aspirational architecture of the international style has been a primary interest for Priest as well as the democratic aspect of public housing in the British reconstruction phase after World War II. She has been included in exhibitions with an architectural focus, such as Viewpoints (1989) and Toronto/Roma (1991). Architect Marc Baraness has noted that Priest's depictions of architecture by Richard Neutra, Adolf Loos and Eileen Gray distills the architects' original ideas and the emotional content of their work. Critic and art historian Bernard Denvir has observed that Priest's drawings of architecture are resonant with the human aspects of the built environment. = Drawing = Priest often uses research-selected photographs as a source and starting point for her architectural drawings, through which alterations and refinements are made. British writer Deanna Petherbridge and critic E.C. Woodley have described the long creative process of the artist, building on painstakingly observed photographs combined with her own memories, and making interventions into the architectural space through the eventual drawing. = Sculpture = Priest‚Äôs earliest sculptural work is related to her Toronto public art commission, The Monument to Construction Workers, which was completed in 1993. The Construction Series: Building Materials (1990-1995) were a hybrid of precise drawings and actual building materials such as granite, aluminum and limestone, which were used to frame the drawings. Art historian Linda Norden observed the tactile aspects of these works, which she saw as reflecting the importance of materiality and place. Between 1996 and 2000, Priest created three fully dimensional sculptures each titled The Critic‚Äôs Armchair. They are meant to resemble furniture and made with materials that are also associated with modern architecture and design, such as chrome, steel, terrazzo and marble. Each armchair includes an insert in which a material drawing is positioned. One writer remarked on the absence of the implied human figure as being central to the effect of these works. Priest‚Äôs sculptural work in 2011 returned to recollections of her life in England. The centre piece incorporates a well-crafted shipping crate that serves as a plinth for a variety of objects made from cherry wood. One of these is a doll-house like model of Tyringham Hall. Another is a locomotive, a homage to the site of her father‚Äôs war injury. Each object has a steel engraved label with poetic phrases on both sides. For Tyringham Hall, one side is engraved with ‚Äúwhere I didn‚Äôt belong but I came from‚Äù; the other side with ‚ÄúOn Chance and Charity.‚Äù = Public Art = Priest‚Äôs on-going interest in architecture has led her to conceptualize and devise integrated permanent public art projects. The first to be built was The Monument to Construction Workers in downtown Toronto, a landmark component for the collaborative urban park project Cloud Gardens working with project architects Baird Sampson. Completed in 1993, it received a Governor General‚Äôs Award of Merit in Architecture in 1994. The Monument measures approximately 22 metres wide by 10 metres at its highest point, and consists of a structural steel grid with twenty-six 150 x 150 cm inserted panels. The panels began as Priest‚Äôs geometric composition drawings of materials and methods used in each of the professional construction trades, such as carpentry, concrete work, and pipe- fitting. The panels themselves were fabricated by the respective tradespeople. Linda Norden described the unique conditions and approach of the process of creating this work, in which Priest directed the activity of around 40 trade workers, all male, subverting the usual gender dynamic of construction. Urban historian Robert Fulford has noted the way in which construction workers are celebrated in the work, while other critics have observed the way that the work reverses the usual materials and processes of building. Priest continued the sculptural work of the Monument with a suite of 27 etchings produced in 1994: The 27th etching is a facsimile of the dedication panel. Curator Ren√©e van der Avoird has said of the etchings that they reflect the strength and precision of both the represented trades and the artist herself. Her most recent major public work was for the Infinity Condominium Development, Toronto, in collaboration with artist Fraser Stables. Commissioned through the City of Toronto Percent for Public Art Program, it was completed in 2008. Using terrazzo and lighting elements, Priest and Stables traced travel across the site from pre-contact to the railway tracks of the 19th and 20th century.  Cultural advocacy and honours  Priest received an Ontario Confederation of University Faculty Associations Teaching Award in 1996, and was recognized for her role in developing the University‚Äôs MFA program. Priest has been a visiting critic and lecturer at the University of Toronto, Carleton University, and the University of Waterloo, and has been a visiting critic at the Yale School of Architecture and the Graduate School of Design at Harvard University. In 2015 she received an honorary doctorate from the Ontario College of Art and Design University, Toronto. Priest also served for a number of years as a Trustee for the Gershon Iskowitz Foundation.

In 1982 she released the German album Volksmusik with the formation Breslau. Due to the misleading naming and the album's provocative lyrics, she was accused of having sympathies for right-wing thought. Her band Zed Yago, founded in 1985, is considered to be a pioneer in the genre of Dramatic Metal. The band's concept albums deal with the experiences of a fictitious daughter of the Flying Dutchman.

Their style has attracted fans such as banjoist B√©la Fleck who produced their Grammy-nominated second album. Biography Che Apalache was formed in Buenos Aires in 2013. After living abroad in a number of countries including Spain and Japan, Joe Troop moved to Argentina in 2010 to teach bluegrass music. Troop grew up in Winston-Salem in the Piedmont region of North Carolina and was inspired to play bluegrass after hearing a Doc Watson concert as a child. In Argentina, he helped develop the small local scene and eventually formed Che Apalache with some of his best students. Troop notes that for their first five years they played only Appalachian music, and \\"that seemed amazing avant-garde to have a bluegrass band in the city of Buenos Aires.\\" However, they later began to incorporate some of the latin styles they had grown up with in Argentina and Mexico. They initially played with an upright bass but eventually settled on the lineup of Martin Bobrik and Franco Martino, from Buenos Aires, and Pau Barjau, from Mexico. In 2017 they received assistance from the Virginia Folklife Program and PineCone, the Piedmont Council of Traditional Music, to tour the United States. From February to May of that year they recorded an album in Argentina to prepare for their first US tour. That summer they won the prestigious Clifftop old-time music contest in the neo-traditional band category and also competed at the Galax Old Fiddlers' Convention. The band's name is composed of \\"Che,\\" a casual greeting ('buddy' or 'man' in Spanish) and \\"Apalache,\\" the Spanish word for Appalachia. Influences The band is known for the many influences they incorporate including: Uruguayan murga, candombe, flamenco, mountain gospel, Spanish Sephardic Jewish music, and classic bluegrass in the style of the Stanley Brothers. They sing in English, Spanish, and Japanese.

He was one of the few early singing cowboys who had actually engaged in ranching. Calling himself the \\"Original Singing Cowboy,\\" Allen's music is considered some of the best examples of authentic traditional cowboy songs. Allen only recorded 24 songs, but his frequent live radio performance and book Cowboy Lore (1933) made him one of the most influential figures in the popularization of country western music.  Biography  = Early life = Allen was born on April 1, 1883, in Waxahachie, Texas. His father, Luther, was a settler from Missouri and seems to have died or abandoned his family when Jules was a child. His mother, Carrie, died ten years later and entrusted Allen with the care of his three younger siblings. According to his book Cowboy Lore, he began working as a hand at his uncle's ranch when he was ten. After his mother's death, he began driving cattle hundreds of mile from the open ranges along the U.S.-Mexico border to railroad stockyards in Montana. During these long journeys, Allen's companions immersed him in a rich oral tradition of cowboy stories and songs, and taught him how to play the guitar. With end of open-range cattle driving, Allen later claimed that he began performing at local rodeos and on an amateur basis. He also stated that worked as a deputy sheriff in El Paso County, Texas, then Bernalillo County, New Mexico, Texas, and finally as a Texas Ranger. However, there is reason to doubt the veracity of his autobiographical claims. For example, military records indicate that he served in the U.S. Army from 1905 to 1907. Additionally, his enlistment records state that he was a \\"barber\\" in Denver, Colorado in 1905.Ancestry.com. U.S. Army, Register of Enlistments, 1798‚Äì1914 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations Inc, 2007. Retrieved September 19, 2019. Allen also never mentioned the fact that he was previously married to a woman in Sturgis, South Dakota, named Charlotte Evelyn Hough, whom he divorced shortly after the birth of their daughter, Ethal Myrie \\"Mary\\" Allen, in 1904. After her parents separated, Mary was placed in a convent as an infant, but her mother remarried and later recovered her.Ancestry.com. 1920 United States Federal Census [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2010. Images reproduced by FamilySearch. = Music career = During World War I, Allen enlisted in the U.S. Army during World War I and began performing in blackface as a minstrel. He served as a sergeant in the 64th Infantry Regiment, which was assigned to the 7th Infantry Division operating in Lorraine, France. Prior to deploying to France, Allen married Elizabeth M. Caswell in El Paso on December 14, 1917.Ancestry.com. Texas, Select County Marriage Index, 1837‚Äì1965 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, US: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2014. Retrieved September 19, 2019. Allen claimed that after the war he briefly returned to ranching, but government census records from 1920 show that was living with his wife in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and working as a driver the short-lived Fox Motor Company. Regardless, he soon left ranching or driving (probably when Fox dissolved in 1923) and began performing as singing cowboy on the radio in Texas under a variety of names including \\"Longhorn Luke\\" (after the Longhorn Cement Company, his San Antonio sponsor) and \\"Shiftless.\\" The success of fellow singing cowboy Carl T. Sprague's song \\"When the Work's All Done This Fall\\" in 1925 opened the door for other singing cowboys like Ken Maynard, Stuart Hamblen, Red River Dave McEnery, Tex Ritter, Gene Autry, and Allen. Allen traveled to Los Angeles to take advantage of the growing cowboy music scene in Hollywood, where he was discovered by Ralph Peer, a scout with Victor Records. In April 1928, he recorded three songs in El Paso with Victor‚Äì\\"Little Joe the Wrangler,\\" \\"Jack O'Diamonds,\\" and \\"Po 'Mourner\\" (a minstrel song). Despite Sprague's earlier recordings, RCA-Victor copyrighted the phrase \\"The Original Singing Cowboy\\" for Allen's records. Allen also acted in a few Westerns. From 1928 to 1929, Allen recorded a total of 24 songs with Victor before his records sales began to slip during the Great Depression when more a more contemporary and romanticized style of country western music became popular. = Later life = Allen, who divorced his second wife sometime in the 1920s, married an unknown woman in 1930 and moved to Taos, New Mexico. In 1929, he reunited with his daughter Mary, who discovered her long-lost father after she heard one of his records playing. Although he never recorded another album, Allen continued to perform on the radio, as well as with rodeo shows and traveling circuses throughout the 1930s. In 1933, Allen wrote an autobiography about his life as a cowboy, accompanied by a dictionary of cowboy terms and sayings, a glossary of cattle brands, and collection of songs in a book entitled Cowboy Lore. While Allen claimed the book contained knowledge and songs he learned while working on the trail, Barry Shank (an American studies scholar) notes that almost all of his observations about cowboy life, as well as all but three of the songs, are identical to those previously published by singer John Avery Lomax in 1910. Furthermore, two of the songs were written in the 1920s for the records Allen recorded with Victor Records. How much of Allen's autobiography was a result of his personal experiences as a cowboy rather than Lomax's work is unknown. Allen divorced his third wife sometime prior to 1940 and moved back to Los Angeles. He continued to perform at rodeos and on radio stations throughout the southwest during the final years of his life. While travelling through Tucson, Arizona in 1945, Allen fell ill and was admitted into the local veterans hospital. Doctors diagnosed him with a gastric ulcer and he died a week later. He is buried at the Evergreen Memorial Park cemetery in Tucson.  Legacy  Although he enjoyed a brief musical career, Allen is considered one of the pioneers of early country music. His cowboy stories and music inspired the next generation of country music singers, including Country Music Hall of Fame member Ernest Tubb. His work also helped popularize western-themed books and films.

He aided an estimated 2000 slaves in escaping from bondage. He was a founding member of the American Anti-Slavery Society. Fussell was an advocate for women serving as physicians, and he influenced the founding of the Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania. He worked as a practicing physician, including providing medical services for fugitive slaves. Early life and education Fussell was born to a Quaker family in Chester County, Pennsylvania, to father Bartholomew Fussell and mother Rebecca Fussell (n√©e Bond). His father and his sister Esther strongly encouraged Fussell's pursuit of higher education. He moved to Maryland as a young man where he perceived he had better educational opportunities. There, he opened a school in Little Falls, Maryland, and taught. At night, he studied medicine, eventually graduating as a physician from the Medical College of Baltimore. He also opened a Sunday school in Bush River Neck, Maryland, for African-American slaves, teaching them to read the Bible. This was a controversial practice at the time. During this time, he became involved through family ties with Quaker members of the local abolitionist movement, especially Elisha Tyson. Fussell himself began to speak out against the institution of slavery, for which he was criticized by local slaveowners. Personal life and family After completing his education, Fussell returned to Chester County, Pennsylvania, where he established a medical practice. Shortly thereafter, on May 26, 1826, he married Lydia Morris and established a home in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, that came to be known as \\"The Pines\\" and was used as a safe house for the Underground Railroad. He purchased The Pines from Jonathan and Ann Thomas who were already active in the Underground Railroad, having used the home as a refuge for runaway slaves from 1805 to 1830. Susan Fussell was a daughter of Bartholomew Fussell and Lydia Morris. She was notable as an educator, nurse in the United States Civil War, and a philanthropist. As a young woman, she was woman of the house at a young age following the early death of her mother. Their other children were Joshua Longstreth Fussell, Morris Fussell, Lydia Ada Fussell, and Benjamin Lundy Fussell. Fussell's wife Lydia died in 1840. On September 2, 1841, he married Rebecca Churchman Hewes, with whom he had one child Edward Churchman Fussell. Participation in the Underground Railroad In Pennsylvania, Fussell developed a working relationship with local abolitionist Thomas Garrett. At that time, Fussell began sheltering fugitive slaves brought to his home from prior refuge with Garrett. Besides sheltering, he used his home, The Pines, to provide medical services to sick or injured runaway slaves. His home was approximately 1 mile east of the historical village of Kennett Square, which was a center point of the abolitionist movement in southeast Pennsylvania. The Pines had a root cellar that was used as a hiding place for runaway slaves, and it also had a second exit for rapid escape. Fussell and his wife Lydia frequently hosted other abolitionists at The Pines. The Pines, as seen in 2019 In 1833, Fussell was an original signer of the Declaration of Sentiments of the American Anti-Slavery Society, a manifesto that stated anti- slavery principles of the organization. The signing occurred at the first meeting of this organization, which was held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In the late 1830s, Fussell moved approximately 20 miles north of Kennett Square to West Vincent, Pennsylvania, to a farm neighboring his sister Ester Lewis. At that location, he collaborated with Lewis, her daughters, in addition to Garrett and abolitionists John Vickers and Elijah Pennypacker in furthering the work of the Underground Railroad. Fussell's wife Lydia died in 1840. He married Rebecca Hewes the following year, at which time Fussell and his new wife moved to York, Pennsylvania. At that time, his brother and nephew moved into the Fussell home in West Vincent to continue the work on the Underground Railroad at the Fussell and Lewis homes. Activities of the Underground Railroad increased after the 1850 passage of the Fugitive Slave Law, which increased penalties for aiding fugitive slaves. Fussell, in turn, increased his own participation. In 1851, he aided the escape of three participants in the Christiana Riot, providing the escapees with refuge in the Lewis family home in Chester County. Fussell remained an active member of the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society up until the end of the United States Civil War. As a safe house operator, he is an example of a conductor and of a stationmaster in the Underground Railroad, railroad terminology often being used in this context. Fussell's involvement in the Underground Railroad is documented in an early treatise on the subject, The Underground Railroad Records, by African- American abolitionist William Still, in 1872. Fussell's home, The Pines, was purchased by Kennett Township in 2016 for historic preservation. Influence on careers for women as physicians Fussell was sensitized to the limited opportunities that women of his time had in the field of medicine because of his sister Ester's stymied efforts to pursue a career in medicine. For this reason, in 1840, Fussell began classes to teach women the basics of medicine. He subsequently began a campaign to advance the cause of women as physicians. In 1846, Fussell organized a meeting of six local physicians and his niece Graceanna Lewis to discuss the desirability of women's careers in medicine. Attendees included the six physicians Ezra Mitchener, Edwin Fussell (the husband of Graceanna's sister, Rebecca Lewis), Franklin Taylor, Ellwood Harvey, and Sylvester Birdsall, in addition to Fussell's niece. This meeting eventually led to the founding of the Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania in 1850, although he did not play a direct role in its creation. Later years and death After the United States Civil War and the prohibition of slavery, Fussell spent much of his time in Pendleton, Indiana, at the home of his son Joshua Fussell. However, he died in West Pikeland, Pennsylvania, at the home of his son Dr. Morris Fussell. Fussell is buried alongside his wife Lydia at the Pikeland Friends Burial Ground in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, USA.
