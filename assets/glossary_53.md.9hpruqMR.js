He served under the Jin dynasty after the end of the Three Kingdoms period. Early life and career Wei Guan was from Anyi County (), Hedong Commandery (), which is located west of present-day Xia County, Shanxi. His father Wei Ji () was a high-ranking Wei official and marquis, who died in 229. Wei Guan inherited his father's peerage, and when he grew older became an official. Throughout the years, he became known for his capability and was continuously promoted. After Cao Huan became emperor, he became an Official of Justice (), and was known for his strength in logical thinking. When the Wei regent Sima Zhao ordered the generals Zhong Hui and Deng Ai to attack Wei's rival state Shu Han in 263, Wei Guan served as Deng Ai's deputy. After the fall of Shu that year, Zhong Hui planned a rebellion, and the first step of his preparation was to falsely accuse Deng Ai of treason. Sima Zhao, believing Zhong Hui's accusations, ordered Deng Ai arrested, and Zhong Hui in turn ordered Wei Guan to arrest Deng Ai, hoping that Wei Guan would fail and be killed by Deng Ai so that he could further affirm his accusations against Deng Ai. Wei Guan knew this, so he surprised Deng Ai in the middle of the night and arrested him. When Zhong Hui rebelled later, Wei Guan pretended to be seriously ill, so Zhong Hui lowered his guard against Wei Guan. Later, Wei Guan participated in inciting the soldiers to start a mutiny against Zhong Hui and end the rebellion. Fearful that Deng Ai would then retaliate against him, he had Deng Ai tracked down and killed. When Du Yu publicly denounced Wei Guan, instead of becoming angry and retaliate against Du Yu, Wei Guan visited him and apologised. He also declined a larger fief that Sima Zhao was ready to bestow on him for his accomplishments. Career during the Jin dynasty In 265, Sima Zhao died and was succeeded as regent by his son Sima Yan (Emperor Wu), who later that year usurped the throne from Cao Huan, thus ending the Cao Wei state and establishing the Jin dynasty (265‚Äì420). Throughout Emperor Wu's reign, Wei Guan continued to be an important official and general, serving in a variety of roles capably. As a result, one of his brothers and one of his sons were granted marquis titles. Wei Guan attempted to implement a revised civil service system, where the civil service examiner () would have less input on grading officials, and actual job performance would become more important, but while Emperor Wu liked Wei Guan's suggestions, he did not carry them out. Wei Guan was one of the few officials who dared to openly speak to Emperor Wu about his choice of heir apparent, his son Sima Zhong, who was developmentally disabled. On one occasion, Emperor Wu, after Wei Guan hinted that Sima Zhong should not be crown prince, sent a number of inquiries to Sima Zhong to have answered. When the inquiries were appropriately answered (because Sima Zhong's wife Jia Nanfeng had someone else answer the inquiries for Sima Zhong), Emperor Wu was happy and publicly showed Wei Guan the answers, embarrassing Wei Guan greatly and making it clear to other officials that Wei Guan had said something. After Emperor Wu's death in 290, Yang Jun, the father of Empress Dowager Yang, assumed the regency for Sima Zhong, who ascended the throne as Emperor Hui. However, in 291, Yang Jun was overthrown and killed in a coup started by Empress Jia. Wei Guan was then made regent, along with Emperor Hui's granduncle Sima Liang. Wei Guan and Sima Liang tried to get the government on track, but Empress Jia continued to interfere with governmental matters. They also became concerned about the violent temper of Emperor Hui's brother Sima Wei (who was heavily involved in the coup against Yang Jun) and therefore tried to strip him of his military command, but Sima Wei persuaded Empress Jia to let him keep his military command. Sima Wei's assistants Qi Sheng () and Gongsun Hong () thereafter falsely told Empress Jia that Sima Liang and Wei Guan planned to depose the emperor. Empress Jia, who had already resented Wei Guan for having, during Emperor Wu's reign, suggested that he change his choice of heir apparent, also wanted more direct control over the government, and therefore resolved to undergo a second coup. In summer 291, Empress Jia instructed Emperor Hui to write an imperial edict to Sima Wei, ordering him to have Sima Liang and Wei Guan removed from their offices. His forces thereby surrounded Sima Liang and Wei Guan's mansions, and while both men's subordinates recommended resistance, each declined and was captured. Against what the edict said, both were killed ‚Äì Sima Liang with his heir Sima Ju () and Wei Guan with nine of his sons and grandsons. After Empress Jia, concerned about Sima Wei's power, then falsely declared that the edict was forged by Sima Wei and had him executed, Wei Guan was posthumously rehabilitated and restored to the status of a duke.

These pogo sticks have the potential for jumping over 3 meters of height. Xpogo can be seen in athlete exhibition teams, Xpogo content on sites such as YouTube, and the annual Pogopalooza: The Xpogo World Championship Series. Xpogo competitions have begun in countries outside of the USA. An Xpogo commercial was run by Nike during the London Olympics. Xpogo athletes were included in the 2014 Rose Parade in Pasadena, California. The vast majority of Xpogo athletes are male and between the ages of 10 and 25. History=Beginnings The beginnings of Xpogo are somewhat contested, but it is acknowledged among the Xpogo community that Dave Armstrong from Provo, Utah, USA was likely the first individual in the 20th century to make a conscious and consistent effort to execute tricks on a traditional steel spring pogo stick, beginning in 1999. Dave created a website, Xpogo.com, around that time to share pictures and video of his bouncing. Shortly after Armstrong, several other individuals began to independently form the idea of creating an extreme sport around pogo. Among these were Nick McClintock, Nick Ryan, Fred Grzybowski, Dan Brown, Rick Gorge, and Matt Malcolm. Each believing they had solely created a sport, the collective founders of Xpogo eventually connected via Xpogo.com. Together they shared their tricks and associated media, effectively laying the groundwork for the sport. Classic sticks An extreme pogo exhibition in 2017. From 2000 to 2004, pockets of Xpogo athletes began to emerge around the United States, and other countries such as the Netherlands, inspired by Xpogo.com. During this time there were no Xpogo sticks, only traditional steel spring sticks that could be purchased at established retailers. Each pocket of jumpers took their own names and made associated websites to help define themselves against the larger Xpogo community. These groups included Team Xpogo, Team Hyper Pogo, Pogo Cult, Rittman Pogo, Grand Theft Pogo, Say No To Park, The Pogo Squad, from York, PA. As each of these groups developed and motivated other individuals around the country to begin bouncing as well, a core group of tricks were created that served as the building blocks for all trick innovation to come. A series of grabs, stalls, spins, and wraps utilizing the two foot pegs, two handlebars, and the frame of the pogo stick became the commonly executed tricks. Simple descriptive names such as \\"One-Foot Peg Grab\\" or \\"Under The Leg Bar Spin\\" were used to describe some tricks, while others received more specialized names such as \\"Malcolm X\\" (180 no-foot peg grab) and \\"Candy Bar\\" (one leg between the handlebars while jumping). Other tricks are related to BMX and skateboarding tricks such as \\"Can-Can\\" and \\"Heel Clicker.\\" Peg Grab Prior to the advent of social media sites such as YouTube and Facebook, the majority of the communication and media sharing among extreme pogo enthusiasts occurred on Xpogo forums where, by 2004 there were 50‚Äì100 dedicated users and many more casual or ‚Äúsilent‚Äù users. Due to the continued growth of the online community and the sport as a whole, member Dan Brown decided to hold an event called Pogopalooza, where some of the top individuals in the sport could come together in person and hold a miniature competition and exposition of the sport. In the summer of 2004 Dan Brown hosted Pogopalooza 1 in a church parking lot in Nebraska where about seven members of the Xpogo community appeared. While the event was small and only attracted friends and family, it set the precedent to hold an annual event bringing together extreme pogo athletes from around the US, and subsequently in other countries. Extreme sticks 2004 was the first year \\"extreme\\" pogo sticks were available. Defined as being able to support riders of adult weights while carrying a height potential of 6+ feet, the first extreme pogo stick was the Flybar 1200, by S.B.I. Enterprises. Instead of using a traditional steel spring, the Flybar utilized giant rubber ‚Äúelastomers,‚Äù creating a bungee-like jumping sensation. The new height potential made possible by the Flybar allowed new tricks, noted most by the first full backflip on a pogo stick, by Brian ‚ÄúChewy‚Äù Call in 2005. Shortly after the release of the Flybar, a company emerged in Southern California with the ‚ÄúMotoStik‚Äù pogo, which used a dual-spring technology with MotoX-style handlebars designed for cross-training. The next extreme pogo stick, the Vurtego, was launched in 2006. This produced the greatest height of any stick to date along with the greatest durability. In 2008 the BowGo, which had been in development since 2001 at Carnegie Mellon University, entered the fray. Using a giant fiberglass bow on the front end of the pogo stick which flexed outward with downward pressure and snapped back in to produce upward momentum, the BowGo launched riders higher more consistently than any stick to date. The TK8 pogo stick, another air compressed design launched in France and Andorra around 2010. The top Xpogo US athletes worked in parallel with extreme pogo companies to help further development. Park City, Utah The combination of the release of several extreme pogo sticks, along with the associated boom in creativity made possible by 6‚Äì9 ft. height potential, the surge in information sharing potential through social media, and the continued steady growth of Xpogo.com brought a new and robust definition to the sport of Xpogo. Pogopalooza 6 and beyond By 2009, the Xpogo community had grown into the hundreds with hundreds to potentially thousands more followers and fans globally. Pogopalooza had occurred 4 additional times in 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008, increasing in scope and attendance each year.Pogopalooza Pogopalooza 6, which was held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, saw the biggest turnout of athletes yet, over 50+ from across the United States, Canada, and England and involved the whole of the City through four days of events and competition. After Pogopalooza 6, national media began to take note of extreme pogo in the biggest manner to date. The Wall Street Journal ran a front-page article on the sport and numerous other countrywide and even international publications began covering athletes, events, and the growth of Xpogo in general. With the media push, more athletes began to emerge around the country and the globe, pushing trick innovation to new levels Pogopalooza 2014 and beyond After a widely attended and covered Pogopalooza 10 in New York City in 2013, the Pogopalooza competition expanded into a multi-city international touring format for 2014. Today, the event is referred to as \\"Pogopalooza: The Xpogo World Championship Series\\" and occurs multiple times throughout the year in cities around the world. Xpogo LLC In June 2010, three of sport‚Äôs original founders, Nick Ryan, Nick McClintock, and Fred Grzybowski, formed Xpogo LLC, a company dedicated to managing the global operations of Xpogo. According to the Xpogo LLC‚Äôs mission statement, the company \\"strives to develop the sport of Xpogo through the management of competitions, strategic partnerships, merchandising and retail, talent, platforms, and content. [The] company‚Äôs ultimate goal is to grow Xpogo into a cultural staple.\\" No-Handed Backflips in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Following the founding of Xpogo LLC, the infrastructure surrounding the growing sport became more defined. Pogopalooza 7 (Salt Lake City), Pogopalooza 8 (Costa Mesa), Pogopalooza 9 (Costa Mesa), and Pogopalooza 10 (New York City) were professional grade, drawing tens of thousands of spectators in total and earning hundreds of millions of media impressions. Today, Xpogo LLC acts as the governing body for the sport, representing the top Xpogo athletes worldwide, releasing and distributing professional content, and producing competitions and clinics. Today Clovis is growing of Xpogo. The expansion of competitions, the recognition of Pro Athletes and Semi-Pro Athletes, many highly viewed commercials, music videos, and media featuring Xpogo athletes, and consistent 97‚Äì99% positive viewer ratings on popular Xpogo videos such as Xpogo Films: RISE support the claim that the sport of Xpogo is growing in global popularity.

It resulted in one of Italy's worst disasters, killing 268 people, destroying 63 buildings and demolishing eight bridges. The upper dam broke first, leading to the collapse of the lower dam. Around 180,000 cubic metres of mud, sand, and water were released into the Rio di Stava valley and toward the village of Stava at a speed of 90 km/h. Having crashed through the village, the torrent continued until it reached the Avisio River a further 4.2 km away, destroying everything in its path.  Cause  An investigation into the disaster found that the dams were poorly maintained and the margin of safe operation was very small. A pipe in the upper dam used to drain water had begun to sag under the weight of sediment, making the dam's drainage less effective. Meanwhile, water continued to be pumped into the reservoir behind the dam, which, coupled with the less efficient drainage, meant the pressure on the bank of the upper dam began to increase. Following the path of least resistance, water began penetrating the bank, causing the soil within to liquefy and weaken the bank until it failed. The water and tailings from the upper dam then flowed into the lower dam, which, under the immense pressure produced, failed thirty seconds later. In June 1992, 10 people were convicted of culpable disaster and multiple manslaughter for their roles in the accident and were all sentenced to prison.

The show aired in syndication from 1997-1998 in first-run (with re-edited repeats airing until 2000), and was hosted by Nick Spano and Valarie Rae Miller. Gameplay Three youths, ages 12‚Äì17, competed in this game, whose centerpiece was a life-sized board game spread out on the studio floor. One at a time, each contestant determined his/her moves via a \\"Magic 8 ball\\", which reveals a type of activity (a stunt or a moral-based question) and the number of spaces the contestant can move upon a correct answer or completion of said stunt. Landing on a \\"Move Ahead\\" space allowed the contestant to move ahead two more spaces. He/she had to move back two spaces upon landing on \\"Go Back\\". However, if the contestant ended up on those spaces when being assessed a penalty, he/she was not allowed to follow its instructions. Activities Four different activities were possible: * Decision ‚Äì The contestant and a \\"Peer Group\\" (a jury composed of about 10-12 teenagers in the studio audience) were read a moral dilemma-type question (e.g., \\"She's a really pretty, petite young blonde, but often wears plain white T-shirts and blue jeans to school because that's what she likes to wear. Does she turn you off because she dresses like a tomboy?\\") The contestant, without knowing how the Peer Group voted, supplied his/her answer and often gave some reasoning. If the response agreed with the consensus of the Peer Group, the contestant advanced. * Odd Job ‚Äì The player performed a stunt (such as sorting clothing by type into the appropriate laundry basket), and had to meet the goal in a time limit to move. * Temptation ‚Äì A prize is described. The contestant could take the prize and accept a two-step penalty, or pass it up and advance. If the contestant took the prize, it was theirs to keep regardless of the outcome of the game. (In at least one instance, a third-place contestant declined the Temptation prize only to find out that it was the last activity of the game and he would have finished in third place either way; the contestant was given the prize anyway.) * Fast Track ‚Äì Similar to \\"Odd Job\\", except the stunt is more difficult and always worth eight steps (e.g., preparing three banana split sundaes on a moving conveyor belt within a time limit). Even if the contestant failed, they got a two-space consolation move. After each contestant has taken a turn, the host asked a \\"Pop Quiz\\" question. Correct answers allowed that player to advance three spaces, while a wrong answer (or failing to answer) meant a three-step penalty. Bonus Round: \\"The Pressure Cooker\\" After an undefined time limit, the player making the least progress was eliminated from further play. The remaining contestants advanced to the \\"Pressure Cooker\\" round, which were yes/no dilemmas (played just like \\"Decision\\"), asked in an alternating format; the player who had made the most progress on the board had the advantage of going first. The first contestant to guess three questions correctly won the game and bonus prizes. Changes * Second run (1998‚Äì99): The complete series was edited with new graphics (as they had lost the rights to \\"Magic 8 Ball\\") and rerun with Pop-Up Video-style commentaries. The copyright date was also changed to 1998. * Third run (1999‚Äì2000): The show was renamed Pressure 2 to coincide with a new game show called Pressure 1. This run consisted of the same set of episodes, edited again with different graphics, a new logo, and the copyright date changed to 1999 in addition to the changes made in the previous season (the pop-up comments were removed). Despite these changes (along with the word \\"Peer\\" being censored every time the show's name was spoken), the old logo could still clearly be seen on the set.

They were also used for a local traffic. History SM30 locomotive is the first Polish diesel locomotive equipped with electrical transmission. A design was worked out by the Central Rolling Stock Industry Construction Bureau in Pozna≈Ñ. The prototype was constructed in Fablok, Chrzan√≥w in 1957. 909 items were built in 1957-1970, 302 of them found place in PKP, the rest worked in the industry (with designations Ls300 or SM30).Bogdan Pokropi≈Ñski, Lokomotywy spalinowe produkcji polskiej, WKi≈Å, Warsaw, 2009, , p. 69-72 The locomotive was also known under its project designation 1D or early PKP designation Lwe55 (until 1960). In the 1970s, 109 items of SM30 locomotive were modified for heating passenger wagons with 500 V electric heaters, and as a result their class designation was changed to SP30 (able to pull passenger trains). Those machines remained in regular service until the late 1980s. In 2000 all of them were again, after dismounting heating systems, returned to SM30 series. Technical data SM30 is a Bo‚Ä≤Bo‚Ä≤ locomotive, what means it runs on two bogies, each equipped with two axles. The general construction of this engine is relatively simple. Being the pioneer machine in the Polish railway industry, it incorporated many solutions from other branches of industry, i.e. the first engine to be mounted, Wola V-300, was taken from tank construction, main DC current generator was in fact stationery generator and traction motors were taken from trams. As the first Polish locomotive with diesel- electric transmission it proved the high efficiency of that solution and was quite successful. The locomotive frame is constructed of steel rolled formers. Ball stub-axles are mounted to strend girders, that make welded box construction. A power unit, composed of a diesel engine and main generator, is mounted on parallel girders. The engine is connected to main generator with an elastic clutch. Four traction motors (two on each bogie) are mounted with a tram system. Traction motors can be powered in series connection, parallel connection and parallel connection with field reduction of 40 to 60%. Traction motors are series devices with hour power. Main generator (PABOM-186a type) is a DC machine with 600 V and 367 A. Its power rating whilst working with 1500 rpm. is . During engine starting the main generator serves as electric starter, powered from the battery. For the purposes of lighting the locomotive and charging batteries an additional generator (Pw-114a type) is used. SM30 locomotives had two types of diesel engine mounted. Wola V-300 and 2DVSa-350 (from 1962) 12-cylinder engines had powers, respectively: . Neutral gear rotation is 600 rpm. and rated rev is 1500 rpm.

The name Cry Baby was from the original pedal from which it was copied, the Thomas Organ/Vox Cry Baby wah-wah, first manufactured in 1966. Thomas Organ/Vox failed to register the name as a trademark, leaving it open for Dunlop. More recently, Dunlop manufactured the Vox pedals under licence, although this is no longer the case. The said wah-wah effect was originally intended to imitate the supposed crying tone that a muted trumpet produced, but became an expressive tool in its own way. It is used when a guitarist is soloing, or to create a \\"wacka-wacka\\" funk styled rhythm. The original pedals were popularized by guitarists such as Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, and David Gilmour, though many artists have developed signature sounds with them since.

Overview Introductory subjects studied in thermal science generally are focused on thermodynamics. These include studies of properties of pure substances, pressure-volume-temperature diagrams, the ideal gas law, heat and its relationship to work, heat transfer, the laws of thermodynamics, engine and refrigeration cycles, and combustion. Another area of concern in thermal science is fluid mechanics. These include fluid statics, fluid flows, e.g. laminar flow vs. turbulent flow, the Bernoulli equation. The applicability of this area is piping networks, turbo-machineries, airfoils. Heat transfer has applications for heat exchangers, heat engines, heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning, and cooling of microelectronics. Combustion involves both thermal effects and chemical reaction. Intensive study of thermal sciences requires additional knowledge and experience in other areas such as experimental techniques and numerical or computational methods.

It was formed in 1917 and served as a training unit based in England during World War I. The squadron was disbanded in 1919 but re-formed at the start of 1939. It subsequently saw combat as a light bomber and maritime patrol squadron during World War II, and took part in the New Guinea Campaign and New Britain Campaign before being disbanded after the war. The squadron was re-raised in 1948 as the RAAF's bomber operational conversion unit. It has primarily served in this capacity since that time, though it has also maintained a secondary strike capability and was also tasked with reconnaissance duties between 1979 and 1993. No. 6 Squadron is currently based at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, and has been most recently equipped with Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornet aircraft between January 2011 and December 2016. The squadron was re-equipped with Boeing EA-18G Growlers in 2017. History=World War I No. 6 Squadron was formed at Parkhouse, England, on 15 June 1917 as a flying training unit of the Australian Flying Corps (AFC). The unit was initially designated No. 30 (Australian Training) Squadron, Royal Flying Corps and its role was to train fighter pilots for service with No. 2 Squadron of the AFC (which was designated No. 68 (Australian) Squadron RFC at the time) on the Western Front. Five of No. 6 Squadron's S.E.5 aircraft at Minchinhampton in 1917 The squadron moved to Shawbury the day after it was formed and then to Ternhill on 29 June. On 1 September it became part of the 1st Training Wing when that unit was established to command the four AFC training squadrons in England (the others being No. 5, No. 7 and No. 8 Squadrons). In January 1918 the squadron was redesignated No. 6 Squadron AFC; the other AFC units were also renamed at this time. No. 6 Squadron moved to Minchinhampton on 25 February. The squadron used several different types of aircraft to train pilots, including the Bristol Scout D, Sopwith 1¬Ω Strutter, Sopwith Pup, Avro 504, Airco DH.5, Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 and Sopwith Camel.Eather 1995, p. 15 While most of these aircraft types were outdated and suitable only for elementary flight training, the S.E.5s, Sopwith Pups and Sopwith Camels were up to date and in service with combat units in France.Eather (2007), p. 2 Like the other units of the 1st Training Wing, No. 6 Squadron continued to train pilots after the end of the war. This was undertaken to keep personnel occupied while they awaited transport back to Australia as well as to strengthen the AFC.Goodland and Vaughan 1992, pp. 74 and 107 No. 6 Squadron was disbanded in March 1919, and its personnel left Minchinhampton to return to Australia on 6 May that year.Goodland and Vaughan 1992, p. 115 World War II Gurney Field at Milne Bay during September or October 1942 On 1 January 1939 No. 4 Squadron, which was located at RAAF Station Richmond in the outskirts of Sydney and equipped with Avro Anson patrol aircraft, was redesignated No. 6 Squadron.Eather 1995, p. 32 No. 4 Squadron had been responsible for conducting reconnaissance patrols along Australia's east coast as well as undertaking training exercises with the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). These duties continued after the squadron was re- designated, and early in 1939 it gained the additional role of providing conversion training on the Anson for new pilots and air gunners.Eather (2007), p. 16 The squadron's maritime patrol activities were hindered by the limitations of its Ansons; these aircraft were obsolete and had an inadequate range and bomb load. On 28 April 1939, an Anson of No. 6 Squadron crashed near Riverstone, killing all four crew members. Following the outbreak of World War II, No. 6 Squadron escorted convoys off the Australian east coast and undertook training exercises with the Australian Army and RAN. The squadron's Ansons were replaced by twelve Mark I Lockheed Hudson light bombers during April and May 1940. These aircraft were much more capable than the Ansons, having a longer range, higher speed and greater bomb load.Eather (2007), p. 19 No. 6 Squadron continued to be based at Richmond, though detachments were made to other airstrips along the east coast when the squadron escorted troop convoys.Eather (2007), p. 20 In August 1940 the squadron conducted long range patrols searching for German raiders which were present in the Tasman Sea, but without success.RAAF Historical Section 1995, p. 15 No. 6 Squadron continued its maritime patrol tasks in the months after the outbreak of the Pacific War in December 1941. At this time the squadron comprised six aircraft based at Richmond and another four based at RAAF Station Laverton near Melbourne.Gillison 1962, pp. 237‚Äì238 In late December, eight of the squadron's Hudsons were dispatched to Malaya to make good the losses suffered by No. 1 and No. 8 Squadrons in the Malayan Campaign. No. 6 Squadron was re-equipped with longer-ranged Mark IV Hudsons by January 1942.Eather (2007), p. 22 In early January 1942 two of these aircraft were dispatched to undertake an urgent photo reconnaissance of the Japanese base at Truk in the Central Pacific on the orders of Air Vice Marshal William Bostock. One of the aircraft suffered mechanical problems after arriving at the forward airfield at Kavieng in New Ireland from where this operation was to be conducted, but the other successfully overflew Truk on 8 January; this was the longest photo reconnaissance flight undertaken by land based RAAF aircraft during World War II. On 22 January a flight of four aircraft was detached from No. 6 Squadron and transferred to the newly formed No. 32 Squadron at Port Moresby in New Guinea.Gillison 1962, p. 365 The squadron's maritime patrol role increased in importance from May 1942 when Japanese submarines began operating off the Australian east coast. On 5 June the crew of a No. 6 Squadron Hudson attacked what they believed was a submerged submarine northeast of Sydney.Eather (2007), pp. 25‚Äì26 During mid-1942 the squadron gave up its Mark IV Hudsons, and was re-equipped with Mark III models.Eather (2007), p. 27 In late August 1942, No. 6 Squadron moved to Horn Island in the Torres Strait and established a detachment of four aircraft at Gurney Field, Milne Bay in New Guinea. The Milne Bay detachment had been formed to provide reconnaissance and bomber support of the Australian garrison there, which was expected to be attacked. Japanese forces landed at Milne Bay on the night of 25/26 August, sparking the Battle of Milne Bay which ended in an Allied victory in early September. No. 6 Squadron flew reconnaissance and anti-shipping patrols from the airfields at Milne Bay throughout the battle. The squadron attacked a convoy of three Japanese destroyers and three patrol boats which were carrying reinforcement troops to Milne Bay on 29 August. While the squadron claimed to have damaged a destroyer in this operation, the Japanese force did not actually incur any damage.Bullard (2007), p. 147 Following the Allied victory at Milne Bay, No. 6 Squadron Hudsons continued to patrol the region near Milne Bay, and sank a Japanese transport ship near Woodlark Island on 26 September. The Horn Island- based elements of the squadron moved to Wards Strip near the town of Port Moresby in New Guinea on 11 October from where it conducted anti-submarine patrols alongside No. 100 Squadron. For much of November the squadron also supported the Australian Army force engaged in the Kokoda Track campaign by dropping supplies and evacuating sick soldiers. From 6 December until near the end of that month, No. 6 Squadron conducted night bombing raids of the Japanese beachhead at Buna, Sanananda and Gona; these included an attack on a destroyer off Buna. Towards the end of December the squadron was concentrated at Turnbull Field at Milne Bay from where it undertook reconnaissance and anti-submarine patrols.RAAF Historical Section 1995, p. 16 A group of No. 6 Squadron aircrew following a raid on Rabaul during November 1943 On the night of 17 January 1943, 24 Japanese aircraft attacked Turnbull Field, destroying one of No. 6 Squadron's Hudsons and damaging the remainder.Eather 1995, p. 33 While the squadron was unable to conduct any operations for several weeks after this attack, the damaged aircraft were subsequently repaired. In March No. 6 Squadron participated in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea by searching for barges and attacking lifeboats carrying survivors from the Japanese ships which had been sunk. Due to the unit's high rate of flying activities, No. 6 Squadron's Hudsons increasingly suffered from mechanical problems, and this may have contributed to a drop in the number of hours flown by the squadron from March 1943. On 20 July No. 9 Operational Group, which commanded No. 6 Squadron and other RAAF units in New Guinea, banned the squadron's Hudsons from taking part in any further combat operations due to their poor condition. It was decided at about this time to re-equip the squadron with Australian- built Bristol Beauforts. To effect this change No. 6 Squadron's Hudson crews flew their aircraft back to Australia and were replaced by new aircrews equipped with Beauforts from September. During this period the squadron's ground crew were frequently used as labourers as they did not have any aircraft to maintain.Eather (2007). pp. 65‚Äì66 After receiving its new aircraft, the squadron was tasked with anti-shipping attacks, and it and No. 100 Squadron cooperated in an attack on a Japanese convoy near Cape St. George on the night of 20 October during which a No. 6 Squadron pilot claimed to have damaged a cruiser. No. 6 Squadron also bombed Japanese positions in New Britain during October in conjunction with No. 100 Squadron. In addition to these offensive operations, the squadron regularly flew anti-submarine patrols to protect Allied shipping.Eather (2007), p. 71 In November the squadron moved to Goodenough Island and became part of No. 71 Wing RAAF alongside No. 8 and No. 100 Squadrons. From November 1943 to March 1944, No. 6 Squadron took part in attacks on the major Japanese base at Rabaul, and also struck other targets in the region to support the naval and ground forces engaged in the New Britain Campaign.RAAF Historical Section 1995, p. 17 From March the squadron mainly undertook convoy escort and anti-submarine patrols, which proved uneventful. No. 6 Squadron's operations were hampered by mechanical problems with its Beauforts, which had been issued to the unit after being reconditioned following service with other RAAF squadrons, and this problem continued until October when it received an allocation of recently built aircraft.Odgers 1968, p. 330 No. 6 Squadron next saw action in late 1944. From late October it and the other units of No. 71 Wing conducted attacks on Rabaul and other locations in New Britain to support the Australian 5th Division's Landing at Jacquinot Bay and subsequent operations on the island. Between December 1944 and January 1945, No. 6 Squadron moved to Dobodura airfield, from where it continued to support Australian Army operations in New Britain and the Aitape‚ÄìWewak area of New Guinea. There were few targets within range of Dobodura, however, and the squadron saw little combat during 1945. Despite the limited nature of the raids conducted from Dobodura, the squadron's offensive operations were hampered by a shortage of bombs.Eather (2007), p. 109 A detachment of six aircraft was deployed to Tadji between late April and 13 May to participate in attacks on Japanese positions near Wewak alongside Beauforts from No. 7, No. 8, No. 15 and No. 100 Squadrons.Odgers 1968, pp. 343‚Äì345 The squadron conducted little operational flying from late May, and in June its commander recommended in his monthly report that No. 6 Squadron be either disbanded or re-equipped and sent to a more active area. RAAF Headquarters did not respond to this proposal, and many other Australian squadrons were similarly under-employed at the time.Eather (2007), p. 112 The squadron's last combat operations were undertaken by a detachment of two Beauforts which were deployed to Biak during July; these aircraft bombed Japanese positions in the area alongside P-40 Kittyhawks operated by No. 120 (NEI) Squadron. Following the end of the war the squadron dropped leaflets to advise Japanese troops that their country had surrendered and continued to make anti-submarine patrols. In September all of the squadron's aircrew were posted to units located further from Australia and were replaced by aircrew from these squadrons. The squadron also began regular courier flights between Dobodura and Milne Bay during the month.Eather (2007), p. 113 No. 6 Squadron remained at Dobodura until 18 October 1945, when it returned to Australia and was disbanded at Kingaroy, Queensland on the 31st of the month.RAAF Historical Section 1995, p. 18 The squadron suffered 35 fatalities during World War II. Operational conversion unit A formation of nine Avro Lincoln heavy bombers from No. 2 and No. 6 Squadrons flying over RAAF Base Amberley in 1953 On 23 February 1948, No. 23 Squadron was redesignated No. 6 Squadron. The unit was based at RAAF Base Amberley in Queensland and equipped with Avro Lincoln heavy bombers. No 6 Squadron formed part of No. 82 Wing, and was primarily responsible for training aircrews to serve with the wing's two front line units; No. 1 and No. 2 Squadrons. Its training effort was increased from 1950 when No. 1 Squadron was deployed to Malaya as part of Australia's contribution to the Malayan Emergency.Eather (1995), p. 34 During October that year three of No. 6 Squadron's Lincolns were deliberately flown through the cloud which resulted from the first British atomic bomb test (Operation Hurricane) which took place in the Montebello Islands off Western Australian. These aircraft had the role of determining the level of radioactivity caused by the atomic blast, and No. 6 Squadron performed similar duties for the subsequent British atomic bomb tests at Maralinga, South Australia. Several Lincolns were so heavily contaminated with radioactivity during these flights that they could not be flown again. The squadron lost three Lincolns in one day on 8 April 1953 when one was written off after its undercarriage collapsed while landing at Amberley and a further two were destroyed when they collided on the ground at Cloncurry, Queensland; no aircrew were injured in these accidents. No. 6 Squadron's Lincolns were replaced with Canberra jet bombers in early 1955, and the unit became operational with these aircraft on 11 July. As part of the transition to the Canberra, the squadron's remaining aircrew were posted to the Lincoln Conversion Flight, which continued to support No. 1 Squadron in Malaya, and replacement aircrew were posted from No. 2 Squadron.Eather (2007), p. 127 The squadron suffered a number of accidents during the next two years in which several Canberras were damaged as a result of defects with the aircraft. No. 6 Squadron continued its training duties with the new aircraft; these included regular deployments to Darwin in the Northern Territory to participate in air defence exercises as well as training flights to Malaya and New Zealand. In early 1967 most of the squadron's personnel were transferred to No. 2 Squadron to bring that unit up to its full strength before it deployed to South Vietnam as part of Australia's commitment to the Vietnam War. From this point onwards, No. 6 Squadron was heavily engaged in training aircrew for service in South Vietnam. During the late 1960s, No. 1 and No. 6 Squadrons were scheduled to be re-equipped with General Dynamics F-111C strike aircraft from 1968. Mechanical problems with United States Air Force (USAF) F-111s caused the RAAF to postpone its acceptance of these aircraft, however, leading for a requirement for an interim aircraft to equip both squadrons.Wilson and Pittaway 2010, p. 41 McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom IIs were leased from the USAF, and No. 6 Squadron was re-equipped with these aircraft between September and October 1970. The Phantoms proved highly successful, though one was severely damaged on its first flight at Amberley when it attempted an emergency landing and the arrester cable failed. It was repaired by No. 3 Aircraft Depot. No. 6 Squadron's remaining Phantoms were handed back to the USAF on 4 October 1972 prior to the delivery of the F-111Cs.RAAF Historical Section 1995, p. 19Wilson and Pittaway 2010, p. 44 Two No. 6 Squadron F-111Cs in 2009 No. 6 Squadron's first F-111Cs arrived at Amberley on 1 June 1973, and the unit flew its first sorties with the aircraft on the 13th of the month. The squadron's main role remained that of an operational conversion unit, though it had a secondary strike role. From August 1979, No. 6 Squadron gained a photo reconnaissance role when it was issued with four aircraft which had been modified into RF-111Cs. These four aircraft were concentrated the squadron's Reconnaissance Flight, which included photo analysts as well as specialised aircrew.Eather (2007), p. 148 Training was conducted in Australia and nearby countries, and the RF-111Cs occasionally deployed to the United States to take part in exercises held there. In June 1982 No. 6 Squadron was expanded to include a Survey Flight, which undertook photo survey flights in co-operation with the Army's Royal Australian Survey Corps using a leased Learjet. The flight conducted surveys of south-eastern Australia, northern Australia, Fiji and parts of Indonesia and Malaysia until it was disbanded on 15 May 1987. In 1993 No. 6 Squadron's F-111Cs were replaced by F-111Gs which had been purchased from the USAF in 1992 to be used for training purposes. This purchase allowed Australia's F-111Cs to be used mainly for strike and reconnaissance purposes and extended the type's expected life in RAAF service. All the F-111Gs were assigned to No, 6 Squadron, and the unit's F-111C and RF-111C aircraft were transferred to No. 1 Squadron.Eather (2007), pp. 152‚Äì153 The squadron typically had seven F-111Gs operational at any point in time.Wilson and Pittaway 2010, p. 69 In 2002 the Australian Government decided to retire the F-111s in 2010 and replace them with Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II aircraft, which at the time were expected to be delivered from 2012. As a result of delays to the F-35 program, the government decided in early 2007 to re-equip both No. 1 and No. 6 Squadrons with Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornet aircraft on an interim basis.Wilson and Pittaway 2010, p. 80 No. 6 Squadron's F-111Gs were progressively retired over the next few months as they became due for major servicing, and the last aircraft of this type flew on 3 September. The final F-111 operational conversion course was completed in mid-2008, and all the remaining F-111Cs and RF-111Cs were transferred to No. 6 Squadron in November 2008 when No. 1 Squadron began the process of converting to F/A-18Fs.Wilson and Pittaway 2010, p. 81 For the next two years the squadron operated as a bomber and reconnaissance unit. No. 6 Squadron's F-111s were formally retired in a ceremony held at Amberley on 3 December 2010 and No. 1 Squadron was declared operational with its new aircraft several days later. No. 6 Squadron began to be re-equipped with F/A-18F Super Hornets from January 2011, and became operational with these aircraft on 1 March that year. The squadron's first Super Hornet operational conversion course was completed in October 2011. Electronic attack unit A No. 6 Squadron EA-18G Growler in 2017 In May 2013, the Federal government announced plans to purchase twelve Boeing EA-18G Growlers to supplement the Super Hornet fleet. No. 6 Squadron was expected to begin taking delivery of the Growlers in 2017; on 1 December 2016 its Super Hornets were transferred to No. 1 Squadron. As of 2014, the squadron was expected to achieve initial operating capability with the Growlers in June 2018 and full operating capacity in 2022. On 7 July 2017 the delivery of last of the EA-18G Growlers was completed. In January 2018 the EA-18G aircraft had their first international deployment, to the Red Flag military exercise in the United States. On 28 January EAG-18G A46-311 burst into flames on take-off, causing substantial damage. After a 9-day grounding the remaining EA-18G aircraft commenced flying again on 8 February. The damaged aircraft was later judged to be beyond economic repair, and written off. The Growler force achieved initial operating capability on 30 April 2019.

It is a special case of generalized quantifier. In classical logic, quantifier prefixes are linearly ordered such that the value of a variable ym bound by a quantifier Qm depends on the value of the variables : y1, ..., ym‚àí1 bound by quantifiers : Qy1, ..., Qym‚àí1 preceding Qm. In a logic with (finite) partially ordered quantification this is not in general the case. Branching quantification first appeared in a 1959 conference paper of Leon Henkin.Henkin, L. \\"Some Remarks on Infinitely Long Formulas\\". Infinitistic Methods: Proceedings of the Symposium on Foundations of Mathematics, Warsaw, 2‚Äì9 September 1959, Panstwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe and Pergamon Press, Warsaw, 1961, pp. 167‚Äì183. Systems of partially ordered quantification are intermediate in strength between first-order logic and second-order logic. They are being used as a basis for Hintikka's and Gabriel Sandu's independence-friendly logic. Definition and properties The simplest Henkin quantifier Q_H is :(Q_Hx_1,x_2,y_1,y_2)\\\\varphi(x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2)\\\\equiv\\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\forall x_1 \\\\, \\\\exists y_1\\\\ \\\\forall x_2 \\\\, \\\\exists y_2\\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\varphi(x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2). It (in fact every formula with a Henkin prefix, not just the simplest one) is equivalent to its second-order Skolemization, i.e. : \\\\exists f \\\\, \\\\exists g \\\\, \\\\forall x_1 \\\\forall x_2 \\\\, \\\\varphi (x_1, x_2, f(x_1), g(x_2)). It is also powerful enough to define the quantifier Q_{\\\\geq\\\\mathbb{N}} (i.e. \\"there are infinitely many\\") defined as :(Q_{\\\\geq\\\\mathbb{N}}x)\\\\varphi (x)\\\\equiv\\\\exists a(Q_Hx_1,x_2,y_1,y_2)[\\\\varphi a\\\\land (x_1=x_2 \\\\leftrightarrow y_1=y_2) \\\\land (\\\\varphi (x_1)\\\\rightarrow (\\\\varphi (y_1)\\\\land y_1 eq a))]. Several things follow from this, including the nonaxiomatizability of first-order logic with Q_H (first observed by Ehrenfeucht), and its equivalence to the \\\\Sigma_1^1-fragment of second-order logic (existential second-order logic)--the latter result published independently in 1970 by Herbert EndertonJaakko Hintikka and Gabriel Sandu, \\"Game-theoretical semantics\\", in Handbook of logic and language, ed. J. van Benthem and A. ter Meulen, Elsevier 2011 (2nd ed.) citing Enderton, H.B., 1970. Finite ordered quantifiers. Z. Math. Logik Grundlag. Math. 16, 393‚Äì397 . and W. Walkoe. citing W. Walkoe, Finite ordered quantification, Journal of Symbolic Logic 35 (1970) 535‚Äì555. The following quantifiers are also definable by Q_H. * Rescher: \\"The number of œÜs is less than or equal to the number of œàs\\" ::(Q_Lx)(\\\\varphi x,\\\\psi x)\\\\equiv \\\\operatorname{Card}({ x \\\\colon\\\\varphi x} )\\\\leq \\\\operatorname{Card}({ x \\\\colon\\\\psi x} ) \\\\equiv (Q_Hx_1x_2y_1y_2)[(x_1=x_2 \\\\leftrightarrow y_1=y_2) \\\\land (\\\\varphi x_1 \\\\rightarrow \\\\psi y_1)] * H√§rtig: \\"The œÜs are equinumerous with the œàs\\" ::(Q_Ix)(\\\\varphi x,\\\\psi x)\\\\equiv (Q_Lx)(\\\\varphi x,\\\\psi x) \\\\land (Q_Lx)(\\\\psi x,\\\\varphi x) * Chang: \\"The number of œÜs is equinumerous with the domain of the model\\" ::(Q_Cx)(\\\\varphi x)\\\\equiv (Q_Lx)(x=x,\\\\varphi x) The Henkin quantifier Q_H can itself be expressed as a type (4) Lindstr√∂m quantifier.  Relation to natural languages  Hintikka in a 1973 paper advanced the hypothesis that some sentences in natural languages are best understood in terms of branching quantifiers, for example: \\"some relative of each villager and some relative of each townsman hate each other\\" is supposed to be interpreted, according to Hintikka, as: : \\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\forall x_1 \\\\, \\\\exists y_1\\\\ \\\\forall x_2 \\\\, \\\\exists y_2\\\\end{pmatrix} [(V(x_1) \\\\wedge T(x_2)) \\\\rightarrow (R(x_1,y_1) \\\\wedge R(x_2,y_2) \\\\wedge H(y_1, y_2) \\\\wedge H(y_2, y_1))]. which is known to have no first-order logic equivalent. The idea of branching is not necessarily restricted to using the classical quantifiers as leaves. In a 1979 paper, Jon Barwise proposed variations of Hintikka sentences (as the above is sometimes called) in which the inner quantifiers are themselves generalized quantifiers, for example: \\"Most villagers and most townsmen hate each other.\\" Observing that \\\\Sigma_1^1 is not closed under negation, Barwise also proposed a practical test to determine whether natural language sentences really involve branching quantifiers, namely to test whether their natural-language negation involves universal quantification over a set variable (a \\\\Pi_1^1 sentence). Hintikka's proposal was met with skepticism by a number of logicians because some first-order sentences like the one below appear to capture well enough the natural language Hintikka sentence. : [\\\\forall x_1 \\\\, \\\\exists y_1 \\\\, \\\\forall x_2 \\\\, \\\\exists y_2\\\\, \\\\varphi (x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2)] \\\\wedge [\\\\forall x_2 \\\\, \\\\exists y_2 \\\\, \\\\forall x_1 \\\\, \\\\exists y_1\\\\, \\\\varphi (x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2)] where : \\\\varphi (x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2) denotes : (V(x_1) \\\\wedge T(x_2)) \\\\rightarrow (R(x_1,y_1) \\\\wedge R(x_2,y_2) \\\\wedge H(y_1, y_2) \\\\wedge H(y_2, y_1)) Although much purely theoretical debate followed, it wasn't until 2009 that some empirical tests with students trained in logic found that they are more likely to assign models matching the \\"bidirectional\\" first-order sentence rather than branching-quantifier sentence to several natural-language constructs derived from the Hintikka sentence. For instance students were shown undirected bipartite graphs--with squares and circles as vertices--and asked to say whether sentences like \\"more than 3 circles and more than 3 squares are connected by lines\\" were correctly describing the diagrams.

In 1991 the course ¬ªfree art¬´ was abandoned and the design degree program was transferred into the so-called \\"Cologne Model\\", which was mainly characterized by a project-oriented teaching and the abolition of traditional disciplines and semester structures. The study program in the Department of Design first time involved teaching areas such as Service Design, Design Management, Design and Gender or Ecology and Design. Since 2008 the Diploma Study Programs at TH K√∂ln ran out. New registrations are made only for the Bachelor and Master Degree Programs. In 2002, the organization was abandoned in departments as part of a high school internal reform.

The club runs a football department as well as handball, volleyball and tennis departments. The club has enjoyed tremendous success in men's volleyball, winning a total of 14 Icelandic Championships since 1974. The handball department enjoyed great success in the early 1980s, winning its major honour, the Icelandic handball cup, in 1981. Football has been played by the club from start, and is the biggest of the four departments. History The club was founded on 5 August 1949. The club was founded in a Nissen hut on the west side of Reykjav√≠k. The club drew support from local area which in the 1950s included large numbers of Nissen huts, an area that was in many ways poverty stricken. The club struggled financially for the first years. The club moved in 1969 to the east side of Reykjav√≠k to a new district that was expanding in the 1960s. The club founded a handball department in the 1950s, and was quite successful in women's handball, winning every available trophy in 1957. A volleyball department was founded in 1974 and has since become the most successful volleyball team in Iceland. The handball department faced financial difficulties in the late 1980s and was disbanded in 1989, but revived in the year 2000. From 1989 the club has also had a Tennis department. The club moved its headquarters again in 1999 to the nearby area of Laugardalur. Plans to merge the club with neighbors √Årmann did not prove successful, the two clubs now share a location but specialize in different types of sports. √ûr√≥ttur concentrate more on group sports whereas √Årmann focuses more on individual sports, except for basketball. Recent seasons in football The team played in the √örvalsdeild Karla (men's premier division) in 2005, but it was relegated to the 1. deild karla (men's second league level). They clinched promotion again after the 2007 season. In 2008 the team finished in 10th place, just above the relegation zone. √ûr√≥ttur was the first to be relegated during the 2009 season, having been sent down after playing only 19 games out of the 22. The 2010 season saw the return of former favorite player, P√°ll Einarsson, as coach. The season was an overall disappointment and the club finished in mid table in division one. In the following season, the team finished in similar position. The 2012 started off badly, but a mid season turnaround meant that the team made a challenge for promotion, but in the end came in 3rd place. After another poor start to the 2013 season P√°ll Einarsson was sacked and was replaced by Serbian Zoran Milkjoviƒá. Following the 2013 season, Zoran Milkjoviƒá left the club, and was replaced by Gregg Ryder who had previously been the assistant coach at √çBV. The Women's team got promoted to the top division in 2010, but got relegated from the Women¬¥s Premier League the year after. In 2012 the team got off to bad start but nevertheless managed to win the league and promotion to the Premier League again.

The newly established sanitation board made a series of recommendations to maintain the health of the city.p. 17 Fran√ßoise Hildesheimer They established a bureaucracy to maintain the health of Marseille. In addition to protecting the city from exterior vulnerabilities, the sanitation board sought to build a public infrastructure. The first public hospital of Marseille was also built during this time period and was given a full-sized staff of doctors and nurses. Additionally, the sanitation board was responsible for the accreditation of local doctors. Citing the vast amount of misinformation that propagates during a plague, the sanitation board sought to, at a minimum, provide citizens with a list of doctors who were believed to be credible.p. 53, Fran√ßoise Hildesheimer The sanitation board was one of the first executive bodies formed by the city of Marseille. It was staffed to support the board's increasing responsibilities. Quarantine system The Sanitation Board established a three-tiered control and quarantine system. Members of the board inspected all incoming ships and gave them one of three \\"bills of health\\". The ‚Äúbill of health‚Äù then determined the level of access to the city by the ship and its cargo. A delegation of members of the sanitation board was to greet every incoming ship. They reviewed the captain's log, which recorded every city where the ship had landed, and checked it against the sanitation board's master list of cities throughout the Mediterranean that had rumors of recent plague incidents. The delegation also inspected all the cargo, crew and passengers, looking for signs of possible disease. If the team saw signs of disease, the ship was not allowed to land at a Marseille dock. If the ship passed that first test and there were no signs of disease, but the ship's itinerary included a city with documented plague activity, the ship was sent to the second tier of quarantine, at islands outside of Marseille harbour. The criteria for the lazarets were ventilation (to drive off what was thought to be the miasma of disease), be near the sea to facilitate communication and pumping of water to clean, and to be isolated yet easily accessible.p. 361, Roger Duch√™ne et Jean Contrucci Even a clean bill of health for a ship required a minimum of 18 days' quarantine at the off-island location. During such time, the crew would be held in one of the lazarettos/lazarets that were constructed around the city. The lazarettos were also classified in relation to bills of health given to the ship and individuals. With a clean bill, a crewman went to the largest quarantine site, which was equipped with stores and was large enough to accommodate many ships and crews at a time. If crew members were believed subject to a possibility of plague, they were sent to the more isolated quarantine site, which was built on an island off the coast of the Marseille harbour. The crew and passengers were required to wait there for 50 to 60 days to see if they developed any sign of plague.p. 366, Roger Duch√™ne et Jean Contrucci Once crews served their time, they were allowed into the city in order to sell their goods and enjoy themselves prior to departure.

This great outburst of plague was the last recurrence of a pandemic of bubonic plague, following the devastating episodes which began in the early fourteenth century; the first known instance of bubonic plague in Marseille was the arrival of the Black Death in the autumn of 1347.Duchene and Contrucci (2004), Chronology. Marseille suffered from epidemics of the European Black Death in 1348 (recurring intermittently until 1361), in 1580 and 1582, and in 1649‚Äì1650. In 1720, Yersinia pestis arrived at the port of Marseille from the Levant upon the merchant ship Grand-Saint-Antoine. The vessel had departed from Sidon in Lebanon, having previously called at Smyrna, Tripoli, and plague-ridden Cyprus. A Turkish passenger was the first to be infected and soon died, followed by several crew members and the ship's surgeon. The ship was refused entry to the port of Livorno. When it arrived at Marseille, it was promptly placed under quarantine in the lazaret by the port authorities. Duch√™ne & Contrucci (2004), pp. 361‚Äì362. Due largely to Marseille's monopoly on French trade with the Levant, this important port had a large stock of imported goods in warehouses. It was also expanding its trade with other areas of the Middle East and emerging markets in the New World. Powerful city merchants wanted the silk and cotton cargo of the ship for the great medieval fair at Beaucaire and pressured authorities to lift the quarantine. The 16th-century mur de la peste (plague wall), Provence A few days later, the disease broke out in the city. Hospitals were quickly overwhelmed, and residents panicked, driving the sick from their homes and out of the city. Mass graves were dug but were quickly filled. Eventually, the number of dead overcame city public health efforts, until thousands of corpses lay scattered and in piles around the city. Attempts to stop the spread of plague included an Act of the Parlement of Aix that levied the death penalty for any communication between Marseille and the rest of Provence. To enforce this separation, a plague wall, or mur de la peste, was erected across the countryside. The wall was built of dry stone, high and thick, with guard posts set back from the wall. Remains of the wall can still be seen in different parts of the Plateau de Vaucluse. At the onset of the plague, Nicolas Roze, who had been vice-consul at a factory on the Peloponnese coast and dealt against epidemics there, proposed his services to the local authorities, the √©chevins. Strong with his experience from Greece, he was made General Commissioner for the Rive-Neuve neighbourhood. He established a quarantine by setting up checkpoints, and went as far as building gallows as a deterrence against looters. He also had five large mass graves dug out, converted La Corderie into a field hospital, and organised distribution of humanitarian supply to the population. He furthermore organised supply for the city itself. On 16 September 1720, Roze personally headed a 150-strong group of volunteers and prisoners to remove 1,200 corpses in the poor neighbourhood of the Esplanade de la Tourette. Some of the corpses were three weeks old and contemporary sources describe them as \\"hardly human in shape and set in movement by maggots\\". In half an hour, the corpses were thrown into open pits that were then filled with lime and covered with soil. Out of 1,200 volunteers and prisoners deployed to fight the plague, only three survived. Roze himself caught the disease, but survived, although chances of survival without modern medicine are between 20 and 40%. During a two-year period, 50,000 of Marseille's total population of 90,000 died. An additional 50,000 people in other areas succumbed as the plague spread north, eventually reaching Aix-en-Provence, Arles, Apt and Toulon. Estimates indicate an overall death rate of between 25 and 50% for the population in the larger area, with the city of Marseille at 40%, the area of Toulon at above 50%, and the area of Aix and Arles at 25%. After the plague subsided, the royal government strengthened the plague defenses of the port, building the waterside Lazaret d'Arenc. A double line of fifteen-foot walls ringed the whitewashed compound, pierced on the waterside to permit the offloading of cargo from lighters. Merchantmen were required to pass inspection at an island further out in the harbour, where crews and cargoes were examined.\\"La peste et les lazarets de Marseille\\"; briefly noted in Simon Schama, Landscape and Memory (1995): 245f. Recent research Bubonic plague victims in a mass grave from 1720 to 1721 in Martigues, France In 1998, an excavation of a mass grave of victims of the bubonic plague outbreak was conducted by scholars from the Universit√© de la M√©diterran√©e.Signoli, Seguy, Biraben, Dutour & Belle (2002). The excavation provided an opportunity to study more than 200 skeletons from an area in the second arrondissement in Marseille, known as the Monastery of the Observance. In addition to modern laboratory testing, archival records were studied to determine the conditions and dates surrounding the use of this mass grave. This multidisciplinary approach revealed previously unknown facts and insights concerning the epidemic of 1722. The reconstruction of the skull of one body, a 15-year-old boy, revealed the first historical evidence of an autopsy dated to the spring of 1722. The anatomic techniques used appear to be identical to those described in a surgical book dating from 1708.

By this point in the war (nearly three years in), the Union Army had pushed the Confederate Army out of several regions of the South, and some rebellious states were ready to have their governments rebuilt. Lincoln's plan established a process through which this postwar reconstruction could come about. Background A component of President Lincoln's plans for the postwar reconstruction of the South, this proclamation decreed that a state in rebellion against the U.S. federal government could be reintegrated into the Union when 10% of the 1860 vote count from that state had taken an oath of allegiance to the U.S. and pledged to abide by Emancipation. Voters could then elect delegates to draft revised state constitutions and establish new state governments. All Southerners except for high-ranking Confederate army officers and government officials would be granted a full pardon. Lincoln guaranteed Southerners that he would protect their private property, though not their slaves. By 1864, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Arkansas had established fully functioning Unionist governments. This policy was meant to shorten the war by offering a moderate peace plan. It was also intended to further his emancipation policy by insisting that the new governments abolish slavery. Reaction Congress reacted sharply to this proclamation of Lincoln's plan. Most moderate Republicans in Congress supported the president's proposal for Reconstruction because they wanted to bring a swift end to the war, but other Republicans feared that the planter aristocracy would be restored and the blacks would be forced back into slavery. Lincoln's reconstructive policy toward the South was lenient because he wanted to popularize his Emancipation Proclamation. Lincoln feared that compelling enforcement of the proclamation could lead to the defeat of the Republican Party in the election of 1864, and that popular Democrats could overturn his proclamation. The Radical Republicans opposed Lincoln's plan, as they thought it too lenient toward the South. Radical Republicans believed that Lincoln's plan for Reconstruction was not harsh enough because, from their point of view, the South was guilty of starting the war and deserved to be punished as such. Radical Republicans hoped to control the Reconstruction process, transform Southern society, disband the planter aristocracy, redistribute land, develop industry, and guarantee civil liberties for former slaves. Although the Radical Republicans were the minority party in Congress, they managed to sway many moderates in the postwar years and came to dominate Congress in later sessions. In the summer of 1864, the Radical Republicans passed a new bill to oppose the plan, known as the Wade‚ÄìDavis Bill. These radicals believed that Lincoln's plan was too lenient, and this new bill would make readmission into the Union more difficult. The Bill stated that for a state to be readmitted, the majority of the state would have to take a loyalty oath, not just ten percent. Lincoln later pocket-vetoed this new bill.

For 34 years, (1969‚Äì2004) 'The Citz' as it came to be known, was run by a trio of maverick geniuses - Giles Havergal, Philip Prowse and Robert David MacDonald. Under this triumvirate the company quickly gained fame and notoriety for its glamorous and ofttimes outrageously decadent European-style treatment of rarely performed European and English classics. New works such as Camille, Chinchilla, A Waste of Time and Webster were regularly written for the company by resident playwright, dramaturge and translator, R. D. McDonald. For many years, the Citz was proving-ground and creative home to young actors who eschewed existing English literary and mechanistic acting conventions in order to develop their own highly passionate and individualistic approach. Famous actors who started their careers there include Tim Curry, Pierce Brosnan, Gary Oldman, Rupert Everett, Sean Bean, Tim Roth, Celia Imrie and Ciar√°n Hinds. Rudic was born into a musical, theatrical family in Glasgow, Scotland. His father was a violinist, his mother a semiprofessional opera 0singer, and his aunt was the Scottish actress and broadcaster Edith Ruddick. Career Rudic began acting in amateur dramatics at an early age and working as a dresser when he was twelve years old in Jimmy Logan's Metropole Theatre in Glasgow. This early experience of the world of variety and music hall, created a deep and enduring fascination with the potential of theatre as a space for expressing the raw immediacy of human existence beyond conventional approaches to acting in text-based theatre. Intent on becoming an actor, he left school at the age of 15 and worked as an office boy at the BBC. While acting in a staff play he was chosen by director, Pharic McLaren, to play the name role in The Boy Who Wanted Peace (1969), part of the BBC's Wednesday Play series. Rudic completed three years of formal actor training at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow (1969‚Äì1972). At the same time he began performing in the physical theatre of Lindsay Kemp - mime, dancer, and teacher of singer David Bowie. Rudic likens Kemp's approach to a theatre of the heightened senses in which intuition and spontaneity within the moment of the performance play a major role. His time with Kemp was a living education in the corporeal mime of √âtienne Decroux, Marcel Marceau, and the classical Japanese theatre of Noh and Kabuki, in which time is non-linear and of the present moment. His work with Kemp in Flowers based on the novel Our Lady of the Flowers by Jean Genet and Woyzeck by George Buchner at the Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh, led to his being accepted as a member of the newly-established Citizens Theatre Company. At that time (1972) he was one of only three Scots actors to be accepted into the young group who were predominantly English. Rudic continued to work there intermittently for almost a quarter of a century until 1996. Travels in the East Throughout his years at the Citz, Rudic travelled frequently to cultures beyond Europe in order to understand more about holistic process in the oral performance tradition. In 1975, on his first visit to the Dalai Lama's refugee headquarters-in-exile in the Himalayas, he was invited by the Dalai Lama's private office to teach acting to the young refugee performers of the Tibetan Institute of Performing Arts (T.I.P.A.) who were preparing for the first Tibetan cultural tour of Europe and the Americas. IN 1978, he also experienced life as a Kathakali acting student at the leading school for Kathakali actors in Kerala, South India - the Kerala Kalamandalum. These travels and others in cultures with strong oral traditions in music, dance and storytelling (Iran, Egypt, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Morocco),contributed greatly to an understanding of his own intuitive process. In 2000, intent on developing himself as a ‚Äòstand-up‚Äô theatre artist, he was awarded a Ford Foundation Grant to travel to Egypt and observe the dying tradition of epic storytelling. As part of his research, he based himself with El Warsha Theatre Company, a group of young Egyptian actors, dancers and singers, working in downtown Cairo. Through the company he came to know the old generation of traditional performance artists such as Sayed El Dawy the improvising epic storyteller from Upper Egypt, and Hassan Khanufa, a traditional street performer and Aragoz puppeteer from Cairo, who died in 2005 at the age of 74. Recent projects In 2006, working with Scottish theatre practitioner Andrew McKinnon, he returned from Cairo to Glasgow to perform a solo improvising \\"Stand-Up Theatre\\" piece - And God Created - at his old theatre, 'The Citz'. The entertainment, improvised around a theme of autobiographical stories about acting and travel, deals with universal themes such as Time, the search for identity beyond society and culture, and the role of thought and memory in consciousness. In October 2008, he returned once again to Glasgow, this time to direct and feature in The Parade, an early work by the American playwright, Tennessee Williams. The actors were encouraged to work within the action through an ongoing use of sensory awareness. There was no fixing of character and throughout the twelve performances, the life between the text was always in a state of flux, which meant that each night was considerably different from the other. This was the European and UK premiere of the work which was played at the Glasgow Citizens Theatre in the Circle Studio. During his years in Egypt, he has continued to refine and expand his Somatic approach to consciousness in theatre in which the actor works out of a dual extemporising reality as both storyteller and story.

Established in 1942, it operated P-40 Kittyhawk fighter aircraft in the South West Pacific theatre during World War II. Following the end of hostilities it re-equipped with P-51 Mustangs and formed part of Australia's contribution to the occupation of Japan until disbanding in 1948. The squadron was re-formed in 1949 and three years later transferred to Malta, where it operated de Havilland Vampire jet fighters on garrison duty until again disbanding in 1955. It was reactivated in 1960 and operated CAC Sabre and Dassault Mirage III fighters in Australia until 1973. No. 76 Squadron was re- formed in its present incarnation in 1989 and is currently stationed at RAAF Base Williamtown, New South Wales, where it operates Hawk 127 jet training aircraft. History=Milne Bay and northern Australia No. 76 Squadron was formed at Archerfield Airport, Queensland, on 14 March 1942 as the RAAF's second squadron equipped with P-40E Kittyhawk fighters (the first being No. 75 Squadron). Led by Squadron Leader Peter Jeffrey, it moved to Weir Strip near Townsville in mid-April to continue training. During April seven of No. 76 Squadron's P-40s were ferried to Port Moresby and handed over to No. 75 Squadron, which was suffering heavy losses while defending the town from Japanese air attacks. On 1 and 13 May No. 76 Squadron Kittyhawks were scrambled to intercept Japanese aircraft near Townsville but did not make contact with the intruders. The squadron completed its training in June, by which time it had received its full complement of 24 fighters and 38 pilots.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 48 RAAF pilots, mainly from No. 76 Squadron, at Milne Bay in September 1942 The squadron deployed to the front lines of the New Guinea Campaign during July 1942. Its advance party left Townsville for its new base at Milne Bay early in the month, and the fighters departed on 19 July. No. 76 Squadron flew its first combat mission on 22 July when its new commanding officer, Squadron Leader Peter Turnbull, led a force of six Kittyhawks from Port Moresby to attack Japanese positions near Gona.RAAF Historical Section (1995), pp. 48‚Äì49 No. 75 Squadron also arrived at Milne Bay on 31 July. Conditions at Milne Bay were extremely difficult as the squadron's airfield was not finished, living and maintenance facilities were almost non-existent and high rainfall meant that any aircraft which ran off the runways and taxiways became bogged in mud. No. 76 Squadron aircraft intercepted Japanese raids on Milne Bay on 4 and 11 August.Eather (1995), p. 86 Keith \\"Bluey\\" Truscott, CO of 76 Squadron, taxiing along Marston Matting at Milne Bay in September 1942 During late August and early September No. 75 and No. 76 Squadrons were involved in the Battle of Milne Bay. On 25 August No. 76 Squadron aircraft bombed a Japanese naval convoy which was approaching the area. While this attack damaged several ships, the force continued on and landed troops at Milne Bay on the night of 25/26 August. From dawn the next day the two Kittyhawk squadrons were heavily engaged with attacking Japanese positions and intercepting Japanese air raids on the area. On 28 August the Kittyhawks were withdrawn to Port Moresby when the Japanese troops came close to their airstrips, but they returned to Milne Bay the next day. No. 75 and No. 76 Squadrons supported the Allied counter-offensive at Milne Bay which ended with the remaining Japanese troops being evacuated in early September. The squadron flew 220 sorties between 26 and 5 September but suffered a heavy blow when Squadron Leader Turnbull was shot down and killed on 27 August. Turnbull was replaced by Squadron Leader Keith Truscott that day.Eather (1995), pp. 86‚Äì87RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 49 Following the battle Lieutenant General Sydney Rowell, the commander of New Guinea Force, stated that the attacks made by the two squadrons on the day of the Japanese landing were \\"the decisive factor\\" in the Allied victory.Gillison (1962), p. 617 No. 76 Squadron was relieved by two United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) squadrons on 21 September and began moving to the Darwin area of northern Australia the next day. No. 76 Squadron completed its movement to Strauss Airfield south of Darwin in early October and became part of the force responsible for defending the area against Japanese air raids on military facilities and Allied shipping.Eather (1995), p. 87 It conducted relatively little flying during October due to shortages of equipment and a high sickness rate from malaria, however. The squadron's flying effort increased in November and December and in January 1943 it was scrambled to intercept several Japanese raids. During one of these attacks Squadron Leader Truscott shot down a Japanese Mitsubishi G4M \\"Betty\\" bomber on 21 January. The Supermarine Spitfire-equipped No. 1 Wing RAAF began to arrive in the Darwin area in January and at the end of the month No. 76 Squadron was transferred to Onslow, Western Australia.RAAF Historical Section (1995), pp. 49‚Äì50 The ship carrying the squadron's personnel and equipment arrived at Onslow on 5 February and were unloaded the next day, but on the 12th of the month the squadron moved the nearby \\"Potshot\\" airfield as there was insufficient water at Onslow to supply the unit. No. 76 Squadron conducted patrols from Potshot and Onslow during March and April to protect the United States Navy facility in the area, though these were marred by Squadron Leader Truscott's death in a flying accident on 28 March. On 27 April the squadron received orders to move to Bankstown Airport in Sydney to be reequipped with more advanced P-40M Kittyhawks.RAAF Historical Section (1995), pp. 50‚Äì51 It was relieved at Potshot by a flight of CAC Boomerang fighters from No. 85 Squadron.Odgers (1968), p. 158 Offensive operations The squadron took delivery of 24 P-40Ms on 8 May and after a period of training was deployed to Goodenough Island in late June 1943, where it became part of No. 73 Wing.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 51 This wing formed part of No. 9 Operational Group, which was a mobile formation tasked with supporting Allied offensives in New Guinea and nearby islands.Odgers (1968), p. 33 As a result, No. 76 Squadron was continuously in action until the end of the war and was mainly employed in fighter sweeps and ground attack missions as few Japanese aircraft were encountered. No. 73 Wing moved to Kiriwina between August and early September, and the squadron became operational there on 10 September.Odgers (1968), p. 69 No. 76 Squadron took part in attacks on the airfield at Gasmata between September and December and on 15 December was part of the force which provided air cover for the United States Army landing at Arawe on the south coast of New Britain. The squadron's activities during December were so intensive that it had to reduce its training program.Odgers (1968), pp. 82, 126‚Äì127 A No. 76 Squadron P-40 Kittyhawk undergoing maintenance at Kiriwina in January 1944 No. 76 Squadron continued to support Allied operations around New Guinea during 1944. On 17 January it took part in an attack on a Japanese camp near Lindenhafen, New Britain which involved 73 aircraft and was the largest RAAF operation to that point in the war.Odgers (1968), p. 130 Several weeks later, No. 73 Wing, which at the time comprised the Kittyhawk-equipped No. 76 and No. 77 Squadrons as well as the Spitfire-equipped No. 79 Squadron, was selected to garrison the Admiralty Islands for 90 days after they were captured in the Admiralty Islands campaign. US Army troops from the 1st Cavalry Division began landing on these islands on 29 February and No. 76 Squadron arrived there on 9 March. The squadron subsequently provided fighter cover and close air support for the Allied forces in the area alongside the rest of No. 73 Wing.Odgers (1968), pp. 170‚Äì177 There was no need for fighter protection of this area by August and No. 76 Squadron was transferred to No. 81 Wing, which also comprised No. 77 and No. 82 Squadrons and was part of No. 10 Group. No. 76 and No. 77 Squadrons completed their movement to Noemfoor on 13 September where they were concentrated with the rest of the wing.Odgers (1968), p. 249 From mid October No. 10 Group attacked Japanese positions in western New Guinea and the eastern islands of the Netherlands East Indies (NEI) to support the United States landing at Leyte in the Philippines. No. 81 Wing concentrated on New Guinea while No. 78 Wing's three Kittyhawk-equipped squadrons struck targets in the other islands.Odgers (1968), pp. 302‚Äì304, 307 On 25 November, No. 10 Group was renamed the First Tactical Air Force (1TAF).Odgers (1968), pp. 298‚Äì299 The squadron remained at Noemfoor until April 1945 when it moved forward to Morotai in the NEI ahead of participating in the Australian-led Borneo Campaign.Eather (1995), pp. 87, 89 In mid-May it moved again to Sanga Sanga airfield in the Sulu Archipelago to provide fighter cover over the island of Tarakan, where Australian troops had landed on 1 May. The squadron flew patrols over Tarakan every day, weather permitting, until the end of the month. No. 76 Squadron also struck Sandakan and Kudat on the north coast of Borneo on several occasions, including a particularly successful attack against Sandakan on 27 May which was made in cooperation with United States Navy PT boats.Odgers (1968), p. 459 The squadron's aircraft returned to Morotai on 13 June to free up space at Sanga Sanga for USAAF P-38 Lightnings, but on 17 June they began to move to the island of Labuan to support Australian forces engaged in the Battle of North Borneo.Odgers (1968), pp. 471‚Äì472 The rest of No. 81 Wing, which had been reinforced with the Spitfire- equipped No. 457 Squadron, was subsequently concentrated at Labuan and operated over Borneo until the end of the war in August. No. 76 Squadron's last mission of the war was flown on 14 August, one day before the Japanese surrender.Odgers (1968), pp. 472‚Äì474 The squadron suffered 22 fatalities during the war. Cold War A group of pilots from No. 76 Squadron with a Mustang fighter in Japan, July 1947 Following the end of the war No. 81 Wing was selected to form the main body of the RAAF's contribution to the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) in Japan.Odgers (1968), p. 496 During August and September 1945 personnel who had not volunteered for this duty left No. 76 Squadron and it was re-equipped with P-51 Mustang fighters.RAAF Historical Section (1995), pp. 51‚Äì52 The wing's ground party left Labuan by sea on 11 February 1946 and No. 76 Squadron became the first BCOF squadron to arrive in Japan on 9 March when it landed at Iwakuni. The squadron moved to No. 81 Wing's permanent base at Bofu two days later. During the occupation of Japan No. 81 Wing flew uneventful surveillance patrols over BCOF's sector of the country.Odgers (1968), p. 497Eather (1995), p. 88 In February 1948 No. 76 Squadron moved to Iwakuni where it was disbanded on 29 October 1948 as part of a reduction in the RAAF strength in Japan. No. 76 Squadron was re-formed at RAAF Base Williamtown on 24 January 1949. The squadron was again equipped with Mustangs, but a shortage of personnel and aircraft meant that it was unable to operate effectively until mid-1950. The Mustangs were replaced with de Havilland Vampire jet fighters in either late 1951 or early 1952.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 52 In March 1952 the Australian Government decided to re-form No. 78 Wing and deploy it to Malta where it would form part of a British force which sought to counter Soviet-influence in the Middle East. No. 75 and No. 76 Squadrons were selected to form the wing's flying units, and they arrived at RAF Hal Far in Malta during July 1952 and were equipped with Vampires leased from the Royal Air Force (RAF). While based at Malta the wing took part in numerous training exercises in the Mediterranean region as well as Europe, including a large-scale NATO exercise in 1953 which involved 2,000 aircraft and 40,000 personnel. In addition, the wing participated in a royal review to commemorate the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. No. 78 Wing moved to the RAF station at Ta' Qali in June 1953 where it remained until it returned to Australia in late December 1954.Stephens (2006), pp. 221‚Äì223 No. 76 Squadron arrived back at Williamtown in February 1955 and was disbanded on 16 March that year. The squadron was re- established at Williamtown on 11 January 1960. It was initially equipped with Vampires, but received more modern CAC Sabres in May 1961. The squadron later formed two aerobatic teams called the Red Diamonds and Black Panthers which took part in air shows and other public events. No. 76 Squadron was re- equipped again with Mirage III fighters in either 1966 or 1968. In 1968 the squadron made a deployment to Darwin to bolster the town's air defences. It continued to use its Mirage IIIs for air defence and ground attack roles until the squadron was disbanded on 24 August 1973 as part of a reduction in the size of the RAAF following Australia's withdrawal from the Vietnam War. Current role A No. 76 Squadron Hawk 127 in 2007 On 1 January 1989 No. 76 Squadron was formed again at Williamtown as a training unit equipped with Aermacchi MB-326 jets and CAC Winjeel forward air control aircraft. The Aermacchi MB-326s were used to provide jet aircraft training for pilots who had been selected to fly F/A-18 Hornet or F-111 aircraft as well as to support Army and Royal Australian Navy exercises. The Winjeels were used for forward air control tasks and had previously been operated by No. 4 Forward Air Control Flight before becoming 'C' Flight of No. 76 Squadron upon its formation.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 144 In 1995 the Winjeels were replaced with modified Pilatus PC-9 trainers. The squadron's forward air control function and aircraft were transferred to the Forward Air Control Development Unit in 2002. No. 76 Squadron currently forms part of No. 78 Wing and remains at Williamtown. It began to be re-equipped with Hawk 127 jets in October 2000 and had 18 of these aircraft in 2010.Holmes (2005), p. 47Sadler (2006), p. 68 The squadron is organised into two flights. Training Flight provides introductory fighter training to pilots who have been trained to operate jet aircraft by No. 79 Squadron. After completing this course the pilots are posted to either No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit to be converted to F/A-18A aircraft or No. 6 Squadron to learn to fly F/A-18F Super Hornets. Operations Flight provides close air support training for the Army and fleet support training for the Navy.Sadler (2006), p. 70 A program to modernise all of the RAAF's Hawks to a similar standard to the Royal Air Force's Hawk T.2 aircraft began in 2014, and No. 76 Squadron is scheduled to receive the first upgraded aircraft. It is planned that the squadron will begin delivering training courses using these modernised aircraft by early 2017.Pittaway (2014), pp. 66‚Äì67 NotesReferences   * * 76 Category:Military units and formations established in 1942 ","title":"No. 76 Squadron RAAF"},{"id":"3573985","text":"Helen Crummy MBE (10 May 1920 ‚Äì 11 July 2011) was a founder of The Craigmillar Festival Society, and served as the Organising Secretary for the group until 1985.

It was performed at the Angevin Court in Naples around this time. Plot and music The story is a dramatization of a traditional genre of medieval French song, the pastourelle. This genre typically tells of an encounter between a knight and a shepherdess, frequently named Marion. Adam de la Halle's version of the story places a greater emphasis on the activities of Marion, her lover Robin and their friends after she resists the knight's advances. It consists of dialogue in the old Picard dialect of de la Halle's home town, Arras, interspersed with short refrains or songs in a style which might be considered popular. The melodies to which these are set have the character of folk music, and seem more spontaneous than the author's more elaborate songs and motets. Two of these melodies in fact appear in the motets, Mout me fu gries de departir/Robin m'aime, Robin m'a/Portare and En mai, quant rosier sont flouri/L'autre jour, par un matin/He, resvelle toi Robin. The attribution of these motets to Adam de la Halle is unconfirmed. History Adam de la Halle wrote the Jeu de Robin et Marion for the Angevin Court of Charles I of Naples. He originally went to Naples in the service of Robert II of Artois. The play was first performed there and it has been suggested that the choice of genre was particularly poignant for those members of the court homesick for France. Although it is tempting to link the characters of French medieval pastourelle and Le Jeu de Robin et Marion with the early history of Robin Hood and Maid Marian, there has been no link proved between the two. The function of these characters within their respective societies was similar: to offer a form of escapism through the imagination into a world of innocent rustic play or heroic greenwood bravery. An adaptation by Julien Tiersot was performed at Arras in 1896 at a festival in honour of Adam de la Halle, by a company from the Paris Opera Comique.

Warren Nutter (March 10, 1923 ‚Äì January 15, 1979) was an American economist, who was known primarily for his work on political economy, industrial concentration, price theory, and Soviet economic history and for cofounding the \\"Virginia school of political economy.\\" Biography Nutter was born in Topeka, Kansas, on March 10, 1923, under the name Gilbert Warren Nutter.https://www.anb.org/view/10.1093/anb/9780198606697.001.0001/anb-9780198606697-e-1401017 He is usually formally referred to as G. Warren Nutter and often casually referred to as Warren or Warren Nutter, because he preferred to be addressed by his middle name. Warren eventually settled in Chicago, Illinois. His education at the University of Chicago was interrupted by service in the US Army infantry in the European Theatre in World War II. He earned the Bronze Star with oak leaf cluster (which means that he received the Bronze Star twice) and the Combat Infantryman Badge. After serving in US Army intelligence after the fall of Nazi Germany, he returned to finish his studies at the University of Chicago, earning his B.A. (1946), M.A. (1948), and Ph.D. (1949) in economics, which he had studied with Milton Friedman and Frank Knight. While finishing his Ph.D. at Chicago, he lectured in economics and German at Lawrence College (now Lawrence University) in Appleton, Wisconsin. He later was an associate professor of economics at Yale University (1950‚Äì1956) and professor of economics at the University of Virginia (1956‚Äì1979). He died after a prolonged bout with colon and liver cancer. Nutter's academic career was twice more interrupted by public service. First, in 1951, during the Korean War, he was called to duty from the U.S. Army Reserves. He served in the Central Intelligence Agency. From 1969 to 1973, he served as assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs during the first administration of President Richard Nixon. Academic contributions Nutter made significant contributions to both technical and political-economic literature. His areas of research interest and contribution included industrial concentration, Soviet economic history, price theory and political economy. He was also active in academic exchange between the East and West blocs during the Cold War. His doctoral dissertation published in 1949, and later reworked and republished as Enterprise Monopoly In The United States: 1899-1958 (1969, Columbia University Press) authored with Henry Einhorn, attacked the prevailing notion that US industry trended toward increased concentration except when government regulation intervened to prevent concentration. Nutter's work showed that on the contrary, government intervention over the long run can tend to increase, rather than lessen, industrial concentration. From 1956 to 1961, under the sponsorship of the National Bureau of Economic Research, Nutter undertook a massive study of the history of the economy of the Soviet Union culminating in the publication of The Growth of Industrial Production in the Soviet Union, 1962, Princeton University Press. His extensively documented study attempted to correct the widely held view that Soviet industrial production had grown at a pace much greater than that of Western economies. The study concluded that Soviet economic growth over the first half of the 20th century was indeed remarkable and that there had been periods of growth spurts which, taken out of historical context, might suggest that the Soviet Union would eventually overtake the United States in economic capacity. However, when the entire Soviet period was taken into consideration, Soviet growth lagged behind Western economies and Soviet economic capacity showed every sign of falling further behind rather than catching up with the West. At the time of its publication, the study's conclusions were not highly regarded by many Sovietologists, who held that Soviet growth rates were much higher than those represented by the study. In the intervening years, as the fall of the Soviet Union revealed more realistic data, Nutter's estimates of Soviet growth rates have been vindicated; in fact, Nutter overstated rather than understated Soviet economic performance. He and James M. Buchanan are credited with founding the Thomas Jefferson Center for Political Economy whose objective was to focus on the study of political economy: not only the technical aspects of economics but also of the philosophical foundations of social organization and economic activity. The Center sponsored and funded a wide array of academic studies and interaction aimed at better understanding the role of the fundamental ideas of Western civilization as the foundation for free societies and economies. During the late 1950s and 1960s, Nutter and Buchanan together worked to build within the Economics Department of the University of Virginia, the so-called Virginia school of political economy. The department attracted a number of prominent academics including Ronald Coase, Gordon Tullock, Alexandre Kafka, George Stigler, and Leland B. Yeager. Nutter died of cancer on January 15, 1979 at his home in Charlottesville.https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1979/01/17/g-warren- nutter-dies/1c436d28-375e-489c-b759-f6e08d8ba310/ Category:1923 births Category:1979 deaths Category:United States Army soldiers Category:American army personnel of World War II Category:Lawrence University faculty Category:People from Topeka, Kansas Category:20th-century American economists Category:United States Assistant Secretaries of Defense Category:Economists from Kansas ","title":"G.

In 2010, he won the Grammy Award for Best New Age Album. He has performed and recorded with Bobby McFerrin and Spyro Gyra and has released several solo albums. Music career Darling was born in Elkhart, Indiana. He was interested in music from an early age, beginning piano when he was four, cello at ten, and string bass in high school. He studied classical cello at Indiana State University and after graduating remained there another four years as a teacher. He worked as a studio musician in Nashville, Tennessee and was a member of the Paul Winter Consort until 1978. During the following year, he formed the chamber jazz group Gallery with Ralph Towner and released his first solo album. Darling's performance and composition draw on a wide range of styles, including classical, jazz, Brazilian, African, and Indian music. He has written and performed music for more than a dozen major motion pictures, the horror film Child's Play (1988), Heat (1995), and Until the End of the World (1991). He contributed music to Nouvelle Vague (1990), √âloge de l'amour (2001), and Notre musique (2004). In 2000, he recorded an unusual collaboration with the Wulu Bunun, a group of Taiwanese aborigines. In 2007 he recorded The Darling Conversations, with Julie Weber discussing his music philosophy. It was issued by Manifest Spirit Records. In January 2009, Darling released the Grammy winning, Prayer for Compassion, a follow-on to his earlier 8-String Religion. Other activities In 1986, Darling joined Young Audiences, an organization that seeks to educate children about music and the arts through school programs. In the same year, he founded Music for People, which seeks to encourage self-expression through musical improvisation. His teaching methods are the subject of a book, Return to Child (2008). In May 2008, he became part of a collaboration of music teacher and performers offering a training program in holistic and intercultural approaches to healing with sound and music at the New York Open Center Sound and Music School.

Works in this form can be of any media and are characterized by interaction or dialogue with the community. Professional artists may collaborate with communities which may not normally engage in the arts. The term was defined in the late 1960s as the practice grew in the United States, Canada, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Australia. In Scandinavia, the term \\"community art\\" more often refers to contemporary art projects. Community art is a community-oriented, grassroots approach, often useful in economically depressed areas. When local community members come together to express concerns or issues through this artistic practice, professional artists or actors may be involved. This artistic practice can act as a catalyst to trigger events or changes within a community or at a national or international level. In English-speaking countries, community art is often seen as the work of community arts centers, where visual arts (fine art, video, new media art), music, and theater are common media. Many arts organizations in the United Kingdom do community-based work, which typically involves developing participation by non-professional members of local communities.  Community art and public art  The term \\"community art\\" may also apply to public art efforts when, in addition to the collaborative community artistic process, the resulting product is intended as public art and installed in public space. Popular community art approaches to public art can include environmental sustainability themes associated with urban revitalization projects.  Forms of collaborative practices  Models of community-engaged arts can vary with three forms of collaborative practices emerging from among the sets of common practices. In the artist-driven model, artists are seen as the catalysts for social change through the social commentary addressed in their works. A muralist whose work elicits and sustains political dialogue would be a practitioner of this model. In the second model, artists engage with community groups to facilitate specialized forms of art creation, often with the goal of presenting the work in a public forum to promote awareness and to further discourse within a larger community. In the process-driven or dialogic model, artists may engage with a group to facilitate an artistic process that addresses particular concerns specific to the group. The use of an artistic process (such as dance or social circus) for problem-solving, therapeutic, group-empowerment or strategic planning purposes may result in artistic works that are not intended for public presentation. In the second and third models, the individuals who collaborate on the artistic creation may not define themselves as artists but are considered practitioners of an art-making process that produces social change. Due to its roots in social justice and collaborative, community-based nature, art for social change may be considered a form of cultural democracy. Often, the processes (or the works produced by these processes) intend to create or promote spaces for participatory public dialogue. In Canada, the field of community-engaged arts has recently seen broader use of art for social change practices by non- arts change organizations. The resultant partnerships have enabled these collaborative communities to address systemic issues in health, education, as well as empowerment for indigenous, immigrant, LGBT and youth communities. A similar social innovation trend has appeared where business development associations have engaged with artists/artistic organizations to co-produce cultural festivals or events that address social concerns. As the field diversifies and practices are adopted by various organizations from multiple disciplines, ethics and safety have become a concern to practitioners. As a result, opportunities for cross-disciplinary training in art for social change practices have grown within the related field of arts education.  Online community art  A community can be seen in many ways, it can refer to different kind of groups. There are also virtual communities or online communities. Internet art has many different forms, but often there is some kind of community that is created for a project or it is an effect of an art project. Community theatre Community theatre includes theatre made by, with, and for a community‚Äîit may refer to theatre that is made almost by a community with no outside help, or to a collaboration between community members and professional theatre artists, or to performance made entirely by professionals that is addressed to a particular community. Community theatres range in size from small groups led by single individuals that perform in borrowed spaces to large permanent companies with well-equipped facilities of their own. Many community theatres are successful, non-profit businesses with a large active membership and, often, a full-time professional staff. Community theatre is often devised and may draw on popular theatrical forms, such as carnival, circus, and parades, as well as performance modes from commercial theatre. Community theatre is understood to contribute to the social capital of a community, insofar as it develops the skills, community spirit, and artistic sensibilities of those who participate, whether as producers or audience-members.  Community-engaged dance  Community-engaged dance includes dance made by, with, and for a community. There are several models for creating community-engaged dance, primarily concerned with participatory art practices and cooperative values.Cynde Chwelos & Maria Lopes, (April 2016), Langara College, Applied Research https://langara.ca/departments/recreation/research/documents/2016-Leading- from-Beside-research-paper-by-Chwelos-and-Lopes.sm.pdf Community-engaged dance generally focuses on exploration, creation and relationship building rather than technical skills development. Like community theatre, community-engaged dance is understood to contribute to the social capital of a community, insofar as it develops the skills, community spirit, and artistic sensibilities of those who participate, whether as producers or audience- members.

Nomenclature A variety of overlapping terms exist for these forms of Christianity: African-initiated churches, African independent churches, African indigenous churches, and African-instituted churches. The abbreviation AIC covers them all. The differences in names correspond to the aspect that a researcher wishes to emphasise. For instance, those who wish to point out that AICs exhibit African cultural forms, describe them as indigenous. These terms have largely been imposed upon such groups and may not be the way they would describe themselves. The term African refers to the fact that these Christian groupings formed in Africa, but AICs differ from one another. Not all African cultural systems are the same. Regional variations occur among West, East, and Southern Africans, and the AICs will reflect these. AICs can now be found outside Africa. Location African-initiated churches are found across Africa; they are particularly well-documented in southern Africa and West Africa. Pauw suggests that at least 36 per cent of the population of Africa belong to an African-initiated church. Origins During the colonial era starting in the 1800s, when European powers took control of most of the African continent, black converts to Christianity were unable fully to reconcile their beliefs with the teachings of their church leaders, and split from their parent churches. The reasons for these splits were usually either: *Political ‚Äì an effort to escape white control *Historical ‚Äì many of the parent churches, particularly those from a Protestant tradition, had themselves emerged from a process of schism and synthesis *Cultural ‚Äì the result of trying to accommodate Christian belief within an African world view Some scholars argue that independent churches or religious movements demonstrate syncretism or partial integration between aspects of Christian belief and African traditional religion. Often these churches have resulted from a process of acculturation between traditional African beliefs and Protestant Christianity, and have split from their parent churches. Bengt Sundkler, one of the most prominent pioneers of research on African independent churches in South Africa, initially argued that AICs were bridges back to a pre-industrial culture. Later, he recognized instead that AICs helped their affiliates to adapt to a modernizing world that was hostile to their cultural beliefs. Classification and taxonomy There are thousands of African-initiated churches (more than 10,000 in South Africa alone) and each one has its own characteristics. Ecclesiologists, missiologists, sociologists and others have tried to group them according to common characteristics, though disagreements have arisen about which characteristics are most significant, and which taxonomy is most accurate. Though it is possible to distinguish groups of denominations with common features, there is also much overlap, with some denominations sharing the characteristics of two or more groups. Many AICs share traditions with Christians from other parts of the Christian world, and these can also be used in classifying them. So there are AICs which share some beliefs or practices with Anglican, Methodist, Roman Catholic, Pentecostal, and Orthodox traditions. Some are Sabbatarian, some are Zionist, and so on. Ethiopian churches Ethiopian churches generally retain the Christian doctrines of their mother church in an unreformed state. Ethiopian African-initiated churches, which are recently formed Protestant congregations, mostly in southern Africa, arose from the Ethiopian movement of the late nineteenth century, which taught that African Christian churches should be under the control of black people. They should not be confused with the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church or Coptic Orthodox Church, which have a much longer and an utterly distinct doctrinal history. Some denominations that arose from the Ethiopian movement have united with these earlier denominations. Zionist churches Zionist Churches such as the Zion Christian Church, trace their origins to the Christian Catholic Apostolic Church in Zion, founded by John Alexander Dowie, with its headquarters at Zion, Illinois, in the United States. (It is now called Christ Community Church). Zionist Churches are found chiefly in Southern Africa. In the early 1900s, Zionist missionaries went to South Africa from the United States and established congregations. They emphasised divine healing, abstention from pork, and the wearing of white robes. The Zionist missionaries were followed by Pentecostal ones, whose teaching was concentrated on spiritual gifts and baptism with the Holy Spirit, with glossolalia as the initial evidence of this. The predominantly white Apostolic Faith Mission of South Africa arose out of this missionary effort and emphasises the Pentecostal teaching. The black Zionists retained much of the original Zionist tradition. The Zionists split into several different denominations, although the reason for this was more the rapid growth of the movement than divisions. A split in the Zionist movement in the US meant that after 1908 few missionaries came to southern Africa. The movement in southern Africa and its growth has been the result of black leadership and initiative. As time passed some Zionist groups began to mix aspects of traditional African beliefs, such as veneration of the dead, with Christian doctrine. Many Zionists stress faith healing and revelation, and in many congregations the leader is viewed as a prophet. Messianic churches Some AICs with strong leadership have been described by some researchers as Messianic, but opinions also changed. The churches that have been called \\"Messianic\\" focus on the power and sanctity of their leaders; often the leaders are thought by their followers to possess Jesus-like characteristics. Denominations described as Messianic include Kimbanguism in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; the Nazareth Baptist Church of Isaiah Shembe in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa; and the Zion Christian Church of Engenas Lekganyane with headquarters in Limpopo, South Africa, and the Ibandla Lenkosi Apostolic Church in Zion of South Africa and Swaziland. Aladura Pentecostal churches The Aladura Pentecostal churches originated in Nigeria. They rely on the power of prayer and in all effects of the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Today such churches include Christ Apostolic Church, Cherubim and Seraphim movement, Celestial Church of Christ and Church of the Lord (Aladura). The first Aladura Movement was started in 1918 at Ijebu Ode, now in Ogun State, Nigeria, by Sophia Odunlami and Joseph Sadare, respectively a school teacher and a goldsmith. They both attended St. Saviour's Anglican Church. They rejected infant baptism and all forms of medicine, whether western or traditional. In consequence, they initiated the \\"Prayer Band\\", popularly called Egbe Aladura. Joseph Sadare was compelled to give up his post in the Synod and others were forced to resign their jobs and to withdraw their children from the Anglican School. The Aladura began as a renewal movement in search of true spirituality. A revival took place during the 1918 flu pandemic. The group used prayer to save many lives affected by the influenza epidemic. This consolidated the formation of the prayer group and the group was named Precious Stone and later the Diamond Society. By 1920, the Diamond Society had grown tremendously and had started to form branches around the Western region of Nigeria. In particular, David Odubanjo went to start the Lagos branch. The group emphasised divine healing, Holiness, and All Sufficiency of God, which form the three cardinal beliefs of the Church today. For this reason, the group had association with Faith Tabernacle of Philadelphia and changed its name to Faith Tabernacle of Nigeria. The Great Revival in Nigeria started in 1930 where the Leaders of the Cherubim & Seraphim, The Church of the Lord (Aladura) and the Faith Tabernacle played important roles. Adherents believe that these leaders ‚Äì Joseph Sadare of \\"Egbe Aladura\\", David Odubanjo of \\"Diamond Society\\", Moses Orimolade of \\"Cherubim & Seraphim\\", and Josiah Ositelu of \\"The Church of the Lord (Aladura)\\" performed several miracles. The revival started in Ibadan in the South-West of Nigeria and later spread to other parts of the country. The Revival group went through several name changes until, after 24 years of its formation, it finally adopted the name Christ Apostolic Church (CAC) in 1942. Today, CAC has spread worldwide and is the precursor of Aladura Pentecostal Churches in Nigeria. The Church has established several educational establishments at all levels, including Joseph Ayo Babalola University and a series of schools .

The channel was operated by Buckeye Cablesystem, and was originally exclusive to its subscribers, but expanded to other northwestern Ohio cable providers such as Time Warner Cable and Comcast. It was carried on channel 5 on Buckeye CableSystem and various other channel positions on Time Warner Cable and Comcast. It existed in several forms from the launch of Buckeye as \\"The CableSystem\\" in 1971, first as a traditional public access station, and then in 1989 becoming a traditional independent station which aired programming traditionally aired in syndication by broadcast stations. In 1995, the channel became an affiliate of The WB under the name Toledo's WB 5, using a logo with the fictitious call letters WT05. Following its merger with UPN, the channel joined The CW. Despite being a cable-only affiliate of The CW, the station never was part of The CW Plus and had been independently programmed by Block Communications and Buckeye with syndicated programming and films outside of network hours. In September 2014, WTVG acquired Toledo 5's program inventory and CW affiliation from Buckeye, and moved it to its second digital subchannel, allowing a local over-the-air affiliate for the network. History The channel began broadcasting on August 7, 1989 as \\"ToledoVision 5\\", which initialized to \\"TV5\\" in local program listings. The channel originally aired on Buckeye Cablesystem's channel 5A, when the cable provider transmitted its cable channels over a dual-coaxial cable system divided into \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" sides. At the time of the channel's sign-on, ToledoVision 5 broadcast its programming daily from 5 p.m. to 12 a.m., with Travel Channel broadcasting over the channel space at other times. Notably, the channel's launch undercut an attempt by W48AP to become the market's second independent outlet upon its launch, as with Buckeye's backing, most of the syndicated programming not taken by WUPW ended up with ToledoVision 5, along with a prime channel slot compared to W48AP's 29B slot and a refusal by Block Communications, which owned both The CableSystem and The Toledo Blade, to carry W48AP's listings outside of paid advertising. W48AP would end up carrying low-tier satellite networks by 1990, not coming back to any prominence until 1995. The station also aired rebroadcasts of newscasts from ABC affiliate WTVG, and served as the Toledo area affiliate for Fox Sports Ohio's broadcasts of Cleveland Indians and Cincinnati Reds games before the channel was added to Buckeye's lineup. It also carried SportsChannel America's package of National Hockey League games. The station joined The WB as a charter affiliate in 1995; W48AP, by then WNGT-LP, took the UPN affiliation. Eventually the Travel Channel found its own 24/7 channel slot, and the dual- coaxial system was converted to a modern single-coaxial digital system, leaving ToledoVision 5 on channel 5. On January 24, 2006, CBS Corporation and Time Warner announced that they would shut down their respective networks, The WB and UPN that fall. In place of these networks, the two companies would form a new service called The CW, which would combine the most-watched programs from both UPN and The WB with new series produced specifically for the network.UPN and WB to Combine, Forming New TV Network, The New York Times, January 24, 2006. Well considered a strong WB affiliate, WT05 affiliated with The CW at launch in mid-September 2006, leaving WNGT with the MyNetworkTV affiliation and new calls in WMNT-CA. Over-the-air viewers with a strong enough antenna were (and still are) able to access the network through either WKBD-TV in Detroit or WBNX-TV from Akron (the network has since moved to WUAB in that market), depending on their location in the market. WKBD is also available on Buckeye, but only north of the Michigan/Ohio state line. Transfer of schedule and affiliation to WTVG-DT2 On July 24, 2014, SJL Communications announced that it would sell WTVG to Gray Television. Gray indicated that it planned to add The CW to a digital subchannel. On September 1, 2014, Toledo 5's CW affiliation and lineup of syndicated programming was moved to the new \\"CW 13\\" channel on WTVG-DT2, replacing the Live Well Network over-the-air, and inheriting channel 5 on Buckeye's cable lineup. Programming Over the years, the station has carried various Toledo area sporting events including Toledo Mud Hens minor league baseball, and University of Toledo and Bowling Green State University football and basketball, to the point that Buckeye Cablesystem launched a regional all- sports network, Buckeye Cable Sports Network (BCSN) on January 7, 2004.

Smith retired on December 31, 2014, as the State Constitution's requirement that judges retire at the end of the calendar year in which they reached the age of 70. Early life and education Smith was born in New York City in 1944, and grew up in Massachusetts and Connecticut. He graduated from Stanford University in 1965 and from Columbia Law School in 1968, where he was editor-in-chief of the law review. Pre-judicial career From 1968 to 2003 he practiced law in New York City with the firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, taking a one- year leave of absence in 1980‚Äì81 to serve as Visiting Professor from Practice at Columbia Law School. In private practice, Smith was best known for representing a shopping center in a case, Shad Alliance v. Smith Haven Mall, that established that the right of free speech does not require shopping centers to allow people to hand out literature on their property; for representing United Airlines' pilots' union in its attempt to take over United Airlines; and for arguing two death penalty appeals before the United States Supreme Court. Court of Appeals On November 4, 2003, he was appointed by Governor George Pataki to the Court of Appeals. During his first year, he emerged as the court's most vigorous questioner from the bench. In October 2011, Smith gave the keynote address at the Seventh Annual Friedrich A. von Hayek Lecture, \\"The Hayekian Judge,\\" sponsored by New York University Journal of Law and Liberty. He was introduced by Richard Epstein. Judge Smith teaches a class at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law with former dean David Rudenstine on the subject of President Trump and the constitutional order. Notable opinions *He wrote a plurality opinion in Pataki v. Silver, upholding the Governor's power over the state budget. *He wrote a dissent in People v. LaValle, in which the majority ruled that the death penalty was unconstitutional. *On July 6, 2006, Smith wrote the main opinion in Hernandez v. Robles, a 4-2 decision, declaring that same-sex marriage in New York was not constitutionally required, and was to be left to the legislature. Chief Judge Judith Kaye wrote the dissent. *On October 23, 2007, in People v. Taylor, he sided with the majority in upholding People v. LaValle, on the grounds of stare decisis. Post-judicial career Smith became a partner in New York City law firm Friedman Kaplan Seiler & Adelman LLP on January 1, 2015, one day after retiring from the Court of Appeals.

Description This plant grows to about . It has light brown bark, usually short, straight spines 1 to 3 centimeters long, twice-compound leaves, and numerous small yellowish flowers appearing in elongate spikes. The tightly twisted seedpods (legumes) are up to 5 centimeters long and very much resemble turned screws. This morphology may have been an evolutionary defense against seed predators such as bean weevils (Bruchinae). The seeds germinate after being scarified in the digestive tracts of animals that eat them. The plant also grows in a clockwise spiral. Habitat It is found along streams and valleys in deserts, particularly in damp or saline soil. It grows alongside common plants of this habitat type, such as arrowweed (Pluchea sericea) and tamarisks. It can be found on playas and other areas of alkaline substrates. This and other mesquite species are dominant plants in the Mesquite Bosque-mesquite woodlands, a common habitat type in the desert southwest region. Many types of animals readily eat the seedpods, including several bird and rodent species and coyotes. Many species of birds nest and roost in the trees, and small mammals find shelter in thicketlike stands. Uses=Food Like those of other Prosopis species, Screwbean Mesquite has nutritious seedpods that can be eaten. The Pimas cooked the pods in dirt-covered pits over intervals of a few days. Mesquite is a traditional Native American food source, being used to make meal, cakes and syrup. Used as a staple food for centuries by desert dwellers, this high protein meal contains good quantities of calcium, magnesium, potassium, iron and zinc, and is rich in the amino acid lysine as well. Mesquite is high in fiber, moderate in sugar, and 8% protein. It has a sweet, rich, molasses-like flavor with a hint of caramel which blends well into smoothies or other drinks, especially those made with cacao and maca. The fruits may be used as a coffee substitute. Wood Native Americans found Screwbean wood valuable for building, for making tools and weapons, and as firewood. The wood is durable and considered attractive, and it may be used in woodworking. Some Native Americans also used the root bark to prepare a treatment for wounds.

It is a form of stochastic ordering. The concept arises in decision theory and decision analysis in situations where one gamble (a probability distribution over possible outcomes, also known as prospects) can be ranked as superior to another gamble for a broad class of decision-makers. It is based on shared preferences regarding sets of possible outcomes and their associated probabilities. Only limited knowledge of preferences is required for determining dominance. Risk aversion is a factor only in second order stochastic dominance. Stochastic dominance does not give a total order, but rather only a partial order: for some pairs of gambles, neither one stochastically dominates the other, since different members of the broad class of decision-makers will differ regarding which gamble is preferable without them generally being considered to be equally attractive. Statewise dominance The simplest case of stochastic dominance is statewise dominance (also known as state-by-state dominance), defined as follows: : Random variable A is statewise dominant over random variable B if A gives at least as good a result in every state (every possible set of outcomes), and a strictly better result in at least one state. For example, if a dollar is added to one or more prizes in a lottery, the new lottery statewise dominates the old one because it yields a better payout regardless of the specific numbers realized by the lottery. Similarly, if a risk insurance policy has a lower premium and a better coverage than another policy, then with or without damage, the outcome is better. Anyone who prefers more to less (in the standard terminology, anyone who has monotonically increasing preferences) will always prefer a statewise dominant gamble. First-order Statewise dominance is a special case of the canonical first-order stochastic dominance (FSD), which is defined as: : Random variable A has first-order stochastic dominance over random variable B if for any outcome x, A gives at least as high a probability of receiving at least x as does B, and for some x, A gives a higher probability of receiving at least x. In notation form, P [A \\\\ge x]\\\\ge P [B \\\\ge x] for all x, and for some x, P[A \\\\ge x]>P[B \\\\ge x]. In terms of the cumulative distribution functions of the two random variables, A dominating B means that F_A(x) \\\\le F_B(x) for all x, with strict inequality at some x. Gamble A first-order stochastically dominates gamble B if and only if every expected utility maximizer with an increasing utility function prefers gamble A over gamble B. First-order stochastic dominance can also be expressed as follows: If and only if A first-order stochastically dominates B, there exists some gamble y such that x_B \\\\overset {d}{=} (x_A+y) where y\\\\le 0 in all possible states (and strictly negative in at least one state); here \\\\overset{d}{=} means \\"is equal in distribution to\\" (that is, \\"has the same distribution as\\"). Thus, we can go from the graphed density function of A to that of B by, roughly speaking, pushing some of the probability mass to the left. For example, consider a single toss of a fair die with the six possible outcomes (states) summarized in this table along with the amount won in each state by each of three alternative gambles: : \\\\begin{array}{rcccccc} \\\\text{State (die result)} & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\\\ \\\\hline \\\\text{Gamble A wins }\\\\$ & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 2 & 2 \\\\ \\\\text{Gamble B wins }\\\\$ & 1 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 2 \\\\ \\\\text{Gamble C wins }\\\\$ & 3 & 3 & 3 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ \\\\hline \\\\end{array} Here gamble A statewise dominates gamble B because A gives at least as good a yield in all possible states (outcomes of the die roll) and gives a strictly better yield in one of them (state 3). Since A statewise dominates B, it also first-order dominates B. Gamble C does not statewise dominate B because B gives a better yield in states 4 through 6, but C first- order stochastically dominates B because Pr(B ‚â• 1) = Pr(C ‚â• 1) = 1, Pr(B ‚â• 2) = Pr(C ‚â• 2) = 3/6, and Pr(B ‚â• 3) = 0 while Pr(C ‚â• 3) = 3/6 > Pr(B ‚â• 3). Gambles A and C cannot be ordered relative to each other on the basis of first-order stochastic dominance because Pr(A ‚â• 2) = 4/6 > Pr(C ‚â• 2) = 3/6 while on the other hand Pr(C ‚â• 3) = 3/6 > Pr(A ‚â• 3) = 0. In general, although when one gamble first-order stochastically dominates a second gamble, the expected value of the payoff under the first will be greater than the expected value of the payoff under the second, the converse is not true: one cannot order lotteries with regard to stochastic dominance simply by comparing the means of their probability distributions. For instance, in the above example C has a higher mean (2) than does A (5/3), yet C does not first-order dominate A. Second-order The other commonly used type of stochastic dominance is second-order stochastic dominance. Roughly speaking, for two gambles A and B, gamble A has second-order stochastic dominance over gamble B if the former is more predictable (i.e. involves less risk) and has at least as high a mean. All risk-averse expected-utility maximizers (that is, those with increasing and concave utility functions) prefer a second-order stochastically dominant gamble to a dominated one. Second-order dominance describes the shared preferences of a smaller class of decision-makers (those for whom more is better and who are averse to risk, rather than all those for whom more is better) than does first-order dominance. In terms of cumulative distribution functions F_A and F_B, A is second-order stochastically dominant over B if and only if the area under F_A from minus infinity to x is less than or equal to that under F_B from minus infinity to x for all real numbers x, with strict inequality at some x; that is, \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^x [F_B(t) - F_A(t)] \\\\, dt \\\\geq 0 for all x, with strict inequality at some x. Equivalently, A dominates B in the second order if and only if \\\\operatorname{E}[u(A)] \\\\geq \\\\operatorname{E}[u(B)] for all nondecreasing and concave utility functions u(x). Second-order stochastic dominance can also be expressed as follows: Gamble A second-order stochastically dominates B if and only if there exist some gambles y and z such that x_B \\\\overset {d}{=} (x_A + y + z), with y always less than or equal to zero, and with \\\\operatorname{E}(z\\\\mid x_A+y)=0 for all values of x_A+y. Here the introduction of random variable y makes B first-order stochastically dominated by A (making B disliked by those with an increasing utility function), and the introduction of random variable z introduces a mean-preserving spread in B which is disliked by those with concave utility. Note that if A and B have the same mean (so that the random variable y degenerates to the fixed number 0), then B is a mean-preserving spread of A. Sufficient conditions for second-order stochastic dominance * First-order stochastic dominance of A over B is a sufficient condition for second-order dominance of A over B. * If B is a mean-preserving spread of A, then A second-order stochastically dominates B. Necessary conditions for second-order stochastic dominance * \\\\operatorname{E}_A(x) \\\\geq \\\\operatorname{E}_B(x) is a necessary condition for A to second-order stochastically dominate B. * \\\\min_A(x)\\\\geq \\\\min_B(x) is a necessary condition for A to second-order dominate B. The condition implies that the left tail of F_B must be thicker than the left tail of F_A. Third-order Let F_A and F_B be the cumulative distribution functions of two distinct investments A and B. A dominates B in the third order if and only if * \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^x \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^z [F_B(t) - F_A(t)] \\\\, dt \\\\, dz \\\\geq 0 \\\\text{ for all } x, * \\\\operatorname{E}_A(x) \\\\geq \\\\operatorname{E}_B(x), \\\\, and there is at least one strict inequality. Equivalently, A dominates B in the third order if and only if \\\\operatorname{E}_AU(x) \\\\geq \\\\operatorname{E}_BU(x) for all nondecreasing, concave utility functions U that are positively skewed (that is, have a positive third derivative throughout). Sufficient condition * Second-order stochastic dominance is a sufficient condition. Necessary conditions * \\\\operatorname{E}_A(\\\\log(x))\\\\geq \\\\operatorname{E}_B(\\\\log(x)) is a necessary condition. The condition implies that the geometric mean of A must be greater than or equal to the geometric mean of B. * \\\\min_A(x)\\\\geq\\\\min_B(x) is a necessary condition. The condition implies that the left tail of F_B must be thicker than the left tail of F_A. Higher-order Higher orders of stochastic dominance have also been analyzed, as have generalizations of the dual relationship between stochastic dominance orderings and classes of preference functions. Arguably the most powerful dominance criterion relies on the accepted economic assumption of decreasing absolute risk aversion. This involves several analytical challenges and a research effort is on its way to address those. See, e.g. Constraints Stochastic dominance relations may be used as constraints in problems of mathematical optimization, in particular stochastic programming. In a problem of maximizing a real functional f(X) over random variables X in a set X_0 we may additionally require that X stochastically dominates a fixed random benchmark B . In these problems, utility functions play the role of Lagrange multipliers associated with stochastic dominance constraints. Under appropriate conditions, the solution of the problem is also a (possibly local) solution of the problem to maximize f(X) + \\\\operatorname{E}[u(X) - u(B)] over X in X_0 , where u(x) is a certain utility function. If the first order stochastic dominance constraint is employed, the utility function u(x) is nondecreasing; if the second order stochastic dominance constraint is used, u(x) is nondecreasing and concave. A system of linear equations can test whether a given solution if efficient for any such utility function. Third-order stochastic dominance constraints can be dealt with using convex quadratically constrained programming (QCP).

He was the director of the Writing Center at Norwich Free Academy in Norwich from 1989 to 1998 and has taught Creative Writing in the English Department at the University of Connecticut. Early life Lamb was born to a working class family in Norwich, Connecticut. Three Rivers, the fictional town where several of his novels are set, is based on Norwich and the nearby towns of New London, Willimantic, in Connecticut as well as Westerly, Rhode Island. As a child, Lamb loved to draw and create his own comic books‚Äîactivities which, he says, gave him \\"a leg up\\" on the imagery and colloquial dialogue that characterize his stories. He credits his ability to write in female voices, as well as male, with having grown up with older sisters in a neighborhood largely populated by girls. After graduating from high school, Lamb studied at the University of Connecticut during the turbulent early 1970s era of anti-war and civil rights protests and student strikes. He holds a B.A. and an M.A. in Education from the University of Connecticut and a Master of Fine Arts in Writing from Vermont College. Writing Lamb began writing in 1981, the year he became a father. Lamb's first published stories were short fictions that appeared in Northeast, a Sunday magazine of the Hartford Courant. \\"Astronauts,\\" published in The Missouri Review in 1989, won the Missouri Review William Peden Prize and became widely anthologized. His first novel, She's Come Undone, was followed six years later by I Know This Much Is True, a story about identical twin brothers, one of whom develops paranoid schizophrenia. Both novels became number one bestsellers after Oprah Winfrey selected them for her popular Book Club. Lamb's third novel, The Hour I First Believed, published in 2008, interfaces fiction with such non-fictional events as the Columbine High School shooting, the Iraq War, and, in a story within the story, events of nineteenth-century America. Published the following year, Wishin' and Hopin was a departure for Lamb: a short, comically nostalgic novel about a parochial school fifth grader, set in 1964. In We Are Water, Lamb returns to his familiar setting of Three Rivers. The novel focuses on art, 1950s-era racial strife, and the impact of a devastating flood on a Connecticut family. His seventh novel, I'll Take You There, revives characters from Wishin' and Hopin and considers themes of millennial-era popular culture contrasted with figures from the silent film era and the 1950s Miss Rheingold contest.

English.uconn.edu. University of Connecticut Department of English. n.d. January 25, 2012. Prison work From 1999 to 2019, Lamb facilitated a writing program for incarcerated women at the York Correctional Institute, Connecticut's only women's prison in Niantic, Connecticut. Lamb's writing program at York Prison produced two collections of his inmate students' autobiographical writing, Couldn't Keep It to Myself: Testimonies from Our Imprisoned Sisters and I'll Fly Away: Further Testimonies from the Women of York Prison, both of which Lamb edited. A third collection, titled You Don't Know Me: Incarcerated Women Voice Their Truths, was slated for publication in October 2019 but never released. The publication of the first book became a source of controversy and media attention when, a week before its release, the State of Connecticut unexpectedly sued its incarcerated contributors‚Äînot for the six thousand dollars each writer would collect after her release from prison but for the entire cost of her incarceration, calculated at $117 per day times the number of days in her prison sentence. When one of the writers won a PEN/Newman's Own First Amendment Award, given to a writer whose freedom of speech is under attack, the prison destroyed the women's writing and moved to close down Lamb's program. These actions caught the interest of the television show 60 Minutes, and shortly before the show aired an episode about the controversy, the State of Connecticut settled the lawsuit and reinstated the program. Influences Lamb says he is influenced by masters of long- and short-form fiction, among them John Updike, Flannery O'Connor, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Willa Cather, Edith Wharton, Raymond Carver,Lamb, Wally. \\"Author's Picks: Twenty-one Books That Called Me to a Writing Life.\\" I Know This Much Is True, Perennial Ed. New York: HarperCollins, 2008. and Andre Dubus. He credits his perennial teaching of certain novels to high school students with teaching him about \\"the scaffolding\\" of longer stories. Among these, Lamb lists Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, Mark Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye. He says Joseph Campbell's The Hero with a Thousand Faces and other anthropological analyses of the commonalities of ancient myths from diverse world cultures helped him to figure out the ways in which stories, ancient and modern, can illuminate the human condition. Lamb has also stated that he is influenced by pop culture and artists who work in other media. Among these he mentions painters Edward Hopper and Ren√© Magritte.

Primary meals The basic feature of a Parsi lunch is rice, eaten with lentils or a curry. Curry is made with coconut and ras without, with curry usually being thicker than ras. Dinner would be a meat dish, often accompanied by potatoes or other vegetable curry. Kachumbar (a sharp onion- cucumber salad) accompanies most meals. Popular Parsi dishes include: * Chicken Farcha (Fried chicken appetizer) * Dhansak (Lamb, mutton, goat, chicken or vegetables in a mixed lentil or toor daal gravy served with brown rice) * Patra ni Machhi (Fish - Pomfret or Surmai stuffed heavily with green coconut chutney and wrapped in a banana leaf - steam cooked.) * Sali Murghi (Spicy chicken with fine fried matchstick potatoes) * Saas ni Machhi (Yellow rice with pomfret fish fillets in white sauce) * Kolmi no Patio (Shrimp in spicy tomato curry) * Jardaloo Sali Boti (Boneless mutton in an onion and tomato sauce with apricots and fried matchstick potatoes) * Khichri (rice with toor daal or moong daal) * Tamota ni Ras Chaval (mutton cutlets with white rice and tomato sauce) Also popular among Parsis, but less so elsewhere, are the typical Parsi eeda (egg) dishes, which include akuri (scrambled eggs with spices) and the pora (\\"Parsi\\" omelette). Also, vegetables like okra, tomato, potato and others are often cooked with eggs on top. Traditional breakfasts during the 1930s in Mumbai or in many South Gujarat villages consisted of khurchan (offal meats cooked with potatoes in a spicy gravy), and some variant of the ubiquitous deep-fried, fried or half-fried eggs. In agrarian communities, this would be washed down by copious quantities of coconut toddy, often straight off the tree. Although in the not-so-distant past, vegetables were considered a 'poor peoples food', there is a presently a trend towards light eating, no red-meat and even vegetarianism. Desserts Common desserts include sev (vermicelli), ravo (sweet semolina pudding) and malido (a nutty fudge). Also popular are faluda and kulfi, both of which are adoptions from the cuisines of the Irani and Persian-speaking communities. Wedding feasts traditionally include Lagan nu Custard. Snacks Popular parsi snacks include bhakhra (deep fried sweet dough), batasa (tea biscuits), dar ni pori (sweetened lentils stuffed in a light pastry), doodh na puff (milk froth) and khaman na ladva (dumplings stuffed with sweetened coconut).

It was featured in Oprah's Book Club for June 1998. Plot summary The novel takes place in Three Rivers, Connecticut in the early 1990s. Dominick Birdsey's identical twin, Thomas Birdsey, suffers from paranoid schizophrenia. With medication, Thomas is able to live his life in relative peace and work at a coffee stand, but occasionally, he has severe episodes of his illness. Thinking he is making a sacrificial protest that will stop the Gulf War, Thomas cuts off his own hand while at a public library. Dominick sees him through the ensuing decision not to attempt to reattach the hand, and makes efforts on his behalf to free him from what he knows to be an inadequate and depressing hospital for the dangerously mentally ill. In the process, Dominick contemplates his own difficult life as Thomas's brother, his marriage to his gorgeous ex-wife, which ended after their only child died of SIDS, and his ongoing hostility toward his stepfather. Dominick also displays classic symptoms of PTSD, as a result of stressors in his adult life. First in Thomas's interests, and then for his own sake, he sees a therapist, Dr. Rubina Patel, a psychologist employed by the hospital. She helps Dominick come to understand Thomas's illness better and the family's accommodations or reactions to it. In the course of Thomas's treatment, Dominick is covertly informed of sexual abuse taking place in the hospital, and helps to expose the perpetrators. He succeeds in getting Thomas released, but Thomas soon dies, apparently by suicide. After Thomas's death, Dominick discovers the identity of their birth father, who was part African American and part Native American‚Äîa secret their mother had shared with Thomas, but not with him. In the midst of this, Dominick is also reading the autobiography of his grandfather, Italian/Sicilian-born Domenico Tempesta, which discloses details about the legacy of twins in their family. Dominick learns about himself and his mother through learning about his grandfather. He also learns that his live-in girlfriend, Joy, has been seeing a gentleman on the side, who is her bisexual half-uncle, and has also let him watch her and Dominick during sex on previous occasions. She is also HIV-positive, having contracted it from her secret lover. She asks Dominick to raise her baby if she dies. At first Dominick resists, but later, after having found his way back into a relationship with his ex-wife, Dessa, they decide to remarry each other and adopt Joy's daughter. The book ends with Dominick able to cope with the considerable loss, failure, and sorrow in his personal and family history.

Life Map showing the Wars of the Eight Princes Sima Wei was the fifth son of Jin's founding emperor Emperor Wu, by his concubine Consort Shen. In his childhood, he was created the Prince of Shiping. Late in his father's reign, circa 289, he was created the Prince of Chu and charged with the military commands of Jing Province (ËçäÂ∑û, modern Hubei and Hunan). After his father died in 290, his brother Crown Prince Zhong ascended the throne as Emperor Hui. Empress Dowager Yang's father Yang Jun was regent, but many people were dissatisfied with his hold on power. One of those was Emperor Hui's wife Empress Jia Nanfeng, and she entered into a conspiracy with Sima Wei, among others, to overthrow Yang Jun. In 291, Sima Wei returned to the capital Luoyang with his troops, and soon a coup happened. Empress Jia, who had her husband easily under her control, had him issue an edict declaring that Yang Jun had committed crimes and should be removed from his posts. It also ordered Sima Wei and Sima Yao () the Duke of Dong'an to attack Yang's forces and defend against counterattacks. Quickly, it became clear that Yang was in trouble. Empress Dowager Yang, trapped in the palace herself, wrote an edict ordering assistance for Yang Jun and put it on arrows, shooting it out of the palace. Empress Jia then made the bold declaration that Empress Dowager Yang was committing treason. Yang Jun was quickly defeated, and his clan was massacred. Emperor Hui's granduncle Sima Liang was recalled to serve as regent, along with Wei Guan. Sima Liang and Wei Guan had reservations about Sima Wei's ferocity in overthrowing Yang, and they therefore tried to strip him of his military command, but Sima Wei persuaded Empress Jia to let him keep his military command. Sima Wei's assistants Qi Sheng () and Gongsun Hong () thereafter falsely told Empress Jia that Sima Liang and Wei Guan planned to depose the emperor. Empress Jia, who had already resented Wei for having, during Emperor Wu's reign, suggested that he change his heir selection, also wanted more direct control over the government, and therefore resolved to undergo a second coup. In summer 291, Empress Jia had Emperor Hui personally write an edict to Sima Wei, ordering him to have Sima Liang and Wei removed from their offices. His forces thereby surrounded Sima Liang and Wei Guan's mansions, and while both men's subordinates recommended resistance, each declined and was captured. Against what the edict said, both were killed‚ÄîSima Liang with his heir Sima Ju () and Wei Guan with nine of his sons and grandsons. Qi then suggested to Sima Wei to take the chance to kill Empress Jia's relatives and take over the government, but Sima Wei hesitated‚Äîand at the same time, Empress Jia came to two realizations: first, if it were realized she had ordered the killing of Sima Liang and Guan Wei it could bring a political firestorm; and second, that Sima Wei would not be easily controlled. She therefore publicly declared that Sima Wei had falsely issued the edict. Sima Wei's troops abandoned him, and he was captured and executed. At the execution, he tried to show the edict to the official in charge of the execution, Liu Song (), and Liu, knowing that Sima Wei had actually carried out the coup on Empress Jia's orders, was saddened, but still carried out the execution. Gongsun Hong and Qi Sheng were also executed, along with their clans. Despite his volatile temper, Sima Wei was known for his generosity, and he was greatly missed by the people. In 301, after Empress Jia's death, he was posthumously rewarded the office of a general, and his son Sima Fan (), while not given the principality of Chu, was created the Prince of Xiangyang.

This chemical compound has a potential application in molecular electronics and was synthesized in 2005 at Kyoto University by the group of Koichi Komatsu. Ordinarily the payload of endohedral fullerenes are inserted at the time of the synthesis of the fullerene itself or is introduced to the fullerene at very low yields at high temperatures and high pressure. This particular fullerene was synthesised in an unusual way in three steps starting from pristine C60 fullerene: cracking open the carbon framework, insert hydrogen gas and zipping up by organic synthesis methods. Organic synthesis Scheme 1 presents an overview of the first step, the creation of a 13 membered ring orifice on the fullerene surface. A 1,2,4-triazine 2 is fitted with two phenyl groups and a pyridine group for reasons of solubility and reacted in 1,2-dichlorobenzene with pristine C60 fullerene 2 in a Diels- Alder reaction at high temperature and for an extended reaction time. In this reaction nitrogen is expulsed and an 8-membered ring is formed (3). This orifice is further extended by reaction with singlet oxygen in carbon tetrachloride which causes one of the ring alkene groups to oxidize to a ketone. The 12-ring is extended to a 13-ring by reaction with elemental sulfur in presence of tetrakis(dimethylamino)ethylene. Scheme 1. Endohedral hydrogen fullerene overview The proposed reaction mechanism is depicted in a plat surface rendition in scheme 2. In the first step the triazine reacts with the fullerene in a Diels-Alder reaction. In the second step nitrogen is expulsed from the DA adduct 2 resulting in the formation of a fused aza-cyclohexadiene ring followed by a [4+4]cycloaddition to an intermediate 4 with two cyclopropane rings. This intermediate quickly rearranges in a retro [2+2+2]cycloaddition to the 8 membered ring product 5. In silico calculations show that the electrons in the HOMO reside primarily in the double bonds of the butadiene part of the ring and indeed singlet oxygen reacts at these positions through the dioxetane intermediate 6 with alkene cleavage to diketone 7 (only one isomer shown). Elemental sulfur S8 is inserted into the single bond of the diene group leading to the extension of the ring to 13 atoms (structures 8 and 9 are identical). Tetrakis(dimethylamino)ethylene activates this bond for electrophilic sulfur addition either by one-electron reduction or by complexation. Scheme 2. Endohedral hydrogen fullerene mechanism From X-ray crystallography it is determined that the shape of the orifice in the sulfur compound is roughly a circle. Inserting hydrogen in this compound is an easy step taking place with 100% efficiency. Zipping up the orifice is a reversal of the steps required to open the cage. Care must be taken to keep the reaction conditions below 160 ¬∞C on order to prevent hydrogen from escaping. m-CPBA oxidizes the sulfur group to a sulfoxide group which can then be extracted from the ring by a photochemical reaction under visible light in toluene. The two ketone groups are re-coupled in a McMurry reaction with titanium tetrachloride and elemental zinc. The reverse cycloadditions take place at 340 ¬∞C in a vacuum splitting of 2-cyanopyridine and diphenylacetylene resulting in the formation of H2@C60 at a 40% chemical yield starting from pristine fullerene. Properties H2@C60 is found to be a stable molecule. it survives 10 minutes at 500 ¬∞C and shows the same chemical reactivity as empty C60. The electronic properties are also largely unaffected. The process of hydrogen introduction and release can be facilitated by increasing the size of the orifice. This can be done by replacing sulfur by selenium (sodium thiolate, Se8) exploiting larger C-Se bond length. Filling cracked-open fullerene now takes 8 hours at 190 ¬∞C at 760 atmospheres (77 MPa) of hydrogen and release between 150 ¬∞C and 180 ¬∞C is three times as fast compared to the sulfur analogue. The activation energy for release is lowered by 0.7 kcal/mol to 28.2 kcal/mol (2.9 to 118 kJ/mol). There is evidence that hydrogen in the fullerene cage is not completely shielded from the outside world as one study found that H2@C60 is more efficient at quenching singlet oxygen than empty C60.

Pirates  The cemetery of past pirates at √éle Ste-Marie (St. Mary's Island) Ile Sainte-Marie, or St. Mary's Island as it is known in English, became a popular base for pirates, starting with Adam Baldridge in 1691John Franklin Jameson, Privateering and Piracy in the Colonial Period: Illustrative Documents (New York, 1923), p. 180 and ending with John Pro in 1719, in the 17th and 18th centuries due to several reasons: it was not far from the maritime routes along which ships returning from the East Indies sailed in transit, their holds overflowing with wealth; it was provided with bays and inlets protected from storms; and finally, it had abundant fruit and was situated in quiet waters. Legendary pirates including William Kidd, Robert Culliford, Olivier Levasseur, Henry Every, Abraham Samuel and Thomas Tew lived in the √Æle aux Forbans, an island located in the bay of Sainte Marie's main town, Ambodifotatra. Many of them would found a family line. Numerous vestiges of this history remain on Nosy Boraha, but at this time the remains have not been yet identified. The utopian pirate republic of Libertalia was also rumored to exist in this area, although the republic's existence, let alone its location, has never been proven.  Diving  Free from sharks, the lagoon of the island is endowed with significant coralline growth. Its underwater fauna is conserved as a natural heritage and popular diving site in the Indian Ocean. On 7 May 2015, a large \\"silver\\" ingot, which was believed to be Captain Kidd's treasure, was found off the coast of the island. After further analysis, UNESCO determined that the piece actually consisted of 95% lead; they judged it to be \\"a broken part of the Sainte-Marie port constructions.\\"  Traditions  On Nosy Boraha, the inhabitants are attached to traditions. The social or family events are faithfully linked to practices invoking the ancestors' spirits. The wealth and variety of these rituals underline the authenticity and depth of the \\"Saint- marien\\" cultural identity.  In popular culture  The island is the setting for the fourth Uncharted game, which was released for the PlayStation 4. In the game, the main characters explore the island while on a quest to discover the rumored pirate utopia of Libertalia and the fictitious bounty of the famed pirate Henry Avery.  Fauna and flora  The insular character and the coralline soil encouraged various adaptations, as much of animal as of plant structure. Thus, Sainte Marie is endowed with a rich fauna and flora. Sainte- Marie has several species of lemur as well as numerous orchid species, among which is the \\"Queen of Madagascar\\" (Eulophiella roempleriana). The island was the only place where Delalande's coua, a non-parasitic cuckoo, was known to occur; this species became extinct in the late 19th century, probably due to predation by feral cats.

The first team plays in the . History Corsham Town was founded in 1884 and affiliated to the Football Association in 1893. The club had to wait just over sixty years before it had won anything, winning the Wilts Junior Cup in the 1946‚Äì47 season. Four seasons later the club entered the FA Cup for the first time making it to the first qualifying round in its first attempt, they entered the competition for a further three seasons.FCHD Football Club History Database In the 1960‚Äì61 season the club won its second honour winning the Wiltshire League Division two, fourteen years after their first honour. In 1976 they became founding members of the Wiltshire Football League, when the Wiltshire Combination and Wiltshire Leagues were amalgamated, starting in Division 2. During their first Season in the new county league the club won the Wiltshire Senior Cup and were promoted to the top division in the league. For many years afterwards the club then spent time being relegated and promoted between the top two divisions, and not achieving anymore silverware, until Gary Lock became manager and began the road to success winning the Addkey Senior Cup in 1995‚Äì96 . His was a short tenure, and Lock was followed by Peter Tripp who led the club to becoming champions for the first time in 1997‚Äì98, also winning the Addkey Senior Cup along with the Wilts Senior Cup. The club also entered the FA Vase competition in the 2001‚Äì02 season for the first time and a season afterwards entered the FA cup again after a gap of 49 years, since last playing in the competition in the 1950s. After spending six years in Division One, they were promoted to the Premier Division in 2004 after finishing fifth in new manager Colin Bush's first season at the helm. That season also saw the ground improve under the chairmanship of Colin Hudd with floodlights being installed and a 112 spectator stand being built. They finished runners up to Bideford in their first two seasons in the Western League's top division and were crowned as champions for the 2006‚Äì07 season, winning the division by two points from Bridgwater Town. Bush decided to step down after four years at the helm, and former Wiltshire Under 18s manager Mel Gingell was appointed with the job of rebuilding the side, after many of the championship winning team decided to leave the Southbank for pastures new. In an impressive first season, Gingell's young charges finished fifth in the league, despite a lengthy touchline ban for the new manager. The club then remained in the Premier Division until the 2011‚Äì12 season where upon finishing 18th they were relegated back to Division One under new manager Trevor Rawlings. Rawlings led the club to a fourth-placed finish in their first season back in the First Division, narrowly missing out on promotion back to the Premier Division at the first time of asking.

He married Mar√≠a Elisa Sigel, born on 18 December 1851, in Wilheim-Kirchheim, Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany, who was also German. The first mill was authorized in 1859 by the provincial government of Antonio Gaspoz, who built it on the banks of the Culul√∫ River. The steam mill was installed in the colony of San Carlos by Guillermo Bauer and Juan Siegel, who hoped to have eight mills operational before 1890. They benefitted from the inauguration of the railroad in 1885, because they were able to ship their product to the port of Rosario, where Guillermo was able to receive more money for his product. By the late 1800s, they were able to cut normal operating costs to the point where the horse-driven mills were closing. Soon after, in the 1890s, Guillermo was honored by the local governor, Luciano Leiva, for giving flour to the poor and contributing money to the local area to stimulate growth. After contributing to the health of many people and giving selflessly, he was honored by a reprographic shop in Rosario, and eventually met Pope Leo XIII, who was touched by his kindness. Guillermo was made the patron saint of reprographers in the early 1900s, and is still honored in many shops today. He died on 26 April 1912 in Argentina.

Affiliated to the Somerset County FA, they are currently members of the and play at Fairfax Park. History Bridgwater Association Football Club were established at a meeting in the Cross Rifle pub on 28 January 1898.BTFC History - The Early Year Bridgwater Town F.C. They joined the Somerset Senior League later in the year, and in their first full season they won the Somerset Senior Cup, beating Yeovil Casuals 1‚Äì0 in a replay. However, the club disbanded after four seasons in the league. In 1903 a new Bridgwater A.F.C. was formed. They subsequently joined the Clevedon & District League for the 1905‚Äì06 season, but left after a single season to join the Weston & District League, also playing in the Highbridge League. They won Division Two of the Weston & District League in 1908‚Äì09, but finished bottom of Division One the following season and were relegated back to Division Two. This was repeated when they won Division Two again in 1911‚Äì12, but were relegated from Division One the following season. The club subsequently folded during the 2013‚Äì14 season. In 1921, Highbridge League club Wills Athletic, the works team of the Wills Engineering company, played Bristol City in a friendly game. The level of interest in the match led to the club being transformed into Bridgwater Town during the 1921‚Äì22 season. After being rejected by the Somerset Senior League in 1923, they joined both the Mid-Somerset and West Somerset leagues. However, financial problems caused by the building works at their new ground forced them to withdraw from both leagues after a single season, they returned to local leagues, including the Taunton & District League, which they played in until 1931. Following World War II Crown Dynamos were formed in 1946 and joined the Bridgwater & District League. They moved up to Somerset Senior League in 1947, and after finishing third in their first season, the club was transformed into Bridgwater Town Association Football Club. The first season under the new name saw the club finish as runners-up, resulting in a successful application to join Division Two of the Western League. They finished as runners-up in Division Two in 1951‚Äì52, earning promotion to Division One. The 1957‚Äì58 season saw them finish second in Division One, as well as winning the League Cup. In 1960‚Äì61 Bridgwater reached the first round of the FA Cup for the first time, and after beating Southern League club Hereford United 3‚Äì0, they lost 2‚Äì1 at another Southern League club, Oxford United. They repeated the feat the following season, beating Weston-super-Mare 1‚Äì0 in a first round replay, before losing 3‚Äì0 at home to Third Division Crystal Palace. In 1963‚Äì64 another first round appearance resulted in a 3‚Äì0 defeat at home to Third Division Luton Town; they were beaten in the same round by Reading in 1971‚Äì72. The club went on to win the league in 1980‚Äì81. After winning the League Cup the following season, they moved up to the Midland Division of the Southern League. However, after two seasons the club resigned from the league and folded due to financial problems caused by the additional travelling, falling attendances and building works at the social club. A new Bridgwater Town was established, taking over from the defunct club's reserves in Division One of the Somerset Senior League. Although they were relegated to Division Two at the end of their first season, they were promoted back to the division at the first attempt, and won Division One in 1986‚Äì87 to earn promotion to the Premier Division. They went on to win three successive Premier Division titles in 1989‚Äì90, 1990‚Äì91 and 1991‚Äì92, and after finishing as runners-up in 1993‚Äì94, were promoted to Division One of the Western League. In 1995‚Äì96 they won Division One and were promoted to the Premier Division. After finishing as Premier Division runners-up in 2006‚Äì07, Bridgwater were promoted to Division One South & West of the Southern League. A third-place finish in 2009‚Äì10 saw them qualify for the promotion play-offs. Although the club defeated VTFC 3‚Äì0 in the semi-finals, they lost 4‚Äì3 to Cirencester Town in the final. They finished bottom of Division One South & West in 2016‚Äì17 and were relegated back to the Premier Division of the Western League. Ground The original Bridgwater club played at a field off the Bath Road that later became the British Cellophane factory. The 1903 club started playing at Taunton Road, the ground used by the Albion Rugby Club, before moving to Westonzoyland Road the following year. The new Bridgwater Town formed in 1921‚Äì22 played at the Malt Shovel ground until the site was used for housing in the mid-1920s, at which point they moved to a ground named Chilton Park at Crowpill. Crown Dynamos initially played at the Eastover Park, before moving to Castle Field when they were transformed into Bridgwater Town. The modern Bridgwater Town have played at Fairfax Park on College Way since being established in 1984. The ground currently has a capacity of 2,500, of which 128 is seated and 500 covered.

The highway once travelled from near Prescott to Ottawa. However, its length was truncated significantly when most of the route was \\"twinned\\" with a second roadway, and renumbered as Highway 416. However, a short stub remains through Johnstown, crossing the St. Lawrence River on the Ogdensburg-Prescott International Bridge to Ogdensburg, New York, where it becomes New York State Route 812. The Ottawa-Prescott Road was one of the first highways designated in Ontario; it was one of four designated in 1918. The highway was numbered in August 1925.  History  Highway 16 becomes New York State Route 812 at the Ogdensburg-Prescott International Bridge The Prescott Highway was established as a provincial highway in 1918, shortly after the Provincial Highway (Highway 2). It remained named until the summer of 1925, when route numbering was introduced and it became Provincial Highway 16. A new route was constructed throughout the 1970s to provide a controlled- access right of way for the highway. During the 1990s, this new route was \\"twinned\\", whereby a new road was constructed parallel to the existing one, and redesignated as Highway 416. A short section through downtown Ottawa was not incorporated into Highway 416, instead being redesigned as Ottawa Regional Road 73 (Prince of Wales Drive). This left a short stub through Johnstown, which remains designated as Highway 16.  Highway 16 New  In 1966 the Eastern Ontario Highway Planning Study was published the Department of Highways (DHO), the predecessor to today's Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO), identifying the need for a controlled-access highway between Ottawa and Highway 401. Highway 16, which crosses the geologically subdued St. Lawrence Lowlands, was selected over Highway 15, which crosses the undulating Canadian Shield to the west, as the ideal route for the new link. To overcome the issue of abutting properties established along the Highway 16 corridor, the DHO began purchasing a new right of way between Highway 401 and Century Road by late 1967 and constructed a two lane bypass of the original alignment, avoiding all the built up areas that the original Highway 16 encountered. This route was designed to easily accommodate the eventual upgrade to a freeway when traffic volumes necessitated. Construction of the Super two, dubbed Highway 16 New, took place between 1969 and 1983. The Spencerville Bypass opened by 1971, connecting with the old highway in the south near Crowder Road and in the north near Ventnor Road. By the end of 1973 the new highway was completed from immediately north of Highway 401 through Leeds and Grenville United Counties and into Ottawa‚ÄìCarleton. This included a bypass around Kemptville and a new structure over the Rideau River. The new highway ended at Dilworth Road (Regional Road 13). For nearly a decade, no new construction took place. Then, during the summer of 1982, the MTO awarded a contract to begin constructing the route north from Dilworth Road towards Manotick, bypassing North Gower. Following the completion of this first contract, which extended the route as far north as Roger Stevens Drive (Regional Road 6) and included a structure over Stevens Creek, a second contract was awarded for the remaining distance north to Century Road (Regional Road 8). The project was completed in 1983, merging into the original route of Highway 16 northeast of the present Prince of Wales Drive overpass. With the completion of Highway 16 New, the MTO need only construct interchanges and the southbound lanes in order to create a full freeway corridor. The upgrade to Highway 416 took place between 1989 and 1999 and was created by the twinning of of Highway 16 New and the construction of an interchange at Highway 401\\\\.  Route description  Highway 16 is now a very brief route, though it was much longer before the construction of Highway 416 truncated it. The highway begins near the shores of the St. Lawrence River in Johnstown at the former Highway 2, now Leeds and Grenville County Road 2. From there the route travels northwest adjacent to the Ogdensburg-Prescott International Bridge, which lies to the southwest. A customs plaza lies at the end of the bridge, north of which the road to the bridge meets the highway. To the northeast is single-detached housing. The highway continues, exiting Johnstown and curving slightly towards the north. Immediately after crossing over a Canadian National track, the route encounters an interchange with Highway 401, Exit 721B. This parclo interchange features full access to Highway 401, including movements not possible at the Highway 416 interchange to the west. North of the interchange, the road curves gently to the northwest, intersecting Cedar Grove Road. After this, the opposing directions of travel diverge and become ramps to northbound and from southbound Highway 416.

It may cause violent swaying motions and even catastrophic failure in improperly constructed structures including bridges, buildings and airplanes. This is a phenomenon known as resonance disaster. Avoiding resonance disasters is a major concern in every building, tower and bridge construction project. The Taipei 101 building relies on a 660-ton pendulum‚Äîa tuned mass damper‚Äîto modify the response at resonance. Furthermore, the structure is designed to resonate at a frequency which does not typically occur. Buildings in seismic zones are often constructed to take into account the oscillating frequencies of expected ground motion. In addition, engineers designing objects having engines must ensure that the mechanical resonant frequencies of the component parts do not match driving vibrational frequencies of the motors or other strongly oscillating parts. Many resonant objects have more than one resonance frequency. It will vibrate easily at those frequencies, and less so at other frequencies. Many clocks keep time by mechanical resonance in a balance wheel, pendulum, or quartz crystal. Description The natural frequency of a simple mechanical system consisting of a weight suspended by a spring is: :f = {1\\\\over 2 \\\\pi} \\\\sqrt {k\\\\over m} where m is the mass and k is the spring constant. A swing set is a simple example of a resonant system with which most people have practical experience. It is a form of pendulum. If the system is excited (pushed) with a period between pushes equal to the inverse of the pendulum's natural frequency, the swing will swing higher and higher, but if excited at a different frequency, it will be difficult to move. The resonance frequency of a pendulum, the only frequency at which it will vibrate, is given approximately, for small displacements, by the equation:Mechanical resonance :f = {1\\\\over 2 \\\\pi} \\\\sqrt {g\\\\over L} where g is the acceleration due to gravity (about 9.8 m/s2 near the surface of Earth), and L is the length from the pivot point to the center of mass.(An elliptic integral yields a description for any displacement). Note that, in this approximation, the frequency does not depend on mass. Mechanical resonators work by transferring energy repeatedly from kinetic to potential form and back again. In the pendulum, for example, all the energy is stored as gravitational energy (a form of potential energy) when the bob is instantaneously motionless at the top of its swing. This energy is proportional to both the mass of the bob and its height above the lowest point. As the bob descends and picks up speed, its potential energy is gradually converted to kinetic energy (energy of movement), which is proportional to the bob's mass and to the square of its speed. When the bob is at the bottom of its travel, it has maximum kinetic energy and minimum potential energy. The same process then happens in reverse as the bob climbs towards the top of its swing. Some resonant objects have more than one resonance frequency, particularly at harmonics (multiples) of the strongest resonance. It will vibrate easily at those frequencies, and less so at other frequencies. It will \\"pick out\\" its resonance frequency from a complex excitation, such as an impulse or a wideband noise excitation. In effect, it is filtering out all frequencies other than its resonance. In the example above, the swing cannot easily be excited by harmonic frequencies, but can be excited by subharmonics. Examples Resonance Rings exhibit at California Science Center Various examples of mechanical resonance include: *Musical instruments (acoustic resonance). *Most clocks keep time by mechanical resonance in a balance wheel, pendulum, or quartz crystal. *Tidal resonance of the Bay of Fundy. *Orbital resonance as in some moons of the solar system's gas giants. *The resonance of the basilar membrane in the ear. *A wineglass breaking when someone sings a loud note at exactly the right pitch. Resonance may cause violent swaying motions in constructed structures, such as bridges and buildings. The London Millennium Footbridge (nicknamed the Wobbly Bridge) exhibited this problem. A faulty bridge can even be destroyed by its resonance (see Broughton Suspension Bridge and Angers Bridge). Mechanical systems store potential energy in different forms. For example, a spring/mass system stores energy as tension in the spring, which is ultimately stored as the energy of bonds between atoms. Resonance disaster In mechanics and construction a resonance disaster describes the destruction of a building or a technical mechanism by induced vibrations at a system's resonance frequency, which causes it to oscillate. Periodic excitation optimally transfers to the system the energy of the vibration and stores it there. Because of this repeated storage and additional energy input the system swings ever more strongly, until its load limit is exceeded. Tacoma Narrows Bridge The dramatic, rhythmic twisting that resulted in the 1940 collapse of \\"Galloping Gertie\\", the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge, is sometimes characterized in physics textbooks as a classic example of resonance. The catastrophic vibrations that destroyed the bridge were due to an oscillation caused by interactions between the bridge and the winds passing through its structure‚Äîa phenomenon known as aeroelastic flutter. Robert H. Scanlan, father of the field of bridge aerodynamics, wrote an article about this.K. Billah and R. Scanlan (1991), Resonance, Tacoma Narrows Bridge Failure, and Undergraduate Physics Textbooks, American Journal of Physics, 59(2), 118‚Äì124 (PDF) Other examples * Collapse of Broughton Suspension Bridge (due to soldiers walking in step) * Collapse of Angers Bridge * Collapse of K√∂nigs Wusterhausen Central Tower * Resonance of the Millennium Bridge Applications Various method of inducing mechanical resonance in a medium exist. Mechanical waves can be generated in a medium by subjecting an electromechanical element to an alternating electric field having a frequency which induces mechanical resonance and is below any electrical resonance frequency.Allensworth, et al., United States Patent 4,524,295. June 18, 1985 Such devices can apply mechanical energy from an external source to an element to mechanically stress the element or apply mechanical energy produced by the element to an external load. The United States Patent Office classifies devices that tests mechanical resonance under subclass 579, resonance, frequency, or amplitude study, of Class 73, Measuring and testing. This subclass is itself indented under subclass 570, Vibration.USPTO, Class 73, Measuring and testing Such devices test an article or mechanism by subjecting it to a vibratory force for determining qualities, characteristics, or conditions thereof, or sensing, studying or making analysis of the vibrations otherwise generated in or existing in the article or mechanism. Devices include right methods to cause vibrations at a natural mechanical resonance and measure the frequency and/or amplitude the resonance made. Various devices study the amplitude response over a frequency range is made. This includes nodal points, wave lengths, and standing wave characteristics measured under predetermined vibration conditions.

In 1871 the year in which Local Fund Act came into force and educational rates were abolished, the school was taken over by the Local Fund Board. In 1877 the school became a Government High School and in 1884, it was handed over by the Government to the management of the school. In January 1888 the High School was raised to the rank of a Second Grade College and was affiliated to the University of Madras under the management of Municipal Council, Government undertaking to bear the net cost of the College Department. The Municipal Council resolved to work the institution on the salary-grant-system from 1894.In 1905 the Government declared the college to be self-supporting and discontinued the salary grant. In 1913 a hostel with furnished accommodation for 100 students was opened. In accordance with the resolution passed at a meeting of Palghat Municipal Council held in December 1917, unanimously requesting th Government to take over the management of the college, the institution was taken over by the Government of Madras Presidency in 1919. The college was raised to First Grade in 1925 with provisions for teaching of History, Philosophy and Mathematics optionals in B.A classes. All classes below Fourth Form were transferred to the control of the Municipal Council, Palakkad in the same year. The High School classes were also transferred in 1933. In 1939 the college was affiliated for the teaching of Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry as main subjects for BSc Degree Examination and Zoology and Electrical Engineering as subsidiary subjects. In 1944 Economics was introduced for B.A and Hindi as part II language in all classes. In 1945 Geography was added to the optional in the Intermediate and in 1947, Group V Malayalam for the B.A. As a result of formation of Linguistic Provinces, the college was affiliated to Kerala University in 1957. The college celebrated its centenary on a grant scale in February 1968 based on starting of rate school, again it celebrated its centenary in the year 1989 based on the starting of the college. The college is now affiliated to Calicut University and has been recognized as a Centre of Excellence by the Government of Kerala.

A tesla coil is a high-Q resonant circuit. Electrical resonance occurs in an electric circuit at a particular resonant frequency when the impedances or admittances of circuit elements cancel each other. In some circuits, this happens when the impedance between the input and output of the circuit is almost zero and the transfer function is close to one. Resonant circuits exhibit ringing and can generate higher voltages and currents than are fed into them. They are widely used in wireless (radio) transmission for both transmission and reception. LC circuits Resonance of a circuit involving capacitors and inductors occurs because the collapsing magnetic field of the inductor generates an electric current in its windings that charges the capacitor, and then the discharging capacitor provides an electric current that builds the magnetic field in the inductor. This process is repeated continually. An analogy is a mechanical pendulum, and both are a form of simple harmonic oscillator. At resonance, the series impedance of the two elements is at a minimum and the parallel impedance is at maximum. Resonance is used for tuning and filtering, because it occurs at a particular frequency for given values of inductance and capacitance. It can be detrimental to the operation of communications circuits by causing unwanted sustained and transient oscillations that may cause noise, signal distortion, and damage to circuit elements. Parallel resonance or near- to-resonance circuits can be used to prevent the waste of electrical energy, which would otherwise occur while the inductor built its field or the capacitor charged and discharged. As an example, asynchronous motors waste inductive current while synchronous ones waste capacitive current. The use of the two types in parallel makes the inductor feed the capacitor, and vice versa, maintaining the same resonant current in the circuit, and converting all the current into useful work. Since the inductive reactance and the capacitive reactance are of equal magnitude, :\\\\omega L = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\omega C}~, so :\\\\omega = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{LC\\\\,}}~, where \\\\omega = 2\\\\pi f\\\\,, in which is the resonance frequency in hertz, is the inductance in henries, and is the capacitance in farads, when standard SI units are used. The quality of the resonance (how long it will ring when excited) is determined by its , which is a function of resistance: Q = \\\\tfrac{1}{R}\\\\sqrt{\\\\tfrac{L}{C}\\\\,}\\\\,. An idealized, lossless circuit has infinite , but all actual circuits have some resistance and finite , and are usually approximated more realistically by an circuit. RLC circuit A series RLC circuit: a resistor, inductor, and a capacitor An RLC circuit (or LCR circuit) is an electrical circuit consisting of a resistor, an inductor, and a capacitor, connected in series or in parallel. The RLC part of the name is due to those letters being the usual electrical symbols for resistance, inductance and capacitance respectively. The circuit forms a harmonic oscillator for current and resonates similarly to an LC circuit. The main difference stemming from the presence of the resistor is that any oscillation induced in the circuit decays over time if it is not kept going by a source. This effect of the resistor is called damping. The presence of the resistance also reduces the peak resonant frequency of damped oscillation, although the resonant frequency for driven oscillations remains the same as an LC circuit. Some resistance is unavoidable in real circuits, even if a resistor is not specifically included as a separate component. A pure LC circuit is an ideal that exists only in theory. There are many applications for this circuit. It is used in many different types of oscillator circuits. An important application is for tuning, such as in radio receivers or television sets, where they are used to select a narrow range of frequencies from the ambient radio waves. In this role the circuit is often referred to as a tuned circuit. An RLC circuit can be used as a band-pass filter, band-stop filter, low-pass filter or high-pass filter. The tuning application, for instance, is an example of band-pass filtering. The RLC filter is described as a second-order circuit, meaning that any voltage or current in the circuit can be described by a second-order differential equation in circuit analysis. The three circuit elements can be combined in a number of different topologies. All three elements in series or all three elements in parallel are the simplest in concept and the most straightforward to analyse. There are, however, other arrangements, some with practical importance in real circuits. One issue often encountered is the need to take into account inductor resistance. Inductors are typically constructed from coils of wire, the resistance of which is not usually desirable, but it often has a significant effect on the circuit.  Example  A series RLC circuit has resistance of 4 Œ©, and inductance of 500 mH, and a variable capacitance. Supply voltage is 100 V alternating at 50 Hz. At resonance X_L = X_C. The capacitance required to give series resonance is calculated as: :X_C = X_L = 2 \\\\pi f L = 2\\\\pi \\\\times 50\\\\ Hz \\\\times 0.5\\\\ H = 157.1\\\\ \\\\Omega :C = \\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\pi f X_C} = \\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\pi \\\\times 50\\\\ Hz \\\\times 157.1\\\\ \\\\Omega} = 20.3\\\\ \\\\mu F Resonance voltages across the inductor and the capacitor, V_L and V_C, will be: :I = \\\\frac{V}{Z}= 100\\\\ V/ 4\\\\ \\\\Omega = 25\\\\ A :V_L = V_C = I X_L = 25\\\\ A \\\\times 157.1\\\\ \\\\Omega = 3927.5\\\\ V As shown in this example, when the series RLC circuit is at resonance, the magnitudes of the voltages across the inductor and capacitor can become many times larger than the supply voltage.

He served as President of the four-person Executive Board of the Vatican's Financial Information Authority (FIA) from January 2011 until January 2014. Biography Nicora was born in Varese, Italy and ordained a priest in 1964. Prior to being ordained, he had earned a license in Canon law from the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome as well as a license in theology from the Theological Faculty in Milan. After his ordination, he became a professor of canon law at the Theological Seminary of Venegano. Nicora first became a bishop in 1977, when he was appointed auxiliary bishop of Milan and titular bishop of Furnos Minor. Nicora oversaw the 1984 revision of the concordat, between Italy and the Vatican. From 1992 to 1997, he served as bishop of Verona. In 2002, Nicora became President of Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See, where his responsibility was administering the Vatican's income from properties. This position is comparable to that of a chief financial officer in a corporation. Upon the death of a Pope all major Vatican officials automatically lose their positions during a sede vacante, and so Nicora lost his position on 2 April 2005 due to the death of Pope John Paul II but later was confirmed to office by Pope Benedict XVI on 21 April. Nicora was made Cardinal-Deacon of San Filippo Neri in Eurosia in 2003 by Pope John Paul II. He participated in the Papal conclave 2005 that elected Pope Benedict XVI and again in the Papal conclave 2013 that elected Pope Francis. On 19 January 2011, Pope Benedict XVI named Cardinal Nicora the President of the four-person Executive Board of the Vatican's recently established Financial Information Authority (FIA). The agency is charged with monitoring the monetary and commercial activities of Vatican agencies, such as the Governorate of Vatican City State, the Vatican Bank, the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See, the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, and smaller agencies such as the Vatican Pharmacy, the Vatican Supermarket, and the Vatican Museums. On 30 January 2014, Pope Francis accepted his resignation from that position and named Bishop Giorgio Corbellini to succeed him as Interim President of the Executive Board of the Authority. Pope Benedict XVI appointed Cardinal Nicora Pontifical Legate for the Basilicas of St. Francis and St. Mary of the Angels in Assisi. After being a cardinal-deacon for ten years, he was promoted to cardinal-priest by Pope Francis on 12 June 2014. Nicora died in a hospital in Rome on 22 April 2017.

It is a member of the and plays at the Southfields Recreation Ground. The club is affiliated to the Somerset County FA. History Believed to be one of the oldest clubs in the county of Somerset, Radstock Town Football Club's official year of foundation, as recognised by The Football Association, was 1895, although there is evidence that appears to show that a Radstock team was playing as early as the 1860s. After playing in the Western League in 1897‚Äì98 as Radstock, they rejoined the League as Radstock Town in 1903‚Äì04, along with near neighbours Welton Rovers but resigned at the end of the 1910‚Äì11 season. They again rejoined the League after the First World War and the 1920s were to see a number of top six finishes. Indeed, 1923‚Äì24 was the club's most successful season, finishing as runners up to Lovell's Athletic by six points. In the early days the club played home games at Roundhill, where the 'A' team and some youth section sides still play, before moving to Southill Park for a number of years, where their stay was enforced because of an American tank division being billeted at Southfield during the Second World War. The original move to Southfield took place in 1927, when as a First World War memorial the miners purchased the field through an issue of ¬£5 shares. Unfortunately, it appears that the issue was not totally successful and as a consequence the control of the ground was gifted to the then Urban District Council and the Miners Welfare, who remain ultimately responsible for the area to this day. The club's lengthy spell in the League came to an end after the 1959‚Äì60 season, when they, along with a number of other Somerset clubs ‚Äì including Clandown, Frome Town, Peasedown Miners Welfare and Street ‚Äì left to join county leagues. Radstock- along with Frome Town and Clandown ‚Äì chose to compete in the Wiltshire League, and won the championship in 1965‚Äì66 and 1966‚Äì67. In the 1970s Radstock switched to the Somerset County League, which they won in 1976‚Äì77 and again in 1978‚Äì79. Radstock rejoined the Western League for the 1979‚Äì80 season. They spent the next few years either in Division One or at the foot of the Premier Division. At the end of the 1993‚Äì94 season Radstock were relegated to the Somerset County League, where they remained for ten seasons before gaining promotion after finishing in third place in 2003‚Äì04. The following season, third place in Division One was sufficient to ensure another promotion and the club is now established back in the Premier Division of the Western League. With thirteen victories to its name the club has won the Somerset Senior Cup on more occasions than any other side in the county. The first time was in the competition's inaugural year of 1895‚Äì96 when they defeated Wells City 4‚Äì0 in a replayed final at Midsomer Norton. Other victories came in 1905‚Äì06, 1927‚Äì28, 1929‚Äì30, 1931‚Äì32, 1936‚Äì37, 1938‚Äì39, 1959‚Äì60, 1963‚Äì64, 1965‚Äì66, 1973‚Äì74, 1982‚Äì83 and 1984‚Äì85.

History The urban area of Orkanger was established as a municipality on 1 July 1920 when it was separated from Orkdal municipality. Initially, it had a population of 1,715. The municipality encompassed the urban area and some of the surrounding countryside. It was an important port, but it did not have the designation of a town at that time. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1963, the municipality of Orkanger ceased to exist and it was merged into the larger municipality of Orkdal. Prior to the merger, Orkanger had 2,874 residents. In 2014, the municipality of Orkdal declared Orkanger to be a \\"town\\". Municipal council During its time as an independent municipality, the municipal council of Orkanger was made up of representatives that were elected to four year terms.

After the 4th century the port was abandoned, because of the Roman Empire crisis and the end of the trade between Rome and India.

They have been used to record scenes for many feature films. The recording framerate of Varicam cameras can be varied between at least 1 to 60 frames per second, offering flexibility in creating rapid or slow motion effects. Because film has traditionally been shot at 24 frames per second, while NTSC video uses 29.97 frames per second, Varicams can be used for both high end video and film production. Panasonic applied the VariCam brand for the first time to the AJ-HDC27. Although the initial capital costs of the cameras are high, their low operating cost has made them popular among independent filmmakers, and they are often available to rent from camera rental companies. The Varicam range has now matured into its latest generation, and is widely used in TV production, as well as film.

The new logo, colored silver, features a stylized capital letter \\"V\\", with the right half composed of blocks, intended to represent both frames of film and digital bits.In the original logo, the right half of the \\"V\\" was claw-shaped in homage to the intermittent mechanism used to advance film. History VariCam HDC27 on tripod Panasonic announced the first generation VariCam, designated model number AJ-HDC27VThe first VariCam was also designated the AJ-HDC27 to distinguish it from a similar camera in the same chassis that did not offer variable frame rates, AJ-HDC27A. The HDC27V was billed as a \\"Multi-Frame Rate HD Cinema Camera\\" and did not carry the VariCam branding. Refer to the 2001 list of Panasonic broadcast & professional video camcorders. By 2002, the model number was changed to HDC27 and sported the VariCam logo. Refer to the 2001 list of Panasonic broadcast & professional video camcorders. However, according to the brochure, the VariCam-branded HDC27 was actually the AJ-HDC27F. (originally the AJ-HDC24A) on April 22, 2001. A similar camera had been introduced with a fixed 60 frames per second frame rate two months earlier. It recorded 720p video to DVCPRO tape at frame rates in integer increments between 4 and 60 frames per second. The BBC filmed the natural history series Planet Earth using HDC27FE Varicams. The second generation VariCam, the AJ-HDC27H, offered improved performance with the same basic features thanks to internal tweaks. The AJ-HDC27H was launched in 2005. Panasonic launched two new Varicams, the AJ-HPX2700 and the AJ-HPX3700, in 2008. These new models feature Panasonic's P2 solid state media technology, representing a major advance for the VariCam line. The AJ-HPX3700 is the flagship model providing full potential 1080p capability and dual link HD-SDI output, while the HPX2700 offers more flexible frame rates at a reduced 720p resolution. NASA captured footage of a Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster recovery mission in 2011 using a HPX3700 in 1080p at 24 frames per second (fps). In 2013, Panasonic announced the development of a 4K Varicam, with promised availability in 2014. On February 27, 2014, Panasonic announced the Varicam 35 (AU-V35C1), a camera that features a 4K CMOS Super 35-sized sensor capable of filming up to 120fps. It was announced alongside the Varicam HS (AU-V23HS1), a 3CMOS 2/3\\"-sensor camera capable of filming up to 240fps in Full HD. The Varicam 35 and HS are modular systems that can be separated into camera and recorder modules, with the 35 and HS sharing a common recorder, Panasonic model number AU-VREC1. The Varicam LT and PURE, introduced separately approximately six months apart in 2016, are both derived from the Varicam 35. The LT (AU-V35LT1G) is a more compact solution coupling the same sensor from the Varicam 35 with an integrated recorder (dropping the modular camera/recorder concept used in the 35 and HS), and the PURE, jointly developed with Codex Digital, uses the same camera section as the Varicam 35 (AU-V35C1G) but sends uncompressed RAW data to a computer with a newly developed recording module (AU-VCXRAW2).

Until Eden Riegel assumed the role, portraying the character from July 2000 to January 2010, the character was portrayed solely by child actresses: Lacey Chabert, Nathalie Paulding, Gina Gallagher, Caroline Wilde and Jessica Leigh Falborn. When Riegel decided to permanently exit the role, plans to recast were confirmed; in June 2010, Christina Bennett Lind replaced Riegel, and remained on the series through the original television finale episode, which aired September 23, 2011. In February 2013, it was announced that Riegel would be reprising her role as Bianca in a guest-arc on Prospect Park's continuation of All My Children. Bianca is scripted as the daughter of Erica Kane and the late Travis Montgomery, born onscreen on February 8, 1988. Her birthday was revised to February 9, 1984 on January 31, 2002 by the show's producers, and her age was stated as 16 in 2000. The middle name given to the character is Christine, after her paternal aunt, Christine Montgomery, and she is portrayed as sweet-natured and well-loved in the fictional community of Pine Valley. Shown to suffer from Reye's syndrome in infancy, as well as anorexia nervosa later in life, she overcomes both with the significant aid of her family. Outside of fiction, Bianca has emerged as a gay icon within the LGBT community. Newspapers such as The New York Times cite her as the first lead character on a major daytime drama to be a lesbian, and The Advocate calls her \\"the most famous gay soap role of all time.\\" She has been the subject and study of various academic works, said to have inspired soap opera writers to begin with the scripting of sexual identities of tortured teen characters, and is a heroine.Article cites its top heroines during Satin Slayer storyline. Bianca one of its most beloved. Under Riegel's portrayal, her popularity has been cited as groundbreaking. Background=Casting and character creation As a teenager, Eden Riegel gave up on her pursuit of a successful acting career. She stated that she had seen a \\"number of talented people\\" who were struggling, and that she started to doubt whether she would ever have the success that she wanted. She decided that it was time to major in social and political theory, go to law school, and become a lawyer. This changed while she attended Harvard. While there, she received \\"a call from a casting director who thought that the five-foot-six beauty should audition to become Erica Kane‚Äôs daughter.\\" Later, the character would eventually be revealed to be a lesbian. Producers did not tell Riegel she would be portraying a lesbian until after she won the role. \\"I was surprised,\\" she said. All My Children creator Agnes Nixon cites that scripting Bianca as a lesbian was in part inspired by Chastity Bono's memoir Family Outing. Nixon explained the feelings she wanted expressed with the character's mother, Erica. She wanted to showcase the thought process and actions \\"most parents\\" have upon finding out that their child is gay: \\"I think the right word for Erica's reaction is denial,\\" said Nixon. \\"I read Family Outing by Chastity Bono. Cher had loads of friends who were gay, but she wasn't able to deal with [Chastity's being gay]. In this prejudicial society in which we live, the first reaction from a parent usually is, 'What did I do wrong?'\\" Nixon, well known for her socially relevant storylines, said that the makings for the Bianca story began in 1947; a college housemate \\"came out\\" to Nixon when Nixon was the same age Riegel had been in 2000. Nixon acknowledged that their original lesbian story in 1983, which lasted two months, did not work out as well as she had hoped and she felt it needed perfecting. \\"Now, in a soap, if you want to do a story about a social issue seriously, the character has to be really well integrated. Bianca's story is the result of that -- with growth and maturity,\\" she stated. Riegel discussed Bianca's storyline with her sister, Tatiana. Tatiana, who is a lesbian and eighteen years Riegel's senior, became one of the primary people Riegel wanted to impress with the storyline. With Tatiana living in Los Angeles, where she works as a film editor and Riegel having lived on the East Coast most of her early life, the sisters did not grow up together but maintained a close relationship. Riegel took the role as an opportunity to bond with Tatiana over a character project, and said Tatiana was one of the people she was most concerned about in portraying Bianca's story. At the time of Bianca's character development upon Riegel taking over the role, there were strict instructions from the show's writers and producers not to reveal Bianca as gay to anyone outside the show (as the storyline had not played out on television screens yet). Despite this, Riegel informed Tatiana two months before the storyline finally began. The revelation was easily envisioned by the sisters as a storyline from a soap opera due to Riegel having told Tatiana Bianca's secret on the day of their father's third wedding. Tatiana said that Riegel was \\"very excited\\" about informing her of Bianca's sexual orientation and that she was happy for her sister. \\"I just thought it was a kick that she would be playing a lesbian -- specifically, Erica Kane's daughter!\\" said Tatiana. Tatiana did have her concerns about the storyline. She did not want the show to do a gay stereotype. Riegel voiced the same concerns earlier on about the character; she clarified that she asked the show's writers and producers to make the character three-dimensional and not \\"so heavily centered\\" on the character's sexual orientation. Having grown up close to an out lesbian sister, who \\"came out\\" in her early 20s, Riegel was familiar with how Bianca should be if stereotypes were to be avoided. At the time of Tatiana's \\"coming-out\\" process, Riegel and brother Sam were children. Tatiana relayed that being gay was not an issue and that she could not remember having had a conversation with them about it at that age. By the time Riegel and Sam were old enough to know what being gay meant, they had grown to love Tatiana's girlfriend and the family was closer than before. Riegel having acquired the role of Bianca led her and Tatiana to discuss certain specifics of the character. Riegel's mindset was centered on what it must have been like for Tatiana to grow up as gay. She said that she had never heard Tatiana's whole coming-out story before and that it was nice to talk about. A year and a half after Bianca's \\"coming out\\" as a lesbian, Riegel and Tatiana felt that the show had done \\"a great job\\" in telling the story of a gay woman and her struggles. Characterization, story influence and recast In a Variety magazine interview, Julie Hanan Carruthers, executive producer of the show, spoke of Bianca's character development. She gave insight into the \\"heart\\" of the story. \\"It was so successful,\\" she said. \\"We did not tell a story about a lesbian. We told a story about a young girl coming out and her life around it. That was a big lesson to all of us here. It's really all about the story. If you can make people care on a human level, it's not sexual preference. It's about the human experience.\\" The writers characterized Bianca's personality as kind-hearted but intolerant of nonsense. These traits were given to reflect the personalities of her parents and her late grandmother (Mona). Additionally, other characters in Bianca's family have been written as protective. Megan McTavish, the show's head writer at the time, said she was \\"most astonished that fans elevated Bianca into one of the serial's 'tent poles' -- soap parlance for characters who hold enormous sway with viewers\\". McTavish explained that if a character is nice to Bianca, the audience tends to like that character, and if he is mean to Bianca, the audience knows he is a bad guy. \\"It's stunning,\\" she cited. \\"The lesbian girl became the moral tent pole of our show.\\" In a 2007 interview with TV Guide, former head writers of the series, James Harmon Brown and Barbara Esensten, stated that since Riegel's portrayal, the character is simply too iconic to ever recast. However, in 2010, Riegel decided to permanently exit the role, and plans to recast were subsequently confirmed. TV Guide's Nelson Branco said, \\"Recasting a superstar is a very risky move, but [All My Children] is clearly determined to test fate.\\" In a March 30, 2010 interview with Soap Opera Digest, Riegel explained why she decided to move on from the character: > I had tried to make it work with All My Children. I don‚Äôt have a business > head, so I don‚Äôt really make business decisions; every decision I make in my > life is emotional and it was difficult to feel that the show wasn‚Äôt... that > Bianca was getting lost. That who she was, was getting lost. I went back > several times and they were so lovely to let me come back and play a > character I love with the people I love so many times. But I felt that the > people making the show didn‚Äôt really understand what Bianca was about > anymore... It troubled me. I got letters from people to whom Bianca meant a > great deal essentially saying, \\"Please don‚Äôt come back. We can't take it > anymore.\\" On May 13, 2010, it was reported that All My Children had found a recast for the character, after a \\"long and careful\\" search. Actress Christina Bennett Lind, cited as having an \\"astonishing\\" resemblance to Riegel, was cast. \\"[Lind] oozes goodness and we really needed that for Bianca. [Lind] brought an integrity and honest innocence to the role that was very tough to match,\\" stated Carruthers. \\"We turned the earth [upside down] going through the candidates. When [Lind] came in to read for the part, she was Bianca. I think it‚Äôll be a very easy transition for the audience.\\" Although Riegel said it would be \\"very painful\\" to watch someone else portray Bianca, and that she would not want to watch, she later tweeted, \\"[All My Children] gets a new Bianca and she's super pretty! And, of course, by that I mean she looks like me. I wish her the very best of luck, of course, and will be cheering her on along with the rest of the [All My Children] fans.\\" Lind regarded this as a compliment, and was appreciative of the support. Lind said of assuming the role, \\"The audition for Bianca felt like an amusement park ride. It was such a thrill to go to an audition by plane rather than subway! I can only hope I do half of what [Riegel] did with the part. She played it with amazing grace and dignity. Now I need to breathe my own life into it.\\" Regarding Bianca being the \\"moral center of Pine Valley\\" and the pressure of being a recast, Lind said she did feel pressure in the beginning. \\"I did look at some of [Riegel's] footage online to prep for it. She, for obvious reasons, was so beautiful, real, and honest in her portrayal of Bianca.\\" Lind stated that it ultimately came down to her not wanting to mimic Riegel: > Part of me feels very strongly that [Riegel] created a character that was so > well-written, detailed, and complicated, and the element of being gay was > part of who she was, but it did not define her. I sort of wanted to take > that and breathe my own life into it and do something else by using myself > rather than using someone else‚Äôs interpretation. I understand these emotions > and all humans do, of wanting to support your family and be equal and be in > love. Ultimately, I said, \\"I can feel the pressure, but I am going to let it > go.\\" The role is so full and rich that I thought, Well, now I am just going > to throw myself into it. Lind said there was no trepidation in taking on a gay role, and that she is \\"really proud\\" to portray Bianca. \\"I am surprised that the gay community is still struggling and fighting so many years later,\\" she said. \\"They are still fighting for basic human rights. I am excited to be a part of that fight.\\" Regarding most of Pine Valley being okay with Bianca being gay, Lind stated that she is \\"a little curious\\" to see some \\"sort of real-life conflict arrive and see that some people in her small town do not accept her sexuality.\\" Lind clarified, \\"In a sense, that is pretty relevant and controversial and true. Because Pine Valley is the exception, it‚Äôs a beautiful utopia right now. I wouldn‚Äôt mind attacking those issues that are happening in small towns right now.\\" Storyline As a child, Bianca originally appears on a recurring basis on All My Children. She was born on-screen in 1988, the out-of-wedlock daughter of Erica Kane and Travis Montgomery. Erica and Travis later wed, but the marriage soon collapses after Travis helps stage a fake kidnapping of Bianca in order to prevent Adam Chandler from taking over his company. Two years later, as Bianca is recovering from Reye's syndrome, Erica and Travis remarry for their daughter's sake. However, by that time Erica is having a secret affair with Travis' brother Jackson, and as soon as Bianca catches them kissing, she sets her \\"Uncle Jack\\" doll on fire and ends up burning the house down. After that incident, Travis divorces Erica, wins full custody of Bianca, moves to Seattle, and remarries his ex-wife, Barbara. Although Bianca is living with her father, she visits her mother from time to time. In 1993, Kendall Hart arrives, Erica's first-born daughter Erica gave birth to at age 14 and gave up for adoption to the Harts, a couple from Florida, after becoming pregnant when she was raped on her 14th birthday by movie actor Richard Fields. A now 9- to 10-year-old Bianca becomes a target of her older half-sister's jealousy when Kendall's identity is revealed and she is reunited with Erica. Kendall, hurt she was given up for adoption, believes Bianca (in Kendall's view) had the life she should have always had too while Bianca is upset that she is not Erica's only daughter. Though she, Erica, Kendall, and her new stepfather, Dimitri, try to make their family work, Bianca and Kendall often bicker with each other, competing for Erica's attention. Bianca ruins Kendall's bridesmaid's dress and Kendall manipulates Bianca, ignoring her sister's cries when she later hears them from the Wildwind crypt after Bianca accidentally locks herself inside. In 1994, when Bianca looks for Kendall at a motel, Richard Fields finds her and attempts to molest her. However, Kendall stops him and saves Bianca from Fields before any assault occurs. In August 1994, Bianca comes to Pine Valley again following the death of Mona Kane Tyler, so overwhelmed by her loss and furious that she did not get to spend much time with her grandmother. Later, Bianca is kidnapped by Dr. Jonathan Kinder and held her for ransom. Kinder is Erica's doctor and has her hooked on painkillers. In self-defense, Bianca pushes Kinder down his stairs. Erica thinks he is dead, and so with help from Janet Green and Skye Chandler, they bury Kinder, but he is very much alive. After Erica is arrested in 1997 for kidnapping Madelyn Grey, the daughter of Edmund Grey and Maria Santos, Bianca runs away from Travis and Barbara to be with her mother. Travis and Barbara then arrive to take Bianca home, but after Travis tells them that Erica would never see Bianca again, Bianca faints and is rushed to the hospital. Bianca is diagnosed with anorexia nervosa and by 1998 ends up hospitalized with a feeding tube. She then goes to a New England rehabilitation center to recover. Sixteen-year-old Bianca (her birth date 1984 now revised by the series) returns home in 2000, stunning her mother, Erica, by confessing that she is in a lesbian relationship with a girl named Sarah. Erica is unable to accept this, but Bianca does find support from Leo du Pres, who often counsels her on life matters. This earns her some jealousy from Greenlee Smythe, who tauntingly calls her LesBianca, but she and Bianca later become friends. This stemmed from Greenlee taking Bianca to see her daughter's supposed memorial, and she gave her a necklace that Leo had given her, and she passed on to her. Sarah's family also disapproves, and to appease them she gets engaged to a man, despite still loving Bianca. Bianca's second girlfriend, Frankie Stone, comes to Pine Valley as part of her aunt Vanessa Cortlandt's ploy to distract Bianca. Frankie develops true feelings for Bianca, but is then murdered by one of Vanessa's henchmen. Soon after, Frankie's identical twin sister, Maggie, arrives and becomes friends with Bianca, often defending her when she is bullied by homophobic classmates. Despite Maggie professing to being heterosexual, she shows a romantic interest in Bianca, which is reciprocated; however, their relationship does not progress past friendship and Bianca begins dating another woman, Polish-born Lena Kundera. Bianca works with Lena at Erica's company, Enchantment Cosmetics. They fall in love, and share a chaste kiss in 2003 while at an airport. Though the relationship is tested when Bianca discovers Michael Cambias, owner of a rival cosmetics firm, has employed Lena to spy on Enchantment Cosmetics, they remain together. In July 2003, Bianca is raped by Michael. She internalizes her rage and only tells Maggie, but eventually the entire town of Pine Valley learns the truth, which brings Bianca and her estranged mother closer. Michael is charged with rape but, to the town's outrage, he is acquitted. When Bianca discovers she is pregnant as a result of rape, Kendall, who had so often scorned Bianca in their past, unconditionally supports her sister and does not give an opinion on Bianca's choices. Michael disappears and Kendall announces she has married her sister's rapist, who shortly turns up dead with Kendall having become the primary suspect in his murder. When Bianca tells Kendall she is keeping her baby, also inspired by Kendall being part of her life, Kendall helps her sister and, with Maggie and Lena's help, aids her in hiding her pregnancy from everyone, including Erica. Kendall announces she is pregnant by Michael, which is also used by her lawyers to help avoid a murder charge and Bianca helps Kendall fake the pregnancy. Bianca and Kendall's ruse is aided by Dr. David Hayward, Ryan Lavery, Lena, Maggie, Reggie Montgomery, and Jackson. The truth eventually comes out that Bianca is the killer but blocked it out and that Kendall, with Reggie's help, worked to cover it up in an effort to protect Bianca; Bianca shot Michael in self-defense but the trauma of her rape led to her repressing the memory. After hearing Bianca's confession, the judge presiding over the case leans hard on the prosecution not to file any charges against her. While Erica tries to protect her daughters throughout the trial, she lashes out at them for keeping the truth from her. Bianca gives birth to a daughter named Miranda in 2004, at a cabin which Bianca and Babe became stranded at during a thunderstorm. After a difficult birth for Bianca, Babe Carey goes to get help and ends up going into labor herself. Babe gives birth to a son with the help of her former husband Paul Cramer, whom she had called for help. During the commotion, Paul secretly kidnaps Babe's son and gives her Miranda instead, whilst claiming to Bianca that her daughter perished in a helicopter crash, which he had staged. Miranda is renamed Bess. Bianca grieves for her lost child, and even tries to kidnap Bess, not realizing she is her actual daughter. As she mourns, Bianca and Kendall become close with their mother again. When Bianca discovers the truth, she attempts to reclaim her daughter, but falls from a balcony during a scuffle with Miranda's acting father, JR Chandler, and ends up comatose. Miranda is later returned to Bianca, causing her to awake from her coma. Bianca never remembers how she fell, whether or not JR pushed her, but she holds him responsible for her fall. In addition, Bianca cannot forgive Babe, who had previously discovered Miranda/Bess's true maternity, but could not part with the child. Bianca's relationship with Lena ends when Lena returns to Poland, and her relationship with Maggie subsequently becomes an issue again, as Bianca realizes that she is still in love with her. Maggie, however, is romantically involved with Jonathan Lavery. After Bianca helps free Maggie from this abusive relationship, they begin to bond again. Though the nature of Bianca and Maggie's relationship is not specified, they, along with Miranda, relocate to Paris in 2005. While there, Bianca heads up the international division of Cambias Industries, which Enchantment now owns. Bianca and Maggie become lovers and are happy together, but in 2007, Bianca returns to Pine Valley alone. She states Maggie has cheated on her with another woman. Maggie follows her, hoping for reconciliation, but despite loving her, Bianca declines. Family problems resurface due to Bianca's sexuality, but this time from her conservative former stepmother Barbara, who denounces her lifestyle, but eventually sees the error of her ways. Bianca rebuilds her friendship with Babe upon finding out that Babe, who was pronounced dead as a result of a serial killer's killing spree, is alive. She then reciprocates the romantic feelings Zarf (later known as Zoe), a transgender lesbian rock star, has for her. Zoe later tells her that at this point in her transition process, a romantic relationship between them would not be best; Zoe is not ready for it, and instead moves to London. Bianca decides to move to Paris to be closer to Zoe, but returns on December 26, 2007 for a brief visit, cheering her family up following their recent traumas. Bianca reveals that she and Zoe drifted apart, but she is determined to provide a stable family unit for Miranda. After bidding farewell, she departs again on December 28, 2007. On October 17, 2008, Zach Slater is in the process of looking for wife Kendall buried under rubble due to a tornado having just struck Pine Valley. He finds Bianca instead, and is surprised to see that she is pregnant. He later finds an unconscious Kendall. As an ambulance arrives for her, it is stated that there is not enough room for Bianca and Zach to ride along to the hospital. There is, however, enough room for Zach and Kendall's children to ride in the front seat of the ambulance. Zach and Bianca stay behind and discuss Kendall's fate. They also discuss Bianca's secret that she is pregnant with Zach's child via sperm donation, and Bianca's new lover named Reese. Zach had agreed to father Bianca's child for the couple, but did not know that she had gone through with the procedure of artificial insemination, until now. The two wonder how Kendall, who is unaware of this pregnancy, will react to the news when they tell her. As Zach and Bianca continue to talk, Bianca goes into labor. Zach helps deliver the new child into the world. Sometime later at the hospital, she is horrified to discover that Babe has perished in the disaster's aftermath. Reese Williams comes to Pine Valley, not long after the tornado with Miranda. She proposes marriage to Bianca and she accepts. Reese and Bianca have their share of obstacles to overcome as a couple, mainly Bianca's suspicions of Reese's sexuality and friendship with Zach, but they exchange wedding vows on February 13, 2009. Reese and Bianca's marriage does not last long when Bianca discovers that Reese engaged in a passionate kiss with Zach the day before their wedding. She later sends Reese annulment papers, and returns to Paris with Miranda and Gabrielle. However, she comes back to Pine Valley on April 24, 2009 after having discussed with Zach the reasons she left. After later talking over her and Reese's relationship problems with Zach and Kendall, the couple reconcile and hope that they can work their relationship out. They return to Paris together with their children, and later remarry. Bianca returns to Pine Valley to help search for Erica in June 2010, and eventually decides to stay. After Erica is found by Jackson Montgomery, Jack has Miranda and Gabrielle flown to Pine Valley. Currently, Miranda, Gabrielle, and Bianca are living at Wildwind with Caleb Cooney. After Reese decides that she is not coming back to Pine Valley, Bianca reluctantly decides to get a divorce, hiring Marissa Tasker for this end. Marissa warns Bianca that Reese may fight to gain custody of her kids and things may get ugly, but Bianca dismisses her concerns, convinced that she and Reese can end things civilly and that Marissa is merely letting her experience with JR get in the way. However, when Reese sends her lawyer and nanny to Pine Valley in her place with tickets for Miranda and Gabrielle to come back for spring break, Bianca realizes that Marissa's fears may not be completely unfounded. However, Marissa manages to get Jack and Erica to come to Bianca's aid, where Jack forces them to back off and leave. Bianca thanks Marissa and apologizes for doubting her. Bianca is subjected to even further turmoil when she discovers that Reese is indeed trying to obtain full custody of both Miranda and Gabby. On May 26, Bianca discovers that Ricky Torres, a seemingly friendly reverend, is in fact a criminal and the murderer of Zach. Realizing that she is on to him, Ricky assaults her. In the midst of the assault, Bianca remembers getting raped by Michael Cambias and suffers a panic attack. When Marissa comes along and sees Ricky carrying an unconscious Bianca, Ricky knocks her out, ties them up, and locks them in the closet. Upon regaining consciousness, Bianca reveals Ricky's true nature to Marissa, and they manage to escape. Bianca subsequently realizes that she is developing romantic feelings for Marissa. Because of these romantic feelings, Bianca helps JR win Marissa back by suggesting romantic dates and gifts that he can give to Marissa. Bianca does all this because she realizes that Marissa may never reciprocate the same feelings for her. One of the gifts that Bianca gives to JR for Marissa is a music box. This music box plays a song that Marissa's adoptive father used to sing to her when she was a little girl. JR gives the music box to Marissa while at the park with the kids. While Marissa is listening to the music box, Bianca watches from afar how much Marissa enjoys the gift and walks away. On June 24, while on a trip with the kids, Bianca finally confesses her feelings to Marissa. Marissa, surprised, says that she is flattered and loves Bianca, just not in that way. Marissa apologizes and says she is straight. Bianca feels relieved that she got her feelings out in the open and she can now move on. Marissa, now feeling uncomfortable, leaves the trip early for JR's birthday. Marissa, after she slept with JR, thinks about Bianca. When Marissa finds out about Bianca helping JR with trying to win her back, she asks Bianca about. Bianca tells Marissa she did it because Bianca could not do all those things for Marissa herself. Another reason was because it looked like Marissa was falling in love with JR again and because it seemed like JR had changed. Marissa accuses Bianca of manipulating her and the situation. Bianca suggests that they should not see each other for a while and Marissa agrees. On July 12, Marissa finally admits her feelings for Bianca and they kiss. Bianca then pulls away during the kiss, saying that she can't do this and that this is a mistake. Bianca then explains that all her relationships have been a dead end ‚Äì that, in the end, she ends up losing her lover and best friend. However, later on, Bianca walks in as Marissa tells JR that she wants Bianca. Marissa then confesses to both Bianca and JR that she is in love with Bianca. In the following weeks, Bianca and Marissa start dating, much to JR's fury, and discuss moving in together. On September 23, Marissa and Bianca received a text message that they believed was from Scott who invited them to a party at the Chandler mansion to celebrate the resurrection of Stuart Chandler who had been presumed dead for two years until he was revealed to be alive as a part of Project Orpheus. They attended the party and enjoyed celebrating life in Pine Valley when JR, in a drunken rage, shot into the crowd. It is revealed on May 2, 2013 that Marissa died and that she was the one who JR shot. Marissa's father, David, tried to stop JR from pulling the trigger, but the gun misfired. David then threw JR to the floor and shot him and as a result, JR lapsed into a five-year-long coma. David was arrested and jailed for the incident but later returned to Pine Valley after being paroled. Bianca is seen visiting Marissa's grave and updating Marissa on her son AJ and Miranda, whom they had planned to raise together. Bianca tells Marissa that they were supposed to be together and that she will never stop missing her. After JR awakens from his coma, Bianca becomes upset when she sees him, going into a fit of grief and attacking him for killing Marissa. Bianca leaves Pine Valley telling everyone she is going away for work, but she is shown visiting her sister Kendall, who appears to be ill. Cultural impact=Popularity Lena (Olga Sosnovska) and Bianca (Riegel) share the first lesbian kiss in American soap opera history (2003). Bianca has been popular with critics and fans. Her romantic pairing with Lena Kundera resulted in American daytime's first lesbian kiss, which received substantial media attention. The following year, in 2004, Riegel appeared on the cover of Girlfriends, North America‚Äôs only lesbian monthly magazine; the content within the piece discussed Riegel's titled breakthrough lesbian role. Riegel's portrayal of the character incited mania, admiration, and viewers displaying overprotectiveness for the character. Riegel additionally won praise from leading gay groups for her \\"complex portrayal\\" of Bianca. =Daytime and visibility= Bianca's impact on daytime television is considered significant for various reasons: She is cited as a gay icon by soap opera and gay/lesbian media, and is credited as the first long-term lesbian character on an American soap opera. AfterElton.com, a website that focuses on the portrayal of gay men in the media, addressed Bianca's impact on viewers. They noted All My Children creator Agnes Nixon having told The Advocate in 2000 that out-lesbian Chastity Bono's memoir was the inspiration for the Bianca storyline, and that she hoped that outing an already-established character as gay would make for a more integrated storyline. AfterElton.com said the representation of gay and lesbian characters in the media is important when taking into account that the viewing audience for soap operas \\"is enormous.\\" Cited was The Museum of Broadcast Communications' assertion that soap opera is \\"the most effective and enduring broadcast advertising vehicle ever devised. It is also the most popular genre of television drama in the world today and probably in the history of world broadcasting...\\" The museum states that \\"no other form of television fiction has attracted more viewers in more countries over a longer period of time.\\" Author C. Lee Harrington, in her book Homosexuality on All My Children: Transforming the Daytime Landscape, stated that when \\"resident villainess\\" Greenlee Smythe uttered \\"Bianca is gay\\" during Bianca's coming-out storyline, it transformed the daytime landscape and ABC's All My Children entered \\"uncharted territory\\" for daytime television by revealing a core character as a lesbian. Jeffrey Epstein, at the time a staff writer for Soap Opera News, was criticized by AfterElton.com for his statement in 1998, where he discouraged the idea that there would be more gay or lesbian representation to come on daytime television due to soap operas being mostly viewed by women and that gay or lesbian romances do not truly enrich most heterosexual women's fantasies. AfterElton.com relayed that the viewing demographic for soap operas continues to grow and diversify, further clarifying, \\"The popularity of the Bianca storyline on All My Children was proof that audiences were more than ready for a lesbian relationship, and his assessment of women's romantic fantasies in regards to gay male characters may prove to be equally outdated.\\" In 2001, Riegel was voted one of Soaps' Hottest Newcomers by Soap Opera Digest and the following year as one of Soaps' Hottest Teens by the same magazine. Riegel modestly accepted, \\"What does that mean, 'hot?' Does that mean I'm hot, like sexy? I feel pretty damn hot. I wish I knew what it meant. No, that's very flattering.\\" In 2003, Bianca was the winner of the first GLAAD Media Award as Favorite OUT Image. With her win, GLAAD released a statement: Lesbianation.com, self-proclaimed as the leading online community for lesbians, voted Riegel #7 on their top ten list of Women We Love: The Ladies of June '06, stating, \\"We were swamped with requests to add All My Children hottie Eden Riegel to our list this month -- and here she is!\\" Bianca's popularity extended to her romances, as well as to other perceived possibilities; this was evident through the character's relationships with Maggie Stone, Lena Kundera, and Babe Carey. The relationship with Carey was not romantic, as Babe (now deceased within the series) was characterized as heterosexual; however, fans speculated that Bianca was secretly in love with Babe. This speculation was mainly due to Bianca's nonchalant and forgiving attitude regarding most of Babe's misdeeds. AfterEllen.com took notice and acknowledged that there were viewers hoping for a Bianca and Babe romance. =\\"Give Bianca her baby back\\"= In 2004, with Bianca's rape having left her subsequently pregnant with Michael's child, and the baby switch storyline having robbed her of her daughter, viewers were infuriated by what they felt was the pain the character had endured within the year. They additionally found the Bianca and Babe friendship unappealing, specifically due to Babe knowingly keeping Bianca from her own child. Within the story, Babe is initially unaware that her child has been switched with Bianca's and that Bianca's child, the one she is caring for, is still alive and not dead as she had been led to believe. However, once convinced by Krystal to keep Bianca's child as her own in order to save JR from heartbreak, she does as advised. Due to her guilt, she goes as far as to name Bianca godmother of the child. Angered by these events, viewers campaigned for Bianca to discover the truth. The amount of mail sent to the ABC studios requesting and demanding that Bianca's baby be returned to her was cited as astounding for a fictional character, especially one of daytime -- and who is also gay: \\"Bianca's sexuality did not seem to matter to the thousands of fans who wrote letters, e-mail messages, and blog entries insisting that the only safe place for the baby was back in the arms of Pine Valley's one known lesbian.\\" Described as \\"Babe's long-overdue confessional\\" and beginning of redemption, she confesses to Bianca the truth about their children on December 7, 2004.On December 7, AMC fans finally got the moment they had been waiting for: Courtesy of Babe's long-overdue confessional, Bianca discovered that her baby is alive! Here, actresses Alexa Havins (Babe) and Eden Riegel (Bianca) describe what went into taping the big moment. The culmination of this storyline combined with everything Bianca faces up to this point \\"transform[s] Bianca into a courageous soap heroine who ha[s] fans rooting for her.\\" Viewers became even more invested in her trials and tribulations and hopeful for the character finding romance. Brian Frons, president of ABC Daytime, stated: > To have someone like Bianca who is openly gay, a mother, proud of who she > is, who has fallen in love with another woman, who is taking heroic action > -- to have the audience embrace this character fully is pretty incredible. > The audience went from 'I don't want to see a lesbian relationship' to > saying, 'Bianca should be in love.' Havins and Riegel described what went into taping the moment Bianca discovers that her child is alive and Babe's deception. \\"It was crazy!,\\" said Riegel of the \\"grueling\\" day. \\"It was insane, in fact. [Havins] and I were on the set from 9 a.m. to like 7:30 at night, just the two of us.\\" Havins agreed and relayed, \\"It was so intense to tape. It was a long, long day, a 12-hour tape day.\\" They were warned by All My Children executives that the episode would be \\"especially\\" demanding. \\"I don't think they've ever handed that much material to just two actresses before, so they wanted us to be prepared,\\" said Riegel. \\"It was the most dialogue I've ever had in my entire life. To the point where several weeks before they gave me the script, our producer, Julie [Hanan Carruthers], sat us down and said to us, 'This is just so important.,'\\" added Havins. \\"And she turned to me and said, 'We're almost nervous because it's so much material. If it's too much, let us know.' It was that dialogue-heavy.\\" Riegel found humor in the situation and said, \\"Unfortunately, we only got the script like three days ahead of time! But hey! We're old pros.\\" When asked if they were intimidated by the challenge of the reveal scenes, Riegel asserted that she \\"wasn't scared at all,\\" and clarified that it \\"was a good challenge\\" and \\"one of those things where it's like, 'This is what I do. This is what I love.'\\" She said, \\"To have all that material and to be there in the moment ... I didn't want to be in any other place.\\" She found it exciting. Having waited for the moment \\"for a long time,\\" it turned out to be \\"a big pay-off.\\" She added: > But I was a little nervous because this was definitely a very, very special > episode. That was the biggest challenge to me; I was going in there knowing, > 'This is the moment.' I kept having to make myself laugh and leave set and > play with my friends in the hair and makeup room and just sort of try to > view the day as though it was just an average taping day because the last > thing those scenes needed from my character's perspective was that sense of > gravity, that feeling of, 'This is so important.' Because it was not a big > deal for my character ‚Äî she had no idea what was coming. Havins agreed with Riegel that the reveal scenes were exciting. \\"I'm always up for a challenge and I work best under pressure,\\" she said. \\"My competitive side kicks in. So the thought that I maybe couldn't do it made me be like, 'Oh, yeah, I'm doin' it!' We put so much preparation into it.\\" Justin Bruening (Jamie Martin) and Jacob Young (JR) were the only other cast members in the episode. \\"...I worked with a private coach, we worked on it together.... We put a lot of time into this episode,\\" Havins stated. \\"We usually don't have that luxury, but this time we did; this took priority. And shooting it, too, we knew it was a big deal.\\" She revealed that the producers and director were patient with them. \\"And if we felt we didn't like where a take went, usually they're like, 'No, it's fine, let's move on,' but this time they were like, 'Let's do it again. We loved that take, girls, but let's try something else,' and we'd go in a totally different direction.\\" She said, \\"They took the time and they were as invested in this episode as [Riegel] and I were, so that was a really good feeling. We were all there, we were all in it together, and hopefully, the finished product shows it.\\" In 2005, Riegel won an Emmy for the role. When she decided to leave the show that same year to pursue other acting ventures, it was suggested that the gay community would be losing a viable voice. ControversyComing out= Scripting legendary character Erica as having a gay daughter initially upset a significant portion of the audience. \\"Viewers were deeply attached to the character as the 16-year-old daughter of [the leading soap opera diva]. ABC held a series of focus groups to gauge audience reaction.\\" Female viewers in Boston and some in Atlanta found the storyline \\"refreshing and reflective\\" of what they called the \\"real world and its diversity.\\" The Atlanta group, however, had a good portion who were concerned about morality and did not want a major character \\"saddled with a lifelong problem.\\" Boston viewers felt Bianca's problem was being in the closet; Atlantans voiced her problem was her sexual preference itself. In addition, there was opposition to the increased love for the character. Critics of gay marriage groups and individuals complained about a sympathetic gay heroine, saying Bianca made daytime television even more licentious. =Rape debate= Bianca's rape was heavily debated; viewers who despised the storyline argued the rape as \\"punishment\\" for her sexuality, and as unnecessary; others felt that it realistically captured what gay women sometimes face from men who want to force themselves on lesbians. When GLAAD (Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) was asked by Metro Weekly why GLAAD sent out an action alert voicing their concern over the rape of Bianca, but two days later sent out another release which seemed to support how the storyline was told, Joan M. Garry, executive director of the organization, responded that they had \\"some concerns\\" about [the storyline] and \\"that the broader context of the [daytime television] genre kind of needs to be taken into account.\\" Metro Weekly felt that this did not answer their question. They wanted to know why there was a sudden reversal in GLAAD's statement, specifically citing that GLAAD's second press release spoke of rape experience for lesbians and how men who rape lesbians not only engage in gender based acts of violence, but in acts of hate violence, and that this release was supportive of how Bianca's rape storyline was told, as opposed to GLAAD's first press release on the matter. Garry said she felt that their first press release concerning Bianca's rape was premature. Metro Weekly countered by asking what is the \\"actual process\\" GLAAD uses to select what to criticize, what raises their organization's red flags. \\"There's a whole host of input we receive about things as we hear about them, as we see them in script form, as we see them in pilots,\\" Garry relayed. \\"We have a strong team of program folks who represent different regions around the country, different communities. We get an awful lot of stuff that comes across the transom via our website raising concerns. And we did get quite a number of concerns coming over email, particularly about All My Children.\\" Garry continued, \\"So it's basically community feedback, as well as some of our own observations and perceptions. Combine that with conversations that we have with folks that are actually producing the images and we really try to work our way through those different opinions and shape a position we think makes sense.\\" In an interview with Soap Opera Digest, Riegel detailed what it was like preparing for her character's rape scenes. She explained that it was grueling and that there were only four people in the episode. She found it to be \\"very work-intensive,\\" emotionally haunting, and voiced that she had trouble sleeping. She elaborated that \\"these\\" type of scenes really stay with a person. Riegel and co-star William deVry (Michael Cambias) rehearsed the scenes on their own, which normally would not have been the case. Riegel commented that it definitely required more work than an ordinary episode. Asked if she was frightened of deVry during Bianca's rape scenes, she admitted that she was and that it was a testament to deVry's acting skills. About the uneasiness of the scenes and whether or not she was frightened or intimidated by \\"the gravity\\" of the storyline, she stated, \\"Absolutely, I was. To be honest, I didn't know if I could handle it. But I knew it was a very important thing to do and that the show was serious about handling it well.\\" She added, \\"I knew we could reach people, and that it was powerful stuff. I could feel the power of it. And I knew I should put myself through this because ultimately it might help somebody, touch somebody, make people talk about it. And rape is something people should talk about.\\" =Transgender romance= Bianca's romantic attraction to transgender rockstar Zarf/Zoe was met with criticism from the gay and lesbian community, and fans in general. They asserted that, as a lesbian, it is illogical for Bianca to be intensely romantically attracted to a transgender woman who is still of the male form, and that even more stressing was that the show conveyed the story as soul-love (the belief that sexual orientation can be negated if you simply love that person's soul). Viewers titled the couple \\"Barf\\" (for Bianca and Zarf), and TV Guide, which reported the nickname, named the storyline one of the worst of 2007. The San Francisco Bay Area Reporter, Inc., a free weekly newspaper serving the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) communities in the area, were one of the first to comment on their discontent with the matter: > We have repeatedly voiced our displeasure over the transgender/lesbian > storyline between Zarf/Zoe and Bianca. We disagree with the basic premise, > Zarf/Zoe as a MTF transgendered lesbian. We want Bianca to be with a woman > (and she did have a one-night stand with Leslie on New Year‚Äôs Eve, which has > to be a first for a daytime soap). We don‚Äôt want her already messy love life > in which she has never been allowed to have a fully realized relationship > with another woman (her first lover went crazy and was institutionalized, > her next was killed, the next was a corporate thief who then had to return > to Poland, the next identical twin of the one who was killed wasn‚Äôt sure she > was even queer and then left her for another woman). We don‚Äôt want her life > complicated with the complexities of a transgender relationship. The Wow Report delivered a scathing remark when they referred to Zarf as a drag queen and commented on their disbelief that All My Children was winning GLAAD awards. =Gabrielle Montgomery= In October 2008, with Bianca's return to the series during a series of tornadoes striking fictional town Pine Valley, Bianca was reported to be pregnant with her second child. Fans immediately began speculating on who the sperm donor was, which caught the attention of soap opera press, LGBT press, and other media outlets. TV Guide reported that \\"nobody knows [Bianca's] in town until her brother-in-law finds her under the rubble.\\" SOAPnet.com stated, \\"The physical affects [sic] of the tornado are miniscule [sic] compared to the ripples Bianca‚Äôs presence creates.\\" Another soap opera website sensationalized the story by stating, \\"When Bianca returns to town this time, she will have a brand new ‚Äòsomeone special‚Äô in her life and a big surprise ‚Äî Bianca is pregnant! And wait until everyone finds out who the 'father' is.\\" Fans, aware that Miranda Montgomery, Bianca's first child, who was the result of rapist Michael Cambias, speculated Zach Slater as the child's biological father; Zach was Michael's older brother. Fans theorized that Bianca wanted a baby closely related to Miranda and asked Zach to father the child. If Bianca were already pregnant when she got to Pine Valley, then Zach could have \\"donated\\" last time Bianca was in town, even though the timing within the series was off. Another theory concluded Bianca‚Äôs former love Zarf/Zoe as the father; the argument arose over a website putting \\"father\\" in quotations. The \\"father\\" is really a \\"mother\\" trapped in a \\"father‚Äôs\\" body, went the theory. Zach was eventually confirmed as the father of the child by magazine Soap Opera Digest, and Bianca's reasons for asking Zach to be the donor and doing so without informing her sister and Zach's wife, Kendall Hart Slater, infuriated viewers. They reasoned that neither Bianca nor Zach would do this to Kendall. The child was soon named Gabrielle Montgomery, and the choice for Zach as the father made Miranda and the new child not only half-sisters, but cousins as well, which some viewers found \\"icky.\\" See also *Bianca Montgomery and Maggie Stone *Lena Kundera and Bianca Montgomery *Reese Williams and Bianca Montgomery *Supercouple ReferencesFurther reading  *C.

He was a socialist and sometime a colleague of Subhas Chandra Bose who became the leader of the All India Forward Bloc (AIFB), of which Thevar was national Deputy Chairman from 1952. He was elected three times to the national Parliamentary Constituency.  Childhood and family life  Muthuramalinga Thevar was born on 30 October 1908,Pasumpon, Ramnad District 1910 onwards he was in the custody of his maternal grandmother Parvathiammal in the neighbouring village of Kallupatti. Parvathiammal was furious with Muthuramalingam's father for having taken two new wives shortly after the death of his second wife. During his youth, Thevar was aided by Kuzhanthaisami Pillai, a close family friend of his father. Pillai took responsibility for arranging Muthuramalingam's schooling. First he was given private tuition and in June 1917 he began attending classes at an elementary school run by American missionaries in Kamuthi. Later he joined the Pasumalai High School (near Thirupparankundaram) and then he shifted to the Union Christian High School in Madurai. Muthuramalingam did not complete his studies. The following year he also missed his chance to attend the final examinations, as he returned to Pasumpon to fight a legal battle over issues of inheritance of family property. The case lingered and was not settled until 1927, when the court ruled in Muthuramalingam Thevar favour. Muthuramalingam's father died on 6 June 1939.Bose, pp. 77‚Äì78, 83, 238  Opposition to Criminal Tribes Act  One issue particularly impacted on Thevar's political career. The Criminal Tribes Act (CTA) had been enacted in 1920 by the government of the Madras Presidency and was subsequently implemented in a piecemeal fashion. Thevar mobilised resistance to it, touring villages in the affected areas and leading protest rallies for the rights of the individuals registered under it. In 1929, the Maravars of 19 villages in Appanad were forced to register, under the CTA. Thevar led a massive campaign in the villages, urging the people to defy it. The authorities partially withdrew, and reduced the number of CTA registrations in the concerned areas from around 2000 to 341. In 1934, Thevar organised a convention at Abhiramam, which urged the authorities to repeal the CTA. A committee consisting of Thevar, P. Varadarajulu Naidu, Perumal Thevar, Sasivarna Thevar and Navaneethakrishna Thevar was appointed by the convention to carry on the efforts to persuade the government to revoke the Act. The CTA was, however, not revoked but instead its implementation was widened. Thevar again led agitations and awareness-raising campaigns against the Act. At the time the Justice Party was governing the Madras Presidency, and their refusal to revoke the law created a strong animosity on Thevar's behalf towards that party.Bose, pp. 80‚Äì81, 125  1936 District Board election  Infuriated by the attitude of the Justice Party government towards the CTA, Thevar concluded that the communities affected by the Act had to be mobilised by the Congress. After returning from a trip to Burma in 1936, he began to work to strengthen the Congress in the southern areas of the Presidency. He contested the election to the Ramnad District Board from the Mudukulathur constituency, defeating his Justice Party opponent. This was Thevar's first experience of being a candidate in an election. After the election, Thevar made a bid to be elected the president of the District Board, as did P. S. Kumarasamy, the Raja of Rajapalyam. Conflict erupted within the local Congress organisation over the issue. S. Satyamurthi, on behalf of the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee, intervened to preserve the unity of the Congress. Thevar was persuaded to withdraw his candidature and presented a motion nominating Kumarasamy as president. When the Congress Socialist Party began to mobilise in the Madras Presidency in 1936, Thevar joined their ranks.Bose, pp. 81‚Äì82, 126, 220  1937 provincial election  Ahead of the 1937 elections to the assembly of the Madras Presidency, Thevar enlisted youths from the Mukkulathor communities to work for the Congress. His activities created worries for the Justice Party government, which forbade him to travel outside of the Ramnad district and to make speeches in public. In February 1937, Thevar contested the assembly election himself, as a candidate in the Ramanathapuram constituency. He had a powerful opponent, the Raja of Ramnad. Thevar won a landslide victory with 11,942 votes against 6,057 for the Raja. Following the election, the Congress formed a government in the Presidency. Thevar had high hopes that the new Congress ministry would revoke the Criminal Tribes Act but the new Chief minister, C. Rajagopalachari, did not do so.Bose, pp. 82, 127  Trade unionist  During the late 1930s, Thevar became increasingly involved in labour activities. He formed and led the Pasumalai Mahalaskshmi Mill Workers' Union, the Meenakshi Mill Workers' Union and the Madura Knitting Company Labour Union. During a prolonged strike of the Pasumalai Mahalaskshmi Mill Workers' Union, demanding the reinstatement of a section of fired trade unionists, Thevar was jailed for seven months from 15 October 1938. In the end, the management of the Mahalakshmi Mills accepted the demands of the union. In the same period, a strike was led by Thevar at the Madura Knitting Company. In 1945, he became the founding president of the TVS Thozhilali Sangam.Bose, pp. 83, 127‚Äì128  Formation of the Forward Bloc  Thevar attended the 52nd annual session of the Indian National Congress, held in Tripuri in March 1939. At this meeting the presidency of Subhas Chandra Bose was challenged by Pattabhi Sitaramayya. Sitaramayya had the active support of Gandhi. Bose, whom Thevar supported, was re-elected as the Congress President. Bose was elected president again over Gandhi's preferred candidate Pattabhi Sitaramayya. Thevar strongly supported Bose in the intra-Congress dispute. He mobilised all south India votes for Bose. However, due to the manoeuvrings of the Gandhi-led clique in the Congress Working Committee, Bose found himself forced to resign from the Congress Presidency. He then launched the Forward Bloc on 22 June, calling for the unification of all leftwing elements into a united organisation within the Congress. Thevar, who was disillusioned by the official Congress leadership which had not revoked the CTA, joined the Forward Bloc. When Bose visited the state immediately after the formation of the Forward Bloc in 1939, it was Thevar who played the key role in arranging a rousing reception in Madurai on 6 September.Bose, pp. 83, 162  Support for the Temple Entry Movement  The Temple Entry Authorisation and Indemnity Act was passed by the government of C. Rajagopalachari in 1939. This removed restrictions prohibiting Dalits from entering Hindu temples.He who removed fear and changed history ‚Äì TAMIL NADU. The Hindu (12 March 2013). Retrieved 30 November 2018. Thevar supported this reform and on 8 July he helped the activist A. Vaidyanatha Iyer take Dalits to Meenakshi Temple in Madurai. U. Muthuramalingam Thevar strongly supported this reform, and issued a warning statement. He said, \\"I would be there at the entrance of the Meenakshi Temple. Those who dare to prevent the Dalits‚Äô entry into the temple, could come there and meet me. I will answer them.\\" After this statement, the caste Hindus hesitated to prevent.[3][4][5] On 8 July 1939, Vaidyanatha Iyer entered the Meenakshi temple at Madurai with the company of L. N. Gopalasamy and six of his Dalit friends, P. Kakkan, Muruganandam, Chinniah, Purnalingam and Muthu.[4][6][7]  In jail  The growing popularity in Thevar as a leader of elements opposing the official Congress leadership in Tamil Nadu troubled the Congress-led government. Thevar was also increasingly associated with labour militancy. A criminal case, the so-called Madura Security Case, was proceeded against him. He was banned from leaving Madurai. When travelling to his birthplace, Pasumpon, in September 1940 he was apprehended and jailed for 18 months at the Central Jail in Tiruchirapalli. His capture sparked wide condemnation in Tamil Nadu. Soon after his release, he was arrested again, under the Defense of India Rules. He was released from prison on 5 September 1945.Bose, p. 83  After release from jail  In 1945, Rajagopalachari tried to make a comeback within the Congress organisation in Tamil Nadu. He had the support of Gandhi and Sardar Patel, but the majority of the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee opposed him. A conference was held in Tirupparankundram to elect the leadership. Chaos broke out as warring factions confronted each other. Thevar interrupted the disputes and passed a motion re-electing Kamaraj as the TNCC President.Bose, pp. 84‚Äì85 Elections to the assembly of the Madras Presidency were again held in March 1946. Thevar contested from the Mudukulathur constituency, and was elected unopposed. Soon thereafter, the CTA was repealed. In February 1948, the Congress expelled all dissenting fractions, including the Forward Bloc, which became an independent opposition party. Thevar became its president of its Tamil Nadu state unit, a position he would hold for the rest of his life. On 23 January 1949, in connection with birthday anniversary celebrations of Bose, Thevar announced that Bose was alive and that he had met him. Soon thereafter Thevar disappeared without any explanation. He returned to public life in October 1950. Rumours claimed that he had travelled to Korea and China during this period. On the national level, the Forward Bloc had been suffering from internal ideological divisions. In 1948, two separate Forward Blocs had emerged, a 'Forward Bloc (Marxist)' (out of which the Forward Bloc of today emerged) and a 'Forward Bloc (Ruiker)' (led by R.S. Ruiker).Thevar himself consequently kept a pragmatic attitude towards the ideological debates of the party at the national level, and kept aloof from taking sides in the splits. Although he himself refuted Marxism, he did not align with the anti-Marxist elements on the national level. See Bose, pp. 165‚Äì166, 200, 221 On 23 June 1951, the two parties reunified at a meeting in Calcutta. A central committee was announced for the united party, which included Thevar as one of its members.Bose, pp. 17‚Äì19, 84‚Äì86, 130  1952 general election  In January 1952, the first general elections in independent India were held. The Forward Bloc contested with the aim of forming non-Congress governments at the Centre as well as in the states. Election were held simultaneously to the Lok Sabha as well as to the legislative assemblies of the states. Thevar contested the Aruppukottai constituency in the Lok Sabha election and the Mudukulathur constituency in the assembly election. He won in both cases.In the Lok Sabha election Thevar got 90 512 votes (45.09%) against the Congress candidate M. Gulam Mohideen who got 70724 votes (35.23%). The Mudukulatur assembly constituency was a two-seat constituency. The Forward Bloc won both seats. Thevar got 37011 votes (28.48%) and his party colleague Mottaya Kundabam got 38412 votes (29.56%). After the election, he decided to vacate his Lok Sabha seat and concentrate his efforts to the Madras legislative assembly.A by-election was held, in which Forward Bloc candidate M.D. Ramaswamy Chettiar was elected with 69,128 votes. After the election, Congress lacked a majority of its own in the Madras legislative assembly. Thevar cooperated with the communists in trying to form a non- Congress governing coalition. However, the governor intervened and made C. Rajagopalachari of the Congress, the Chief Minister.Bose, pp. 86‚Äì87  Split in the Forward Bloc  In 1955, internal divisions reappeared with the Forward Bloc. The Indian National Congress had adopted Socialism as its guiding principle at a session in Madras. Some leaders within the Forward Bloc, like the chairman Mohan Singh and Sheel Bhadra Yajee, now argued that the time had come for the Forward Bloc to merge with the Congress. This proposal did however not win much support in other sections of the party leadership. Singh- Yagee unilaterally declared the party merged into the Congress. An extraordinary central committee meeting was convened in Nagpur 11‚Äì15 May 1955. Singh, Yagee and their followers were expelled from the party. Hemanth Kumar Bose was elected chairman of the party, Haldulkar the general secretary and Thevar the deputy chairman of the party. Thevar would hold that post until his death.Bose, pp. 18‚Äì21  1957 general election  Thevar travelled to Burma for the second time in December 1955, taking part in political and religious activities organised by the All Burma Tamil Nadu Association. He returned on 18 February 1956 and began to prepare for the erstwhile coming general election. A new dynamic in the efforts to build a non-Congress front had emerged in the Madras State (which had been reorganised in 1956). The Congress had been divided and C. Rajagopalachari had formed a new party, the Congress Reform Committee (CRC). In the election, Thevar again contested both the Aruppukottai constituency in the Lok Sabha election and the Mudukulathur constituency in the assembly election. He won both seats, but this time he decided to vacate the assembly seat.Bose, pp. 87‚Äì88  Ramnad riots  A by- election was held in the Mudukulathur assembly constituency on 1 July 1957, as Thevar had resigned from his assembly seat. The election was won by D. V. Sasivarna Thevar of the Forward Bloc. The situation in the area was tense on the day that the results were released, and there was a sizeable presence of police forces in place. Clashes between Maravars, who largely supported the Forward Bloc, and pro-Congress Pallars began in a few villages soon after the election result was acknowledged. Gradually the violence spread to more and more villages, and by August the riots had spread throughout the entire district. Several persons were killed and thousands of houses were torched.According to a statement of the then Tamil Nadu Home Minister M. Bakthavatsalam, 38 persons were killed in the clashes and over 2800 houses were burnt down. Thevar travelled to Delhi on 17 July to attend the session of the Lok Sabha. He returned on 9 September. On 10 September he took part in a 'Peace Conference' together with T. V. Sasivarna Thevar and Velu Kudumbar, a legislative assembly member of the Forward Bloc (from the Kudumbar community). From the Dalit Pallars side six Kudumbars took part. There was also a delegate from the Nadar caste Velusamy Nadar. The conference concluded that the three castes should live in harmony.  Final years  Statue of Thevar in Parliament opened by Subramanian Swamy After being released from prison Thevar began mobilising for the Madurai municipal elections, held in March 1959. An alliance of the Forward Bloc, Communist Party of India, Indian National Democratic Congress and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam was formed. The alliance won the elections, and for the first time Congress lost its hold over the city administration. Following the election, Thevar's health deteriorated and he largely withdrew from public life. He was nominated for the 1962 Lok Sabha election but attended only one campaign meeting, which also was attended by Rajaji (who now had merged with his INDC with the Swatantra Party). Thevar was re-elected, but due to health reasons he was unable to travel to the parliament in Delhi. Thevar died on 30 October 1963 on his 55th birthday.Bose, pp. 89‚Äì90He passed away at Thirunagar,Madurai at 4:30 am.  Legacy  After his death, the Forward Bloc entered into a period of decline in Tamil Nadu and Kerala.Bose claims that one cause of the post-Thevar decline of the Forward Bloc was that Thevar's personal dominance over the party in Tamil Nadu had prevented the formation of a strong second-rank leadership. See Bose, p. 165 The party leadership was overtaken by Thevar's disciple P.K. Mookiah Thevar. The party organisation became ridden by splits and disputes.Bose, pp. 162‚Äì163, 188 In this situation, the major chunk of the Maravar vote-bank of the Forward Bloc was overtaken by the Dravida Munnetra KazhagamM. Karunanidhi played a significant part in incorporating the southern warrior castes, like the Maravars, into the Tamil political identity. and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. Several official honours have been given to Thevar. In 1968 the Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar College was founded in Usilampatti by the then DMK-led state government. His biography was included in the high school textbooks in Tamil Nadu. In 1971 his cemetery in Pasumpon was converted into an official memorial. A life-size portrait of Thevar was installed in the Tamil Nadu assembly in 1980. In 1984, after the bifurcation of the Ramnad District the 'Pasumpon Muthuramalingam District' was created.. However in 1996 the district was renamed. The Pasumpon Muthuralingam District is now known as the Sivaganga District.Bose, p. 133 On 1 October 2002 the life-size statue of Thevar was unveiled in the Parliament House by the then President of India, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. Time slots for paying homage at Thevar Memorial. The Hindu (26 October 2005) But at the same time his legacy is not entirely uncontroversial. At times violence between Thevars and Dalits flare up in the area, and desecrations of monuments of Muthuramalinga Thevar have taken place.Politicians add fuel to caste fire in TN  References Cited sources *Bose, K.

The term was used in Stove's book The Plato Cult as part of his argument against Karl Popper and other philosophers whom he characterised as \\"modernists\\". For Stove, Popper was influenced by the pervasive anti-Victorian mentality of the era, epitomised by Evelyn Waugh's book A Handful of Dust, in which the absurdity of Victorian values is expressed by a parody of \\"Victorian\\" conceptions of the civilizing mission of imperialism, when the hero is finally trapped in the Amazonian jungle, forced eternally to read the works of Dickens to a tribal chief. For Stove, the ascription of absurdity to Victorian culture was essentially a matter of taste, but one so powerful and irrational that it possessed the intensity of religious faith. As a result, it produced a revulsion - rather than a reasoned scepticism - to writers such as the Victorian philosopher of science William Whewell. Following Stove's usage, the term was taken up by the design historian Shelagh Wilson to refer to modernist distaste for Victorian architecture and design. Wilson argued that \\"Palissyite\\" design, influenced by the methods of Bernard Palissy, had been ridiculed and misunderstood by proponents of \\"Puginite\\" design, following the proto-modernist principles of Augustus Pugin. Wilson's argument formed part of a reaffirmation of the aesthetic principles of the grotesque. The argument that distaste for Victorian cultural values ('Anti-victorianism') is irrational has been adopted by other writers,either following Stove's politically conservative attack on liberal thought, or Wilson's critique of modernism.

In keeping with the Navy's long tradition, they were designed to be qualitatively superior to battleships that might be faced in battle, such as those from the United States or Great Britain. As part of this, the class would have been armed with six guns, the largest weapons carried aboard any warship in the world. Design work on the A-150s began after the preceding in 1938‚Äì1939 and was mostly finished by early 1941, when the Japanese began focusing on aircraft carriers and other smaller warships in preparation for the coming conflict. No A-150 would ever be laid down, and many details of the class' design were destroyed near the end of the war. Background and design In the 1930s, the Japanese government began a shift towards ultranationalist militancy. Planners envisioned an empire stretching from Japan to the resource-rich European colonies in Southeast Asia, and defensible islands in the Pacific Ocean (the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere). The extensive distances involved, and the likelihood of this expansion leading to a confrontation with the United States, led the Japanese to build and maintain a large fleet that could seize and hold onto these territories.Willmott (1999), p. 32Schmo (2004), pp. 42‚Äì43 The U.S. posed a particular problem for Japan, as it possessed significantly greater industrial power,Willmott (1999), p. 22 and several leading members of the United States Congress had pledged \\"to outbuild Japan three to one in a naval race\\". The Imperial Japanese Navy had recognized since at least 1896 that the country could not outproduce its potential opponents, and therefore insisted that its ships had to be more powerful than foreign equivalents. It established this qualitative lead at various times over the next 40 years, with the s just before World War I, the s at the end of that war, and the s in the 1930s.Evans & Peattie (1997), p. 59 The A-150s were designed according to that doctrine to continue their qualitative superiority in battleships over their most likely opponents, the United States and Great Britain. Early conceptions for what would become the A-150 battleships called for eight or nine 51-centimeter guns in double or triple turrets, as the successful construction of a gun in 1920‚Äì1921 made the Japanese confident that such a large weapon could be built. The designers hoped to give the ships a top speed of , which would give them a comfortable margin over the American s. However, these grand specifications were curtailed when tests culminated in a ship that had a displacement of some ; it was felt that ships of this size would be \\"too large and too expensive\\".Garzke & Dulin (1985), p. 85 Formal design studies began in 1938‚Äì1939. They initially focused on a ship closer to the displacement of the preceding , on which plans had just been completed, albeit one mounting six 51-centimeter guns.Garzke & Dulin (1985), pp. 85‚Äì86 As the Japanese expected that the Americans would ascertain the true characteristics of the Yamato class‚Äîespecially its primary armament of guns, which would become the largest naval weapons in use in the world‚Äîthey hoped that the 51-centimeter guns would outperform any American response to the Yamatos' smaller guns.  Specifications  Plans for the A-150s were finished in early 1941, for most intents and purposes. However, these were destroyed at the end of the war, along with most of the other documentation relating to the class. The general destruction of records and Japan's extensive efforts (before and during the war) to keep any information about the ships out of the hands of foreign nations severely limited the amount of information on the ships available to historians.Muir (1990), p. 485Skulski (1989), p. 8 This is, for example, why the A-150's exact specifications are up to some debate. The displacement was to be similar to the Yamato class, which was around ,Breyer (1973), p. 330 and the belt armor was probably going to be thick.Gardiner & Chesneau (1980), p. 178 This was so large that steel mills in Japan were incapable of manufacturing it. Instead, two layers of armor plates would have been used, despite its reduced effectiveness as compared to a single plate of the same total thickness. Armament The design of the A-150s called for a main battery of six 45-caliber 51-centimeter guns in three twin turrets. These would have been the largest ever fitted to a capital ship, dwarfing the 46-centimeter guns mounted on the Yamato class,Garzke & Dulin (1985), pp. 85, 88 and were a key factor in historians William H. Garzke and Robert O. Dulin's argument that the A-150s would have been the \\"most powerful battleships in history\\". By 1941, one‚Äîpossibly two‚Äîof the 51-centimeter guns were being constructed at the Kure Naval Arsenal and detailed designs of their turrets were drawn up. The turrets would have weighed and each gun would have massed . They would have had a total length of and the bore length was to have been around . The armor-piercing shells would have weighed .Lacroix & Wells (1997), p. 755 The composition of the A-150's secondary armament is not fully known. Historians Eric Lacroix and Linton Wells have written that Japanese designers were considering mounting a large number of 65-caliber Type 98 dual-purpose guns, though this was not final. These guns had a maximum elevation of +90¬∞, which gave them an effective ceiling of and a horizontal range of . They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of , although resulting wear on the barrels reduced their designed lifespan to only about 350 rounds. They were able to fire 15‚Äì19 rounds per minute.Lacroix & Wells (1997), p. 626 Construction As war with the United States became increasingly likely over the Second Sino- Japanese War, and particularly after the Japanese seizure of French Indochina in mid-1940, all design work on battleships was diverted in early 1941‚Äîeven though the A-150's design was nearly complete‚Äîin order to focus on higher- priority warships like aircraft carriers and cruisers. Two A-150s, provisionally designated as Warships Number 798 and 799, were projected in a 1942 building program. Under this plan, 798 would have been built in the same dock as , while 799 would be built in Kure in the same dock as after a fourth Yamato-class ship was launched. The ships would have then have been finished in 1946‚Äì1947, but the war's turn against the Japanese after the Battle of Midway meant that the need for ships other than battleships never abated.

The family were strong Catholics and were intermarried with other Catholic families, including that of Sir Thomas More, the former Lord Chancellor. The family's Catholicism was practiced behind closed doors. His three older brothers followed in the Catholic tradition. The eldest was the Royalist soldier Colonel Sir Henry Gage (1597-1645), who fought on the Continent for Catholic Spain and eventually in England for Charles I. According to J. Eric S.

Valladolid was the scene of a good deal of rivalry and bad feeling between the different religious orders, a situation worsened by the temperamental and political tensions between the Spanish and the English. Gage developed a contempt for the Jesuits and chose the Dominicans. He joined the Dominicans in Jerez, Spain, taking the religious name Tom√°s de Santa Mar√≠a, and his pro-Jesuit father disinherited him.McGrady, \\"Thomas Gage\\" p. 2.Newton, Norman. Thomas Gage in Spanish America. New York: Barnes & Noble 1969, pp. 17, 25. He volunteered in 1625 for the mission to the Philippines. Before his departure a royal decree forbade any foreigner, under severe penalties, to go to the Spanish colonies. Fellow friars aided Gage to board the ship for the Indies, and he was hidden in a barrel and the party of thirty or so Dominican friars sailed from Cadiz, on 2 July 1625.Newton, Thomas Gage in Spanish America, p. 34. In the Spanish Americas The route led through Mexico, where Gage decided to remain and for a time taught Latin in the convent school. By Gage's own account, in Mexico City he heard from a friar who had run away from his duties in the Philippines that the Dominican superiors there were cruel and harsh and the friars corrupt and worldly. In order to escape onward posting to the Philippines, Gage and three other friars escaped from Mexico for Guatemala. Here he was accepted by the Dominicans as a useful addition to their manpower. He spent two or three years in the priory in Santiago de los Caballeros, where he seems to have liked the opportunity for study but began to have religious doubts and was led to ask to return to England. The Dominican authorities refused, on the grounds that missionaries had to remain in the Americas for ten years. Further embittered, he decided to accompany friar Francisco Moran into new territories of Guatemala to learn the language and ways of the Amerinds. This he did and preached to two communities of Mixco and Pinola for five years. It seems likely that this was already in his mind at least in part a largely mercenary operation, aimed at gathering funds to finance a return to England. Gage gathered a handsome 9,000 crowns, in what proportion honestly gained is left unclear. By 1635, with this sum accumulated, Gage, now increasingly disenchanted with Spanish America, was ready to return to Europe, requested permission from the Dominican Provincial, was refused and was posted instead to Petapa. After a year there he decided to run for it. All in all he had spent the years 1625-1637 in Mexico and Guatemala. Turning his wealth into pearls and precious stones, on 7 January 1637, he made his way through Nicaragua and sailed from Costa Rica on 4 February. He was captured by Dutch corsairs led by Diego el Mulato en route. Gage was unharmed and was allowed to keep some books and paintings, but lost all his other valuables. He finally reached Spain on 28 November 1637, and in 1638 arrived in England. There, after an absence of twenty-six years, he discovered that he had been disowned and disinherited by his father, long deceased, though he was welcomed and treated well by his family. He could not get along with his fellow Dominicans in England and soon traveled to Rome, though his doubts about his faith continued. On the way out he called on his brother Colonel Henry Gage at his winter quarters near Ghent. This journey, lengthened by ill-health and wartime conditions, brought him a number of adventures, but also the opportunity to visit Protestant communities in both Germany and France. In Rome, where he continued to conceal his leaning to Protestantism, he involved himself in a variety of intrigues. Conversion to Anglicanism Without doubt he encountered cases of the sort of laxity which the Dominican and other orders were trying to remedy in other parts of the world. Clerical scandals are not new, either. At the same time Gage dedicates his energies to telling the world tales such as that of the friars playing cards, with one friar who jokingly scoops the winnings into the sleeve of his habit, saying that Dominicans are forbidden to touch money. An incident like that may have been marked by bad taste, and it may have been symptomatic of a less than devout atmosphere, but it might also not merit a change of religion. Another story recounted with disdain by a Gage who against his vows amassed a fortune, is of the Spanish friar noted for his learning who was excommunicated when money was found in his quarters. Gage seems to be by temperament a bitter pill and later in life seems distinctly unhinged. Despairing now perhaps more or less of everything, he returned from Rome to England in September 1640, and began to take an active part in the parliamentary troubles in England, and then in 1642 publicly abandoned the Catholic Church for a Puritanical form of Anglicanism. He became a \\"Preacher of the Word\\", and as a means to improve the lukewarm reception he had received among Protestants and by the Parliamentarian part, he married. Though for this he was rewarded with the rectorship of Acrise in Kent, he had won for himself general ridicule by a sermon he preached that summer in St Paul's, London, and published in October under the title \\"The Tyranny of Satan, discovered by the teares of a converted sinner [...] by Thomas Gage, formerly a Romish Priest, for the space of 38 yeares, and now truly reconciled to the Church of England\\". In December 1642 he testified against the priest Thomas Holland, whom he had known at St. Omer and Valladolid, and obtained a sentence of hanging, drawing and quartering which was effectively carried out. The following year, 1643 it was the turn of the Franciscan Francis Bell, with the same result. On 7 September 1644 the Jesuit Ralph Corby was executed on his evidence. Gage then set about publicizing his life's experience, and published his now-famous book, The English-American his Travails by Sea and Land in 1648, which was as much a political pamphlet and an adventurer's prospectus as a traveller's tale. That of Thomas Holland was not the only death for which Gage was responsible among the Catholics. In 1650 two priests were arrested, the Jesuit Peter Wright and the Dominican Thomas Middleton or Dade. Wright had been chaplain in Ghent and in England to Thomas Gage's soldier brother Henry and had attended Henry at his death. Dade was the provincial of the English Dominicans. Gage was the chief prosecution witness. His brother George visited him and pleaded with him not to stain himself with judicial murder. Thomas Gage promised to desist and did get Dade, against whom he had a personal grudge, off the charge. Possibly Gage was afraid for his own safety if he let the trial collapse. The execution of Wright was not popular and Gage's treachery, compounded by his attack on his late brother Henry's good name, earned even the rebuke of the court. In 1651 came an attempt to win back some public regard with his A duell betvveen a Iesuite and a Dominican : begun at Paris, gallantly fought at Madrid, and victoriously ended at London, upon fryday the 16-day of May, Anno Dom. 1651 / by Thomas Gage, alias the English American, now preacher of the word at Deal in Kent, in several printings, and then his A full survey of Sion and Babylon, and a clear vindication of the parish-churches and parochial-ministers of England [...], or, A Scripture disproof, and syllogistical conviction of M. Charles Nichols, of Kent : delivered in three Sabbath-dayes sermons in the parish church of Deal in Kent, after a publick dispute in the same church with the said Mr. Charles Nichols, upon the 20. day of October 1653. Informer Not only was Gage not a silent convert, he was also prepared to go to great lengths to persecute his former faith. He obtained the death sentence for Thomas Holland (1642), Francis Bell (1643), Ralph Corby (1644) and Peter Wright (1651). In 1649 he is said to have been summoned by the Council of State, presumably to provide information about Catholic priests. In fact there is a record of a Thomas Gage being arrested in 1617, and brought before the Privy Council. It cannot be excluded that this was our Thomas Gage and that the Council released him in return for his becoming a spy, though this is not proved. The travel writer Title page, The English-American his travail by sea and land: or, A new survey of the West-Indies, London 1648 When the Civil War brought success for the Revolution, he had aligned himself become closely with Oliver Cromwell. In 1648 he had published The English-American, or a New Survey of the West Indies, a mixture of some original with plagiarized material, taken in later editions especially from the compilation by the parson Samuel Purchas and from the Hispania Victrix (1552) Francisco Lopez de G√≥mara (1511-1562). Though full of exaggerations and some flagrant romancing, the book made a sensation and for the first time made public a description of the Spanish possessions in America. It was to be reprinted in expanded editions, in extracts and in translations thereafter. In this book, addressed to Sir Thomas Fairfax, Lord Fairfax of Cameron, the Parliamentary Captain- General, Gage promotes the view that the Spanish dominions with their long coastlines and weak defences would be an easy prey for English forces and urges such an attack as a sort of religious duty and mission upon the English. If God raised the Puritans to purify England, how much more needing of remedy were the Catholic dominated regions of the Americas, subjugated by what Gage considers their notoriously corrupt clergy. The thesis was that it would be possible to attack and loot Spanish possessions in the Americas, without embarking upon a costly war in Europe. The book made special mention whatever might assist an invading army‚Äîroads, fortifications, populations, layouts of towns. It is hard to set aside the suspicion that the details in the book were the fruit of the observations of a professional spy. The military adventurer On the strength of Gage's undoubted experience in the Caribbean and Central America, this appeal was heeded, especially with the ending of the Anglo-Dutch war in 1654 led Cromwell to be attentive to new foreign policy openings. In a secretly planned operation, on a force of 18 warships, 20 transport vessels and 3,000 men set sail from Portsmouth on Christmas Day 1654 with Gage on board as chaplain and guide and arrived at Barbados a month later. In practice the soldiers were in part the most troublesome members of their regiments, in part newly pressed Londoners. An additional 6,000 troops, untrained and badly disciplined, were raised from servants and freemen in the colonies of Barbados, Montserrat, Nevis and St Kitts. Supplies ran low, the joint commanders squabbled and morale plunged when the soldiers learned they were not to plunder the Spanish colonies. The aim was to secure a base of operations in the Caribbean and from there to threaten Spanish trade and treasure routes in Central America and weaken Catholic influence in the Americas. Arriving off Santo Domingo on 13 April 1655, the expedition found that it had been reported beforehand and the Spaniards were ready. In shore the English forces suffered greatly from heat and drought during their march through difficult tropical terrain. Moreover, contrary to Gage's confident prediction, the Indians fought with the Spanish had taken measures of defense. Coupled with the democratic habits of the Roundheads, the result was fiasco. Moving on, the fleet anchored on 11 May off Jamaica, landed the troops of General Venables, and, after a desperate resistance by the Spaniards, captured the island. Though Spain formally ceded Jamaica to England in 1670, the slaves (\\"Maroons\\") released by the Spanish harassed the English efficiently into the 18th century. The expeditions commanders were later to be charged with deserting their posts, briefly imprisoned in the Tower, and relieved of their commands. As to Thomas Gage, before the immediate operation was concluded he died (probably of dysentery) in 1656. References=Editions * A.P.

The straight-six was introduced in mid-year 1962, and replaced the flathead 6-226 Willys Super Hurricane that was in use since 1954. The Tornado engine was also manufactured in Argentina by Industrias Kaiser Argentina (IKA) from 1965 to 1973. History The development of a new engine for Kaiser Jeep for an entirely new vehicle began under Chief Engineer, A.C. \\"Sammy\\" Sampietro, in the late-1950s. Sampietro worked under Donald Healey in Europe and focused on improving power output through better engine breathing. The single overhead cam design was combined with hemispheric combustion chambers. Mass production of the new engine began in 1962. The Jeep Tornado engine was introduced in the Willys Jeep Wagon and truck models. Six-cylinder versions built after May 3, 1962, received the 230 OHC \\"Tornado\\" engine, replacing the 226 L-head \\"Super Hurricane\\" I6. It was made the standard engine in the completely new Jeep Wagoneer station wagons (today called SUV) and Jeep Gladiator pickup trucks that began production in the fall 1962 for the 1963 model year. The Tornado was the only U.S.-built overhead-cam engine in production at that time. The new engine was designed for robust, heavy-duty performance with maximum efficiency. Its excellent fuel economy was proven in tests with the Tornado- OHC engine having the lowest specific fuel consumption of all production gasoline engines on the market. Design The Tornado, like most Jeep engines, was undersquare for better low-speed torque. It had a bore with a stroke. The standard version had an 8.5:1 compression ratio. Output was at 4000 rpm and of torque at 1750 rpm. A low-compression (7.5:1) version was also available, with at 4000 rpm and of torque at 2400 rpm. It was a \\"high- efficiency\\" engine with a conservatively rated power output. The new engine's overhead camshaft design was only one of the advanced features offered for the first time in a U.S.-designed and mass-produced engine. The Tornado was a good engine; unfortunately, it was complex (by 1960s standards) and was discontinued in civilian vehicles in the U.S. in 1965. It continued to be used in military versions of the Jeep pickup, the M-715, and M-725, until 1969. These engines had block-mounted motor mounts, rather than the front cover mounts that were a cause of oil leaks on the civilian versions. One unique feature of the design was that the camshaft only had six lobes. One lobe operated both the intake and exhaust valve for each cylinder. This made engineering cam profiles a bit more difficult than conventional two lobes per cylinder (one per valve) designs, but allowed the valves to be better arranged for the cross-flow head. Valves were directly opposite their respective ports, and ports were short with wide radius turns. Road tests of the new Jeep Wagoneer by Car Life magazine described the OHC six as \\"commendably smooth and quiet.\\" The engine accelerated the four-wheel-drive full-size station wagon (the SUV designation was not yet known) with an automatic transmission from 0 to 60 mph in 15.9 seconds. Their tests recorded on the highway and in the city, that \\"certainly demonstrates the remarkable efficiency of the OHC engine.\\" Production Production of this engine continued in Argentina by Industrias Kaiser Argentina (IKA) after 1965. The engine was used in a variety of Jeep vehicles and American Motors (AMC) passenger cars assembled under license. The engine became best known for powering the IKA-Renault Torino, a hybrid version of the AMC Rambler American and Rambler Classic (American engine and trunk compartments, Classic passenger compartment) having unique styled front and rear body parts that was built in Argentina from 1966 to 1981. It achieved international success in the 1969 N√ºrburgring 84-hour endurance race when a Torino placed third due to penalty points after covering 334 laps, the most of all the racers: about . The engine name was changed to \\"Torino\\" to match the car in 1973. It also received a major block and crankshaft refinement that year ‚Äî seven main bearings instead of the original four. Industrias Kaiser Argentina was eventually bought out by Renault, and in 1975, the \\"IKA\\" name was dropped and it became \\"Renault Argentina\\". The Torino, Jeeps, AMC cars, as well as the Tornado engine itself, continued to receive upgrades over the years. Argentinian Tornado engines raised output from 155 HP to 215 HP (street versions) and 250 HP to 350 HP (Racing versions). This was achieved by a new cylinder head, which improved the intake and exhaust ducts. Also adopted a new camshaft, a new exhaust manifold of a 3-1/3-1 type, two 2-inch diameter exhaust pipes, and 3 carburetors Weber DCOE 45-45. The Torino and the Jeep Tornado engine continued production through 1982. It was marketed as the \\"Tornado Jet\\", and later as the \\"Tornado Interceptor\\", in AMC design automobiles built by IKA. From 1976 to 1982, they were the only non-Renault‚Äìdesigned cars and engines built by the French company. Applications The Jeep Tornado engine was used in the following vehicles: * Willys Jeep Truck 1962-65 * Willys Jeep Wagon 1962-65 * Jeep Gladiator 1963-64 * Jeep Wagoneer 1963-64 * Kaiser Jeep M715 1963-69 (military only) * Kaiser Jeep M725 1963-69 (military only) * Renault Torino, also known as IKA Torino, 1966‚Äì73 * by Industrias Kaiser Argentina and Renault Argentina, in Jeep utility vehicles, the Rambler Classic and Ambassador passenger cars, from 1965‚Äì73 References External links  Category:Piston engines Category:Inline-six engines Tornado Category:1962 introductions Category:Gasoline engines by model ","title":"Jeep Tornado engine"},{"id":"3574775","title":"Igor Korolev"},{"id":"3574779","text":"James Johnston (born 1966) is an English alternative rock musician and painter .

A Puritan minister, he has fathered an illegitimate child, Pearl, with Hester Prynne and considers himself unable to reveal his sin. Next to Hester Prynne herself, Dimmesdale is often considered Hawthorne's finest character. His dilemma takes up a significant portion of the novel, bringing out Hawthorne's most famous statements on many of the concepts that recur throughout his works: guilt and redemption, truth and falsehood, and others. Dimmesdale faces a problem that is both simple and paradoxical: the knowledge of his sin, his inability to disclose it to Puritan society, and his desire for confession. He attempts to ameliorate the pressure of this position by punishing himself (both physically and mentally) and by insisting to his parishioners that he is a base, worthless creature. Without the awareness of his specific crime, however, his flock takes his protestations of worthlessness as further evidence of his holiness (a fact of which he is well aware) since, in the Puritan conception, awareness of one's sinful worthlessness is a necessary component of whatever virtue is available to humans; thus, Dimmesdale has been taken as an example of a conflict typical of Puritans (or seen as such by Hawthorne from his historical distance). Portrayals Dimmesdale was portrayed by Lars Hanson in the 1926 adaption, Hardie Albright in the 1934 adaption and Gary Oldman in the 1995 adaption.

He is not to be confused with his son and pupil Cornelis Vroom. Biography View of Delft seen from the west; one of the earliest cityscapes in the Netherlands, and the earliest of Delft Arrival of a Dutch Three master at Kronborg Castle, Helsing√∏r Vroom was born in Haarlem. Much of what is known of his life comes from his biography by Karel van Mander, who devoted four pages to him in his \\"Schilder-boeck\\", which reads as an adventure story, complete with freezing his pants to a mountain top and nearly starving to death on a rock with a group that discussed cannibalism as a possible survival strategy. Though it is unknown at what age he started on his travels, Vroom was born into a family of artists and began his career as a pottery (faience) painter and when his mother remarried, was no older than 19 when he rebelled against his stepfather who insisted he stick to pottery painting, by boarding a ship for Spain (Sevilla) and from thence via Livorno and Florence to Rome. Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom in Karel van Mander's Schilderboeck, 1604, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature In Florence he was patronized around 1585‚Äì87 by Cardinal Ferdinando de' Medici, later Grand Duke of Tuscany. While there he became a pupil of Paulus Bril. He went back and forth to Venice, where he earned money as a majolica painter. When he returned north, he travelled via Milan, Genoa, Albisola (a ceramics center where he again earned money painting ceramics), Turin (where he met the Haarlem painter Jan Kraeck), and Lyon (via a mountain pass where his pants froze to the summit rock). From there he travelled to Paris, where he met a painter from Leiden, and from there he went to Rouen, where he became mortally ill but was saved by a woman who bandaged his head. There he boarded a ship homewards and was back in Haarlem in 1590, the year he married, before travelling to Danzig (now Gda≈Ñsk) to visit his uncle, Frederick Henricksz, who was city architect there, and where he painted an altarpiece. During his next journey, this time to Portugal, he survived shipwreck, but was threatened with execution as \\"an English pirate\\" - from which he was saved by being recognized as a Catholic from his salvaged devotional paintings, which convinced the monks on the beach that he and his companions were not \\"heathen Protestants\\" (Vroom, having been to Italy, had coached his fellow survivors in the catechism). Having been granted free passage, Vroom travelled to St. Huves (Setubal), where he recorded his adventures in a painting that he sold to a painter there. When he decided to return to Haarlem, he got off the ship at the last minute due to a premonition, being called a \\"crazy painter\\". The ship sank in the √òresund near Helsingor and in Haarlem Vroom was reported dead. However, he had written to his wife, who thus discovered he was still alive. He eventually died in Haarlem, in his late seventies. Tapestry designs When he did return to Haarlem, it was as an artist of international repute and soon afterwards he received two commissions for tapestry designs, one of which, from Lord Howard of Effingham, was for a series of ten tapestries depicting the defeat of the Spanish Armada of 1588, by the English under Howard‚Äôs overall command as Lord Admiral. Executed in Brussels in 1592‚Äì95, the tapestries later decorated the House of Lords, Westminster, and were fortunately recorded in engravings before they were destroyed by fire in 1834. Legacy Vroom recorded important engagements of the Dutch and English fleets in his oil paintings, giving a detailed portrayal of ships. Most of the pieces described by Van Mander are lost, and his greatest commissions were obtained after Van Mander's death. Vroom's large and decorative battles, ceremonial scenes and beach views introduced novel compositional devices to be taken up by younger Dutch marinists. The Haarlem marine painters Hans Goderis, Cornelis Verbeeck and Cornelis Claesz van Wieringen were all directly influenced by him.Theodorus Schrevelius in his \\"Harlemias\\" He became a member of the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke and his pupils included Aert Anthonisz, Nicolaes de Kemp, Jan Porcellis, and his sons Cornelis Hendriksz Vroom and Frederik Hendricksz Vroom. Works Among his more famous historical scenes included the 1607 Battle of Gibraltar and the arrival of various dignitaries in Amsterdam, including Protestant leader Frederick V, Elector Palatine of Bohemia who had been exiled by the Holy Roman Emperor.

In an effort to spare the cost of purchasing new motive power, the Santa Fe elected to expand on the success of its CF7 and other capital rebuild programs and extend the life of its fleet of 80 aging SD24s by rebuilding them at its San Bernardino, California Shops. The rebuilt locomotives saw service throughout much of the Santa Fe system. One unit, the 4625, was wrecked in August 1974 shortly after rebuild. Another 44 units were retired by Santa Fe in 1985 and replaced with state-of-the-art equipment, while a year later the remaining 35 units were sold to Guilford Rail System (now Pan Am Railways). As of 2012, all SD26s have been scrapped. History=Development The first locomotive to go through the rebuild program was Santa Fe #4533, which entered the San Bernardino shops in January 1973. Its four roof-mounted \\"torpedo tube\\" air reservoir tanks were moved to allow for the installation of a new inertial air filtering system (SD24s lacked a central air filtration system), which was located directly behind the locomotive cab. The resulting \\"blower bulge\\" or \\"hump\\" became the most obvious visual identifier of the SD26. Two of the air tanks were reinstalled toward the back roof on either side of the radiator section fans, while the other pair was situated on either side of the dynamic brake fans. The original EMD 16-567D3 engine was rebuilt with 645 power assemblies. Coupled with extensive electrical system upgrades, the horsepower rating was increased to 2,625 and gave rise to the 26 designation. The SD24's unreliable electrical system was replaced with upgraded circuitry, consisting of new wiring harnesses and EMD's new \\"Dash 2\\" circuit cards. The unit was retrofitted with extended-range dynamic brakes as well. The footboards were reconfigured, the locomotive bell was removed from the front pilot and mounted midway between the radiator fans and dynamic brake fans, and a roof-mounted beacon and cab air conditioning system was installed. The unit retained its one-piece windshield and nose-mounted classification lights. When all of the modifications were complete, the locomotive was given a fresh coat of Yellowbonnet paint and reassigned as #4633 (all SD26s were given a 100-place \\"bump\\" in numbering to reflect their new class). Over the next 5 years, all of the SD24s on Santa Fe's roster would undergo similar modifications (the last one being #4508) though not all received air conditioning, which was omitted from the following units: #4603, #4604, #4607, #4608, #4620, #4623, #4625, #4629‚Äì#4631, #4636‚Äì#4638, #4640, #4643, #4646, #4648, #4651, #4652, #4655, #4656, #4659, #4663, #4665, #4668, #4671, #4674, #4677, and #4678. Subsequent alterations In the early 1980s, most of the stock one-piece windshields were replaced with two-piece units similar to those used on the EMD GP20, a move intended to bring standardization of windshield glass to several classes of Santa Fe locomotives and thereby reduce maintenance stockpiles. A \\"second generation\\"-style traction motor blower housing was fitted to the left side of later rebuilds. Ten of the units (#4601, #4603‚Äì#4607, #4612, #4617, #4618, and #4675) were wired to operate with \\"slug\\" units for work in the Kansas City and Barstow hump yards and flat yards throughout the system. Ten others (#4611, #4627, #4629, #4640, #4645, #4648, #4667, #4674, #4677, and #4678) were configured with Locotrol Remote Control Equipment (RCE) for use in coal, grain, potash, and molten sulfur unit train service. In service The majority of SD26s were placed in both general freight and intermodal service in the Kansas City ‚Äî La Junta ‚Äî Albuquerque ‚Äî El Paso freight pool, while others spent their years running up and down the railroad's Coast Lines. The units became known as \\"slushbuckets\\" among railfans in reference to their distinctive turbocharger sound, which was considerably more subdued than that produced by either the GP40 or SD40. #4625 was wrecked near Rustler Springs, Texas in August 1974 and was subsequently sent to the scrap yard. Afterlife Changing philosophies regarding motive power expenditures led the Santa Fe to begin trimming its SD26 roster in the Spring of 1985, when 44 of the locomotives were retired and traded to EMD in exchange for 15 new GP50s. The other 35 units were sold at the end of 1986 to Guilford Rail System (now known as Pan Am Railways). As of 2012, the last SD26, ST 643 (formerly ATSF 4673), was scrapped.

The film is based on the book of the same name by Jurek Becker. The film stars Robin Williams, Alan Arkin, Liev Schreiber, Hannah Taylor-Gordon, and Bob Balaban. The film is set in 1944 in a ghetto in German-occupied Poland during the Holocaust and tells the story of a Polish- Jewish shopkeeper named Jakob Heym who attempts to raise the morale inside the ghetto by sharing encouraging rumors that he claims he has heard on a radio. It is a remake of the 1975 East German-Czechoslovak film Jakob der L√ºgner. Plot In Poland of early 1944, a Polish-Jewish shopkeeper named Jakob Heym is summoned to the German headquarters after being falsely accused of being out after curfew. While waiting for the commander, Jakob overhears a German radio broadcast speaking about Soviet offensives. Returned to the ghetto, Jakob shares his information with a friend, sparking rumors that there is a secret radio within the ghetto. After hesitating, Jakob decides to use the chance to spread hope throughout the ghetto by continuing to tell the optimistic, fantastic tales that he allegedly heard from his \\"secret radio\\", and his lies keep hope and humor alive among the isolated ghetto inhabitants. He also has a real secret, in that he is hiding a young Jewish girl who escaped from an extermination camp deportation train. However, the Gestapo learn of the mythical radio and begin a search for the resistance hero who dares operate it. Jakob surrenders himself to the Germans as they demand the person with the radio give himself up or risk hostages being killed. During interrogation, Jakob tells the police commander that he had only listened to the radio inside his office. He is ordered to announce publicly that this was all a lie, so the ghetto's liquidation would then proceed in an orderly fashion. When presented to the public, Jakob refuses to tell the truth, but is shot before he can make his own speech. At the film's ending, Jakob says, post-mortem, that all the ghetto's residents were then deported and were never seen again. As in the novel, there is an alternate \\"but maybe it wasn't like that at all\\" ending where, following Jakob's death, the train carrying the Jewish prisoners to the death camps is halted by Soviet troops and the occupants released.

According to Box Office Mojo, it opened in 1,200 theaters and made $2,056,647 in its opening weekend, placing eighth at the box office. The film's total domestic gross was just $4,956,401. The film currently holds a rating of \\"rotten\\" on Rotten Tomatoes with only 29% positive reviews and an average rating of 4.7/10. Roger Ebert gave the film two stars (out of four), comparing it to the similarly themed Life Is Beautiful by saying, \\"I prefer Life Is Beautiful, which is clearly a fantasy, to Jakob the Liar, which is just as contrived and manipulative, but pretends it is not.\\" He went on to say about the acting in the film: \\"Williams is a talented performer who moves me in the right roles, but has a weakness for the wrong ones. The screenplay and direction are lugubrious, as the characters march in their overwritten and often overacted roles toward a foregone conclusion.\\"Roger Ebert's review of \\"Jakob the Liar\\" Variety's Todd McCarthy also made comparisons with Life is Beautiful in his review, but he noted that Jakob the Liar was shot in late 1997, before Life is Beautiful had even premiered in Italy.https://variety.com/1999/film/reviews/jakob-the-liar-1200459127/ Williams received a Golden Raspberry Award nomination for Worst Actor for his performances in Jakob the Liar and Bicentennial Man, but lost to Adam Sandler, who was nominated for Big Daddy.

A critical component of the competition program was making a viable connection across the elevated I-59/I-20 highway from the Civic Center facility to the existing administrative and cultural facilities surrounding Linn Park to the south. For several decades after the complex opened, this problem was not addressed. A proposal to create a park underneath the elevated highway is in the works as part of the expansion of the complex. The new park will be known as City Walk BHAM. Multiple plans to expand the complex has been presented before the final proposal was approved. An attempt by former Birmingham mayor Larry Langford to build a large domed stadium was unsuccessful. The BJCC authority has purchased several parcels of land required for that expansion, but the project still does not have major financial backing and lacks a clear design. Former Birmingham Mayor William Bell expressed some interest in building a domed stadium, but on a smaller scale. The Alabama Department of Transportation is currently replacing the aging I-20/59 elevated viaduct adjacent to the complex. The project involves the reuse of some right-of-way to improve interstate ramps, which will temporarily interfere with plans to build a multipurpose stadium at the complex's current site. The new viaduct is expected to be completed and reopened to traffic by January 2020. Venues=Arena Legacy Arena (formerly known as the BJCC Coliseum until February 1999 and the BJCC Arena until December 2014), seats 17,654 for sporting events, 19,000 for concerts and 8,000 in a theater setting. It has been the home to ice hockey, college basketball and arena football teams in Birmingham. It was home of the Birmingham Bulls of the WHA from 1976 to 1978 and another version of the Birmingham Bulls of the ECHL from 1992 to 2001. It was also home to the UAB men's basketball team starting in 1978 before the team moved into Bartow Arena in 1988. The Alabama Steeldogs, an af2 team, played in the arena from 2000 to 2007. In 2009 and 2017, the arena hosted Davis Cup tennis matches. The arena has hosted major concert tours, Disney on Ice, American Idol Live!, the PBR Unleash the Beast Series, Monster Jam, Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, and other events including trade shows. New stadium Construction of a new football stadium, located just east of the main complex, began on July 25, 2019 with grading work. A ceremonial groundbreaking had been held on December 13, 2018. Once completed in 2021, the new 47,000-seat stadium, to be known as Protective Stadium due to a sponsorship deal with the Birmingham- based Protective Life insurance company, will be home to UAB Blazers football. If completed in time for the 2022 World Games, it will serve as that event's main stadium. Concert hall The 2,835 -seat BJCC Concert Hall was the home of the Alabama Symphony Orchestra before moving to UAB's state of the art Alys Stephens Center. Concerts and touring Broadway and family shows are also held here. It features an -by-88-foot (25.5-x-27-m) stage with a 24-foot-(7.3 m)-tall proscenium. Its grid height of 105 feet (32 m) makes the concert hall the tallest building in the complex. There is also a pipe organ at the Concert Hall, and backstage there are 2 chorus rooms and 12 dressing rooms, as well as two rehearsal areas and a VIP Reception Room. Theater The 1,000-seat BJCC Theater is used for operas, ballets, and smaller concerts and stage shows, and is also home to the Birmingham Children's Theatre, the nation's largest children's theater. The theater contains a 46-by-70-foot (14-by-21-meter) stage and a grid height of 58 feet (17.5 m). There are 2 rehearsal areas, 2 chorus dressing rooms and 6 dressing rooms, including a star's dressing room. Exhibition Hall The Exhibition Hall is used for Birmingham's largest trade shows and conventions. It is divisible into three smaller halls and can accommodate 1100 exhibit booths. Other facilities The complex contains 64 meeting rooms totaling of meeting space, including a ballroom that can seat up to 1,200 for banquets. The ten-story Medical Forum, with meeting space, a 275-seat theater, classrooms, conference space, and offices, is also located here. The adjacent 838-room Sheraton Birmingham Hotel provides a large ballroom and other convention and meeting facilities nearby. The Sheraton also housed the COGIC AIM Convention Youth Services in 2012. The 294-room Westin Birmingham Hotel within the Uptown entertainment district provides more than 7,000 square feet of flexible meeting space and an additional 2,500 square feet of pre-function space.

This is the legacy of three decades of war which has taken a severe toll on the Cambodians; it has some 40,000 amputees, which is one of the highest rates in the world. The Cambodian Mine Action Centre (CMAC) estimates that there may be as many as four to six million mines and other pieces of unexploded ordnance in Cambodia. Some estimates however run as high as ten million mines. An anti- personnel mine on display at APOPO Visitor's Center in Siem Reap The Chinese made landmines in Cambodia were placed by the Cambodian factions (including the Lon Nol, Khmer Rouge, the Heng Samrin and Hun Sen regimes, as well as the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea who, with international support retained the UN seat throughout much of the 1980s) which clashed during the Civil War in Cambodia in the 1970s and 1980s. They were placed in the whole territory of the country. A common problem Cambodians faced with the anti- personnel mines is that often even the people who placed the mines do not remember them a couple of years later. While many mines were placed with the sole intent to harm humans, some were placed with the intent to protect an area. Many sacred temples were surrounded with land mines to protect them from looting, which used to be a major problem. The CMAC (Cambodia Mine Action Center) has cleared many of these areas, and put up signs stating their work in previous minefields.  Casualty Rates  2010 casualty statistics from the Cambodian Mine Victim Information Service (CMVIS) show that Cambodia had one of the highest casualty rates in the world. the number of casualties in 2013 was 111, consisting of 22 persons killed and 89 injured. One-third of the casualties have been children, and almost all of them are boys, with studies showing that men and boys tend to be more willing than women to play with or examine explosives. Of surviving landmine victims, 87% are males over 15 years old, with a mean age of 28 years. In Afghanistan, 73% are males between ages 16 to 50, and 20% of the victims are male children.\\" \\"ICRC statistics claim that only 25% of mine victims arrive at hospital within 6 hours of being injured with 15% having to travel for more than 3 days before they reach a hospital.\\" During the first half of 2016, the number of people killed in landmine incidents nearly doubled, with 20 deaths compared to 11 for the same period in 2015, though injuries declined by almost half, from 55 to 29. Social consequences The high numbers of victims of working age affecting entire families represent a considerable burden on families' capacity for raising income and educating their children. The social consequences of land mines which Cambodia experiences poses a considerable social and economic problem. It exposes the vulnerability of the health system and the lack of a support strategy. For a family with a very low income, to have a member lose a limb and no access to good health care, and no governmental aid makes the dangers of land mines a much heavier burden on the Cambodian community. \\"Landmines, just by their sheer number alone in a particular area, can influence the population's behaviour. This in turn may result in an overall deterioration of public health and other aspects of social wellbeing. Farmers with mines, or those who only \\"perceive\\" the presence of landmines on their land will not be able to cultivate the land. This will lead to food scarcity and eventually even malnutrition.\\"  Socioeconomic effects  The National Level One Survey in Cambodia conducted in 2002 found that 20% (2776 out of 13908) of all villages in Cambodia are still contaminated by minefields and/or cluster bomb areas with reported adverse socio-economic impacts on the community. These adverse impacts included restrictions on access to agricultural land, pasture land, forests, and water resources, with 102,778, 105,707, 172,878 and 84,588 families being affected respectively. A 2004 Cambodia Socio Economic Survey (CSES) noted that households headed by someone with one or more reported disabilities have significantly less wealth than other households. Households headed by a person disabled by war or landmines live in poverty at levels almost three times higher than if the disability was due to other causes. Demining efforts , there are seven demining organizations working in Cambodia : The Cambodian Mine Action Center (CMAC), established by the Supreme National Council of Cambodia in 1992, the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF), The HALO Trust, and the Mines Advisory Group (MAG). The Cambodian Mine Action Authority or Cambodian Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority (CMAA) was established in late 2000 as a regulatory authority to coordinate all demining, and establish policies and procedures. Finding the location of the mines with no witness or map record is a very difficult task that needs very specific tools, and demands a lot of time, and trained staff, and therefore also a lot of investment. Currently, most of the remaining mines are frequently found in the fields. Nowadays identifying the areas with mines and clearing them is carried out in the North West of the country, where most of the remaining mines are found. APOPO, a Belgian non- governmental organization which uses rats to detect landmines also joined the demining efforts in 2014. In 2003, CMAA estimated that the combined cost for demining operations, including technical assistance and in kind contributions for Cambodia were about $40 million per year. Experts estimated that Cambodia would need another 10 to 20 years to clear the mines if the current level of funding was maintained. On the same year, landmine-detection dogs were deployed by the CMAC, with technical and financial assistance from the Norwegian People's Aid (NPA). These highly trained animals however are being infected with parasites including fleas, ticks, and mosquitoes which often lead to the dogs' death or early retirement, a problem both the government and private groups and trying to solve. Gambian pouched rats, also known as Giant African rats are being used to help in demining efforts. Since 2016 APOPO's hero rats have found roughly 500 anti-personnel mines and more than 350 unexploded bombs in Cambodia.

It is located in the north-east corner of Vancouver, British Columbia, near the Vancouver-Burnaby border. Travelling northward, the tunnel begins underneath Adanac Street, passing under the interchange between East Hastings Street and the Highway 1 offramps. It ends underneath Triumph Street, with the highway continuing north to the McGill Street interchange (to the Port of Vancouver) and the Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing towards the District of North Vancouver. The tunnel is long. Dangerous goods are not permitted to be transported through it. History In August 1960 the Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing (known at the time as the Second Narrows Bridge) was opened to traffic. This was followed in 1964 by the completion of the Trans Canada Highway. However, the portion of the highway passing through Vancouver was not built to highway standards. Instead, it used an existing portion of Cassiar Street, including the intersection of Cassiar and Hastings Street. This meant that traffic on the highway was controlled by traffic lights at Hastings and Cassiar also at Adanac Street and again at William Street for traffic control from the Rupert Park Diversion, all contributing to congestion especially during peak periods. The Cassiar Connector was completed in January 1992; at the time it was described as removing one of the last remaining traffic lights on the Trans Canada Highway and also as the BC Ministry of Transportation's largest project to date. The project upgraded 2.3 km of highway south of the Ironworkers Memorial Bridge, and involved the construction of seven new overpasses, 20 retaining walls, a pedestrian bridge, two new interchanges and the Cassiar Tunnel itself which is 730m long.Frontier to Freeway - An Illustrated History of the Roads in British Columbia (see page 18) The total cost of construction was estimated to be C$115 million. On January 12, 1992, a Sunday, pedestrians were allowed to roam through the dual tunnels. The next day, it was opened to vehicle traffic, and the Trans Canada highway was diverted to the new route. Highway expansion In 2005, the British Columbia provincial government introduced an infrastructure plan known as the \\"Gateway Program\\".BC Government \\"Gateway Program Definition Report\\" (see pg 32) As part of that program, the Trans Canada highway through the Cassiar Connector was increased to three lanes in each direction. These lanes were intended to be used primarily for dedicated entry and exit lanes. Because the tunnel was originally designed to have three lanes in each direction, expansion was not necessary.

It is owned and operated by the City of Mukilteo as part of Mukilteo Lighthouse Park. The lighthouse is listed on the Washington State Heritage Register and was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. History Construction of the lighthouse began in 1905, using the Carl Leick design also seen in the second Ediz Hook lighthouse and Oregon's Cape Arago lighthouse. It was built of wood, while most other lighthouses of the era were constructed using brick and concrete. The lighthouse became operational in 1906, using a revolving Fresnel lens that was manufactured in France in 1852. In 1927, the original lens was replaced with the fixed (non-rotating) fourth- order Fresnel lens which is still in use. The lighthouse and a modern fog signal were automated in 1979, and in 1981, a remote fog sensor was installed. The two Victorian-style homes on the property were used by Coast Guard personnel until 1996. The entire complex was renovated by the Mukilteo city government in the 1990s for use as a museum. In 2001, the U.S. Coast Guard turned over ownership of the lighthouse to the City of Mukilteo. It is the centerpiece of Mukilteo Lighthouse Park, with the grounds and interior open to the public.

Typically, about 10% of the energy is transferred from one trophic level to the next, thus preventing a large number of trophic levels. Energy pyramids are necessarily upright in healthy ecosystems, that is, there must always be more energy available at a given level of the pyramid to support the energy and biomass requirement of the next trophic level. An ecological pyramid (also trophic pyramid, Eltonian pyramid, energy pyramid, or sometimes food pyramid) is a graphical representation designed to show the biomass or bioproductivity at each trophic level in a given ecosystem. A pyramid of energy shows how much energy is retained in the form of new biomass at each trophic level, while a pyramid of biomass shows how much biomass (the amount of living or organic matter present in an organism) is present in the organisms. There is also a pyramid of numbers representing the number of individual organisms at each trophic level. Pyramids of energy are normally upright, but other pyramids can be inverted or take other shapes. Ecological pyramids begin with producers on the bottom (such as plants) and proceed through the various trophic levels (such as herbivores that eat plants, then carnivores that eat flesh, then omnivores that eat both plants and flesh, and so on). The highest level is the top of the food chain. Biomass can be measured by a bomb calorimeter. Pyramid of energy A pyramid of energy or pyramid of productivity shows the production or turnover (the rate at which energy or mass is transferred from one trophic level to the next) of biomass at each trophic level. Instead of showing a single snapshot in time, productivity pyramids show the flow of energy through the food chain. Typical units are grams per square meter per year or calories per square meter per year. As with the others, this graph shows producers at the bottom and higher trophic levels on top. When an ecosystem is healthy, this graph produces a standard ecological pyramid. This is because in order for the ecosystem to sustain itself, there must be more energy at lower trophic levels than there is at higher trophic levels. This allows organisms on the lower levels to not only maintain a stable population, but also to transfer energy up the pyramid. The exception to this generalization is when portions of a food web are supported by inputs of resources from outside the local community. In small, forested streams, for example, the volume of higher levels is greater than could be supported by the local primary production. Energy usually enters ecosystems from the Sun. The primary producers at the base of the pyramid use the solar radiation to power photosynthesis which produces food. However most wavelengths in solar radiation cannot be used for photosynthesis, so they are reflected back into space or absorbed elsewhere and converted to heat. Only 1 to 2 percent of the energy from the sun is absorbed by photosynthetic processes, and converted into food.Gates DM, Thompson JN and Thompson MB (2018) Efficiency of solar energy utilization Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Accessed: 26 December 2019. When energy is transferred to higher trophic levels, on average only about 10% is used at each level to build new biomass, becoming stored energy. The rest goes to metabolic processes such as growth, respiration, and reproduction.Pauly, D. and Christensen, V (1995) \\"Primary production required to sustain global fisheries\\". Nature 374.6519: 255-257. Advantages of the pyramid of energy as a representation: * It takes account of the rate of production over a period of time. * Two species of comparable biomass may have very different life spans. Thus a direct comparison of their total biomasses is misleading, but their productivity is directly comparable. * The relative energy chain within an ecosystem can be compared using pyramids of energy; also different ecosystems can be compared. * There are no inverted pyramids. * The input of solar energy can be added. Disadvantages of the pyramid of energy as a representation: * The rate of biomass production of an organism is required, which involves measuring growth and reproduction through time. * There is still the difficulty of assigning the organisms to a specific trophic level. As well as the organisms in the food chains there is the problem of assigning the decomposers and detritivores to a particular trophic level. Pyramid of biomass A pyramid of biomass shows the total biomass of the organisms involved at each trophic level of an ecosystem. These pyramids are not necessarily upright. There can be lower amounts of biomass at the bottom of the pyramid if the rate of primary production per unit biomass is high. A pyramid of biomass shows the relationship between biomass and trophic level by quantifying the biomass present at each trophic level of an ecological community at a particular time. It is a graphical representation of biomass (total amount of living or organic matter in an ecosystem) present in unit area in different trophic levels. Typical units are grams per square meter, or calories per square meter. The pyramid of biomass may be \\"inverted\\". For example, in a pond ecosystem, the standing crop of phytoplankton, the major producers, at any given point will be lower than the mass of the heterotrophs, such as fish and insects. This is explained as the phytoplankton reproduce very quickly, but have much shorter individual lives. Pyramid of numbers A pyramid of numbers shows the number of individual organisms involved at each trophic level in an ecosystem. The pyramids are not necessarily upright. In some ecosystems there can be more primary consumers than producers. A pyramid of numbers shows graphically the population, or abundance, in terms of the number of individual organisms involved at each level in a food chain. This shows the number of organisms in each trophic level without any consideration for their individual sizes or biomass. The pyramid is not necessarily upright. For example, it will be inverted if beetles are feeding from the output of forest trees, or parasites are feeding on large host animals. History The concept of pyramid of numbers (\\"Eltonian pyramid\\") was developed by Charles Elton (1927).Elton, C. 1927. Animal Ecology. New York, Macmillan Co. link. Later, it would also be expressed in terms of biomass by Bodenheimer (1938).Bodenheimer, F. S. 1938. Problems of Animal Ecology. Oxford University Press. link.

The hospital was officially opened on 26 September 1980. The hospital originally was developed to be a site for future expansion of the Mater Children's Hospital, a centre for servicing the needs of the Commonwealth Games held nearby and a range of other initiatives that never eventuated. At one point in its history it was almost closed but after vigorous protests by the local community it was reopened and continues as an elective surgical hospital and an active general medical facility. In 2007 it became part of the newly formed Brisbane South Health District and the QEII Hospital Health Service District was abolished. The district included four hospital services ‚Äì Beaudesert, Logan, Bayside and QEII. There was also a proposal to build a stand-alone 'surgicentre' at QEII to provide for increased elective surgery. The eventual outcome was a range of internal redevelopments including an enhanced outpatients area, a new ward, an additional operating theatre and considerable infrastructure upgrades. In January 2008 it was announced that the Federal Government would provide funding of $2 Billion for eight medical super clinics as a plan to improve public health services. The QEII Hospital was to be one of the eight hospitals to receive the super clinic boost. By March 2009 no further development of a medical super clinic at QEII had occurred though it was still actively rumoured as a Commonwealth Government initiative. By 2014 there were no longer any plans for a super clinic at QEII. In late 2008 the Southside Health District and the Princess Alexandra Hospital Health District merged and it was renamed Metrosouth Health Service District. The QEII as it is known continues to function as before, though the former Community Health Services administrative area was closed and as of February 2009 and an additional ward was opened to increase the elective surgical capacity of the facility.

A subordinate and right-hand man of Duan Qirui, he was a prominent member of the Anhui clique.  Early life  Xu was born in Xiao County, Jiangsu (now part of Anhui province), with a scholar family background. He was one of the youngest persons ever to pass the Imperial examinations. In 1905 he was accepted into the Japanese School of Land Army Officials, and returned to China in 1910. From 1911-17 he served in the First Army in various positions on the general staff, such as chief of the Logistics Department, deputy chief of land forces and chief of land forces. In 1914 he founded a middle school called Cheng Da Middle School, which is the predecessor of today‚Äôs Affiliated High School of the Capital Normal College. In 1918 Xu founded the Anfu Club, the political arm of the Anhui clique, which then won three-fourths of the seats in the National Assembly. Later that year Xu executed Lu Jianzhang after discovering that Lu was trying to persuade Feng Yuxiang, Lu's nephew, to fight against the Anhui clique. This would lead to Xu's own assassination in 1925.  Military career  Xu Shuzheng In 1919 Xu assumed command of the Northwest Frontier Defense Army, which invaded newly independent Outer Mongolia in October. On November 17 he forced Outer Mongolia to withdraw its declaration of autonomy, thus temporarily bringing Mongolia back under Chinese control. In 1920, after Duan fell from power, Xu lost his position and moved his forces back to confront his enemies. He was replaced in Mongolia by Chen Yi, and Mongolia became independent again in early 1921 when Chinese forces were defeated by the Russian‚ÄìMongol army commanded by Gen. Baron Roman von Ungern- Sternberg. Xu's forces were defeated in the subsequent Zhili‚ÄìAnhui War and he was forced to take shelter in the Japanese embassy. In the early 1920s Xu was sent to Italy as part of a Chinese diplomatic mission; a secondary purpose was to get him out of the country. He returned to China in 1924 after Duan's return as chief executive.  Death  In December 1925, while traveling from Beijing to Shanghai by train, Xu was kidnapped by Zhang Zhijiang, a member of Feng Yuxiang's forces. He was assassinated at dawn the next day by Feng as revenge for the killing of Lu Jianzhang. This also deprived Feng's rival Duan of a powerful supporter. Xu was 45 years old.  Personal life  Xu Shuzhen (second from left) led a delegation to the Brussels Airport in Belgium, August 1925. The left one was Xu Daolin. Xu had one wife and four concubines. His wife Xia Hongjun (, also named Xia Xuan ()), died in Suzhou, Jiangxu Province, in 1955. They had four sons and two daughters. First son Hsu Shen-chiao ( Xu Shenjiao) and third son Hsu Dau-lin (, Xu Daolin) were active in Republic of China politics.

In integrated circuit design, hardware emulation is the process of imitating the behavior of one or more pieces of hardware (typically a system under design) with another piece of hardware, typically a special purpose emulation system. The emulation model is usually based on a hardware description language (e.g. Verilog) source code, which is compiled into the format used by emulation system. The goal is normally debugging and functional verification of the system being designed. Often an emulator is fast enough to be plugged into a working target system in place of a yet-to-be-built chip, so the whole system can be debugged with live data. This is a specific case of in-circuit emulation. Sometimes hardware emulation can be confused with hardware devices such as expansion cards with hardware processors that assist functions of software emulation, such as older daughterboards with x86 chips to allow x86 OSes to run on motherboards of different processor families.  Introduction  The largest fraction of silicon integrated circuit respins and steppings are due at least in part to functional errors and bugs inadvertently introduced at RTL stage of the design process. Thus, comprehensive functional verification is key to reducing development costs and delivering a product on time. Functional verification of a design is most often performed using logic simulation and/or prototyping on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). There are advantages and disadvantages to each and often both are used. Logic simulation is easy, accurate, flexible, and low cost. However, simulation is often not fast enough for large designs and almost always too slow to run application software against the hardware design. FPGA-based prototypes are fast and inexpensive, but the time required to implement a large design into several FPGAs can be very long and is error- prone. Changes to fix design flaws also take a long time to implement and may require board wiring changes. With traditional vendor tools, FPGA prototypes have little debugging capability, probing signals inside the FPGAs in real time is very difficult, and recompiling FPGAs to move probes takes too long. This is changing with the emergence of more advanced FPGA prototype debug tools that remove limitations on signal visibility. The usual compromise is to use simulation early in the verification process when bugs and fixes are frequent, and prototyping at the end of the development cycle when the design is basically complete and speed is needed to get sufficient testing to uncover any remaining system-level bugs. FPGA prototyping is also popular for testing software. Simulation acceleration can address the performance shortcomings of simulation to an extent. Here the design is mapped into a hardware accelerator to run much faster and the testbench (and any behavioral design code) continues to run on the simulator on the workstation. A high-bandwidth, low latency channel connects the workstation to the accelerator to exchange signal data between testbench and design. By Amdahl's law, the slowest device in the chain will determine the speed achievable. Normally, this is the testbench in the simulator. With a very efficient testbench (written in C or transaction- based), the channel may become the bottleneck. In some cases, a transaction- level testbench is able to feed as much data to the design being emulated as \\"live\\" stimulus. In-circuit emulation improves somewhat on FPGA prototyping's implementation times, and provides a comprehensive, efficient debugging capability. Emulation does this at the expense of running speed and high cost ($1M+) compared to FPGA prototypes ($75K). Looking at emulation from the other direction, it improves on acceleration's performance by substituting \\"live\\" stimulus for the simulated testbench. This stimulus can come from a target system (the product being developed), or from test equipment. At 10,000 to 100,000 times the speed of simulation, emulation makes it possible to test application software while still providing a comprehensive hardware debug environment.  Debugging simulations vs. emulations/prototyping  It is worth noting that simulation and prototyping involve two different styles of execution. Simulation executes the RTL code serially while a prototype executes fully in parallel. This leads to differences in debugging. In simulation: *The user can set a breakpoint and stop simulation to inspect the design state, interact with the design, and resume simulation. *The user can stop execution ‚Äúmid-cycle‚Äù as it were with only part of the code executed. *The user can see any signal in the design and the contents of any memory location at any time. *The user can even back up time (if they saved checkpoint(s)) and re-run. With a prototype: *The user employs a logic analyzer for visibility, and so can see only a limited number of signals which they determined ahead of time (by clipping on probes). This is changing with emerging FPGA prototype tools that provide full visibility to 10,000s of internal signals, such as Certus. *The target does not stop when the logic analyzer triggers, so each time the user changes the probes or trigger condition, they have to reset the environment and start again from the beginning. *Probes are added directly to the RTL design to make specific signals available for observation. When the system is run, the RTL-based probe connected to each of the instrumented signals collects the signal's value at each clock cycle. The data is stored in a trace buffer in FPGA block RAM. An analyzer connected to the prototype downloads the information giving the user offline visibility into the system for efficient debug. Acceleration and emulation are more like prototyping and silicon in terms of RTL execution and debugging since the entire design executes simultaneously as it will in the silicon. Since the same hardware is often used to provide both simulation acceleration and in-circuit emulation, these systems provide a blend of these two very different debugging styles. High end hardware emulators provide a debugging environment with many features that can be found in logic simulators, and in some cases even surpass their debugging capabilities: *The user can set a breakpoint and stop emulation to inspect the design state, interact with the design, and resume emulation. The emulator always stops on cycle boundaries. *The user has visibility to any signal or memory contents in the design without the need to set up probes before the run. While visibility is provided also for past time, the amount of time that it can show in the past might be limited in some cases to the depth of the emulator's trace memory. *The user can even back up time (if they saved checkpoint(s)) and re- run. *Because of their high cost, emulators are beyond the reach of many developers, leading to the rise of advanced FPGA prototyping platforms and debug tools..  Emulation and 2-state logic  Another difference between simulation and acceleration and emulation is a consequence of accelerators using hardware for implementation ‚Äì they have only two logic states ‚Äì acting the way the silicon will when fabricated. This implies: *They are not useful for analyzing X-state initialization. *They cannot analyze strength resolution, or at least this must be done statically at compile time. *Emulators do not model precise circuit timing, and hence they will probably not find any race conditions or setup and hold time violations. These tasks are properly carried out during logic simulation or with a static timing analysis tool.  Emulation versus prototyping  A key traditional distinction between an emulator and an FPGA prototyping system has been that the emulator provides a rich debug environment, while a prototyping system has little or no debug capability and is primarily used after the design is debugged to create multiple copies for system analysis and software development. New tools that enable full RTL signal visibility with a small FPGA LUT impact, allow deep capture depth and provide multi-chip and clock domain analysis are emerging to allow efficient debug, comparable to the emulator.

In short, Apollodorus says that Bactriana is the ornament of Ariana as a whole; and, more than that, they extended their empire even as far as the Seres and the Phryni.\\" (Strabo 11.11.1 ) Notes # Strabo 11.11.1 Full text Category:Ancient Greek language Category:Geography of India Category:Indus River Category:Geography of Sindh Category:Geography of Pakistan ","title":"Sigerdis"},{"id":"3575119","text":"Hurricane Lili was one of only four Atlantic tropical cyclones on record to reach hurricane status in the month of December. The final of thirteen tropical storms in the 1984 Atlantic hurricane season, Lili developed as a subtropical cyclone which originated from a frontal trough to the south of Bermuda on December 12. It tracked southeastward, then northward, slowly attaining tropical characteristics and becoming a hurricane on December 20. Lili turned to the south and southwest, briefly threatening the northern Caribbean islands before weakening and dissipating near the coast of the Dominican Republic. The storm produced light rainfall but no damage. Meteorological history In the second week of December, a frontal trough stalled south of Bermuda. An upper level disturbance moved over the area on December 9, and produced widespread convection along the frontal wave. The system moved to the northeast, and based on a developing circulation within the convection, the National Hurricane Center classified the system as a subtropical storm on December 12 while located 275 miles (440 km) northeast of Bermuda. With winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) and strengthening, the subtropical storm initially drifted northeastward. On December 13, a ridge of high pressure to its north forced the storm southeastward, and the following day the storm turned to the south after an upper-level cold-core low developed over the system. A break in the ridge resulted in the storm turning to the northeast, with its forward motion accelerating to nearly 40 mph (65 km/h). After turning to the northwest on December 17, the high pressure system again halted its northward movement, leaving the storm drifting south-southeastward. Conditions favored further strengthening, and the subtropical storm reached 70 mph (115 km/h) winds on December 18. Satellite imagery estimated the storm attained hurricane status on December 19, and a day later ship near the center reported winds of 75 mph (120 km/h). Based on the wind report, as well as a minimum central pressure of 980 mbar and a well-defined eye, the storm was classified as Hurricane Lili while located 730 miles (1,180 km) east of Bermuda. Lili continued generally southward, reaching its peak intensity of 80 mph (130 km/h). Higher pressures developed to its northeast, resulting in the hurricane to accelerate to the southwest. On December 22, Lili finished executing its large cyclonic loop by passing over the same location it passed one week prior. The combination of its increased forward speed, as well as increased levels of vertical wind shear, created an unfavorable environment which caused steady weakening. On December 23, Lili weakened to a tropical storm while located 430 miles (690 km) northeast of Antigua. It rapidly lost organization as it approached the Leeward Islands, and dissipated just off the coast of the Dominican Republic on December 24. Impact and records When Lili reached hurricane status on December 20, it became one of only four Atlantic tropical cyclones to reach hurricane strength in the month of December. The other three were an unnamed hurricane in the 1887 season, Hurricane Alice in 1954, and Hurricane Epsilon in 2005. In addition, Hurricane Nicole lasted as a hurricane from late November to early December 1998. Because of its rapid movement, a hurricane watch was issued for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands on December 22. As the storm weakened, the watches were discontinued. In response to the threat of the hurricane, officials posted a small craft advisory along the coastline of northern Puerto Rico. There, the weakening tropical cyclone produced light rainfall, though there was no reported damage. Lili moved through Hispaniola as an area of squally weather, but damage, if any, is unknown.  Accounts  Sailor Brian Hancock encountered Hurricane Lili during the Route of Discovery yacht race from Benalm√°dena, Spain to Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic. > Tropical Storm Lili was traveling at around 18 knots along the same path as > the race fleet and was starting to pick off the slower boats.

The ball is kicked so short that it forces the receiving team's slower players to recover the ball first instead of their faster kick returner. Secondly, the bouncing ball may be harder for the receiving team to pick up, allowing more time for kicking team members to get downfield to surround the ball carrier. History The first recognized use of this by design in modern play was by the San Francisco 49ers during the 1981 season. On opening day, 49ers kicker Ray Wersching, due to an injured leg, was forced to kick the ball lightly on a kickoff at the Pontiac Silverdome against the Detroit Lions causing the ball to hit the ground instead of sailing through the air. The hard Astroturf surface of the Silverdome saw the spheroid-shaped football bounce oddly, sporadically, and was noticeably difficult for the receiving team to field. Its characteristics were that of an onside kick. Head coach Bill Walsh turned this predicament into design and used it later in Super Bowl XVI, also held at the Silverdome. Wersching made two squib kicks late in the first half. The first pinned the Bengals deep in their own territory, and after forcing a punt, the resulting good field position led to a 49ers field goal. Moments later, as time was running out in the half, Wersching made a second squib kick, and this time the Bengals muffed the ball, and the 49ers recovered. As time expired in the half, 49ers scored a last-second field goal. Strategy The squib kick is a tactic used to prevent a long return, usually at the end of the half. On average the receiving team will gain better field position than it would returning a normal kick. However, it is considered worthwhile by the kicking team, as it is more difficult to return for a touchdown. Also it must be returned, which is not the case on a touchback, and thus it takes time off the clock and often brings the half to an end. A squib kick can work against the kicking team, especially if the receiving team is expecting it. Because the kick is so short, the receiving team will usually get good field position, even if there is a minimal gain on the return. With moderate gain, the receiving team can find themselves in field goal territory quickly. Squib kicks are also more difficult to pull off successfully than they were in the 1980s, since artificial turf has evolved to thicker, less bouncy installations such as FieldTurf. The unpredictable nature of a squib kick's bounce can also play against the kicking team if the ball inadvertently bounces out of bounds, giving the receiving team far better field position. Famous examples Perhaps the most famous example of a squib kick is the controversial last- second kickoff return, nicknamed \\"The Play\\", during the November 20, 1982 college football game between the University of California, Berkeley (\\"California\\" or \\"Cal\\") Golden Bears and their arch-rival, the Stanford Cardinal. Stanford took the lead 20-19 with only four seconds remaining in the game. Anticipating a squib kick, Cal coach Joe Kapp sent his onsides return team into the game. The players recovered the ball and lateraled it five times -- two of them controversial - to score a touchdown to win the game. In Super Bowl XLI, the Indianapolis Colts decided to squib kick five of six subsequent kickoffs after Devin Hester of the Chicago Bears returned the opening kickoff for a touchdown. The Colts ended up winning 29-17. In Super Bowl XXXVII, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers used the squib kick on all of kickoffs against the Oakland Raiders, ending up in an overwhelming win for Tampa Bay. In the Central European Championship, 2007, the assistant coach of the Budapest Wolves, William Goldenberg, called a squib kick within the last few minutes of the 4th quarter versus the Belgrad Vukovi. This controversial kick was returned and eventually led to the Vukovi winning within the last minute of the game.

This holiday is held every year on October 11 by Presidential Proclamation, to commemorate his death from wounds suffered at the Siege of Savannah on October 9, 1779 and to honor the heritage of Polish Americans. The observance was established in 1929 when Congress passed a resolution (Public Resolution 16 of 1929) designating October 11 as General Pulaski Memorial Day. Every President has issued a proclamation for the observance annually since (except in 1930). This is a separate holiday from the regional holiday in the Chicago area titled Casimir Pulaski Day that commemorates Pulaski's birth on March 4, 1746. Regional celebrations New York City has an annual Pulaski Day Parade and Grand Rapids, Michigan holds Pulaski Days at this time. Some areas with large Polish-American populations instead celebrate Casimir Pulaski Day on the first Monday of every March, marking Pulaski's March 4, 1746 birth. Wisconsin, Illinois, Kentucky and Indiana have state recognition of this holiday, which is particularly popular in Chicago and Milwaukee. General Pulaski's Day is a holiday recognized by the Commonwealth of Kentucky, United States \\"in commemoration of the death of revolutionary General Casimir Pulaski\\". General Pulaski's Day is observed on October 11 of every year in Kentucky. General Pulaski's Day was created by a statute enacted by the Kentucky General Assembly sometime prior to 1942. History of the battle and Pulaski's role The Siege of Savannah was an encounter of the American Revolutionary War in 1779. The year before, the city of Savannah, Georgia had been captured by a British expeditionary corps under Lieutenant-Colonel Archibald Campbell. The siege itself consisted of a joint Franco-American attempt to retake Savannah from September 16, 1779 to October 18, 1779. On October 9, 1779, a major assault against the British siege works failed. During the attack, Polish Kazimierz Pu≈Çaski, fighting on the American side, was mortally wounded. With the failure of the joint American-French attack, the siege failed, and the British remained in control of Georgia until July 1782, close to the end of the war. The battle is much remembered in Haitian history; the Fontages Legion, consisting of over 500 gens de couleur‚Äîfree men of color from Saint-Domingue‚Äîfought on the French side. Henri Christophe, who later became king of independent Haiti, is thought to have been among these troops. In 2005 archaeologists with the Coastal Heritage Society and the LAMAR Institute discovered portions of the British fortifications at Spring Hill. The brunt of the combined French and American attack on October 9, 1779, was focused at that point. The find represents the first tangible remains of the battlefield. In 2008 the CHS/LAMAR Institute archaeology team discovered another segment of the British fortifications in Madison Square. Observances President George W.

The grouping is approximate, as paradoxes may fit into more than one category. This list collects only scenarios that have been called a paradox by at least one source and have their own article on Wikipedia. Although considered paradoxes, some of these are simply based on fallacious reasoning (falsidical), or an unintuitive solution (veridical). Informally, the term paradox is often used to describe a counter-intuitive result. However, some of these paradoxes qualify to fit into the mainstream perception of a paradox, which is a self- contradictory result gained even while properly applying accepted ways of reasoning. These paradoxes, often called antinomy, point out genuine problems in our understanding of the ideas of truth and description.  Logic  * : The supposition that, 'if one of two simultaneous assumptions leads to a contradiction, the other assumption is also disproved' leads to paradoxical consequences. Not to be confused with the Barber paradox. * : If a presumption needs to be made that a specific result can be deduced from premises, then the result can never be deduced. Also known as Carroll's paradox and is not to be confused with the \\"Achilles and the tortoise\\" paradox by Zeno of Elea. * : A situation in which someone is in need of something that can only be had by not being in need of it. A soldier who wants to be declared insane to avoid combat is deemed not insane for that very reason and will therefore not be declared insane. * : In any pub there is a customer such that if that customer is drinking, everybody in the pub is drinking. * : Inconsistent premises always make an argument valid. * : If there is one winning ticket in a large lottery, it is reasonable to believe of any particular lottery ticket that it is not the winning ticket, but it is not reasonable to believe that no lottery ticket will win. * : (or Hempel's Ravens): Observing a green apple increases the likelihood of all ravens being black. * : Disjunction introduction poses a problem for imperative inference by seemingly permitting arbitrary imperatives to be inferred. * : The day of the hanging will be a surprise, so it cannot happen at all, so it will be a surprise. The surprise examination and Bottle Imp paradox use similar logic.  These paradoxes have in common a contradiction arising from either self-reference or circular reference, in which several statements refer to each other in a way that following some of the references leads back to the starting point. * : A male barber shaves all and only those men who do not shave themselves. Does he shave himself? (Russell's popularization of his set theoretic paradox.) * : The thesis that there are some things which are unnameable conflicts with the notion that something is named by calling it unnameable. * : The phrase \\"the first number not nameable in under ten words\\" appears to name it in nine words. * : If a crocodile steals a child and promises its return if the father can correctly guess exactly what the crocodile will do, how should the crocodile respond in the case that the father guesses that the child will not be returned? * : A law student agrees to pay his teacher after (and only after) winning his first case. The teacher then sues the student (who has not yet won a case) for payment. * : \\"If this sentence is true, then Santa Claus exists.\\" * : A Cretan says: \\"All Cretans are liars\\". This paradox works in mainly the same way as the liar paradox. * : Is the word \\"heterological\\", meaning \\"not applicable to itself\\", a heterological word? (A close relative of Russell's paradox.) * : If there was a name for a natural number that is identical to a name of the successor of that number, there would be a natural number equal to its successor. * : By formulating an equivalent to Richard's paradox, untyped lambda calculus is shown to be inconsistent. * : \\"This sentence is not known.\\" * : \\"This sentence is false.\\" This is the canonical self-referential paradox. Also \\"Is the answer to this question 'no'?\\", and \\"I'm lying.\\" **: \\"The next statement is true. The previous statement is false.\\" A variant of the liar paradox in which neither of the sentences employs (direct) self-reference, instead this is a case of circular reference. ** : Two sentences that each say the other is not true. ** : What would happen if Pinocchio said \\"My nose grows now\\"? , an image of Pinocchio with a speech bubble \\"My nose will grow now!\\" has become a minor Internet phenomenon (Google search, Google image search). It seems likely that this paradox has been independently conceived multiple times. ** : \\"'Yields a falsehood when appended to its own quotation' yields a falsehood when appended to its own quotation.\\" Shows that a sentence can be paradoxical even if it is not self-referring and does not use demonstratives or indexicals. ** : An ordered infinite sequence of sentences, each of which says that all following sentences are false. While constructed to avoid self- reference, there is no consensus whether it relies on self-reference or not. * : \\"It is opposite day today.\\" Therefore, it is not opposite day, but if you say it is a normal day it would be considered a normal day, which contradicts the fact that it has previously been stated that it is an opposite day. * : It initially appears as if we can quantify over absolutely everything (including the expression itself), but this generates the liar paradox * : We appear to be able to use simple English to define a decimal expansion in a way that is self-contradictory. * : Does the set of all those sets that do not contain themselves contain itself? * : \\"All I know is that I know nothing.\\"  Vagueness  * : It seems like one can replace any component of a ship, and it is still the same ship. So they can replace them all, one at a time, and it is still the same ship. However, they can then take all the original pieces, and assemble them into a ship. That, too, is the same ship they began with. : See also * (also known as the paradox of the heap): If one removes a single grain of sand from a heap, they still have a heap. If they keep removing single grains, the heap will disappear. Can a single grain of sand make the difference between heap and non-heap?  Mathematics  * : A fallacious argument by induction that appears to prove that all horses are the same color. * : An ant crawling on a rubber rope can reach the end even when the rope stretches much faster than the ant can crawl. * : The number of points of intersection of two higher-order curves can be greater than the number of arbitrary points needed to define one such curve. * : Elevators can seem to be mostly going in one direction, as if they were being manufactured in the middle of the building and being disassembled on the roof and basement. * : The first number that can be considered \\"dull\\" rather than \\"interesting\\" becomes interesting because of that fact. * : If potatoes consisting of 99% water dry so that they are 98% water, they lose 50% of their weight. * : Does the set of all those sets that do not contain themselves contain itself?

Babies of smokers have lower average birth weight, but low birth weight babies born to smokers have a lower mortality rate than other low birth weight babies. This is a special case of Simpson's paradox. * , or the ': A trend that appears in different groups of data disappears when these groups are combined, and the reverse trend appears for the aggregate data. * : The mathematical concept of an average, whether defined as the mean or median, leads to apparently paradoxical results‚Äîfor example, it is possible that moving an entry from an encyclopedia to a dictionary would increase the average entry length on both books.  Probability  The Monty Hall problem: which door do you choose? * : A paradox of conditional probability closely related to the Boy or Girl paradox. * : Different common-sense definitions of randomness give quite different results. * : What is the chance that two people in a room have the same birthday? * : Conditional probability density functions are not invariant under coordinate transformations. * : A two-child family has at least one boy. What is the probability that it has a girl? * Dartboard Puzzle: If a dart is guaranteed to hit a dartboard and the probability of hitting a specific point is positive, adding the infinitely many positive chances yields infinity, but the chance of hitting the dartboard is one. If the probability of hitting each point is zero, the probability of hitting anywhere on the dartboard is zero. * : A test that is accurate the vast majority of the time could show you have a disease, but the probability that you actually have it could still be tiny. * : Shows that the exact meaning of statements involving conditionals and probabilities is more complicated than may be obvious on casual examination. * : An unintuitive consequence of conditional probability. * : A wager between two people seems to favour them both. Very similar in essence to the Two- envelope paradox. * : One can have three dice, called A, B, and C, such that A is likely to win in a roll against B, B is likely to win in a roll against C, and C is likely to win in a roll against A. * : The Kelly criterion is an often optimal strategy for maximizing profit in the long run. Proebsting's paradox apparently shows that the Kelly criterion can lead to ruin. * : A probability problem that can be correctly answered as one half or one third depending on how the question is approached. * : When pulling a random card, how do you determine the color of the underside? * : A variation of the Monty Hall problem. * : You are given two indistinguishable envelopes, each of which contains a positive sum of money. One envelope contains twice as much as the other. You may pick one envelope and keep whatever amount it contains.

Geometry and topology  The Banach‚ÄìTarski paradox: A ball can be decomposed and reassembled into two balls the same size as the original. * : Cut a ball into a finite number of pieces and re-assemble the pieces to get two balls, each of equal size to the first. The von Neumann paradox is a two-dimensional analogue. ** : A set that can be partitioned into two sets, each of which is equivalent to the original. * : the perimeter of a landmass is in general ill-defined. * : a coin rotating along the edge of an identical coin will make a full revolution after traversing only half of the stationary coin's circumference. * : or ': A simple object with finite volume but infinite surface area. Also, the Mandelbrot set and various other fractals are covered by a finite area, but have an infinite perimeter (in fact, there are no two distinct points on the boundary of the Mandelbrot set that can be reached from one another by moving a finite distance along that boundary, which also implies that in a sense you go no further if you walk \\"the wrong way\\" around the set to reach a nearby point). * : There exists a countable subset C of the sphere S such that S\\\\C is equidecomposable with two copies of itself. * : an optical illusion * : A set contained in and with the same Lebesgue measure as the unit square, yet for every one of its points there is a straight line intersecting the Nikodym set only in that point. * : A sphere can, topologically, be turned inside out.  Decision theory  * : People can make decisions based not on what they actually want to do, but on what they think that other people want to do, with the result that everybody decides to do something that nobody really wants to do, but only what they thought that everybody else wanted to do. * : Some systems of apportioning representation can have unintuitive results due to rounding ** : Increasing the total number of seats might shrink one block's seats. ** : Adding a new state or voting block might increase the number of votes of another. ** : A fast-growing state can lose votes to a slow-growing state. * : Given more than two choices, no system can have all the attributes of an ideal voting system at once. * : How can a rational choice be made between two outcomes of equal value? * : Even those who know better play the so-called chain store game in an irrational manner. * : Selecting the best decision-making method is a decision problem in itself. * : People exhibit ambiguity aversion (as distinct from risk aversion), in contradiction with expected utility theory. * : The belief that people generally disapprove of the United States Congress as a whole, but support the Congressman from their own Congressional district. * : The more similar two choices are, the more time a decision-making agent spends on deciding. * : Policies intending to reduce future CO2 emissions may lead to increased emissions in the present. * : or Lover's paradox Despite goodwill, human intimacy cannot occur without substantial mutual harm. * : It is easier to solve a more general problem that covers the specifics of the sought-after solution. * : Can one intend to drink the non-deadly toxin, if the intention is the only thing needed to get the reward? *Motivation crowding theory: Adding incentives for some behavior can sometimes backfire and actually result in less of that behavior. * : a type of false dilemma in which contradictory observations lead to the same conclusion. * : Increased navigational precision may result in increased collision risk. * : How do you play a game against an omniscient opponent? * : Should one tolerate intolerance if intolerance would destroy the possibility of tolerance? * : Also known as the Downs paradox.

If a member of a moving row moves past a member of the stationary row in an indivisible instant of time, they move past two members of the row that is moving in the other direction in this instant of time.  Astrophysics  * : In some binary star systems the partners seem to have different ages, even though they are thought to have formed at the same time. * : The contradiction between existence of liquid water early in the Earth's history and the expectation that the output of the young Sun would have been insufficient to melt ice on Earth. * : Extreme-energy cosmic rays have been observed that seem to violate the Greisen‚ÄìZatsepin‚ÄìKuzmin limit, which is a consequence of special relativity. * : Compared to theory, there is an overabundance of young stars close to the supermassive black hole in the Galactic Center. * Olbers' paradox: see  Classical mechanics  * : If the tortoise is ahead of Achilles, by the time Achilles reaches the tortoise's current position, the tortoise will have moved a bit further ahead, which goes on indefinitely. * : An archer must, in order to hit his target, not aim directly at it, but slightly to the side. Not to be confused with the arrow paradox. * If we divide time into discrete 0-duration slices, no motion is happening in each of them, so taking them all as a whole, motion is impossible. * : A massive battleship can float in a few litres of water. * : Rolling joined concentric wheels seem to trace the same distance with their circumferences, even though the circumferences are different. * : The angular momentum of a stick should be zero, but is not. * : Flow of an inviscid fluid produces no net force on a solid body. *: Based on the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations, one would expect the mass flux in a channel to decrease with increasing Knudsen number, but there is a distinct minimum around Knudsen number 0.8. * : Surface-dwelling arthropods (such as the water strider) should not be able to propel themselves horizontally. * : To reach its target, an airborne arrow must first reach an infinite number of midpoints between its current position and the target. * : Even though hydrometers are used to measure fluid density, a hydrometer will not indicate changes of fluid density caused by changing atmospheric pressure. * : Which way does a sprinkler rotate when submerged in a tank and made to suck in the surrounding fluid? * : Are there non-deterministic systems in Newtonian mechanics? * : Rigid-body dynamics with contact and friction is inconsistent. * : When a cup of tea is stirred, the leaves assemble in the center, even though centrifugal force pushes them outward. * : When a fluid is poured from a higher container onto a lower one, particles can climb up the falling water.  Cosmology  * : In a Newtonian universe, gravitation should pull all matter into a single point. * : If the universe we observe resulted from a random thermodynamic fluctuation, it would be vastly more likely to be a simple one than the complex one we observe. The simplest case would be just a brain floating in vacuum, having the thoughts and sensations you have. * : If there are, as various arguments suggest, many other sentient species in the Universe, then where are they? Should not their presence be obvious? * : If the universe were infinitely old, it would be in thermodynamical equilibrium, which contradicts what we observe. * : Why is the night sky dark if there is an infinity of stars, covering every part of the celestial sphere?  Electromagnetism  * : An apparent violation of Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction.  Quantum mechanics  * : A charged particle is affected by an electromagnetic field even though it has no local contact with that field * : Why do measured quantum particles not satisfy mathematical probability theory? * : Matter and energy can act as a wave or as a particle depending on the experiment. * : Can far away events influence each other in quantum mechanics? * : In the small wavelength limit, the total scattering cross section of an impenetrable sphere is twice its geometrical cross-sectional area (which is the value obtained in classical mechanics). * : How can we make inferences about past events that we haven't observed while at the same time acknowledge that the act of observing it affects the reality we are inferring to? * : When the potential of a potential barrier becomes similar to the mass of the impinging particle, it becomes transparent. * : Spherically symmetric wave functions, when observed, produce linear particle tracks. * : Energies stored on capacitance and inductance are not equal to the ground state energy of the quantum oscillator. * : Two players who can not communicate accomplish tasks that seemingly require direct contact. * : (Turing paradox) echoing the Zeno paradox, a quantum particle that is continuously observed cannot change its state * : According to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, a cat could be simultaneously alive and dead, as long as it remains unobserved. * : There is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle, known as complementary variables, such as position and momentum can be known. This is often confused with a similar effect in physics called the observer effect  Relativity  * : About the stress on a rope under the effects of length contraction. * : Black holes violate a commonly assumed tenet of science that information cannot be destroyed. * : On the kinematics of a rigid rotating disk. * : Introductory relativity problem about a ladder, a barn, and simultaneity. * : Which formula should be used to transform velocities between non-collinear reference frames in special relativity? * : An accelerated charge should radiate, yet such radiation is not observed for stationary particles on gravitational fields. * : The buoyancy of a relativistic object (such as a bullet) appears to change when the reference frame is changed from one in which the bullet is at rest to one in which the fluid is at rest. * : Einstein's thought experiment about how faster-than- light communication could cause a causality paradox. * : Does a torque arise in static systems when changing frames? * : The theory of relativity predicts that a person making a round trip will return younger than his or her identical twin who stayed at home.  Thermodynamics  * : In an ideal gas, is entropy an extensive variable? * : Why is there an inevitable increase in entropy when the laws of physics are invariant under time reversal? The time reversal symmetry of physical laws appears to contradict the second law of thermodynamics. * : The second law of thermodynamics seems to be violated by a cleverly operated trapdoor. * : Hot water can, under certain conditions, freeze faster than cold water, even though it must pass the lower temperature on the way to freezing.  Biology  * : In some areas of the oceans, phytoplankton concentrations are low despite there apparently being sufficient nutrients. * : Genome size does not correlate with organismal complexity. For example, some unicellular organisms have genomes much larger than that of humans. * : Even a tiny fecundity advantage of one additional offspring would favor the evolution of semelparity. * : Despite their relatively small muscle mass, dolphins can swim at high speeds and obtain large accelerations. * : Exposure to small doses of toxins can have beneficial effects. * : Persistent female choice for particular male trait values should erode genetic variance in male traits and thereby remove the benefits of choice, yet choice persists. * : When rising to stand from a sitting or squatting position, both the hamstrings and quadriceps contract at the same time, despite their being antagonists to each other. * : Increasing the food available to an ecosystem may lead to instability, and even to extinction. * : Applying pesticide to a pest may increase the pest's abundance. * : Why are there so many different species of phytoplankton, even though competition for the same resources tends to reduce the number of species? * : An anomalous pattern of inheritance in the fragile X syndrome. * : The concept for a taxon can overlap in the past. * : When did the ancestors of birds live?  Health and nutrition  * : The observation that the French suffer a relatively low incidence of coronary heart disease, despite having a diet relatively rich in saturated fats, which are assumed to be the leading dietary cause of such disease. * : The large amount of glycogen in the liver cannot be explained by its small glucose absorption. * : The finding that Hispanics in the United States tend to have substantially better health than the average population in spite of what their aggregate socio-economic indicators predict. * : The observation that Israelis suffer a relatively high incidence of coronary heart disease, despite having a diet very low in saturated fats, which are assumed to be the leading dietary cause of such disease. * : Mexican children tend to have higher birth weights than can be expected from their socio-economic status. * : In some medical conditions, obesity is associated with increased survival, although there is a strong association with shortened lifespan in the general population. * : Humans and other small-to-medium-sized mammals get cancer with high frequency, while larger mammals, like whales, do not. If cancer is essentially a negative outcome lottery at the cell level, and larger organisms have more cells, and thus more potentially cancerous cell divisions, one would expect larger organisms to be more predisposed to cancer. * : A pulsus paradoxus is an exaggerated decrease in systolic blood pressure during inspiration. It can indicate certain medical conditions in which there is reduced cardiac output, such as cardiac tamponade or constrictive pericarditis. Also known as the Pulse Paradox. * : The \\"second wind\\" is a sudden period of increased wakefulness in individuals deprived of sleep that tends to coincide with the individual's circadian rhythm. Although the individual is more wakeful and aware of their surroundings, they are continuing to accrue sleep debt and thus, are actually exacerbating their sleep deprivation.  Chemistry  * : Diluted nitric acid will corrode steel, while concentrated nitric acid will not. * : The length of time that it takes for a protein chain to find its folded state is many orders of magnitude shorter than it would be if it freely searched all possible configurations. * : Exceptions to the principle that a small change in a molecule causes a small change in its chemical behavior are frequently profound.  Time travel  * (also ontological paradox): You send information/an object to your past self, but you only have that information/object because in the past, you received it from your future self. This means the information/object was never created, yet still exists. *: A man travels back in time to discover the cause of a famous fire. While in the building where the fire started, he accidentally knocks over a kerosene lantern and causes a fire, the same fire that would inspire him, years later, to travel back in time. The bootstrap paradox is closely tied to this, in which, as a result of time travel, information or objects appear to have no beginning. * : What happens when a time traveler does things in the past that prevent them from doing them in the first place? :*: If one travels back in time and kill their grandfather before he conceives one of their parents, which precludes their own conception and, therefore, they couldn't go back in time and kill their grandfather. :*: A billiard ball can be thrown into a wormhole in such a way that it would emerge in the past and knock its incoming past self away from the wormhole entrance, creating a variant of the grandfather paradox. :*: One can travel back in time and murder Adolf Hitler before he can instigate World War II and the Holocaust; but if he had never been instigated that, then the murder removes any reason for the travel.  Linguistics and artificial intelligence  * : Is a \\"historical linguist\\" a linguist who is historical, or someone who studies \\"historical linguistics\\"? * : How can a language both enable communication and block communication? * : Logical thought is hard for humans and easy for computers, but picking a screw from a box of screws is an unsolved problem. * : In transformational linguistics, there are pairs of sentences in which the sentence without movement is ungrammatical while the sentence with movement is not. * : In automated handwriting recognition, a cursively written word cannot be recognized without being segmented and cannot be segmented without being recognized.  Philosophy  * : It seems that no conceptual analysis can meet the requirements both of correctness and of informativeness. * : Plato says: \\"If your next statement is true, I will allow you to cross, but if it is false, I will throw you in the water.\\" Socrates responds: \\"You will throw me in the water.\\" Whatever Plato does, he will seemingly break his promise. Similar to the crocodile dilemma. * : How can people experience strong emotions from purely fictional things? * : If all truths are knowable, then all truths must in fact be known. * : If God knows in advance how we will decide, how can there be free will? * : Why can induction be used to confirm that things are \\"green\\", but not to confirm that things are \\"grue\\"? * : When one pursues happiness itself, one is miserable; but, when one pursues something else, one achieves happiness. * : \\"Minimal Liberty\\" is incompatible with . * : (Learner's paradox) A man cannot search either for what he knows or for what he does not know. * : (Parfit's paradox) Is a large population living a barely tolerable life better than a small, happy population? * : \\"It's raining, but I don't believe that it is.\\" * : A paradoxical game between two players, one of whom can predict the actions of the other. * : Several distinct paradoxes share this name. * : Can an omnipotent being create a rock too heavy for itself to lift? * : The author of a book may be justified in believing that all his statements in the book are correct, at the same time believing that at least one of them is incorrect. * : (Epicurean paradox) The existence of evil seems to be incompatible with the existence of an omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect God. * : Even though rules are intended to determine actions, \\"no course of action could be determined by a rule, because any course of action can be made out to accord with the rule\\". * : White horses are not horses because white and horse refer to different things. * : \\"You will never reach point B from point A as you must always get half-way there, and half of the half, and half of that half, and so on ...\\" (This is also a paradox of the infinite)  Mysticism  * : Our illusions are not real, yet it's real that illusion itself exists. * : In Kabbalah, how to reconcile self-awareness of finite Creation with Infinite Divine source, as an emanated causal chain would seemingly nullify existence. Luria's initial withdrawal of God in Hasidic panentheism involves simultaneous illusionism of Creation (Upper Unity) and self-aware existence (Lower Unity), God encompassing logical opposites.  Economics  One class of paradoxes in economics are the paradoxes of competition, in which behavior that benefits a lone actor would leave everyone worse off if everyone did the same. These paradoxes are classified into circuit, classical and Marx paradoxes. * : A change in a possible outcome that is shared by different alternatives affects people's choices among those alternatives, in contradiction with expected utility theory. * ': A book arguing that antitrust enforcement artificially raised prices by protecting inefficient competitors from competition. * : To sell information you need to give it away before the sale. * : Two players reaching a state of Nash equilibrium both find themselves with no profits gained via exploitation. * : Adding extra capacity to a network can reduce overall performance. * : Consumption varies surprisingly smoothly despite sharp variations in income. * : nations or subpopulations with higher GDP per capita are observed to have fewer children, even though a richer population can support more children. * : Increasing road capacity at the expense of investments in public transport can make overall congestion on the road worse. * : For countries with income sufficient to meet basic needs, the reported level of happiness does not correlate with national income per person. * : With capacity constraints, there may not be an equilibrium. * : The perceived failure of European countries to translate scientific advances into marketable innovations. * : Why were interest rates and prices correlated? * : Increasing the price of bread makes poor people eat more of it. * : Inability to recoup cost of obtaining market information implies efficient markets cannot exist. * : Some businesses bring about their own downfall through their own successes. * : Increases in efficiency lead to even larger increases in demand. * : Some countries export labor-intensive commodities and import capital-intensive commodities, in contradiction with the Heckscher‚ÄìOhlin theorem. * Louboutin paradox: Paradox of luxury goods. The more expensive some commodity is, the less it is used after acquiring.Mark Skousen, Kenna C. Taylor, Puzzles and paradoxes in economics, (1997), Edward Elgar Publishing, * : Capital is not flowing from developed countries to developing countries despite the fact that developing countries have lower levels of capital per worker, and therefore higher returns to capital. * : Actions that may be vicious to individuals may benefit society as a whole. * : Keeping everyone out of an information system is impossible, but so is getting everybody in. * : The imposition of a tariff on imports may reduce the relative internal price of that good. * : Why do generations that significantly improve the economic climate seem to generally rear a successor generation that consumes rather than produces? * : If everyone saves more money during times of recession, then aggregate demand will fall and will in turn lower total savings in the population. * : If everyone tries to work during times of recession, lower wages will reduce prices, leading to more deflationary expectations, leading to further thrift, reducing demand and thereby reducing employment. * , also known as diamond- water paradox: Water is more useful than diamonds, yet is a lot cheaper. * : (also known as Solow computer paradox): Worker productivity may go down, despite technological improvements. * : Using the Kaldor‚ÄìHicks criterion, an allocation A may be more efficient than allocation B, while at the same time B is more efficient than A. * : Successfully fixing a problem with a defective product may lead to higher consumer satisfaction than in the case where no problem occurred at all. * : People will only offer a modest fee for a reward of infinite expected value. * : The paradox of plenty (resource curse) refers to the paradox that countries and regions with an abundance of natural resources, specifically point-source non-renewable resources like minerals and fuels, tend to have less economic growth and worse development outcomes than countries with fewer natural resources. * : A trader can gain by throwing away some of his/her initial endowment. * : Bribing politicians costs less than one would expect, considering how much profit it can yield.  Perception  the vertical‚Äìhorizontal illusion * : An auditory illusion in which a sequentially played pair of Shepard tones is heard as ascending by some people and as descending by others. * : Cognitive lock of some experienced programmers that prevents them from properly evaluating the quality of programming languages which they do not know.: Chapter 1, Introduction. * : A visual illusion which suggests inconsistency, such as an impossible cube or the vertical-horizontal illusion, where the two lines are exactly the same length but appear to be of different lengths.  Politics  * : When two countries each have nuclear weapons, the probability of a direct war between them greatly decreases, but the probability of minor or indirect conflicts between them increases. * : A person can simultaneously advocate two conflicting policy options, A and B, provided that the person believes that democratic decisions should be followed.  Psychology and sociology  * : Women conform more closely than men to sociolinguistics norms that are overtly prescribed, but conform less than men when they are not. * : Countries which promote gender equality tend to have less gender balance in some fields. * : While many studies suggest IQ to be inheritable to a large degree, the Flynn effect seems to indicate large environmental influence on IQ. * : Ironic processing is the psychological process whereby an individual's deliberate attempts to suppress or avoid certain thoughts (thought suppression) renders those thoughts more persistent. * : People care about animals, but embrace diets that involve harming them. * : A situation in which moral imperatives clash without clear resolution. * : Schizophrenia patients in developing countries seem to fare better than their Western counterparts.Developing countries: The outcomes paradox Nature.com * : Sometimes, retelling of familiar stories appears to still induce suspense, despite the fact that the audience already knows how the story will unfold. * : People can sometimes recover more quickly from more intense emotions or pain than from less distressing experiences. * : The contradictory association whereby higher levels of self-awareness are simultaneously associated with higher levels of psychological distress and with psychological well- being.Trapnell, P. D., & Campbell, J. D. (1999). \\"Private self-consciousness and the Five-Factor Model of Personality: Distinguishing rumination from reflection\\".

Miscellaneous  * : Models or simulations that explain the workings of complex systems are seemingly impossible to construct. As a model of a complex system becomes more complete, it becomes less understandable; for it to be more understandable it must be less complete and therefore less accurate. When the model becomes accurate, it is just as difficult to understand as the real-world processes it represents. * : Humorous example of a paradox from contradicting proverbs. * : Many documents contain pages on which the text \\"This page is intentionally left blank\\" is printed, thereby making the page not blank. * : The outcome of an event or experiment is influenced by the presence of the observer. * : A paradox in demography in which lessening mortality for a particular cause results in a surprisingly small increase in life expectancy and no change in overall mortality.

There are two types, the NCLEX-RN and the NCLEX-PN. After graduation from a school of nursing, one takes the NCLEX exam to receive a nursing license. A nursing license gives an individual the permission to practice nursing, granted by the state where they met the requirements. NCLEX examinations are developed and owned by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing, Inc. (NCSBN). The NCSBN administers these examinations on behalf of its member boards which consist of the boards of nursing in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and four U.S. territories, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. To ensure public protection, each board of nursing requires a candidate for licensure to pass the appropriate NCLEX examination: NCLEX-RN for registered nurses and the NCLEX-PN for vocational or practical nurses. NCLEX examinations are designed to test the knowledge, skills and abilities essential for the safe and effective practice of nursing at the entry level. NCLEX examinations are provided in a computerized adaptive testing (CAT) format and are presently administered by Pearson VUE in their network of Pearson Professional Centers (PPC). With computerized exams such as this, the computer selects which question you are asked based on how you answered the previous question. The NCLEX covers a wide range of material. The individual will be scored by their ability to think critically about decisions involving nursing care. Changes in the exam The governing body responsible for making changes to the NCLEX is the National Council of State Boards of Nursing, the NCSBN. They make changes by analyzing the current nursing practices. They do this by surveying approximately 12,000 recently licensed nurses about different nursing activities which appear on the NCLEX. The NCSBN analyzes these nursing activities based on how frequent the activity may occur, how it could impact the patient's safety, and the location of these activities. The NCSBN conducts these analyses every three years, then makes any needed changes to the exam. Changes were made in 2013 and are expected every three years after that date. In 2015, NCLEX was adopted in Canada, with changes made to address measuring units, drug names, and other terminology differences between the United States and Canada. Additionally, the NCLEX is available in Canadian French for French-speaking Canadians. Levels of examination=NCLEX-RN NCLEX-RN (National Council Licensure Examination-Registered Nurse). All boards of nursing in states and territories of the United States require candidates to pass this exam for licensure as a registered nurse (RN). As of 2015, 10 provincial/territorial RN regulators in Canada have chosen the NCLEX-RN and the National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) as the provider of the Canadian RN entry-to-practice exam. The NCLEX-RN uses the five-step nursing process. Each of the questions will fall into one of the five steps: assessment, diagnosis, planning, implementation, and evaluation. NCLEX- PN NCLEX-PN (National Council Licensure Examination-Practical Nurse). All US state and territorial boards of nursing require a passing result on the exam for licensure as a licensed practical nurse (LPN) or licensed vocational nurse (LVN).  Exam content  The majority of test items are written at the cognition level of application or higher, but the exam may include items at all cognitive levels. Examples of cognitive level are memorization or recall, knowledge, analysis and application. NCLEX-PN The exam's content is based on client needs: * Safe Effective Care Environment ** Coordination of Care ** Safety and Infection Control * Health Promotion and Maintenance * Psychosocial Integrity * Physiological Integrity ** Basic Care and Comfort ** Pharmacological and Parenteral Therapies ** Reduction of Risk Potential ** Physiological Adaptation NCLEX-RN The exam's content is based on client needs: * Safe and Effective Care Environment ** Management of Care 17-23% ** Safety and Infection Control 9-15% * Health Promotion and Maintenance 6-12% * Psychosocial Integrity 6-12% * Physiological Integrity ** Basic Care and Comfort 6-12% ** Pharmacological and Parenteral Therapies ** Reduction of Risk Potential 9-15% ** Physiological Adaptation 11-17% Physiological Integrity The Physiological Integrity category contains the majority of the questions on the exam, about 43-67 percent. This portion of the NCLEX deals with adult medical and surgical care, pediatrics, and gerontology, which is the study of the elderly and the effects of aging. Some of the questions may deal with conditions that nurses treat on a regular basis such as, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, neurological disorders, renal diseases, and respiratory diseases. In addition, questions on traumatic injuries, immunological disorders, skin disorders and infectious diseases could be asked. There are different topics on the NCLEX pertaining to the pediatric client. These topics may include growth and development, birth abnormalities, child abuse, common infectious diseases of children, and usual childhood traumas such as burn injuries and fractures. Safe and Effective Care Environment This category makes up approximately 21-33 percent of the NCLEX questions. Questions in this category cover safety issues in patient care, particularly the administration of medicine to patients, safety measures to prevent further injuries and infections, isolation precautions, safety for pediatric patients, and special safety precautions for patients with psychiatric problems. This portion of the exam may also include questions pertaining to laboratory tests, test results, and unique nursing procedures that may be associated with test results; ethical and legal nursing problems; nursing management; and issues related to giving patients the best care. NCLEX questions on these topics are randomly spread throughout the exam. Health Promotion and Maintenance The Health Promotion and Maintenance category makes up about 12 percent of the NCLEX examination. Questions under this category deal with birth control measures, pregnancy, labor and delivery; care for a newborn infant, growth and development, and diseases that can spread easily like sexually transmitted infections. If a patient is pregnant, it is very important that the nurse be able to act as a teacher or counselor for the patient. This makes it necessary to understand all components of a patient‚Äôs pregnancy. Knowledge of a proper diet, development of the fetus, signs and symptoms of pregnancy complications and certain pregnancy related procedures will be helpful for this section of the exam. Psychosocial Integrity Like the section on Health Promotion and Maintenance, the Psychosocial Integrity category constitutes approximately 12 percent of the NCLEX questions. Questions in this category pertain to patients with psychiatric problems and their unique issues. In addition, this material may cover coping mechanisms for different situations. Other situations covered in this section are about psychosocial problems that fall short of psychiatric illness. Questions could cover information on the following disorders: depression, schizophrenia, organic mental disorders, eating disorders, personality disorders, and anxiety disorders. Also included in this section may be questions about crisis intervention, substance abuse, and therapy through communication. Format The NCLEX exam is taken on a computer at a Pearson Professional Center. Pearson Professional Centers are testing centers for certifications and licenses all over the world. There are numerous testing centers in each state of the U.S. and centers can be found in 175 countries. The NCLEX exam is at least 90 percent multiple-choice questions. The remaining questions require an individual to fill in the blank, choose all of the correct answers from a list of options, put a number of steps in the correct sequence, or identify a correct area on a picture. Some of these alternative format questions ask information about a chart, graph, or audio clip. The questions can also use pictures as the answer choices instead of words. Each question will appear one at a time on a computer screen. Questions will not be repeated; however, questions based on a similar situation could be asked. Each individual will take a different form of the exam. Since each question depends on how the previous question is answered, an individual can be given between 75 and 265 questions. Only 60 out of the first 75 questions on the exam will count. The 15 that do not count are ‚Äútrial‚Äù questions, and these will be used on future examinations. The ‚Äútrial‚Äù questions are not identified as such, therefore, it is best to answer every question. If the individual continues to get questions from the same category, it could mean that the NCSBN is testing those types of questions, or it could mean that the individual keeps getting those types of questions incorrect. The computer will continue to randomly generate questions from that category until the individual has met the requirements of the test plan. Each individual will have a maximum of six hours to complete the exam but there is no minimum time limit. There is a mandatory 10-minute break about 2¬Ω hours after the start of the exam and another optional break after about 4 hours of testing. It is acceptable to take breaks any time during the exam, however, test-takers will lose the additional break time from the total test time. A certain number of correctly answered questions is not required to pass the exam. An individual‚Äôs score will not be compared to other scores to determine if he or she passes. The NCLEX is graded by comparing the responses to a pre-established standard. Those individuals who meet or exceed the standard pass the exam, those who do not fail. Question types Most of the questions of the NCLEX exam are worded questions with multiple choice answers. In recent years, however, the NCSBN has added new format questions which do not involve simple multiple- choice selection. Examples of the new formats include identifying and selecting a particular area of a drawn body part, selecting multiple correct answers via check boxes, free response mathematical questions usually involving medication calculations, and ordering the steps of a medical or nursing procedure. Questions on the NCLEX exam are of three different types or levels: Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3. Level 1 questions are the most basic questions and make up less than 10 percent of the total questions. Level 1 questions test the individual‚Äôs knowledge and understanding. These questions require the individual to recall specific facts and information. Level 2 questions require an additional level of thinking in order to answer the question. In these types of questions, the individual will be required to know specific information and then use it to interpret or analyze the question. Level 2 questions are analysis and application type questions. Level 3 questions are the most complex type of question on the NCLEX. These questions require the individual to judge, evaluate, and combine information. The individual will have to apply the rules, facts, and processes they know and then make decisions about what is best for the patient‚Äôs care based on the situation. What makes level 3 questions difficult is the likely existence of more than one correct answer forcing the individual to decide which answer is the best choice. Level 2 and Level 3 questions make up about 95 percent of the questions on the NCLEX exam. However, it is possible for the exam to have no Level 1 question. Multiple platforms took on the mission to equip students with the tools to pass the exams, including Kaplan, UWorld, and Kahn with different methodology from sample questions mirroring the actual exam to assist in active and personalized learning.

For over two decades it was unsolved. Robbery and murders On the evening of September 23, 1983, just before the restaurant closed, armed robbers held up the Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant in Kilgore, Texas, USA. The five people in the restaurant at the time (who were either employees or waiting for someone there) were abducted, taken to a nearby field on County Road 232, and each executed with a shot to the back of the head. One of the victims, who was found a short distance from the others, had been raped. The victims' bodies were discovered by local police and Texas Rangers, and were identified as: David Maxwell (20), Joey Johnson (20), Monty Landers (19), Mary Tyler (37) and Opie Hughes (39). Investigation For 22 years, the case remained unsolved; several people were arrested and one person, James Earl Mankins, Jr., a man with prior drug convictions who was also the son of a state representative, was charged with the murders, but was later released after the beginning of pre-trial proceedings due to a lack of evidence. Finally, in November 2005, two men (already in prison for other crimes) were arrested and charged: cousins Darnell Hartsfield (44) and Romeo Pinkerton (47). At the time of arrest, Hartsfield was serving a life sentence for aggravated perjury in connection with the case. They were both charged with capital murder, and could have received the death penalty if convicted. Convictions Jury selection in Pinkerton's trial began August 6, 2007 in New Boston and completed on September 27, 2007. Pinkerton's death penalty trial was scheduled to start at 9 a.m. on October 15, 2007 at the Bowie County Courthouse in New Boston. He pleaded guilty to five lesser counts of first degree murder on October 29, 2007 and received five concurrent life sentences as a part of his plea deal. Hartsfield was convicted at trial in Bryan (Brazos County), Texas (on a change of venue from East Texas due to pre-trial publicity) and sentenced to five consecutive life sentences. An April 2007 article from the Houston Chronicle details Pinkerton's denial of the crime. Darnell Hartsfield and his cousin, Romeo Pinkerton, were both convicted in 2008. On February 4, 2010 the Texas Sixth Court of Appeals upheld the convictions of Darnell Hartsfield. It ruled that there was sufficient evidence for the conviction. Possible third perpetrator DNA evidence taken from Opie Hughes' body ‚Äì found some distance away from the rest of the victims ‚Äì indicated she had been sexually assaulted. However, the DNA did not match that of Hartsfield, Pinkerton, Mankins, or any other suspect. This led investigators to the possibility of a third man. Neither of the two convicted felons ever revealed the identity of any accomplice. the Rangers are still investigating this case and searching for a third person.

The setting is of a British and West German film crew following National Guard soldiers and police as they pursue members of a counterculture group across a desert. Plot The film takes place in 1970. The Vietnam War is escalating and United States President Richard Nixon has just decided on a \\"secret\\" bombing campaign in Cambodia. Faced with a growing anti-war movement, President Nixon decrees a state of emergency based on the McCarran Internal Security Act of 1950, which authorizes federal authorities, without reference to Congress, to detain persons judged to be a \\"risk to internal security\\". Members from the anti-war movement, Civil Rights Movement, feminist movement, conscientious objectors, and Communist Party, mostly university students, are arrested and face an emergency tribunal made up of community members. With state and federal jails at their top capacity, the convicted face the option of spending their full conviction time in federal prison or four days at Punishment Park. There, they will have to traverse 53 miles of the hot California desert in three days, without water or food, while being chased by National Guardsmen and law enforcement officers as part of their field training. If they succeed and reach the American flag at the end of the course, they will be set free. If they fail by getting \\"arrested\\", they will serve the remainder of their sentence in federal prison. European filmmakers follow two groups of detainees as part of their documentary; while Group 637 starts their three-day ordeal and learn the rules of the \\"game\\", the civilian tribunal begins hearings on Group 638. The filmmakers conduct interviews with members of Group 637 and their chasers, documenting how both sides become increasingly hostile towards the other. Meanwhile, the film crew documents the trial of Group 638 as they argue their case in vain for resisting the war in Vietnam. The first group splinters into one group that refuses to accept the rules of the game and tries to resist with violence, and another group that goes on towards the goal. The violent group are all killed. As the others come near the flag they find a group of police waiting for them; it turns out that there is no way to win the Punishment Park course as the system controls it from start to finish.

It was shot in the cin√©ma v√©rit√© style using hand-held cameras. Watkins heightened realism by using amateur actors, improvisation, and newsreel camera techniques, but he also had rigid control over editing to guarantee audience involvement and the clear expression of his personal vision. Initially Watkins had a carefully detailed script, but as in his other films, he decided to allow his cast to improvise based on their own instinctive reactions while following a rough outline of sequences drawn up by the director. In his previous films, Watkins had only used improvisation a small amount. Punishment Park was the first time Watkins gave his cast nearly complete control over the dialogue. On one occasion the participants identified with the situation so completely that the victims actually threw rocks at the pursuers, resulting in one opening fire in return. The panic of the film team, upon believing that the fallen actors had been shot for real, was genuine. Although the film itself is fictional, many of the elements found within are metaphors of social and political events of the time, such as the trial of the Chicago Seven, the Kent State shootings, police brutality, and political polarisation. Technical notes Punishment Park was shot in 16mm with a skeleton crew of eight people and only one Eclair camera. The set was extremely minimal, using only a tent enclosed within a larger tent for the interior scenes. The rest was shot on location at the El Mirage Dry Lake in California. It took only two and a half weeks to shoot. The \\"newsreel\\" quality of the film was enhanced by desaturating the color and removing the traditional hard edge of the image through the use of Harrison diffusion filters. The total production cost was only $95,000, including a transfer from 16mm to 35mm.Original Punishment Park press kit from 1971, reprinted in the booklet of the 2012 British Blu-ray Disc. Response One of Watkins' intentions for the film was to provoke strong emotional and intellectual responses. Few people had impartial reactions to the film. As Watkins foresaw, this produced debates after the viewings of the film similar to the debates that take place in the film. There were many extremely negative reactions to the film, largely due to the unconventional form or because it was viewed as an indictment against the United States. Some even linked the film to communism, claiming that the film expresses a Communist philosophy. However, many more people were outraged that a British director would make a film about American political problems in a time of crisis. The film was heavily attacked when it was released at the 1971 New York Film Festival and Hollywood studios refused to distribute it.

Early life The son of Cosmo Lewis Duff-Gordon and the former Anna Maria Antrobus, Cosmo Duff-Gordon became the 5th Baronet of Halkin in 1896, his title stemming from a Royal licence conferred on his great-uncle in 1813 in recognition of his aid to the Crown during the Peninsular War. In 1772 his family had founded the Duff-Gordon sherry bodega in Spain, which still produces high-quality fortified wines. The Duff-Gordons were, by descent, a Scottish aristocratic family. In 1900, Duff-Gordon married the celebrated London fashion designer \\"Madame Lucile\\" (n√©e Lucy Christiana Sutherland, then Mrs. James Stuart Wallace). This was a slightly risqu√© union, as Lucy was a divorcee whose sister, Elinor Glyn, was a notorious romance novelist. Lady Duff-Gordon (Lucile) As a sportsman, Duff-Gordon was most noted as a fencer, representing Great Britain at the 1906 Intercalated Games, winning silver in the team √©p√©e event.Bystander, 4 April 1906, p. 13; Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (1911), Vol. 9, p. 668. King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra were among distinguished spectators at one of the final bouts between Sir Cosmo and his German opponent Herr G. Casimir.Bystander, 9 May 1906, p. 169. Duff-Gordon served on the organizing committee at the 1908 Summer Olympics, appointed by Lord Desborough, chairman of the British Olympic Association. He took part in pistol duelling competitions and was a member of the British team demonstrating the sport in the fencing arena at the 1908 Games.https://royalarmouries.org/stories/our-collection/bloodless-duelling-at- the-olympics/ He was also a self-defence enthusiast who trained with champion Swiss wrestler Armand Cherpillod at the Bartitsu Club in London's Soho district.Vaucher, Abel: Cherpillod, Armand, \\"La vie d'un champion: Cours de culture physique et de jiu-jitsiu\\", Lausanne, France, √©ditions \\"civis\\", 1933 was a co-founder of the London Fencing League, a member of the Bath Club and the Royal Automobile Club. He was also a sheriff and magistrate in his native Kincardineshire, near Aberdeen, where his ancestral country estate Maryculter was located. Titanic voyage Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon is best known for the circumstances in which he survived the sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912, along with his wife and her secretary, Laura Mabel Francatelli. The three were among only 12 people who escaped in Lifeboat #1, which had a capacity of 40. The ladies had earlier turned down places in two other lifeboats for women and children because Lady Duff-Gordon refused to be separated from her husband. Criticism after the disaster claimed Sir Cosmo boarded the lifeboat in violation of the \\"women and children first\\" policy and that, once the craft was afloat, he bribed its crew not to return to rescue people struggling in the water. Duff-Gordon denied the allegation that he disobeyed orders, maintaining there had been no women or children in the immediate vicinity when his boat was launched. (There is additional confirmation from other witnesses that First Officer William Murdoch allowed Sir Cosmo a place in the boat so he could join his wife.) Moreover, Sir Cosmo denied his offer of money to the lifeboat's crew was a bribe, and the British Board of Trade's inquiry into the disaster accepted his explanation that it was a charitable contribution for crew members who had lost not only their possessions but their jobs. The inquiry nonetheless concluded that, if the lifeboat had returned to the wreck site, it might have been able to rescue others. Regarding the bribery allegation the report stated: The very gross charge against Sir Cosmo Duff Gordon that, having got into No. 1 boat he bribed the men in it to row away from the drowning people, is unfounded.British Wreck Commissioner's Enquiry: Report. \\"Account of the Saving and Rescue of those who Survived: Conduct of Sir Cosmo Duff Gordon and Mr Ismay\\". Accessed on 3 February 2014, at: Later life and legacy Grave of Duff-Gordon in Brookwood Cemetery Sir Cosmo Duff- Gordon continued in his social and sporting interests in Scotland and later in London, where he lived at 5, Alfred Place, South Kensington.Tatler, 2 July 1930, p. 30; Walter Lord, The Night Lives On (1986), p 219. He was estranged from his wife from 1915 until his death, although they never divorced and remained friends.Randy Bryan Bigham, Lucile ‚Äì Her Life by Design (2012), pp. 74-75, 223. He died on 20 April 1931 of natural causes and is buried at Brookwood Cemetery, Woking, Surrey. His wife died exactly four years later, on 20 April 1935. Sir Cosmo and Lady Duff-Gordon were portrayed by the actors Martin Jarvis and Rosalind Ayres, themselves a married couple, in the 1997 film Titanic. In the 2012 ITV mini-series Titanic the couple was portrayed by Simon Paisley Day and Sylvestra Le Touzel. In 2012 a box of documents and letters concerning the Titanic sinking belonging to the Duff-Gordons was rediscovered at the London office of Veale Wasbrough Vizards, the legal firm that merged with Tweedies, who represented the couple. Amongst the papers was a rebuttal of the evidence given against them at the Board of Trade inquiry, and an inventory of Lady Duff-Gordon's possessions that were lost, the total value listed as ¬£3,208 3s 6d. In one letter Sir Cosmo complains: \\"There seems to be a feeling of resentment against any English man being saved....The whole pleasure of having been saved is quite spoilt by the venomous attacks they made at first in the papers. This, I suppose, was because I refused to see any reporter.\\" Despite the official vindication by the Board of Trade inquiry, public suspicion that the Duff-Gordons had acted selfishly tainted the couple for the remainder of their lives.

Tim and Tracey Canaday founded Never Summer snowboards in 1991. As the company progressed, they began expanding beyond snowboarding, such as a clothing line. All Never Summer merchandise is made in Denver. In 2016 they celebrated their 25-year anniversary by filming a documentary on the culture of the company the Canaday brothers established.  History  Never Summer mountain range in ColoradoIt all began in 1983 when Tim and Tracey Canaday founded their first snowboard company named ‚ÄúSwift Snowboards\\" with their friend Scott Rolfs. The two brothers were originally from Fort Collins, Colorado. Tim (fourteen at the time) built snowboard shapes in his high school wood shop class. Back when the Swift company was established, the Canadays were working out of their garage. After the company was unsuccessful, the Canaday's took a break from the business and moved to California. A few years later in 1991, snowboarding became more popular. So Tim and Tracey moved back to Colorado and renamed their company Never Summer, after the Never Summer Mountains in Colorado. They are located at the western edge of Rocky Mountain National Park, extending to Routt and Arapaho National Forest where pockets of snow last year round. In the early stages of Never Summer Industries, it was just the two of them. Tracey drove around and sold the boards out of his Honda Civic while Tim was the creator and designer. After another move to Denver in 1993 to be closer to suppliers, Never Summer took root and developed into a fully operating manufacturer and international distributor. Never Summer is one of the innovators of P-tex sidewalls, now a common feature on the product lines of many manufacturers.  Controversy  Workers in the Never Summer factory precisely hand-make all snowboards, longboards, and skis. Due to the company's high demand back in 2016, they fell extremely far behind in orders according to The Denver Post. Everyday, Never Summer's workers produce 120 snowboards, 50 pairs of skis and 60 longboards. However, this was not enough to keep up with demand.

They released five albums, Guzzle (1990), You Get Nothing (April 1992), Bring on the Juice (August 1993), Everyday Lies (November 1995) and Do You Leave Here Often (February 1998). In 1992 McNeair was replaced by Michael Glenn on drums, who was replaced in turn in 1995 by Dean Muller. Michael Weber, who had been replaced in 1992 by Jimmy Sfestos on guitar, died in January 1999, aged 32.  History  Hoss were formed in 1990 in Melbourne as a hard rock band with the line-up of Scott Bailey on bass guitar, Todd McNeair on drums (ex-Seminal Rats), Joel Silbersher on guitar and lead vocals (ex-God) and Michael Weber on lead guitar (ex-Seminal Rats, Slush Puppies). Their name was chosen \\"because Joel likes monosyllabic names.\\" They signed with Au Go Go Records, which issued their debut single, \\"Green\\", and their first album, Guzzle. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described it as \\"a rushed affair (recorded in one session, the day before the band played its debut gig), and consequently lacked appealing ideas.\\" Silbersher told Steven Corby of The Canberra Times that their sound was \\"stripped down, raucous rock 'n'roll.\\" You Get Nothing, their second album was released in April 1992, for which McFarlane felt, \\"The band was at its best [as they] mixed Detroit rock action with Exile on Main Street-era Rolling Stones raunch.\\" By that time they were one of a string of 1990s hard rock bands on Melbourne's Dog Meat Records, alongside label mates, Powder Monkeys and Splatterheads. Just before the album's appearance McNeair and Weber had returned to Seminal Rats; they were replaced in Hoss by Michael \\"Captain Kaos\\" Glenn (ex-Joysticks, Forbidden Planet) and Jimmy Sfetsos (ex-Nice Girls from Cincinnati), respectively. For their third album, Bring on the Juice (August 1993), the group used Charlie Owen (of Beasts of Bourbon) on lap slide guitar and dobro for a track, \\"Lip from Lip\\". Silbersher was the main song writer for the group, he also released a solo album, Melonman (1994) and has collaborated with Owen as the Tendrils to issue their self-titled album (June 1995). He has toured as a backing musician with other acts, including Tex Perkins and with Dirty Three. In March 1994 Hoss issued an extended play, Gentle Claws, which was followed by their fourth album, Everyday Lies, in November 1995. Joachim Hiller of German magazine, Ox-Fanzine felt that Silbersher \\"mu√ü in seinem jungen Leben schon verdammt viel Leid erlebt haben, denn sonst k√∂nnte er nicht mit so heiserer Bluesstimme seinen Schmerz herausbr√ºllen.\\" (translation: \\"must have had a lot of suffering in his young life, otherwise he would not be able to rouse his pain with such hoarse blues.\\") During 1995 Glenn was replaced on drums by Dean Muller (ex-Voodoo Lust, Macho Clowns). On their early albums, Hoss were influenced by 1970s garage and boogie hard rock such as Aerosmith, Blue √ñyster Cult and The Stooges. However, by their fifth album, Do You Leave Here Often? (February 1998), they had developed a more complex sound, which continued to exhibit hard rock influences but also used more sophisticated arrangements reminiscent of bands such as the Afghan Whigs. McFarlane opined that they had \\"earned a solid reputation by consistently living up to audience expectations with well-honed songs and uncompromising gigs. By taking inspiration from the likes of The Rolling Stones, Kiss, The Stooges, AC/DC and Black Sabbath, Hoss came up with a near-perfect blend of melodic power chords, hyper-kinetic guitar riffs and hard driving rock beats.\\" Hoss performed at the Meredith Music Festival in December 2010, they were described on the festival website as \\"Powerful, tough, natural-sounding rock‚Äôn'roll with a brain as well as a rump. They don‚Äôt make videos, they don‚Äôt play very often (took them 15 years to go to Perth), they don‚Äôt compromise, and as far as I can tell they don‚Äôt care; they ain‚Äôt careerist.\\" They had previously played at the festival in 1992, 1993 and 1996.

Aerial refueling VMGR-152 is capable of refueling helicopters, tilt-rotor and fixed-wing aircraft in support of tactical missions, training operations, or ferry flights. This is accomplished through the use of the two refueling pods mounted under the wings of its KC-130J aircraft, outboard of the engines. These pods trail a 93-foot hose attached to a stabilized paradrogue into which receiver aircraft plug. Assault air transport Assault air transport is the squadron's secondary mission. VMGR-152 can deliver supplies and troops by airdrop, or through assault landings on unimproved airstrips both during the day as well as at night, using night-vision devices. History=World War II The squadron was activated as VMJ-253 in the Western Pacific on March 11, 1942. VMJ-253 pioneered Trans-oceanic transport in the Marine Corps during World War II. It also became the parent squadron for the joint air transport organization dubbed the South Pacific Combat Air Transport Command (SCAT). Lieutenant Colonel Perry K. Smith, USMC, became the first Commanding Officer of SCAT. By November 1942, VMJ-253 had supported operations on Guadalcanal and surrounding islands, logging thousands of flight hours. While on Guadalcanal, VMJ-253 was the first combat transport squadron to land at Henderson Field, bringing Brigadier General Roy S. Geiger and his staff to take command of the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing. Following the Japanese counterattack that forced the United States Navy to withdraw, VMJ-253 continued to re-supply fuel, ammunition, food, and medical supplies in support of the besieged ground troops. The squadron's Douglas R4Ds delivered supplies despite being fired upon by Japanese troops lurking near Henderson Field and marauding A6M Zeros in the skies. Until the end of 1942, it was the Marines of VMJ-253 and other SCAT units that solved the logistical problems of Marines and soldiers on Guadalcanal. Through 1943, VMJ-253 supported operations on Bougainville, New Georgia, Vella Lavella, and numerous islands throughout the Solomon chain. As the island-hopping campaign moved into the Central Pacific in 1944, so did VMJ-253. Detached from SCAT, VMJ-253 officially became a transport squadron and was redesignated VMR-253. VMR-253 was assigned to the Transport Air Group, popularly called TAG, which was the Central Pacific version of SCAT. Continuing the heavy schedule of lifts from Tarawa, VMR-253 sortied to Kwajalein, Roi-Namur, and Eniwetok. In October 1943, VMR-253 moved to Guam. Working out of Guam, VMR-253 supported actions on Tinian, Saipan, and Peleliu. VMR-253 remained on Guam until the close of the war, and in May 1946, returned to MCAS Miramar. Post WW II / Korean War Curtiss R5C-1 at the National Museum of Naval Aviation From Miramar, VMR-253 moved to MCAS El Toro under Marine Aircraft Group 25 where the aging fleet of R4Ds was replaced with Douglas R5Ds. VMR-253 continued its primary mission of moving men and supplies wherever the Marine Corps needed them. After a four-year squadron stand down from 1947 to 1951, VMR-253 reactivated for active duty in the Korean War; with only six Curtiss R5C aircraft, 5 officers and 18 enlisted Marines. By the end of the year it had grown to 58 officers and 184 enlisted men; had received 16 new Fairchild R4Qs; and was ready to go to war once again. From January 1952 through June 1953, the squadron logged over 11,000 flight hours, carried 30,170 passengers, and moved of cargo. 1954 - 1965 In 1954, the squadron relocated to Itami Air Force Base, Japan and then to Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan. From Japan, VMR-253 conducted the bulk of Marine air transport in the Pacific for nearly ten years. On February 1, 1962, the famous Lockheed KC-130F Hercules joined Marine aviation in the Pacific. With its ability to refuel fighter and attack aircraft, VMR-253 was redesignated Marine Aerial Refueler Transport Squadron 152 (VMGR-152), and the squadron's primary mission became aerial refueling. Less than a year after receiving the Hercules aircraft, the pilots and Marines of VMGR-152 were called upon to support United States Army advisors in the latest hot spot, Indo-China. This deployment gave the squadron valuable experience in the employment of the Battle Herc that would soon pay off. On August 24, 1965, a KC-130F (BuNo 149802) from the squadron veered off runway on take-off from Kai Tak Airport, Hong Kong hit the seawall and crashed into the sea. This was the first Hercules hull loss in Marine Corps service. It was carrying Marine personnel returning to Vietnam after R&R; in Hong Kong; of six crew and 65 passengers, 59 were killed. Vietnam era A VMGR-152 KC-130F landing at Dong Ha, in 1967 Beginning in 1965, with increasing U.S. involvement in Vietnam, detachments from VMGR-152 were deployed in country with Marine Amphibious Forces (MAF) to support F-4s and A-4s used by Marine tactical squadrons. To better support the detachments in Vietnam, the squadron relocated to Okinawa, Japan. From 1967 to 1975, the bulk of VMGR-152's missions were directly in support of action in Southeast Asia. Detachments typically lasted five days, and operated out of Da Nang Air Base. In addition to aerial refueling and Marine Logistic (MarLog)cargo missions, VMGR 152 'GVs' dropped flares in support of ground troop operations at night. At its peak, the squadron was flying 900 missions a month and continued this high tempo of operations well into 1967. On 10 February 1968 a VMGR-152 KC-130F was hit by groundfire during landing at Khe Sanh, Quang Tri province. The fuel bladders on board were set alight and the airframe burned out on the runway, with the loss of six on board. Concurrent with the direct support of action in Vietnam, the squadron established itself as a mainstay in the Western Pacific. VMGR-152 conducted numerous trans-Pacific (TRANSPAC) missions, which involved the refueling of entire squadrons of fighter and attack aircraft as they crossed the Pacific on deployment. VMGR-152 also participated in a myriad of exercises and the movement of tons of cargo and thousands of troops, securing VMGR-152's tenure in WESTPAC. 1980s - 1990s During the 1980s, larger United States Air Force tankers specifically designated for the strategic movement and refueling of aircraft relieved VMGR-152 of its TRANSPAC mission. This allowed the squadron to explore a more tactical employment of the KC-130 in intra-theater refueling and transport operations, and employ a more effective use of the aircraft and its personnel in a tactical environment. In 1987, VMGR-152 became the first PCS (permanent change of station) aircraft squadron on Marine Corps Air Station Futenma. KC-130s from VMGR-152 refuel VFA-97 F/A-18Cs, in 2006 Since the early 1990s, VMGR-152 has experienced a steady increase in the number of missions flown. In June 1993, the squadron acquired five KC-130Rs, which provided the squadron with a significant increase in aircraft range and added to its effectiveness in refueling and transport operations. In January 1995, VMGR-152 joined Special Purpose MAGTF in support of Operation United Shield, the final withdrawal of all UNOSOM forces from Somalia. In May 2009, VMGR-152 joined Operation Enduring Freedom with the new KC-130J. Recent significant operations In November and December 2004, VMGR-152 participated in Joint Task Force 535, the Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief mission in the Republic of the Philippines after several tropical storms and typhoons struck the island of Luzon. In the wake of the December 26, 2004 earthquake off the coast of Indonesia, and subsequent widespread tsunami in the Indian Ocean region, VMGR-152 deployed aircraft and personnel to Thailand, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia in support of Operation Unified Assistance. In September 2006, VMGR-152 was awarded the Henry Wildfang Aerial Refueler/Transport Squadron of the Year award from the Marine Corps Aviation Association, which recognizes its impact on the community, as well as how well the squadron performs its mission and the types of missions it is involved in. Community work cited include not only the humanitarian missions throughout the Pacific, but also the work in the Okinawan community. In May and June 2008 VMGR-152 operated relief flights in Myanmar to provide assistance in the wake of devastation left by Cyclone Nargis, a tropical storm that caused a reported 32,000 deaths. During this time the Sumos launched 312 sorties to total 481.8 hours and delivered of cargo. The squadron took delivery of its first KC-130J Super Hercules on 4 June 2007 with the first operational flight of the new aircraft on 19 June. A second KC-130J was delivered in September that year. In June 2008 the squadron participated in Exercise Pitch Black, which is a biennial military exercise hosted by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and based on RAAF Base Tindal. The aim of the exercise is to practice Offensive Counter Air and Defensive Counter Air combat, in a simulated war environment and consists of a ‚Äúred team‚Äù and a ‚Äúblue team‚Äù. As a member of the ‚Äúred team‚Äù, the Sumos acted as the force multiplier of the exercise by providing Fixed Wing Aerial Refueling. In May 2009 the squadron sent two KC-130Js as a detachment with VMGR-352 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). It was the Sumos' first combat deployment since 1975 during the Vietnam War. A total of 40 VMGR-152 Marines deployed to Kandahar, Afghanistan to provide additional support in the War on Terror. In November VMGR-152 sent a second detachment to OEF. In July 2010 a two-aircraft detachment departed for the country of Bangladesh carrying Marines from MWSS-171 and their equipment to support their mission in building schools for Bangladeshi children. VMGR-152's role in this mission resulted in carrying over of cargo and 42 passengers to the poverty stricken country. During October 2010, VMGR-152 flew relief operations in the Republic of the Philippines in the aftermath of Typhoon Megi. In December that year VMGR-152 completed its transition to the KC-130J. After the T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami hit Japan on 11 March 2011, the squadron sent eight of its KC-130Js to Iwakuni for disaster relief and support for the Japanese Government and people in what became ‚ÄúOperation Tomodachi‚Äù. The first crews left with less than a 24-hour notice and were not given an expected return date. In the month of April the squadron continued support for Operation Tomodachi. A three-aircraft detachment shifted to Atsugi, and most crews were moved back home to the squadron and based out of Futenma for the remaining support. In July 2012 the final deployment of three crews, two aircraft and 40 maintenance Marines to Afghanistan returned after five weeks in theater because of operational draw downs. Their return marked the end of eight consecutive wartime deployments of VMGR-152 to OEF and the restoration of a 15-aircraft fleet now available for future operational commitments tasked to the Sumos throughout the Pacific Command. Since summer of 2012, VMGR-152 has been involved in exercises and operations throughout all of its Area of Responsibility and beyond to include Hawaii, Alaska, Australia, Thailand, Nepal, and Mongolia. In July 2014, VMGR-152 completed a permanent change of station from MCAS Futenma back to MCAS Iwakuni for the first time since 1987. The squadron was the first to move from Futenma as the Marine Corps begins to turn the airfield over to the Japanese. With the move VMGR-152 takes its place as only the second PCS squadron aboard MCAS Iwakuni, joining Marine All Weather Fighter Attack Squadron 242 (VMFA-242). Sumos conducting Aerial Refueling with two AV-8B Harriers Awards and Safety VMJ-253 was awarded the Distinguished Unit Citation as part of the 1st Marine Division (Reinforced) for the Guadalcanal Campaign. The squadron also received a Navy Unit Commendation for its operations as part of SCAT from December 1942 to July 1944.Armstrong, William. (2017). Marine Air Group 25 and SCAT (Images of Aviation). Arcadia. . VMGR-152's commitment to safety and maintaining readiness levels have earned the squadron numerous unit citations and awards. These include the CNO Aviation Safety Award for 1992, 1993, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004, and 2005, the MCAA Commandant's Aviation Efficiency Trophy for 1992, 1993, 2011 and 2013 and the National Defense Transportation Unit Award for 1993, 1995, and 2000, and the MCAA Marine Aerial Refueler Transport Squadron of the Year Award (Henry Wildfang Award) for 1994, 2001, and 2005. On July 16, 2001, the Sumos of VMGR-152 exceeded 230,000 mishap free flight hours. In July 2005, the Sumos exceeded 250,000 mishap-free flight hours.

It is the fourth of seven consecutive Scottish documents in the manuscript, the first six of which were probably put together in the early thirteenth century by the man who wrote de Situ Albanie. The Chronicle is a vital source for the period it covers, and, despite some later Francization, is very much written in Hiberno-Latin, showing evidence of a scribe with some knowledge of contemporary Middle Irish orthography.

She was named for a sea bird. Petrel was laid down on 27 August 1887, built by the Columbia Iron Works and Dry Dock Company in Baltimore, Maryland; launched on 13 October 1888; and commissioned 10 December 1889, with Lieutenant Commander W. H. Bronson in command.  Service in the Pacific  Assigned to the North Atlantic Station, Petrel continued with it until September 1891, when ordered to the Asiatic Squadron where she was to serve until 1911. Steaming north in May 1894, she reported at Unalaska, in July to operate with the Bering Sea patrol to discourage seal poaching. In July, she operated off the Pribilof Islands; and in August she returned to the Asiatic station. In March and April 1898 Emilio Aguinaldo had meeting with Commander Edward Wood, captain of the Petrell to discuss Philippine rebel support in the upcoming Spanish-American Warp. 23 Lindsay, Deborah G.

Withdrawing from Hong Kong in April 1898, Petrel became part of George Dewey's fleet in the campaign against Manila. On 1 May, after Dewey's squadron had defeated the heavy Spanish ships in the first engagement of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Petrel entered the inner harbor and lowered a boat to destroy six Spanish ships there. (For more detailed information, see Battle of Manila Bay.) Petrel then steamed to the navy yard at Cavite and forced its surrender. Sent into Cavite to destroy any Spanish ships seeking refuge there on 2 May, Petrel sent a party ashore which seized the arsenal at Cavite and returned with 2 tugs, and , plus 3 additional launches. Petrel continued operations in the Philippines throughout 1898 and 1899. She joined in shelling Panay Island on 11 February 1899; on the 22nd, a force of 48 men from Petrel occupied Cebu. In October, Petrel joined in supporting the Marine Corps assault on Noveleta by bombarding ahead of the advancing Marine column.  1901 fire  On the morning of 31 March 1901, while off Cavite in Manila Bay, Petrel suffered a fire which resulted in the death of her captain, Lieutenant Commander Jesse M. Roper. The fire originated in the sail room, a small compartment in the bottom of the ship, adjacent to the magazine and accessible only by a hatchway from the berth deck above. While some sailors cleared ammunition out of the magazine, another group, led by Roper, took turns entering the compartment and fighting the blaze. The fire produced no visible flames but thick, acrid smoke and fumes. The sail room was also pitch black; the ship's electric generator had been turned off at dawn, and no other lamps would work in the harsh atmosphere of the compartment. A number of men, including Roper, were overcome by the bad air and were pulled out of the sail room semi-conscious. As the fumes grew thicker and more noxious, Roper ordered everyone out of the compartment, but one sailor, Seaman Patrick Toner, did not emerge from the room. When a sound was heard from below, believed to be Toner fighting for breath, four men descended to rescue him. The four were Roper (not fully recovered from his first trip below), Cadet J.E. Lewis, Jack of the Dust Kessler, and Gunner's Mate Flaherty. When the four men did not return, Seaman Alphonse Girandy tied a rope around his waist and climbed down the ladder. He found Kessler and Flaherty, both semi- conscious, and passed them up to be hauled through the hatchway. At the bottom of the ladder he found Toner and, although losing consciousness himself, held on to him as the sailors above pulled both men out of the compartment. Lieutenant J.S. McKean, with a rope around his waist, was next into the sail room, followed by Private Louis F. Theis of the ship's Marine Corps detachment and Seaman Thomas Cahey. As McKean searched in the darkness for the two men still missing, Lieutenant Commander Roper and Cadet Lewis, the ship's generator finally came back online. With the help of a lamp lowered through the hatchway, McKean could see Roper and Lewis slumped against the walls of the compartment. McKean dragged Roper to the ladder to be hauled out and then, with the help of Theis and Cahey, rescued Lewis just before losing consciousness himself. The fire was extinguished later that day; Roper was killed by the fumes, but the other men all eventually recovered. For their actions during the incident, Cahey, Girandy, and Thies were each awarded the Medal of Honor.  Service in the Atlantic  Decommissioned at Cavite after the war, Petrel was recommissioned on 9 May 1910. After visiting European waters in 1911, she returned to the Atlantic coast. Disturbances in the Caribbean sent her to Mexican and West Indian waters from 1912 to 1915 to protect American interests, and in 1916 she became station ship at Guantanamo. With the World War I declaration of war in April, Petrel returned to the United States to serve with the American Patrol Detachment at Boston, Massachusetts, throughout the war. During World War I the Petrel became stranded on a South America island while hunting for submarines after the wireless communications were swept overboard during a storm. The natives helped the sailors find food and survive until they were able to get away on the tide. After 30 years of service, Petrel was decommissioned at New Orleans, Louisiana, on 15 July 1919 and was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 16 April 1920. She was subsequently sold to Snare and Treest, New York, on 1 November 1920.

He is the second son of Ewen and Olwen MacCormick who married in 1946 after serving together in the RAF. His older brother, Ian MacCormick (also known as the music journalist and writer Ian MacDonald) was born in 1948. After attending primary schools in Brixton they were both awarded free places at Dulwich College. There Bill met Phil Targett-Adams (now better known as Phil Manzanera) and they developed an interest in playing music. In 1966 Bill's mother worked with Honor Wyatt, the mother of drummer Robert Wyatt, and Bill saw his band Soft Machine play their first gig in August 1966 at Coombe Springs in Kingston and, thereafter, became a regular visitor at Honor Wyatt's house in Dalmore Road, West Dulwich, where the band lived and rehearsed. In 1968 Phil Targett-Adams and Bill formed a band at Dulwich College with a floating membership except for drummer Charles Hayward, two years their junior. Under the name Pooh and the Ostrich Feather they played gigs around the school and at parties. Bill and Phil both left Dulwich College in 1969 and they reunited with Charles Hayward the following year to form a band called Quiet Sun. They recruited keyboard player Dave Jarrett and, briefly, sax player, Dave Monaghan, but were unable to find a suitable bass player. Bill, who was to sing and play drums, learnt the bass parts to the various compositions in order for the band to rehearse and continued as the bass player until the band broke up in the summer of 1971. One of the band's last gigs was supporting Symbiosis at Portsmouth Polytechnic. This band featured Robert Wyatt who was about to leave Soft Machine and, when he did, he contacted Bill asking him to play bass in a new band to be called Matching Mole. They were joined in the band by the late Phil Miller and Caravan's keyboard player Dave Sinclair. They recorded an album for CBS in December 1971 (released simply as Matching Mole in April 1972) and Dave Sinclair was replaced by New Zealand keyboard player Dave MacRae in February 1972. The band toured intermittently until September 1972 when Robert broke it up. It had recorded its second album, Little Red Record, the previous month. Bill briefly joined Daevid Allen's Gong in France in the autumn of 1972. In the spring of 1973 he persuaded Robert Wyatt to form a new version of Matching Mole which would also feature sax player Gary Windo and keyboard player Francis Monkman recently of Curved Air. Unfortunately, after a serious accident involving Robert, the project was abandoned. That autumn Bill played on two tracks of Brian Eno's first solo album Here Come the Warm Jets. In 1974 Bill decided to pursue his interest in politics and was awarded a place at the London School of Economics to start in September 1975. in the meantime, Phil Manzanera was planning to record his first solo album (Diamond Head) but had booked extra studio time in order to record Quiet Sun's unrecorded material. The original band was reformed and, assisted by Eno and his brother Ian MacDonald, the album Mainstream was recorded. Ian and Bill then continued writing and recording with Phil Manzanera over an extended period producing the album Listen Now, released in 1977. In the summer of 1976, Phil, Bill and Eno along with drummer Simon Phillips, Francis Monkman and slide guitar player Lloyd Watson formed the short-lived 801 which played three gigs and recorded an album 801 Live, released in autumn 1976. A new version of the 801 was formed in order tour to promote the release of Listen Now in the autumn of 1977. This consisted of Phil, Bill, singer/guitarist Simon Ainley, Roxy Music drummer Paul Thompson and keyboard player David Skinner. In early 1978 work started on Phil Manzanera's third solo album, K-Scope, which Bill partly wrote and on which he played and sang. Roxy Music then reformed to record Manifesto. Later that year Bill was invited to join Random Hold, a band formed by guitarist David Rhodes and keyboard player the late Dave Ferguson. Along with ex-Glitter Band drummer Pete Phipps they toured the UK supporting XTC and Peter Gabriel and in North America with Peter Gabriel. They recorded a double album for Polydor Records. The band broke up in the summer of 1980 and Bill left the music business to pursue his interest in politics. Having joined the Liberal Party in 1973 and after being a candidate in the 1974 Council elections in the London Borough of Bromley, he was selected to stand as the Greater London Council candidate in Beckenham in 1981 and as a borough council candidate in 1982. In 1982 he was short-listed as the Liberal Party candidate for the Bermondsey by-election. After Simon Hughes's election as MP he worked in the constituency and was agent in two successful Southwark Council by-elections and was assistant agent in the 1984 General Election. Soon after he was employed as the London Area Agent by the Liberal Party and was agent in the Enfield, Southgate, by-election caused when the Conservative MP, Sir Anthony Berry, was murdered by the IRA. At the subsequent Brecon and Radnor by- election in 1985 he organised the first ever computerised direct mail campaign which helped the Liberal Party win the seat. He ran computer operations at numerous by-elections over the next six years including wins in Greenwich, Eastbourne, and Kincardine and Deeside. He was also the agent in the Liberal Democrats' first by-election in Kensington by-election in 1988. In 1988 he was appointed one of two National Elections Co-ordinators for the Liberal Democrats alongside Chris (later Lord) Rennard before he left in 1989 after a financial crisis in the new party. He joined a small direct marketing company called PS Mailing but continued to be contracted back to the Liberal Democrats for fundraising and by-elections. Having attended a political conference in Washington DC organised by Campaigns and Elections magazine to learn about polling, the company was commissioned to conduct a telephone poll prior to the Kincardine and Deeside by-election in 1991. This having been successful, and the company taken over by the large independent market research company Martin Hamblin, he helped organise and conduct the Liberal Democrats' research programme through until the end of the General Election in 1997. In 1998 he was obliged to retire on health grounds. He had been elected as the London Borough councillor for the Anerley ward of Bromley Council in 1990 and had retained the seat in 1994 and 1998 but retired in 2002. In 2006 he published a book entitled Pro Patria Mori: The 56th (1st London) Division at Gommecourt, 1st July 1916. This was planned as the first of a series of books about the Battle of the Somme. Since then he has published A Lack of Offensive Spirit? The 46th (North Midland) Division at Gommecourt, 1 July 1916 and Z Day: The VIII Corps at Beaumont-Hamel and Serre, 1 July 1916. A new book, the Long Road to the Somme 1870-1916, is due in 2018 and J Jour: The French 6e Armee on the Somme, 1 July 1916, in 2019. In addition, he played a bass solo on Phil Manzanera's 2004 album 6PM in the track \\"Wish You Well\\", a tribute to MacCormick's late brother Ian and was the webmaster of the official Genesis, Phil Collins and Phil Manzanera Manzanera.com web sites for several years.

The company went out of business in the late 1950s. The S.F.B.J. made dolls in France and also assembled dolls with both French and German sourced parts. By the 1920s, it is generally believed that production was centred in France. While the S.F.B.J. may have always struggled with German doll makers for the lucrative United States toy trade, it claimed to sell well in France, the French colonies, South American and Australian markets. Its dolls were made of many materials including bisque, composition and early plastics - in the later years of the firm. The S.F.B.J. made dolls from fine to cheap qualities and also had a large, well- equipped dressmaking branch. There were many different moulds including character dolls modelled after real children and dolls designed by French artists. S.F.B.J. dolls were used for tourist souvenirs as well as children's toys. The popular Bleuette dolls were one of its most high profiled products.

The Marine Corps Aviation Association honored HMA-369 with their Helicopter Squadron of the Year Award in 1972. HMA-369 was also awarded a Navy Unit Citation for this period. The squadron redeployed to Okinawa in January 1973, but remained active in the conflict through Operation Eagle Pull and Operation Frequent Wind in 1975, flying numerous sorties supporting the evacuation of Saigon. Post Vietnam In April 1977, HMA-369 was disestablished on Okinawa and reestablished at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California as a member of Detachment Marine Aircraft Group 16, 3rd MAW. In August 1983, HMA-369 had the distinction of being the first helicopter squadron of any service to participate in the United States Air Force Red Flag aviation combat exercise. In October 1985, HMA-369 was in Hong Kong to support then Vice-President George H.W. Bush's trip to the People's Republic of China. On two separate occasions, the Gunfighters flew four UH-1Ns from Hong Kong across the Red Chinese border to the cities Guangzhou and Shenzhen. This historic trip marked the first time since 1949 that a tactical Marine squadron had entered Communist China's airspace. Also during 1987, UH-1Ns were made a permanent part of the HMA-369 and on September 15, 1987 HMA-369 was officially re-designated as Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 369 (HMLA-369). In October 1987, the majority of AH-1J pilots attended the AH-1W pilot's familiarization course in Dallas, Texas and on October 30, 1987, HMLA-369 received its first AH-1W. Gulf War & the 1990s In 1990, HMLA-369 was one of the squadrons chosen as the HMLA component of Marine Aircraft Group 70 (MAG-70) in support of Operation Desert Shield. The Gunfighters advanced team arrived in Saudi Arabia on August 16, 1990, operating as the first Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron in theater. During Desert Shield the Gunfighters were called to war. Throughout the war, the Gunfighters distinguished themselves both in the planning and execution phases of the air and ground wars. On 10 March 1991, the Gunfighters departed Saudi Arabia, returning to Camp Pendleton. In November, the Gunfighters received the MCAA Squadron of the Year Award. Numerous officers and crew were decorated for valor, most notable the Commanding Officer, Michael M. \\"Spot\\" Kurth, who was awarded the Navy Cross. On November 28, 1992, HMLA-369 began planning for Operation Restore Hope, the international United Nations humanitarian relief effort in Somalia. On December 3, 1992, the Gunfighters were assigned as the force in readiness and by January 1, 1993, the entire squadron was deployed to Baledogle, Somalia, as the sole light attack helicopter squadron in theater operating under Marine Aircraft Group 16SimmonsThe US Marines History, p. 320. HMLA -369 flew a variety of missions including Close In Fire Support, Command and Control, MEDEVAC, Escort, Visual and Photo Reconnaissance, Logistical Supply, VIP, and Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) support. HMLA-369 logged 1,098 flight hours during January. The Gunfighters returned to Camp Pendleton in April 1993. November 1993 saw the Gunfighters depart for Okinawa in support of the UDP deployment Program. Additionally, the Gunfighters provided detachments for the 11th and 31st Marine Expeditionary Units (Special Operations Capable) (MEU(SOC)). The Gunfighter 11th MEU(SOC) Detachment supported Operation Continue Hope and Operation Distant Runner, aiding in the evacuation of Americans from war torn Rwanda. right Global War on Terror The Gunfighters of the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit aboard the USS Bonhomme Richard, received word from Central Command on March 3, 2002 that their assets would be needed to support the Coalition Joint Task Force (CJTF) operating out of Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. The Gunfighter's six AH-1Ws flew 22 days of continuous combat operations which included attached, detached and combined escort, close air support (CAS), forward air control (FAC(A)), and armed reconnaissance. HMLA-369 Cobra over Al Qaim, Iraq in November 2005 HMLA-369 arrived in Kuwait on April 13, 2003 and within three days began conducting combat operations in the skies of Iraq. In April 2003 the Gunfighters carried out over 300 combat missions into Iraq, from Ali Al Salem, Kuwait, providing combat support to Marines on the ground. Amassing over 600 mishap-free hours, the Gunfighters directly supported the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force. The Gunfighters flew over 1,300 mishap-free flight hours while performing offensive air and utility support missions. In the month of May alone, HMLA-369 flew 948.3 hours and completed 638 combat sorties. Working mostly out of Blair Field, a forward operating base (FOB) in Al Kut, Iraq, the Gunfighters provided continuous air coverage in northeastern Iraq. From June 27 to July 1, the Gunfighters flew air support for British allies in southeastern Iraq. The British ground forces requested close air support for their sweep of the towns of Al Amarah and Al Silah. The month of July was short for Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 369. The Gunfighters concluded flight operations in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom on July 12. The Gunfighters finished up their second rotation in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and are based at Forward Operating Base, Al Taqaddum, Iraq. As part of 2nd MAW (FWD), MAG-26(FWD).

In 1872 he managed to save enough to buy from a physician, Dr. Samuel Pitcher, the formula of a laxative called Castoria. With this formula, he made a fortune. Originally marketed as Pitcher's Castoria, the product has had several names, notably Fletcher's own. Castoria Laxative Advertisement, ca 1914 A little known fact is that he was sent South before the Civil War to collect debts by Demas Barnes. He returned (successfully) just before Fort Sumter was attacked (so shortly before April 12, 1861 he returned north). Partly due to this success (and others both before and after), Barnes backed him in forming The Centaur Company.

She was named for William Windom. Service history=Revenue cutter Windom was completed in 1896 at the Iowa Iron Works in Dubuque, Iowa and was accepted by the Treasury Department on 11 May 1896. Partially incomplete, she was moved from Dubuque‚Äîvia Cairo, Illinois, and New Orleans, Louisiana‚Äîto Baltimore, Maryland, where she was completed and placed in commission on 30 June 1896. For the next 17 months, she operated out of Baltimore making an annual winter cruise of the fishing grounds between the Virginia Capes and Cape Hatteras. Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War In March 1898, with war against Spain looming just over the horizon, President William McKinley began the process of preparing for the fight. On the 24th, he issued the executive order instructing the Revenue Cutter Service to cooperate with the Navy for the duration of the crisis. Two days later, she received orders to report at Norfolk, Virginia, and there she found herself on 25 April when Congress passed the resolution recognizing that a state of war existed between the United States and Spain. Five days later, Windom departed Hampton Roads on her way to the blockade off Cuba. She stopped at Key West, Florida, for four days and arrived off the Cuban coast on 8 May. She patrolled the southern coast of Cuba near Cienfuegos until the 13th. During that time, she cut the Cienfuegos cable, the Spanish colonial government's only link with the outside world; and, on 12 May, she helped to cover the withdrawal of a Navy boat expedition. At a critical point in that action, the cutter closed the enemy shore and silenced the Spanish battery and briefly dispersed their infantry allowing the harassed boats to reach safety. The following day, she withdrew from the area to return to Key West‚Äîprobably for fuel and provisions. She again got underway for the combat zone on 27 May and took up station off Havana on the 28th. For the remainder of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Windom participated in the blockade of Havana, returning to Key West on two occasions‚Äîonce during the last two weeks of June and again during the first week in August. Return to the revenue service  Hostilities ended on 13 August; Windom reverted to Treasury Department control on the 17th; and she returned to Norfolk on the 22nd. She remained there until 3 October at which time she headed for New York City where she transferred most of her armament to Gresham before resuming duty at Baltimore with the Revenue Cutter Service on the 13th. From the fall of 1898 to the summer of 1906, Windom operated out of Baltimore, cruising the waters of the Chesapeake Bay and occasionally venturing out into the Atlantic in the vicinity of the Virginia Capes. On 13 July 1906, the cutter departed Arundel Cove, Maryland, to sail‚Äîvia Key West, and Mobile, Alabama‚Äîto her new base of operations, Galveston, Texas. She arrived there on 6 August and began duty patrolling the gulf coast of the United States. That assignment lasted for five years. On 1 August 1911, she left Galveston to return to Arundel Cove. She arrived at the station on the shores of the Chesapeake on 1 September and was placed out of commission on the 12th. Her retirement, however, was only a brief one, for she returned to full commission on 1 November. She served at Washington, D.C., from mid- November 1911 until early May 1912. On 7 May, she headed back to the Gulf of Mexico. Initially, she assisted in flood relief at New Orleans; but, in June, she resumed her coastal patrols out of Galveston. She cruised the entire gulf coast from Texas to Key West over the next 18 months. After war broke out in Europe in August 1914, the cutter took on the added responsibility of enforcing America's neutrality laws. In November 1914, Windom headed back to Arundel Cove to be decommissioned again. She arrived at the depot on 3 December but made a short voyage to Washington before going out of service. She returned to Arundel Cove on 13 January 1915; and, on the 15th, she was placed out of commission. On 13 December 1915, near the end of a year of inactivity, Windom was renamed Comanche. Less than a month later, on 8 January 1916, the cutter went back into service under her new name. On 19 January, she departed the Chesapeake Bay area to return to her old patrol area in the Gulf of Mexico. She arrived at Galveston on 2 February and resumed her old routine. World War I The United States' declaration of war on the Central Powers once again brought the cutter under Navy Department control on 6 April 1917. Comanche continued to patrol the gulf coast even in naval service. Her second period of service with the Navy lasted over two years until 28 August 1919 at which time she was returned to the jurisdiction of the Treasury Department. Revenue service again She continued her patrols of the gulf for another seven months and then headed for Key West where she was decommissioned on 17 April 1920 for repairs. Recommissioned in July, the ship relieved cutter at Mobile and rejoined the Gulf Division. Serving successively at Mobile, Key West, and Galveston, she patrolled coastal waters constantly until June 1930. During that period, she left the Gulf of Mexico only once, in 1923, for repairs at Baltimore and Norfolk. On 2 June 1930, she was detached from the Gulf Division and was ordered back to Arundel Cove. Disposal She arrived at her destination on 1 July and was placed out of commission on 31 July 1930. She was sold to Weiss Motor Lines, of Baltimore, on 13 November 1930. WWII- era SS William Windom (1943‚Äì64) Separate from the above vessel, there was an SS William Windom that was part of the fleet of Liberty Ships during World War II. The construction of the World War II-era, Type C1 ship, SS William Windom began on 11 December 1942 at Richmond Shipyards and finished on 8 January 1943. The SS William Windom was launched to sea on 19 January 1943. SS William Windom was at Normandy on D-Day, 6 June 1944. According to the log of U.S. freighters at Normandy, each vessel carried 480 men and about 120 army vehicles to Normandy from the United Kingdom during June 1944 or were loading or awaiting orders during June 1944. The records from the William Windom said it was \\"loading in June.\\" In August 1964, the World War II-era Windom was scrapped.

USA was a joint venture which was established in August 1995 as a Limited Liability Company (LLC), equally owned by Boeing and Lockheed Martin. The company was headquartered in Houston, Texas and in 2008 employed approximately 8,800 people in Texas, Florida, Alabama, and the Washington, D.C. area. In 2014, the company was in the process of dissolving. The company was finally dissolved on 20 December 2019.  History  United Space Alliance's original logo featured the Space Shuttle orbiter, it was changed to the current logo in 2008. United Space Alliance was formed as a limited liability company as a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin in response to NASA's desire to consolidate many Space Shuttle program contracts to one prime contractor. USA and NASA signed the Space Flight Operations Contract in September 1996 to become the single prime contractor that NASA was seeking. USA supported the contract for 10 years through September 2006. This led to USA and NASA agreeing on October 2, 2006 to the Space Program Operations Contract. Until 2011, USA's major business was the operation and processing of NASA's Space Shuttle fleet and International Space Station at Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center and John F. Kennedy Space Center. This work was defined by the Space Program Operations Contract (SPOC) between NASA and USA. The contract ran from October 1, 2006 through September 30, 2010, which was to be the end of Space Shuttle operations. The contract included five one-year options that could extend the contract through Fiscal Year 2015. Efforts under the Space Program Operations Contract included work and support for mission design and planning; software development and integration; astronaut and flight controller training; system integration; flight operations; vehicle processing, launch and recovery; vehicle sustaining engineering; flight crew equipment processing; and Space Shuttle and International Space Station-related support to the Constellation Program. It was a cost reimbursement contract, with provisions for award and performance fees.  Search for role in the post-Shuttle era  With the planned end of the Space Shuttle program in 2011, USA sought new business opportunities through new government contracts for other NASA programs. One of those contracts was the 2008 Integrated Mission Operations Contract (IMOC) to provide flight operations support for the Constellation Program and International Space Station Program in Houston through September 30, 2011. Also, USA signed a 2008 subcontract with Alliant Techsystems for support of the Ares I launch vehicle. In November 2010, United Space Alliance was selected by NASA for consideration for potential contract awards for heavy lift launch vehicle system concepts, and propulsion technologies.  Demise  The efforts of USA's management to identify new post-Shuttle business opportunities were ultimately not successful, and its owners Boeing and Lockheed-Martin decided to wind down the joint venture. As of September 30, 2014, USA no longer held active contracts, and said that it would not pursue future contracts. However, USA announced that it would continue to operate in an administrative business capacity to manage government contract close-out requirements. Close-out of government contracts historically takes 5‚Äì7 years.. On December 20, 2019, the company was dissolved.

An improvised explosive device, described as a nail bomb or similar, detonated around 7:00 a.m. within a Palu butcher's market mostly frequented by Christians shopping for New Year's Eve celebrations, killing eight people and wounding a further 53. The bomb detonated within a partially enclosed butcher's shop that sold pig and dog meat direct to the public, both of which are forbidden under Islamic custom. A second explosive device was reportedly discovered around four metres from the initial blast site, nearby a stall selling pork, and defused. The target, a market in a district dominated by the mostly Christian Minahasa ethnic group, may have been selected to maximise Christian casualties, as Central Sulawesi province had previously been the site of significant sectarian violence between Christian and Muslim factions that claimed over a thousand lives between 1998 and 2002. The conflict had largely been concentrated around the Poso region of the province and Palu had largely been spared wide scale violence and then Indonesian Security Minister Widodo Adisucipto suggested Jemaah Islamiyah may have been responsible for the attack.  The attack  The device, described as home- made and low-explosive, detonated at 7:05 a.m. within a meat stall in front of a house used for the slaughter of pigs and opposite the Bethel Church in the Maesa subdistrict, south of Palu. Police officials stated the bomb was filled with nails and ball bearings, and most of the victims suffered injuries to their limbs due to the shrapnel from the device. Bystanders are described as having carried the wounded from the makeshift market to a road, and placing them in passing cars to be taken to local hospitals, where at least 20 shoppers were treated for serious injuries in the attack. Several of the fatalities were identified as Bambang Wiyono Saputra (50), Yakulina Tana (45), Agustina Mande (37) the owners of the stall, Yoppie (42) and his wife Meisye (39) and a member of the Intelligence Unit of the Tadulako District Army Command, Sgt. Tasman Lahansang.  Investigation  Following the attack, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono denounced the bombing and conveyed his condolences to the families of the victims. Roadblocks were established in the Palu region and a team from Criminal Investigation Agency (Bareskrim), was deployed directly to Palu to aid the ongoing investigation. A single person was arrested the same day, according to a report by provincial police chief Oegroseno, although it was unclear whether he was a direct suspect, police would only say that he had been acting suspiciously and asked vendors where they lived. Convicted terrorist financier Eko Budi Wardoyo is suspected of involvement in the Palu market bombing following his involvement in the murder of Reverend Susianti Tinulele, a female pastor killed on 18 July 2004 during an attack on a South Palu church that also wounded four teenagers. Wardoyo was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment in 2010 for funding that attack and giving assistance to the criminals found responsible for the 2005 Tentena market bombings that claimed 22 lives on 28 May 2005. Another bomb was discovered among street vendors near Palu Plaza during the Idul Fitri festival in 2008 and detonated by the local Palu bomb squad without incident.

Both electrical and electronics engineers typically possess an academic degree with a major in electrical/ electronics engineering. The length of study for such a degree is usually three or four years and the completed degree may be designated as a Bachelor of Engineering, Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Applied Science depending upon the university. Scope of undergraduate education The degree generally includes units covering physics, mathematics, project management and specific topics in electrical and electronics engineering. Initially such topics cover most, if not all, of the sub fields of electrical engineering. Students then choose to specialize in one or more sub fields towards the end of the degree. In most countries, a bachelor's degree in engineering represents the first step towards certification and the degree program itself is certified by a professional body. After completing a certified degree program the engineer must satisfy a range of requirements (including work experience requirements) before being certified. Once certified the engineer is designated the title of Professional Engineer (in the United States and Canada), Chartered Engineer (in the United Kingdom, Ireland, India, Pakistan, South Africa and Zimbabwe), Chartered Professional Engineer (in Australia) or European Engineer (in much of the European Union). Post graduate studies Electrical engineers can also choose to pursue a postgraduate degree such as a master of engineering, a doctor of philosophy in engineering or an engineer's degree. The master and engineer's degree may consist of either research, coursework or a mixture of the two. The doctor of philosophy consists of a significant research component and is often viewed as the entry point to academia. In the United Kingdom and various other European countries, the master of engineering is often considered an undergraduate degree of slightly longer duration than the bachelor of engineering. Typical electrical/electronics engineering undergraduate syllabus Apart from electromagnetics and network theory, other items in the syllabus are particular to electronics engineering course.

Certification The advantages of certification vary depending upon location. For example, in the United States and Canada \\"only a licensed engineer may...seal engineering work for public and private clients\\". This requirement is enforced by state and provincial legislation such as Quebec's Engineers Act. In other countries, such as Australia, no such legislation exists. Practically all certifying bodies maintain a code of ethics that they expect all members to abide by or risk expulsion. In this way these organizations play an important role in maintaining ethical standards for the profession. Even in jurisdictions where certification has little or no legal bearing on work, engineers are subject to contract law. In cases where an engineer's work fails he or she may be subject to the tort of negligence and, in extreme cases, the charge of criminal negligence. An engineer's work must also comply with numerous other rules and regulations such as building codes and legislation pertaining to environmental law. Significant professional bodies for electrical engineers include the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the Institution of Engineering and Technology. The former claims to produce 30 percent of the world's literature on electrical engineering, has over 360,000 members worldwide and holds over 300 conferences annually. The latter publishes 14 journals, has a worldwide membership of 120,000, certifies Chartered Engineers in the United Kingdom and claims to be the largest professional engineering society in Europe.

The source code to the original nVIR has been made widely available, and so numerous variants have arisen. Each variant causes somewhat different symptoms, such as: application crashes, printing errors on laser printers, slow system response time, or unpredictable system crashes. nVIR spreads through any nVIR-infected program, but due to the long period of time nVIR lies basically dormant in a host system, nVIR generally finds its way into system backups and is not detected until the first overt symptoms appear. For example, if a disk used in an infected Macintosh is removed and inserted in a second Macintosh, the other machine will become infected if any application on that disk is executed in the second machine. Further, any method used to transfer programs between Macintoshes will spread nVIR, including file transfer over a network. However, nVIR cannot spread via a print network's hardware. nVIR carries an additional code resource, CODE 256 (though some variants carry CODE 255), and patches the jump table to point to it. The original application's entry point is saved in the nVIR 2 resource. nVIR introduces to the System file the INIT 32 resource which is executed at startup, at which time nVIR patches the TEInit trap. Any application subsequently calling this trap will be infected. The nVIR 3 (or nVIR 5) resource is a copy of INIT 32. An nVIR 10 resource in the System file will prevent nVIR infection. If an application calls OpenResFile prior to TEInit, that application will be damaged. nVIR 0 resource holds a counter that is set to 1000 on the first infection of the system. Each reboot decrements the counter by 1. Each application launch decrements it by 2. When the counter reaches 0, nVIR will beep 1 out of 8 reboots and 1 of 4 infected application launches. If MacinTalk is installed in the machine's System folder, the machine may occasionally say \\"Don't Panic\\". Otherwise, it may beep unexpectedly. nVIR has been known to 'hybridize' with different variants of nVIR on the same machine.

It was proposed by Ronald N. Bracewell in a 1960 paper, as an alternative to interstellar radio communication between widely separated civilizations.  Description  A Bracewell probe would be constructed as an autonomous robotic interstellar space probe with a high level of artificial intelligence, and all relevant information that its home civilization might wish to communicate to another culture. It would seek out technological civilizations‚Äîor alternatively monitor worlds where there is a likelihood of technological civilizations arising‚Äîand communicate over \\"short\\" distances (compared to the interstellar distances between inhabited worlds) once it discovered a civilization that meets its contact criteria. It would make its presence known, carry out a dialogue with the contacted culture, and presumably communicate the results of its encounter to its place of origin. In essence, such probes would act as an autonomous local representative of their home civilization and would act as the point of contact between the cultures. Since a Bracewell probe can communicate much faster, over shorter distances, and over large spans of time, it can communicate with alien cultures more efficiently than radio message exchange might. The disadvantage to this approach is that such probes cannot communicate anything not in their data storage, nor can their contact criteria or policies for communication be quickly updated by their \\"base of operations\\". While a Bracewell probe need not be a von Neumann probe as well, the two concepts are compatible, and a self-replicating device as proposed by von Neumann would greatly speed up a Bracewell probe's search for alien civilizations. It is also possible that such a probe (or system of probes if launched as a von Neumann-Bracewell probe) may outlive the civilization which created and launched it. There have been some efforts under the SETA and SETV projects to detect evidence for the visitation of the Solar System by such hypothetical probes, and to signal or activate such an alleged probe that may be lying dormant in local space. Variations in the echo delay times of radio transmissions, known as long delayed echoes, or LDEs, have also been interpreted in Professor Bracewell's 1960 paper as evidence for such probes. The near-earth object 1991 VG was initially suggested as a candidate for a Bracewell probe due to its unusual characteristics. In more recent years, however, additional discoveries have accounted for the characteristics of 1991 VG, and it is no longer regarded as anomalous.  Fictional examples  * In Arthur C. Clarke's novel The Fountains of Paradise the extraterrestrial Starglider probe is an example of a Bracewell probe. In Clarke's story The Sentinel, later adapted into the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey, the 'Monolith' appears to be a Bracewell probe placed on the moon to ensure that only a civilization capable of spaceflight would be able to discover it. * Alien Planet is a 94-minute special which aired on the Discovery Channel in 2005 about two internationally built robot probes, and their mothership, searching for alien life on the fictional planet Darwin IV. * Bracewell probes are featured in David Brin's 2012 novel Existence. * In Star Trek: The Motion Picture, a Voyager-class probe was upgraded and repurposed by an alien civilization. It acquired so much information, it became conscious and returned \\"home\\" to share what it learned * In the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \\"The Inner Light\\", a Bracewell probe transmits details of an extinct civilization to Captain Picard. * In the Star Trek: Voyager episode \\"Friendship One\\", the crew is tasked with recovering a Bracewell probe that humans launched and find it on a planet whose inhabitants used the knowledge they obtained from it with disastrous results. * An alien probe contacts the space station Babylon 5 in the season 3 episode \\"A Day in the Strife\\". The probe is a Bracewell probe, asking a series of questions and offering new technologies, medicine and science in return for answers to said questions. However, if the probe receives correct answers‚Äîthus proving that whatever civilization the probe has come into contact with is advanced‚Äîthe probe detonates with a yield of 500 megatons, removing said civilization's homeworld or facility. This makes it more of a berserker probe. * The Snark, an alien probe that visits Earth in the novel In the Ocean of Night (1977) by Gregory Benford. * Bracewell probes in the role-playing game Eclipse Phase infect the seed AIs created by humanity with a deadly computer virus. * In the Doctor Who episode Victory of the Daleks, the Daleks create a Bracewell probe in the form of a convincingly-human android (appropriately named Bracewell) and covertly send it to Earth during World War II in order to communicate a false cover story to humans that disguises the Daleks' own arrival.

The students are driven by creativity and intellectual curiosity. The Bridges educational model is strength-based and talent-development driven. Each student has an individual learning plan created to meet their diverse learning style, academic, creative and social/emotional needs. Stimulating core classes, abundant enrichment, small class size, extensive academic supports and a vital advisory and mentoring program are all part of the Bridges approach. The school is located in Studio City, Los Angeles, California. History Bridges Academy started as a private tutorial for three students in the home of founder Carolyn McWilliams in 1994. Prior to the 1997-1998 school year, the school relocated to its former site on Burbank Boulevard in Sherman Oaks, California. During that time, annual enrollment was between 40 and 50 students per year. In 1998, the school was granted non-profit corporation status, with a Board of Trustees and McWilliams continuing as the Head of School. In 2001, the Board of Trustees and Head of School dedicated the mission of the school to educating twice- exceptional students. McWilliams retired in the summer of 2003 and Charles \\"Chuck\\" Potts, the founding Head of the Wesley School in North Hollywood, California, was hired as interim Head of School. After a national search, Carl Sabatino, former Head of the Upper School of Lawrence Woodmere Academy in N.Y., was hired as Head of School in 2005. In 2008 enrollment had reached over 100 students; as of 2010 it had risen to over 150 students. Current enrollment is around 180. Facilities In 2005, Bridges moved from its previous location in Sherman Oaks, California to its current location in a shared-use arrangement with Osaka Sangyo University (OSULA) Education Center. The campus is the former site of the all-girls Catholic Corvallis High School (California). It was purchased by OSULA in the late 1980s. Bridges continued absorbing more and more classroom and administrative space until finally purchasing the campus in 2011 at which time OSULA moved on to another location. Curriculum The curriculum is strength-based and student- centered, driven by an understanding that \\"students thrive when the academic challenge is commensurate with their intellectual gifts\\", and a belief that \\"students' special needs can be met without diluting the curriculum.\\" Gifts, passions, talents and interests are cultivated through stimulating core academic classes, a rich array of electives and enrichment clusters, project- driven Intersessions and a Young Experts Achievement program.Bridges Academy website The learning disabilities among the gifted and very gifted student population include: Autism, nonverbal learning differences, organizational challenges, Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, audio and visual processing problems, and dysgraphia. The program is accredited by the Western Association of Schools & Colleges (WASC) and the California Association of Independent Schools (CAIS). Bridges is a Member of the California Association of Independent Schools; the National Association of Independent Schools; and the Educational Records Bureau. The high school program meets or exceeds the university of California A-G requirements for high school graduation. All students are required to have a laptop. The campus has a wireless network aside from hardwired classrooms and offices. In sports, Bridges participates in the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) in basketball, cross country and track. Other sports and physical activities are part of the traditional fitness component of the curriculum.Bridges website, sports In 2014, interest from multiple students led to the creation of a Speech and Debate Program where students compete in a range of different public speaking and debate events across a statewide and national level. As of 2016, the Bridges team is an active member school of the National Speech and Debate Association, and has qualified students to the CHSSA State Speech and Debate Championship Tournament and the NSDA's National Speech and Debate Tournament Finals in only two years of existence. Since first graduation in 1996, graduates have been accepted at virtually all community colleges Valley College, Cal State and University of California schools, as well as some major universities and four-year colleges throughout the nation.Bridges Academy Admissions In 2007, two Bridges students received Honorable Mention Awards as part of the Smart Kids With Learning Disabilities organization's annual Youth Achievement Award program.Smart Kids with LD Parents' involvement is encouraged and supported via the Parents Association, online resources and forums, and on-campus events including support groups and a speaker series. The development office encourages 100% participation in the Annual Fund Plus Campaign with phone calls and emails. Mascot In 2010, Academy Students voted on a new mascot. They chose the Phoenix out of many submitted designs. The mascot is used for athletic and fundraising purposes. All documentation and branding contain the official logo of the school, a bridge.

Data cleansing may be performed interactively with data wrangling tools, or as batch processing through scripting. After cleansing, a data set should be consistent with other similar data sets in the system. The inconsistencies detected or removed may have been originally caused by user entry errors, by corruption in transmission or storage, or by different data dictionary definitions of similar entities in different stores. Data cleaning differs from data validation in that validation almost invariably means data is rejected from the system at entry and is performed at the time of entry, rather than on batches of data. ; The actual process of data cleansing may involve removing typographical errors or validating and correcting values against a known list of entities. The validation may be strict (such as rejecting any address that does not have a valid postal code) or fuzzy (such as correcting records that partially match existing, known records). Some data cleansing solutions will clean data by cross-checking with a validated data set. A common data cleansing practice is data enhancement, where data is made more complete by adding related information. For example, appending addresses with any phone numbers related to that address. Data cleansing may also involve harmonization (or normalization) of data, which is the process of bringing together data of \\"varying file formats, naming conventions, and columns\\", and transforming it into one cohesive data set; a simple example is the expansion of abbreviations (\\"st, rd, etc.\\" to \\"street, road, etcetera\\").  Motivation  Administratively incorrect, inconsistent data can lead to false conclusions and misdirect investments on both public and private scales. For instance, the government may want to analyze population census figures to decide which regions require further spending and investment on infrastructure and services. In this case, it will be important to have access to reliable data to avoid erroneous fiscal decisions. In the business world, incorrect data can be costly. Many companies use customer information databases that record data like contact information, addresses, and preferences. For instance, if the addresses are inconsistent, the company will suffer the cost of resending mail or even losing customers.  Data quality  High-quality data needs to pass a set of quality criteria. Those include: * Validity: The degree to which the measures conform to defined business rules or constraints (see also Validity (statistics)). When modern database technology is used to design data-capture systems, validity is fairly easy to ensure: invalid data arises mainly in legacy contexts (where constraints were not implemented in software) or where inappropriate data-capture technology was used (e.g., spreadsheets, where it is very hard to limit what a user chooses to enter into a cell, if cell validation is not used). Data constraints fall into the following categories: ** Data-Type Constraints ‚Äì e.g., values in a particular column must be of a particular data type, e.g., Boolean, numeric (integer or real), date, etc. ** Range Constraints: typically, numbers or dates should fall within a certain range. That is, they have minimum and/or maximum permissible values. ** Mandatory Constraints: Certain columns cannot be empty. ** Unique Constraints: A field, or a combination of fields, must be unique across a dataset. For example, no two persons can have the same social security number. ** Set-Membership constraints: The values for a column come from a set of discrete values or codes. For example, a person's gender may be Female, Male or Unknown (not recorded). ** Foreign-key constraints: This is the more general case of set membership. The set of values in a column is defined in a column of another table that contains unique values. For example, in a US taxpayer database, the \\"state\\" column is required to belong to one of the US's defined states or territories: the set of permissible states/territories is recorded in a separate State table. The term foreign key is borrowed from relational database terminology. ** Regular expression patterns: Occasionally, text fields will have to be validated this way. For example, phone numbers may be required to have the pattern (999) 999-9999. ** Cross-field validation: Certain conditions that utilize multiple fields must hold. For example, in laboratory medicine, the sum of the components of the differential white blood cell count must be equal to 100 (since they are all percentages). In a hospital database, a patient's date of discharge from the hospital cannot be earlier than the date of admission. * Accuracy: The degree of conformity of a measure to a standard or a true value - see also Accuracy and precision. Accuracy is very hard to achieve through data-cleansing in the general case because it requires accessing an external source of data that contains the true value: such \\"gold standard\\" data is often unavailable. Accuracy has been achieved in some cleansing contexts, notably customer contact data, by using external databases that match up zip codes to geographical locations (city and state) and also help verify that street addresses within these zip codes actually exist. * Completeness: The degree to which all required measures are known. Incompleteness is almost impossible to fix with data cleansing methodology: one cannot infer facts that were not captured when the data in question was initially recorded. (In some contexts, e.g., interview data, it may be possible to fix incompleteness by going back to the original source of data, i.e. re-interviewing the subject, but even this does not guarantee success because of problems of recall - e.g., in an interview to gather data on food consumption, no one is likely to remember exactly what one ate six months ago. In the case of systems that insist certain columns should not be empty, one may work around the problem by designating a value that indicates \\"unknown\\" or \\"missing\\", but the supplying of default values does not imply that the data has been made complete.) * Consistency: The degree to which a set of measures are equivalent in across systems (see also Consistency). Inconsistency occurs when two data items in the data set contradict each other: e.g., a customer is recorded in two different systems as having two different current addresses, and only one of them can be correct. Fixing inconsistency is not always possible: it requires a variety of strategies - e.g., deciding which data were recorded more recently, which data source is likely to be most reliable (the latter knowledge may be specific to a given organization), or simply trying to find the truth by testing both data items (e.g., calling up the customer). * Uniformity: The degree to which a set data measures are specified using the same units of measure in all systems ( see also Unit of measure). In datasets pooled from different locales, weight may be recorded either in pounds or kilos and must be converted to a single measure using an arithmetic transformation. The term integrity encompasses accuracy, consistency and some aspects of validation (see also data integrity) but is rarely used by itself in data-cleansing contexts because it is insufficiently specific. (For example, \\"referential integrity\\" is a term used to refer to the enforcement of foreign-key constraints above.)  Process  * Data auditing: The data is audited with the use of statistical and database methods to detect anomalies and contradictions: this eventually indicates the characteristics of the anomalies and their locations. Several commercial software packages will let you specify constraints of various kinds (using a grammar that conforms to that of a standard programming language, e.g., JavaScript or Visual Basic) and then generate code that checks the data for violation of these constraints. This process is referred to below in the bullets \\"workflow specification\\" and \\"workflow execution.\\" For users who lack access to high-end cleansing software, Microcomputer database packages such as Microsoft Access or File Maker Pro will also let you perform such checks, on a constraint-by-constraint basis, interactively with little or no programming required in many cases. * Workflow specification: The detection and removal of anomalies are performed by a sequence of operations on the data known as the workflow. It is specified after the process of auditing the data and is crucial in achieving the end product of high-quality data. In order to achieve a proper workflow, the causes of the anomalies and errors in the data have to be closely considered. * Workflow execution: In this stage, the workflow is executed after its specification is complete and its correctness is verified. The implementation of the workflow should be efficient, even on large sets of data, which inevitably poses a trade-off because the execution of a data-cleansing operation can be computationally expensive. * Post-processing and controlling: After executing the cleansing workflow, the results are inspected to verify correctness. Data that could not be corrected during the execution of the workflow is manually corrected, if possible. The result is a new cycle in the data-cleansing process where the data is audited again to allow the specification of an additional workflow to further cleanse the data by automatic processing. Good quality source data has to do with ‚ÄúData Quality Culture‚Äù and must be initiated at the top of the organization. It is not just a matter of implementing strong validation checks on input screens, because almost no matter how strong these checks are, they can often still be circumvented by the users. There is a nine-step guide for organizations that wish to improve data quality:Kimball, R., Ross, M., Thornthwaite, W., Mundy, J., Becker, B. The Data Warehouse Lifecycle Toolkit, Wiley Publishing, Inc., 2008. Olson, J. E. Data Quality: The Accuracy Dimension\\", Morgan Kaufmann, 2002. * Declare a high-level commitment to a data quality culture * Drive process reengineering at the executive level * Spend money to improve the data entry environment * Spend money to improve application integration * Spend money to change how processes work * Promote end-to-end team awareness * Promote interdepartmental cooperation * Publicly celebrate data quality excellence * Continuously measure and improve data quality Others include: * Parsing: for the detection of syntax errors. A parser decides whether a string of data is acceptable within the allowed data specification. This is similar to the way a parser works with grammars and languages. * Data transformation: Data transformation allows the mapping of the data from its given format into the format expected by the appropriate application. This includes value conversions or translation functions, as well as normalizing numeric values to conform to minimum and maximum values. * Duplicate elimination: Duplicate detection requires an algorithm for determining whether data contains duplicate representations of the same entity. Usually, data is sorted by a key that would bring duplicate entries closer together for faster identification. * Statistical methods: By analyzing the data using the values of mean, standard deviation, range, or clustering algorithms, it is possible for an expert to find values that are unexpected and thus erroneous. Although the correction of such data is difficult since the true value is not known, it can be resolved by setting the values to an average or other statistical value. Statistical methods can also be used to handle missing values which can be replaced by one or more plausible values, which are usually obtained by extensive data augmentation algorithms. System The essential job of this system is to find a suitable balance between fixing dirty data and maintaining the data as close as possible to the original data from the source production system. This is a challenge for the Extract, transform, load architect. The system should offer an architecture that can cleanse data, record quality events and measure/control quality of data in the data warehouse. A good start is to perform a thorough data profiling analysis that will help define to the required complexity of the data cleansing system and also give an idea of the current data quality in the source system(s).  Tools  There are many data- cleansing tools like Trifacta, Openprise, OpenRefine, Paxata, Alteryx, Data Ladder, WinPure and others. It's also common to use libraries like Pandas (software) for Python (programming language), or Dplyr for R (programming language). One example of a data cleansing for distributed systems under Apache Spark is called Optimus, an OpenSource framework for laptop or cluster allowing pre-processing, cleansing, and exploratory data analysis. It includes several data wrangling tools. Quality screens Part of the data cleansing system is a set of diagnostic filters known as quality screens. They each implement a test in the data flow that, if it fails, records an error in the Error Event Schema. Quality screens are divided into three categories: * Column screens. Testing the individual column, e.g. for unexpected values like NULL values; non-numeric values that should be numeric; out of range values; etc. * Structure screens. These are used to test for the integrity of different relationships between columns (typically foreign/primary keys) in the same or different tables. They are also used for testing that a group of columns is valid according to some structural definition to which it should adhere. * Business rule screens. The most complex of the three tests. They test to see if data, maybe across multiple tables, follow specific business rules. An example could be, that if a customer is marked as a certain type of customer, the business rules that define this kind of customer should be adhered to. When a quality screen records an error, it can either stop the dataflow process, send the faulty data somewhere else than the target system or tag the data. The latter option is considered the best solution because the first option requires, that someone has to manually deal with the issue each time it occurs and the second implies that data are missing from the target system (integrity) and it is often unclear what should happen to these data. Criticism of existing tools and processes Most data cleansing tools have limitations in usability: * Project costs: costs typically in the hundreds of thousands of dollars * Time: mastering large-scale data-cleansing software is time-consuming * Security: cross-validation requires sharing information, giving an application access across systems, including sensitive legacy systems Error event schema The Error Event schema holds records of all error events thrown by the quality screens. It consists of an Error Event Fact table with foreign keys to three dimension tables that represent date (when), batch job (where) and screen (who produced error). It also holds information about exactly when the error occurred and the severity of the error. Also, there is an Error Event Detail Fact table with a foreign key to the main table that contains detailed information about in which table, record and field the error occurred and the error condition.

Data scrubbing reduces the likelihood that single correctable errors will accumulate, leading to reduced risks of uncorrectable errors. Data integrity is a high-priority concern in writing, reading, storage, transmission, or processing of the computer data in computer operating systems and in computer storage and data transmission systems. However, only a few of the currently existing and used file systems provide sufficient protection against data corruption. To address this issue, data scrubbing provides routine checks of all inconsistencies in data and, in general, prevention of hardware or software failure. This \\"scrubbing\\" feature occurs commonly in memory, disk arrays, file systems, or FPGAs as a mechanism of error detection and correction. RAID With data scrubbing, a RAID controller may periodically read all hard disk drives in a RAID array and check for defective blocks before applications might actually access them. This reduces the probability of silent data corruption and data loss due to bit-level errors.Ulf Troppens, Wolfgang Mueller-Friedt, Rainer Erkens, Rainer Wolafka, Nils Haustein. Storage Networks Explained: Basics and Application of Fibre Channel SAN, NAS, ISCSI, InfiniBand and FCoE. John Wiley and Sons, 2009. p.39 In Dell PowerEdge RAID environments, a feature called \\"patrol read\\" can perform data scrubbing and preventive maintenance. In OpenBSD, the \`bioctl(8)\` utility allows the system administrator to control these patrol reads through the \`BIOCPATROL\` ioctl on the \`/dev/bio\` pseudo-device; as of 2019, this functionality is supported in some device drivers for LSI Logic and Dell controllers ‚Äî this includes \`mfi(4)\` since OpenBSD 5.8 (2015) and \`mfii(4)\` since OpenBSD 6.4 (2018). In FreeBSD and DragonFly BSD, patrol can be controlled through a RAID controller-specific utility \`mfiutil(8)\` since FreeBSD 8.0 (2009) and 7.3 (2010). The implementation from FreeBSD was used by the OpenBSD developers for adding patrol support to their generic bio(4) framework and the bioctl utility, without a need for a separate controller- specific utility. In NetBSD in 2008, the bio(4) framework from OpenBSD was extended to feature support for consistency checks, which was implemented for \`/dev/bio\` pseudo-device under \`BIOCSETSTATE\` ioctl command, with the options being start and stop (\`BIOC_SSCHECKSTART_VOL\` and \`BIOC_SSCHECKSTOP_VOL\`, respectively); this is supported only by a single driver as of 2019 ‚Äî \`arcmsr(4)\`. Linux MD RAID, as a software RAID implementation, makes data consistency checks available and provides automated repairing of detected data inconsistencies. Such procedures are usually performed by setting up a weekly cron job. Maintenance is performed by issuing operations check, repair, or idle to each of the examined MD devices. Statuses of all performed operations, as well as general RAID statuses, are always available. File systems=Btrfs As a copy-on-write (CoW) file system for Linux, Btrfs provides fault isolation, corruption detection and correction, and file-system scrubbing. If the file system detects a checksum mismatch while reading a block, it first tries to obtain (or create) a good copy of this block from another device if its internal mirroring or RAID techniques are in use. Btrfs can initiate an online check of the entire file system by triggering a file system scrub job that is performed in the background. The scrub job scans the entire file system for integrity and automatically attempts to report and repair any bad blocks it finds along the way. ZFS The features of ZFS, which is a combined file system and logical volume manager, include the verification against data corruption modes, continuous integrity checking, and automatic repair. Sun Microsystems designed ZFS from the ground up with a focus on data integrity and to protect the data on disks against issues such as disk firmware bugs and ghost writes. ZFS provides a repair utility called \`scrub\` that examines and repairs silent data corruption caused by data rot and other problems. Memory Due to the high integration density of contemporary computer memory chips, the individual memory cell structures became small enough to be vulnerable to cosmic rays and/or alpha particle emission. The errors caused by these phenomena are called soft errors. This can be a problem for DRAM- and SRAM-based memories. Memory scrubbing does error-detection and correction of bit errors in computer RAM by using ECC memory, other copies of the data, or other error-detecting codes. FPGA Scrubbing is a technique used to reprogram an FPGA. It can be used periodically to avoid the accumulation of errors without the need to find one in the configuration bitstream, thus simplifying the design. Numerous approaches can be taken with respect to scrubbing, from simply reprogramming the FPGA to partial reconfiguration. The simplest method of scrubbing is to completely reprogram the FPGA at some periodic rate (typically 1/10 the calculated upset rate). However, the FPGA is not operational during that reprogram time, on the order of micro to milliseconds. For situations that cannot tolerate that type of interruption, partial reconfiguration is available. This technique allows the FPGA to be reprogrammed while still operational.

Saturn was launched during 1890 by Harlan & Hollingsworth Company, Wilmington, Delaware; was purchased on 2 April 1898 by the United States Navy from the Boston Towboat Company for service in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War; and commissioned on 11 April 1898, Commander Samuel W. Very in command. Service history=Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, 1898 Departing from Brooklyn, New York, on 11 April 1898, Saturn steamed south to Key West. Carrying coal for United States Navy ships operating against Spanish forces in the Caribbean, Saturn called at Cienfuegos, Cuba, at ports in Haiti and Puerto Rico, and at St. Thomas, Danish West Indies, before the war ended. She returned to Norfolk, Virginia on 1 September 1898 and was decommissioned there on 4 November and placed in reserve. Asiatic Squadron, 1900‚Äì1903 Recommissioned on 15 August 1900, Saturn departed from Norfolk on that day to join the Asiatic Squadron. Visiting Gibraltar, Port Said, Aden, and Singapore, Saturn arrived at Cavite, Luzon, Philippine Islands, on 10 October 1900. The collier, based at Philippine ports, operated in East Asian waters into 1903, but usually was stationed for months at a time at Chefoo and Woosung, China; Nagasaki, Japan; and Hong Kong. Detached on 5 March 1903 from the Asiatic Fleet, the ship arrived at Bremerton, Washington, on 25 April and was decommissioned there on 30 June 1903 and placed in reserve. Pacific Fleet, 1903‚Äì1916 Saturn was placed in service on 2 December 1903 on a merchant basis and attached to the Pacific Squadron the same day. She operated on the United States west coast, from San Diego, California to Elaine, Washington, into 1908. She made one voyage to Kiska and Dutch Harbor, Alaska, during mid-1904, and another to Honolulu and Midway Island in January 1906, carrying coal for shore facilities. She also cruised in Mexican waters during January, April, July, and August 1907, supplying ships of the fleet. Saturn was assigned to the Pacific Torpedo Flotilla on 1 December 1908. She cruised along the southern California and Mexican coast into 1911, returning to Puget Sound Navy Yard on 22 August 1911. Saturn was placed out of service there on 30 September and returned to the Reserve Force. Placed in service again on 3 August 1912, Saturn returned to duty with the Pacific Fleet. She operated out of California, Washington, and Mexican ports supporting fleet activities until placed in reserve on 31 July 1913 at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. Saturn was placed in service on 4 April 1914 and deployed to Mexican waters to protect United States citizens while the Mexican political situation deteriorated. Saturn spent much of 1914 anchored at Mazatl√°n, Manzanillo, and La Paz, Mexico, and returned to United States waters early in the following year. The collier remained in service in waters from Mexico to Washington into September 1916. Alaska, 1916‚Äì1920 Saturn departed Bremerton on 2 September 1916 for Sitka, Alaska, to operate as a tender and relay ship for radio communication between Alaska and bases on the United States west coast. She cruised extensively in waters of the North Pacific and was placed in full commission on 4 April 1917 upon United States entry into World War I. She called frequently at Seward, Sitka, Tatoosh, Ketchikan, and Dutch Harbor, insuring continuous communications between the continental United States and the Alaska Territory. During November 1918, Saturn was assigned special duty carrying coal and supplies to the United States Expeditionary Force at Vladivostok, Russia, during the Russian Civil War and large-scale Japanese intervention. She departed Vladivostok on 12 January 1919 and proceeded homeward via Olongapo, Philippine Islands; Guam; and Pearl Harbor, arriving on 25 February at Mare Island Navy Yard. Saturn resumed duty as a communications link between Alaska and the continental United States, with occasional additional duty as a radio repair ship. She was classified AG-4 as a miscellaneous auxiliary on 17 July 1920. Decommissioning and sale Relieved of her duty at the end of 1921, she departed Mare Island on 19 January 1922, transited the Panama Canal, and reached League Island, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 16 February. Decommissioned on 17 March 1922, Saturn was sold on 25 September 1922 to Joseph G. Hitner of Philadelphia, and scrapped.

They were introduced by Ren√©-Louis Baire in 1899. A Baire set is a set whose characteristic function is a Baire function. (There are other, almost equivalent, but inequivalent definitions of Baire sets.) Classification of Baire functions Baire functions of class Œ±, for any countable ordinal number Œ±, form a vector space of real-valued functions defined on a topological space, as follows. *The Baire class 0 functions are the continuous functions. *The Baire class 1 functions are those functions which are the pointwise limit of a sequence of Baire class 0 functions. *In general, the Baire class Œ± functions are all functions which are the pointwise limit of a sequence of functions of Baire class less than Œ±. Some authors define the classes slightly differently, by removing all functions of class less than Œ± from the functions of class Œ±. This means that each Baire function has a well defined class, but the functions of given class no longer form a vector space. Henri Lebesgue proved that (for functions on the unit interval) each Baire class of a countable ordinal number contains functions not in any smaller class, and that there exist functions which are not in any Baire class. Baire class 1 Examples: *The derivative of any differentiable function is of class 1. An example of a differentiable function whose derivative is not continuous (at x = 0) is the function equal to x^2 \\\\sin(1/x) when x ‚â† 0, and 0 when x = 0\\\\. An infinite sum of similar functions (scaled and displaced by rational numbers) can even give a differentiable function whose derivative is discontinuous on a dense set. However, it necessarily has points of continuity, which follows easily from The Baire Characterisation Theorem (below; take K = X = R). *The characteristic function of the set of integers, which equals 1 if x is an integer and 0 otherwise. (An infinite number of large discontinuities.) *Thomae's function, which is 0 for irrational x and 1/q for a rational number p/q (in reduced form). (A dense set of discontinuities, namely the set of rational numbers.) *The characteristic function of the Cantor set, which equals 1 if x is in the Cantor set and 0 otherwise. This function is 0 for an uncountable set of x values, and 1 for an uncountable set. It is discontinuous wherever it equals 1 and continuous wherever it equals 0. It is approximated by the continuous functions g_n(x) = \\\\max(0,{1-nd(x,C)}), where d(x,C) is the distance of x from the nearest point in the Cantor set. The Baire Characterisation Theorem states that a real valued function f defined on a Banach space X is a Baire-1 function if and only if for every non-empty closed subset K of X, the restriction of f to K has a point of continuity relative to the topology of K. By another theorem of Baire, for every Baire-1 function the points of continuity are a comeager GŒ¥ set . Baire class 2 An example of a Baire class 2 function on the interval [0,1] that is not of class 1 is the characteristic function of the rational numbers, \\\\chi_\\\\mathbb{Q}, also known as the Dirichlet function which is discontinuous everywhere. Baire class 3 An example of such functions is given by the indicator of the set of normal numbers, which is a Borel set of rank 3. See also *Baire set *Nowhere continuous function References * *. *.

Located on the Niagara Escarpment, it has few roads which wind through the Escarpment's forests. Like the neighbouring community of St. Johns in Thorold, Effingham sits on the edge of Short Hills Provincial Park. The St. Johns Conservation Area, maintained by the Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority, is located nearby. Effingham began as a small Quaker settlement early in Niagara's history. Situated in the Short Hills of Pelham, it owed its beginnings to David Secord, brother-in-law to Laura Secord, who had arrived shortly after 1783. As a Butler's Ranger, Secord was entitled to a land grant of . The patent issued on 8 July 1799. The tract was composed mainly of wooded hills divided by spring-fed streams. Secord harnessed the water power of the fast flowing streams to run a grist mill at what has since become the neighbouring hamlet of St. Johns, only the second mill to be built in Upper Canada. Secord had cleared 10 acres (4 ha) and planted apple trees, which were already bearing fruit, when the Loyalist and Quaker Samuel Beckett arrived on the scene. Beckett was to be the forerunner of many Quakers who would settle in Pelham. Secord sold his entire grant to Beckett on 13 October 1809 for GBP¬£687/10s. Beckett proceeded to build a saw mill. Besides the grist mill, a woollen factory and fulling mill are recorded, and eventually the bustling milling centre became known as \\"Beckett's Mills\\". The original Beckett home is still in good condition, and its present owner is only its fourth since 1795. The fast running streams of the Twelve Mile Creek system were a source of power and the soil was excellent for farming and growing wheat. The grist mills of Beckett's Mills and St. Johns served the farmers throughout the region. In 1850, Beckett's Mills was renamed \\"Effingham\\" and a post office was established. Effingham boasted a general store, post office, a Quaker church, a blacksmith shop and a carriage shop. In spite of exterior forces, such as the first Welland Canal and the railways by-passing St. Johns, Effingham was still able to be a busy milling community. By 1854, however, the effects of the second Welland canal, more railways and American imported wheat from Ohio forced the community to change to cash crops of fruit, vegetables and dairy products. Effingham slowly declined as a regional centre. Today, the mills are gone. Fierce storms in 1935 washed out the mill dams and sent a flood of water through the valley, destroying many bridges. Of the many millponds where ducks and geese once paddled, only broken-down mill races are still to be found.

The Tibetan medical system is based upon Indian Buddhist literature (for example Abhidharma and Vajrayana tantras) and Ayurveda. It continues to be practiced in Tibet, India, Nepal, Bhutan, Ladakh, Siberia, China and Mongolia, as well as more recently in parts of Europe and North America. It embraces the traditional Buddhist belief that all illness ultimately results from the three poisons: delusion, greed and aversion. Tibetan medicine follows the Buddha's Four Noble Truths which apply medical diagnostic logic to suffering.Kala, C.P. (2005) Health traditions of Buddhist community and role of amchis in trans-Himalayan region of India. Current Science, 89 (8): 1331-1338. History As Indian culture flooded Tibet in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, a number of Indian medical texts were also transmitted. For example, the Ayurvedic AstƒÅngahrdayasamhitƒÅ (Heart of Medicine Compendium attributed to Vagbhata) was translated into Tibetan by ‡Ω¢‡Ω≤‡Ωì‡ºã‡ΩÜ‡Ω∫‡Ωì‡ºã‡Ωñ‡Ωü‡ΩÑ‡ºã‡Ωî‡Ωº‡ºç (Rinchen Zangpo) (957‚Äì1055). Tibet also absorbed the early Indian Abhidharma literature, for example the fifth-century Abhidharmakosasabhasyam by Vasubandhu, which expounds upon medical topics, such as fetal development. A wide range of Indian Vajrayana tantras, containing practices based on medical anatomy, were subsequently absorbed into Tibet.Kala, C.P. (2002) Medicinal Plants of Indian Trans-Himalaya: Focus on Tibetan Use of Medicinal Resources. Bishen Singh Mahendra Pal Singh, Dehradun, India. 200 pp. Some scholars believe that rgyud bzhi (the Four Tantras) was told by the Lord Buddha, while some believe it is the primary work of ‡ΩÇ‡Ω°‡Ω¥‡ºã‡Ωê‡Ωº‡ΩÇ‡ºã‡Ω°‡Ωº‡Ωì‡ºã‡Ωè‡Ωì‡ºã‡Ωò‡ΩÇ‡Ωº‡Ωì‡ºã‡Ωî‡Ωº‡ºç (Yuthok Yontan Gonpo, 708 AD).Mirror of Beryl: A Historical Introduction to Tibetan Medicine Desi Sangye Gyatso, translated by Gavin Kilty, Wisdom Publications 2009. The former opinion is often refuted by saying \\"If it was told by the Lord Buddha, rgyud bzhi should have a Sanskrit version\\". However, there is no such version and also no Indian practitioners who have received unbroken lineage of rgyud bzhi. Thus, the later thought should be scholarly considered authentic and practical. The provenance is uncertain. It was the aboriginal Tibetan people's accumulative knowledge of their local plants and their various usages for benefiting people's health that were collected by ‡Ω¶‡æü‡Ωº‡Ωì‡ºã‡Ωî‡Ωº‡ºã‡ΩÇ‡Ω§‡Ω∫‡Ωì‡ºã‡Ω¢‡Ωñ‡ºã‡Ωò‡Ω≤‡ºã‡Ωñ‡Ωº‡ºã‡ΩÜ‡Ω∫‡ºç the Tonpa Shenrab Miwoche and passed down to one of his sons. Later Yuthok Yontan Gonpo perfected it and there was no author for the books, because at the time it was politically incorrect to mention anything related to Bon nor faith in it. ‡ΩÇ‡Ω°‡Ω¥‡ºã‡Ωê‡Ωº‡ΩÇ‡ºã‡Ω°‡Ωº‡Ωì‡ºã‡Ωè‡Ωì‡ºã‡Ωò‡ΩÇ‡Ωº‡Ωì‡ºã‡Ωî‡Ωº‡ºç (Yuthok Yontan Gonpo) adapted and synthesized the Four Tantras in the 12th Century. The Four Tantras are scholarly debated as having Indian origins or, as Remedy Master Buddha Bhaisajyaguru's word or, as authentically Tibetan with Chinese origins. It was not formally taught in schools at first but, intertwined with Tibetan Buddhism. Around the turn of the 14th century, the Drangti family of physicians established a curriculum for the Four Tantras (and the supplementary literature from the Yutok school) at ‡Ω¶‡ºã‡Ω¶‡æê‡æ±‡ºã‡Ωë‡ΩÇ‡Ωº‡Ωì‡ºç (Sakya Monastery).

Chagpori taught Gyamtso's Blue Beryl as well as the Four Tantras in a model that spread throughout Tibet along with the oral tradition. Four Tantras The Four Tantras (Gyuzhi, ‡Ω¢‡æí‡æ±‡Ω¥‡Ωë‡ºã‡Ωñ‡Ωû‡Ω≤‡ºç) is a native Tibetan text incorporating Indian, Chinese and Greco- Arab medical systems. The Four Tantras is believed to have been created in the twelfth century and still today is considered the basis of Tibetan medical practise. The Four Tantras is the common name for the text of the Secret Tantra Instruction on the Eight Branches, the Immortality Elixir essence. It considers a single medical doctrine from four perspectives. Sage Vidyajnana expounded their manifestation. The basis of the Four Tantras is to keep the three bodily humors in balance; (wind rlung, bile mkhris pa, phlegm bad kan.) * Root Tantra ‚Äì A general outline of the principles of Tibetan medicine, it discusses the humors in the body and their imbalances and their link to illness. The Four Tantra uses visual observation to diagnose predominantly the analysis of the pulse, tongue and analysis of the urine (in modern terms known as urinalysis ) * Exegetical Tantra ‚Äì This section discusses in greater detail the theory behind the Four Tantras and gives general theory on subjects such as anatomy, physiology, psychopathology, embryology and treatment. * Instructional Tantra ‚Äì The longest of the Tantras is mainly a practical application of treatment, it explains in detail illnesses and which humoral imbalance which causes the illness. This section also describes their specific treatments. * Subsequent Tantra ‚Äì Diagnosis and therapies, including the preparation of Tibetan medicine and cleansing of the body internally and externally with the use of techniques such as moxibustion, massage and minor surgeries. Some believe the Four Tantra to be the authentic teachings of the Buddha 'Master of remedies' which was translated from Sanskrit, others believe it to be solely Tibetan in creation by Yuthog the Elder or Yuthog the Younger. Noting these two theories there remain others sceptical as to its original author. Believers in the Buddhist origin of the Four Tantras and how it came to be in Tibet believe it was first taught in India by the Buddha when he manifested as the 'Master of Remedies'. The Four Tantra was then in the eighth century translated and offered to Padmasambhava by Vairocana and concealed in Samye monastery. In the second half of the eleventh century it was rediscovered and in the following century it was in the hands of Yuthog the Younger who completed the Four Tantras and included elements of Tibetan medicine, which would explain why there is Indian elements to the Four Tantras. Although there is clear written instruction in the Four Tantra, the oral transmission of medical knowledge still remained a strong element in Tibetan Medicine, for example oral instruction may have been needed to know how to perform a moxibustion technique. Three principles of function Like other systems of traditional Asian medicine, and in contrast to biomedicine, Tibetan medicine first puts forth a specific definition of health in its theoretical texts. To have good health, Tibetan medical theory states that it is necessary to maintain balance in the body's three principles of function [often translated as humors]: rLung (pron. Loong), mKhris-pa (pron. Tree-pa) [often translated as bile], and Bad-kan (pron. Pay-gen) [often translated as phlegm].The Basic Tantra and the Explanatory Tantra from the Secret Quintessential Instructions on the Eight Branches of the Ambrosia Essence Tantra Men-Tsee-Khang: India 2008 ‚Ä¢ rLung is the source of the body's ability to circulate physical substances (e.g. blood), energy (e.g. nervous system impulses), and the non-physical (e.g. thoughts). In embryological development, the mind's expression of materialism is manifested as the system of rLung. There are five distinct subcategories of rLung each with specific locations and functions: Srog-'Dzin rL√ºng, Gyen-rGyu rLung, Khyab-Byed rL√ºng, Me-mNyam rLung, Thur-Sel rL√ºng. ‚Ä¢ mKhris-pa is characterized by the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of heat, and is the source of many functions such as thermoregulation, metabolism, liver function and discriminating intellect. In embryological development, the mind's expression of aggression is manifested as the system of mKhris-pa. There are five distinct subcategories of mKhris-pa each with specific locations and functions: 'Ju-Byed mKhris-pa, sGrub-Byed mKhris-pa, mDangs-sGyur mKhris-pa, mThong-Byed mKhris-pa, mDog-Sel mKhris-pa. ‚Ä¢ Bad-kan is characterized by the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of cold, and is the source of many functions such as aspects of digestion, the maintenance of our physical structure, joint health and mental stability. In embryological development, the mind's expression of ignorance is manifested as the system of Bad-kan. There are five distinct subcategories of Bad-kan each with specific locations and functions: rTen-Byed Bad-kan, Myag-byed Bad-kan, Myong-Byed Bad-kan, Tsim-Byed Bad-kan, 'Byor-Byed Bad-kan. Usage A key objective of the government of Tibet is to promote traditional Tibetan medicine among the other ethnic groups in China. Once an esoteric monastic secret, the Tibet University of Traditional Tibetan Medicine and the Qinghai University Medical School now offer courses in the practice. In addition, Tibetologists from Tibet have traveled to European countries such as Spain to lecture on the topic. The Tibetan government-in-exile has also kept up the practise of Tibetan Medicine in India since 1961 when it re- established the Men-Tsee-Khang (the Tibetan Medical and Astrological Institute). It now has 48 branch clinics in India and Nepal.Tibetan Medical & Astrology Institute of the Dalai Lama The Government of India has approved the establishment of the National Institute for Sowa-Rigpa (NISR) in Leh to provide opportunities for research and development of Sowa-Rigpa.

It began as a punk band, but by the time of signing to Tooth & Nail Records it had evolved into a swing revival outfit. Their first album, which was self-titled, was produced by Gene Eugene and Dennis Danell. They wrote their own songs, and their musical style and lyrics were often compared to The W's, but John Brown's lead vocals were likened to The Mighty Mighty Bosstones' Dicky Barrett or The Reverend Horton Heat. In their second album, Green Room Blues, the group dropped the horn section entirely and shifted to a rockabilly sound. The album's title reflects the fact that both Eugene and Danell died in early 2000, during production of the album. Though Danell had not been involved in the production, Eugene had been, and was replaced by Chris Colbert. The album has a darker mood than their debut effort, though its lyrics still reflect the faith of John Brown. The album also contained a cover of The Cure's \\"Lovesong\\". 2000 was generally reported as a bad year for the band; they were unable to play shows regularly because in addition to recording difficulties, their drummer left. They were able to get Rodney from the Calicoes to fill in occasionally, and thus played at Cornerstone and other festivals. Also, one night their van caught fire and was totaled, though they still managed to play that night.

He was a member of the Country Liberal Party (CLP) and sat with the National Party in federal parliament. He held ministerial office under four prime ministers. Scullion was a professional fisherman prior to entering politics. He was first elected to the Senate at the 2001 federal election, and briefly served as Minister for Community Services in the Howard Government in 2007. He was deputy leader of the National Party from 2007 to 2013, the first senator to hold the position, and served two terms as the party's Senate leader (2007‚Äì2008 and 2013‚Äì2019). In 2013, Scullion was appointed Minister for Indigenous Affairs in the Abbott Government. He held the same position in the Turnbull and Morrison Governments before retiring from parliament at the 2019 election. He was the only minister to hold the same portfolio in those three governments. Early life Scullion was born in London, England, then lived in Deakin, Canberra, during high school. He is married with 3 children. Before entering the Senate he was a professional fisherman and graduated from the Australian Rural Leadership Program. Career Scullion received media attention early in his career when questions arose over how his business relationships with government bodies might have affected his eligibility to sit in parliament. Investigations continued for some time, but in the end did not affect his membership of Parliament. On 30 January 2007, he was appointed Minister for Community Services in the Australian Government. He held office for only 10 months before the Howard Government was defeated in an election. In February 2007, Scullion was elected to the position of deputy Senate leader of the federal National Party and was subsequently promoted to the positions of deputy parliamentary leader of the National Party and leader of the party in the Senate on 3 December 2007, following the coalition's defeat. On 6 December 2007 he was named as Shadow Minister for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in the shadow ministry chosen by new Opposition Leader Brendan Nelson.Parliament of Australia, Shadow Ministry list, 6 December 2007 , retrieved January 2008. In 2008, he was defeated by Barnaby Joyce for the Senate leadership, but retained the deputy leadership of the National Party.Barnaby Joyce promoted to Nats Senate leader: Fairfax 17/9/2008 Scullion was re-elected at the 2010 election and appointed Shadow Minister for Indigenous Affairs by Opposition leader, Tony Abbott. In February 2012, Scullion appeared in the second episode of Kitchen Cabinet with Annabel Crabb, when they went into the mud flats for crustaceans, which she has recalled as the most memorable show. Following Joyce's move to the House of Representatives in 2013, Scullion reclaimed his position of Senate leader but lost the deputy parliamentary leadership to Joyce. On 11 February 2016 Joyce was elected leader of the Nationals with Fiona Nash as his deputy. As Nash was also a Senator, Scullion had to relinquish the Senate leadership to Senator Nash. In fact, Senator Nash had been Senator Scullion's Senate deputy prior to her election as deputy leader of the parliamentary party. After the High Court ruled that Joyce and Nash were ineligible during the 2017 Australian parliamentary eligibility crisis, Scullion was appointed interim parliamentary leader of the National Party. On 26 January 2019 he announced he would not recontest his Senate seat at the forthcoming election.

The game has been rated for release on PlayStation 4 but no announcement of its release has been made. Plot Specter, the Pipo Monkeys' leader, finds a Monkey Helmet, and hires the human scientist to aid him in his evil plans. They establish television stations protected by the Freaky Monkey Five where they plan to broadcast TV shows worldwide. The television shows that are broadcast on every television put every human except the twins, Kei and Yumi (Satoru and Sayaka outside of North America), their aunt Aki, and Natalie (Natsumi outside of North America) into a mindless trance. When Natalie informs Kei and Yumi that Spike (Kakeru), Jimmy (Hikaru) and the Professor were all infected by the television show, Kei and Yumi go out to catch the monkeys and thwart Specter and Tomoki. Their mission was to go to every movie set and capture all the monkeys there and destroy the satellite there. Kei and Yumi easily capture Monkey White, Monkey Blue, and Monkey Yellow. When they reach the TV Station where Monkey Pink is, Kei and Yumi's attempts to capture her fail and she escapes, although they manage to stop her Specter TV broadcast anyway. They manage to capture Monkey Red afterwards. When they reach Tomoki City, Tomoki challenges them to a battle in his giant Tomo-King robot. Tomoki, after being defeated by Kei and Yumi, and being humiliated by Specter, lets them take his rocket to space to defeat his former partner. Once they reach Specter's outer space base of operations: Space Station SARU-3, they capture all the monkeys and deactivate the movie sets on their way to Specter. When they reach Specter, he tells them his plan about how he will use his space station to cut the earth in half and keep half of it for the monkeys (leaving the other half, originally meant for Tomoki, to the humans). Afterwards he gets in his new Gorillac Mech and tries to activate his plan. He is defeated and the two escape from the satellite, leaving Tomoki to give his life to deactivate the Twin Heavens. He survives. After Specter is defeated, Monkey Pink releases him and the rest of the Freaky Monkey Five, leaving them to be caught again in extremely similar missions. To complete the game one hundred percent, all the four hundred and forty-two monkeys have to be caught, all the time trials have to be completed with a gold time, and all the items, CDs, Video Tapes (except 28), Car Skins, Genie Dance tracks, books, etc. have to be bought. The game holds a total of four hundred and thirty-four monkeys if the secret code monkeys are not caught. Gameplay Playing as either Kei (Satoru) or Yumi (Sayaka), gameplay follows that of the previous games in which the player must catch several monkeys by using various gadgets controlled with right analogue stick. While there are fewer gadgets in this game than previous entries, a new feature in this game is the ability to morph into different forms through a device built by Aki. Some monkeys may also try to steal the player's Stun Club or Time Net and use it against them, and can even force them out of the level by catching them with their own net. Playing as Yumy has an additional benefit; owing to her pop idol status, certain monkeys will go star-struck upon sight of Yumi, allowing for an easy capture. Mesal Gear Solid A minigame featured in the game is ', a spoof of Metal Gear Solid (the name is a pun on and .) In this game, players control Pipo Snake, a monkey loaded with Solid Snake's battle data, sent on a mission to rescue Snake and destroy a monkey-like Metal Gear. Gameplay is similar to Metal Gear Solid in which players have to use stealth and weapons to sneak around undetected and rescue prisoners. Players are equipped with a Banana Pistol for stunning enemies and Pineapple Grenades for breaking open flimsy walls. Similarly, the original PlayStation 2 editions of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater include a Snake vs. Monkey mode in which Snake has to capture monkeys.

From childhood, she sought to become a famous artist, but had to confront her parents' strong opposition to the idea. Her mother was from the Galicia region of Spain, and her father was an Italian man from Genoa. N√©lida married Julio Rivera Roca, a jazz piano player, in 1949, which got her to complete her dream as the lead vocalist in his orchestra. She was discovered in 1950, during one such performance, by Luis C√©sar Amadori, owner of the Maip√≥ Theatre, and first starred on the professional stage in Amadori's The Maip√≥ Theatre is Telling its Stories. The show's commercial success allowed Amadori to triple the price of the seats, and she became a legend in her genre during the 1950s. Critics and her public came to know her as \\"The Venus of Corrientes Avenue\\" (the Buenos Aires theatre district). She remarried in 1963 with vocalist Aldo Perricone (known by his stage name, Ricky Giuliano), though the marriage ended in 1969. In her last show, in the winter of 1974, she shared top credits with the then up-and-coming star, Susana Gim√©nez.

It was introduced in April 2003 and is a means-tested benefit. Despite their name, tax credits are not to be confused with tax credits linked to a person's tax bill, because they are used to top- up wages. Unlike most other benefits, it is paid by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). WTC can be claimed by working individuals, childless couples and working families with dependent children. In addition, people may also be entitled to Child Tax Credit (CTC) if they are responsible for any children. WTC and CTC are assessed jointly and families remain eligible for CTC even if where no adult is working or they have too much income to receive WTC. In 2010 the coalition government announced that the Working Tax Credit would, by 2017, be integrated into and replaced by the new Universal Credit. However implementation of this has been repeatedly delayed and may not be finished until 2022. From 2018 no new claims can be made for Working Tax Credit, only Universal Credit. But existing WTC claimants will not be all transferred to UC until 2022.  History  The WTC replaced the Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC), which operated from April 1999 until March 2003. The WFTC was itself a transitional system from the earlier benefit for working families known as Family Credit (FC), which had been in operation since 1986. The WFTC shared its assessment of means and period of renewal (6 months) with FC but moved towards a tax credit approach styled on schemes in other countries, which used an annual declaration of income to assess entitlement for a whole year. Tax credits also replaced the child elements in means tested benefits, the Children's Tax Credit in the tax system, and disabled persons tax credit. In 2014 WTC and CTC combined distributed ¬£30 billion per year.  How it works  The basic operation of the tax credit is broken down into the following steps: # An individual makes an application for WTC to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). # HMRC calculates a provisional amount of tax credit to be awarded. It is based on the previous tax year's income and current circumstances. The tax credit is then paid in weekly or four weekly instalments to the claimant via bank account until the end of the tax year, 5 April. It is possible to ask HMRC to base their calculations on the estimated current year's income, but this does carry some risks.http://www.litrg.org.uk/help/lowincome/taxcredits/doingthesums.cfm # After the end of the tax year, HMRC send claimants forms (TC603R and TC603D commonly called renewal or declaration forms) asking them to confirm their actual income for the year just ended. For those who do not have actual income figures available, they must provide an estimate to HMRC, usually by 31 July and confirm this, usually by the following 31 January. # A final calculation of the WTC is made using the confirmed income. This final amount might be greater, equal to or lower than the provisional amount received the previous year. # If someone received more than the final WTC calculation, this is an over payment and must be repaid to HMRC. Similarly, if someone received less than the final WTC calculation, this is an underpayment in which case HMRC will make a lump sum payment back to that person.  Calculation of the annual award  The amount of the award is calculated from two separate amount as follows: :WTC award = Elements minus Withdrawal The component called Elements is based on circumstances whilst the Withdrawal component is income based. The following sections describe how each component is arrived at.  Elements  The Working Tax Credit (WTC) and the Child Tax Credit (CTC) are made up of \\"elements\\" related to individual circumstances. Examples of elements for an entire year are:Tax Credits rates and elements * a basic element of ¬£1,890 payable to everyone (in 2009/2010) * a couple and lone parent element (¬£1,860) * a 30 hour [working week] element (¬£775) * a mildly or moderately disabled worker element (¬£2,530) * a severely disabled worker element (¬£1,075) * a 50+ return-to-work payment (discontinued after April 2012). Each element that applies to a claimant's circumstances is added together to determine the maximum award of tax credit (before any withdrawal is considered). For example, a couple would have elements calculated as :Elements = ¬£1,890 + ¬£1,860 = ¬£3,750  Withdrawal  The withdrawal rate is the amount that is deducted from the Elements described above. If the gross annual income exceeds a predetermined first threshold of ¬£6,420 (in 2013/14) then the withdrawal rate is 41 percent. This means that for every ¬£1 earned above the threshold, 41p of the WTC entitlement is withdrawn. As withdrawal of tax credits is based on 'gross' rather than 'net' income, however, the claimant is also subject to Class 1 NIC national insurance contributions at 12 percent and UK income tax at 20 percent‚Äîmaking an effective marginal tax rate of 73 percent. For example, if one person in a couple earns ¬£10,000 pa, then the amount of withdrawal is :Withdrawal = 41% times (10,000 - 6,420) = ¬£1,467.80 Under withdrawal, entitlement to WTC is gradually reduced first until 'exhausted' at an income level that can be calculated from the first threshold and the basic award. For a couple, for instance, this would be: ¬£6,420, plus (¬£1,920 + ¬£1,970) divided by 41%. That is ¬£15,908 in rounded figures.  Amount of WTC  In this example, the award is then calculated as follows: :WTC = Elements - Withdrawal = ¬£3,750 - ¬£1,396.20 = ¬£2,353.80  Interaction with Child Tax Credit  WTC and CTC were designed to be a seamless allowance that steadily reduces as family income rises. If they are claimed together, both combine to form the basic award. This combined award is subject to withdrawal from the point at which WTC entitlement would have been zero (called the First threshold for those entitled to Child Tax Credit only). In 2009/10 this threshold was ¬£16,040. However, unlike WTC, CTC does not continue to reduce to zero. It reduces only until it reaches the \\"basic family element\\" of ¬£545pa. Thereafter it remains fixed until the household reaches a second income threshold (¬£50,000 in 2009/10). After that it reduces again at a rate of ¬£1 for every ¬£15 of income. Recipient households of combined WTC/CTC awards thus fell into three categories * those on a 'main-rate' reduction of 70% (i.e. marginal tax + 39%) receiving > ¬£545pa * those on an income of up to ¬£50,000 in receipt of the small flat rate family element (i.e. marginal tax only) receiving ¬£545pa * those with incomes between ¬£50,000 and ¬£58,170 (i.e. marginal tax + 6.67%) receiving ¬£545pa  Awards and disregards  WTC and CTC for the current tax year are considered to be an interim award because they are based on the previous tax year's gross household income. Final awards would need to be adjusted in subsequent years when the actual income is known. Since large fluctuations from year to year would be undesirable, broad allowance is made for this by disregarding the first ¬£2,500 of any increase in the final income from one year to the next. Only changes in excess of this income disregard are taken into account in establishing a final award. Overpayments are recovered by adjustment to the amount of the following years' interim award. Tax credits have not proved to be nearly as robust or well administered as the initial design envisaged. Claimants have not always recognised the need to report any change of circumstances immediately. The time taken by the system of administration to then take these into account adds to any overpayment generated and shortens the time available for their recovery. This led to significant levels of overpayments. In order to reduce the overpayment problem, the income disregard was raised tenfold from ¬£2,500 to ¬£25,000 with effect from 2006/07.  Assessment of income  Income for tax credit purposes is in principle assessed similarly to UK income tax. Thus 'income' (c/f 'taxable income') consists of what the individual receives from gross earned and unearned sources‚Äîless allowances for 'expenditures' that would reduce that income. But, unlike income tax, tax credits measure income based on family 'household', rather than the individuals within. Also the effect of income disregard ‚Äîto mask large annual increases in resources from reassessment‚Äî weakens comparisons with a true income tax still further. By comparison with other means tested benefits, the income treatment of claimants of tax credits is especially generous; it permits deduction of the full gross amount (rather than 50% net) of any individual pension contributions and any Gift aid payments. Since increases in income are subject to withdrawal at 39%(in the initial range), such reductions are effectively 'rebated' at the same rate through the tax credits received. Thus, while a pension (or Gift Aid) contribution of ¬£100 will cost the employee ¬£80 (after basic rate tax relief) directly from net pay, it attracts an additional ¬£39 in tax credits; so the true cost is only ¬£41. Other concessions with regard to assessment of income (in contrast to means testing used elsewhere) include: * disregarding the first ¬£300 of 'other' gross income (rent, interest or dividends etc.). * disregarding 'other' income derived from tax-free savings and investments * having no explicit (ineligibility) limit for capital resources (as only actual income derived from capital is taken into account) Level of take-up Around 7 million people in the UK were entitled to claim Working Tax Credit or the companion Child Tax Credit, although around 2 million people do not do so. The levels of Tax Credit take-up in the UK have not risen in recent years, despite an increase of 100,000 children living in households classed as \\"below the poverty line\\" between 2004 and 2005.official Treasury figures Implementation difficulties The introduction of the Working Tax Credit scheme was marred by implementation issues and large-scale overpayments. The Office of National Statistics estimated that of the ¬£13.5bn paid out in tax credits in 2004, ¬£1.9bn consisted of overpayments. In addition, computer problems led to delays in many receiving payments, causing significant financial hardship for those on low incomes, and resulting in EDS losing its contract to provide the Inland Revenue with computer services. These problems led to considerable political fallout. Dawn Primarolo, who as Paymaster General was the minister responsible for the implementation of tax credits, had to apologise to parliament and was asked whether she had \\"lost control\\" of her department. Prime Minister Tony Blair also apologised to Parliament over the incident. Criticism The Working Tax Credit scheme was subject to much criticism, particularly in the wake of the difficulties surrounding its implementation. Criticism focused on the way that credits are calculated on an annual basis, leading to overpayment, followed by large demands for repayment, which those on low income may find difficult to meet. David Harker, chief executive of Citizens Advice, commented \\"This is an untenable system. An annualised system doesn't provide the stability of income required by low income families.\\" In addition, the scheme was accused of being over-complicated and difficult for claimants to understand, and of underestimating the extent to which the incomes of low earners can fluctuate over a year, especially a problem for self-employed people whose income may fall below the minimum wage (at which point Working Tax Credit is disallowed). The Labour Party claimed that the tax credit system was effective in tackling child poverty, with, by their government's definitions, 2 million children lifted out of absolute poverty and almost 1 million out of relative poverty by 2007.Hain4Labour: Reconnect To Win: Rebuilding the progressive coalition: A new agenda for Labour‚Äôs future However, the subsequent Coalition government sought to redefine poverty so as to highlight \\"children living in workless households or those with drug- dependent parents\\", despite their tax credit incomes, remaining in poverty. Even with the previous definition, this government claimed that the existing tax credits system failed to \\"meet its statutory target to halve the problem by 2010 ‚Äì despite the huge amount of taxpayers‚Äô money spent on tackling it.\\" See also *Taxation in the United Kingdom *UK labour law *Earned income tax credit (1975) and New Jobs tax credit (1977) in the US ReferencesExternal links * *House of Commons Public Accounts Committee report into Tax Credits and Overpayment *Tax Credit Casualties *Tax Credits rates and elements *Working Tax Credit Category:Child welfare in the United Kingdom Category:Social security in the United Kingdom Category:Tax credits Category:Taxation in the United Kingdom ","title":"Working Tax Credit"},{"id":"3575828","text":"Basic geological regions of Australia, by age. The geology of Australia includes virtually all known rock types and from all geological time periods spanning over 3.8 billion years of the Earth's history. Australia is a continent situated on the Indo-Australian Plate. Components Australia's geology can be divided into several main sections: the Archaean cratonic shields, Proterozoic fold belts and sedimentary basins, Phanerozoic sedimentary basins, and Phanerozoic metamorphic and igneous rocks. Australia as a separate continent began to form after the breakup of Gondwana in the Permian, with the separation of the continental landmass from the African continent and Indian subcontinent. Australia rifted from Antarctica in the Cretaceous. The current Australian continental mass is composed of a thick subcontinental lithosphere, over 200 km thick in the western two-thirds and 100 km thick in the younger eastern third. The Australian continental crust, excluding the thinned margins, has an average thickness of 38 km, with a range in thickness from 24 km to 59 km.http://rses.anu.edu.au/~brian/PDF- reprints/2012/SN-chapter-2.pdf The continental crust is composed primarily of Archaean, Proterozoic and some Palaeozoic granites and gneisses. A thin veneer of mainly Phanerozoic sedimentary basins cover much of the Australian landmass (these are up to 7 km thick). These in turn are currently undergoing erosion by a combination of aeolian and fluvial processes, forming extensive sand dune systems, deep and prolonged development of laterite and saprolite profiles, and development of playa lakes, salt lakes and ephemeral drainage. Blocks The main continental blocks of the Australian continent are; * The Yilgarn Craton, of Archaean age * The Pilbara Craton of Archaean to Proterozoic age * The Gawler Craton and Willyama Block, of Archaean to Proterozoic age. These are in turn flanked by several Proterozoic orogenic belts and sedimentary basins, notably the * Musgrave Block of granulite gneiss and igneous rocks * The Arunta Block of amphibolite grade metamorphic rocks and granites * The Gascoyne Complex, Glengarry Basin, and Bangemall Basin sandwiched between the Yilgarn and Arunta Blocks Geologic history The geologic history of the Australian continental mass is extremely prolonged and involved, continuing from the Archaean to the recent. In a gross pattern, continental Australia grew from west to east, with Archean rocks mostly in the west, Proterozoic rocks in the centre, and Phanerozoic rocks in the east. Recent geologic events are confined to intraplate earthquakes, as the continent of Australia sits distant from the plate boundary. The Australian continent evolved in five broad but distinct time periods, namely: 3800‚Äì2100 Ma, 2100‚Äì1300 Ma, 1300‚Äì600 Ma, 600‚Äì160 Ma and 160 Ma to the present. The first period saw the growth of nuclei about which cratonic elements grew, whereas the latter four periods involved the amalgamation and dispersal of Nuna, Rodinia and Pangea, respectively. Tectonic setting The Australian landmass has been part of all major supercontinents, but its association with Gondwana is especially notable as important correlations have been made geologically with the African continental mass and Antarctica. Australia separated from Antarctica over a prolonged period beginning in the Permian and continuing through to the Cretaceous (84 Ma). Seismicity map of Australia, USGS. Continental Australia is unique among the continents in that the measured stress field is not parallel to the present-day north-northeast directed plate motion. Most of the stress state in continental Australia is controlled by compression originating from the three main collision boundaries located in New Zealand, Indonesia and New Guinea, and the Himalaya (transmitted through the Indian and Capricorn plates). South of latitude ‚àí30¬∞, the stress trajectories are oriented east‚Äìwest to northwest‚Äìsoutheast. North of this latitude, the stress trajectories are closer to the present day plate motion, being oriented east- northeast‚Äìwest-southwest to northeast‚Äìsouthwest. Notably, the main stress trajectories diverge most markedly from one another in north‚Äìcentral New South Wales (east-southeast to north-northeast), although the area is not known historically for earthquake activity. Young mountain building (< 5 Ma) in the Flinders Ranges of South Australia is driven from plate convergence at the boundary in New Zealand. Australia is currently moving toward Eurasia at the rate of 6‚Äì7 centimetres a year. Archaean There are three main cratonic shields of recognised Archaean age within the Australian landmass: The Yilgarn, the Pilbara and the Gawler cratons. Several other Archaean- Proterozoic orogenic belts exist, usually sandwiched around the edges of these major cratonic shields. The history of the Archaean cratons is extremely complex and protracted. The cratons appear to have been assembled to form the greater Australian landmass in the late Archaean to mesoProterozoic, (~2400 Ma to 1,600 Ma). Chiefly the Capricorn Orogeny is partly responsible for the assembly of the West Australian landmass by joining the Yilgarn and Pilbara cratons. The Capricorn Orogeny is exposed in the rocks of the Bangemall Basin, Gascoyne Complex granite-gneisses and the Glengarry, Yerrida and Padbury basins. Unknown Proterozoic orogenic belts, possibly similar to the Albany Complex in southern Western Australia and the Musgrave Block, represent the Proterozoic link between the Yilgarn and Gawler cratons, covered by the Proterozoic-Palaeozoic Officer and Amadeus basins. See also: * Narryer Gneiss Terrane Palaeoproterozoic Western Australian Events The assembly of the Archaean Yilgarn and Pilbara cratons of Australia was initiated at ~2200 Ma during the first phases of the Capricorn orogen. The last stages of the 2770‚Äì2300 Ma Hamersley Basin on the southern margin of the Pilbara Craton are Palaeoproterozoic and record the last stable submarine-fluviatile environments between the two cratons prior to the rifting, contraction and assembly of the intracratonic ~1800 Ma Ashburton and Blair basins, the 1600‚Äì1070 Ma Edmund and Collier basins, the 1840‚Äì1620 Ma northern Gascoyne Complex, the 2000‚Äì1780 Ma Glenburgh Terrane in the southern Gascoyne Complex and the Errabiddy Shear Zone at the northwestern margin of the Yilgarn Craton. Between approximately 2000‚Äì1800 Ma, on the northern margin of the Yilgarn Craton, the c. 1890 Ma Narracoota Volcanics of the Bryah Basin formed in a transverse back-arc rift sag basin during collision. Culmination of the cratonic collision resulted in the foreland sedimentary Padbury Basin. To the east the Yerrida and Eerarheedy Basins were passive margins along the Yilgarn's northern margin. The c. 1830 Ma phase of the Capricorn Orogeny in this section of the Pilbara-Yilgarn boundary resulted in deformation of the Bryah-Padbury Basin and the western fringe of the Yerrida Basin, along with flood basalts. The Yapungku Orogeny (~1790 Ma) formed the Stanley Fold Belt on the northern margin of the Eerarheedy Basin, via assembly of the Archaean-Proterozoic fold belts of Northern Australia. East Australian Events The Palaeoproterozoic in southeastern Australia is represented by the polydeformed high-grade gneiss terranes of the Willyama Supergroup, Olary Block and Broken Hill Block, in South Australia and New South Wales. The Palaeoproterozoic in the north of Australia is represented mostly by the Mount Isa Block and complex fold-thrust belts. These rocks, aside from suffering intense deformation, record a period of widespread platform cover sedimentation, ensialic rift-sag sedimentation including widespread dolomite platform cover, and extensive phosphorite deposition in the deeper sea beds. Mesoproterozoic The oldest rocks in Tasmania formed in the Mesoproterozoic on King Island and in the Tyennan Block. Late Mesoproterozoic igneous events include: * the Giles Complex mafic- ultramafic intrusions in the Musgrave Block at ~1080 Ma * widespread sills in the Bangemall Basin and the Glenayle area at ~1080 Ma * The Warukurna Large Igneous Province of ~1080 Ma Neoproterozoic Widespread deposition occurred in the Centralian Superbasin and Adelaide Geosyncline (Adelaide Rift Complex) during the Neoproterozoic. The Petermann Orogeny caused extensive uplift, mountain building and basin fragmentation in central Australia at the close of the Neoproterozoic. Paleozoic=Cambrian The Stavely Zone in Victoria is a boninite to MORB basalt terrane considered to have been connected with the boninites the Mount Read Volcanics of Northern Tasmania. In New South Wales, extensive deepwater sedimentation formed the Adaminaby Beds in Victoria and New South Wales. The Lachlan Fold Belt ophiolite sequences are considered to be of Cambrian age, and are obducted during the Lachlan Orogen. The Petermann Orogeny in Central Australia, which started at the end of the Neoproterozoic, continued into the Cambrian, shedding a thick intracontinental sequence of fluvial sediments into the central Australian landmass. Marginal platforms and passive margin basins existed in South Australia ‚Äì ‚Äì formed in the foreland of the Delamerian Orogeny. Western Australian passive margin basins and platform cover begin at this stage. The extensive Antrim Plateau flood basalts, covering in excess of 12,000 square kilometres, erupt in the Cambrian of Western Australia, providing a useful chronostratigraphic marker. * Stansbury basin * Gascoyne Sub-basin ‚Äì begins Cambrian, through to Tertiary * Bonaparte Gulf Basin Ordovician Ordovician geological events in Australia involved Alpinotype orogeny in the Lachlan Fold Belt, resulting in the great serpentinite belts of western New South Wales, and accretion of deepwater molasse and flysch exemplified by the slate belts of Victoria and eastern New South Wales. Victoria ‚Äì 490‚Äì440 Ma The late Cambrian to early Ordovician saw deepwater sedimentation of the St Arnaud and Castlemaine Group turbidites, which are now emplaced in the Stawell and Bendigo Zones. The middle Ordovician saw the deposition of the Sunbury Group in the Melbourne Zone, Bendoc Group and formation of the Molong Arc, a calc-alkaline volcanic arc which is related to the Kiandra Group turbidites. Ordovician orogenies include the Lachlan Orogeny. Silurian During the Silurian Period most of the Australian continent in the west and centre was dry land. However, from Geraldton north to Exmouth Gulf along the far Western Australian coast a fluvial sediment basin existed. Near Kalbarri on the Murchison River the footprints of a giant water scorpion were found on land, the first animal to walk on the Australian continent. A gulf linked to the sea existed under what is now the Great Sandy Desert. Meanwhile, in the east there were volcanic arcs in New England, also west of Townsville and Cairns, and in NSW and Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory. Deep water sediments formed in the Cowra, Tumut and Hillend Troughs. The Yass Molong rise was a row of volcanoes. Granite intrusions formed in New South Wales and Victoria from 435 to 425 Mya, with the Bega batholith as young as 400 Mya. In NSW granites the distinction between I-type and S-type granites was discovered.David Johnson: Geology of Australia Cambridge University Press, 2004 Devonian During the Devonian Period conditions were warm in Australia. There was a large bay in the great Sandy Desert with reefs. The Calliope Arc went from the north of Rockhampton south to Grafton. Most of the centre and west of Australia was land mass. There were volcanic mountains off the current east coast supplying sediment into a basin on parts of the east. The basin contained limestone and river deposited sand. Andesite and Rhyolite volcanoes were found in central NSW, the Snowy Mountains, Eden, New England and near Clermont, Queensland. Baragwanathia longifolia was the first Australian land plant appearing at this time. The Tabberabberan Orogeny compressed the eastern seaboard in an east‚Äìwest direction, with Tasmania, Victoria and southern New South Wales folded 385 ‚Äì 380 Mya. Northern NSW and Queensland was compressed 377 to 352 Mya. A major river drained the continental interior and passed eastwards at Parkes. The Bungle Bungle Range sandstone was formed in Western Australia from river sands. More Granite was intruded in the Devonian. The Connors Arc and Baldwin arc formed behind Mackay and Western New England. Carboniferous The Carboniferous Period saw the Eastern Highlands of Australia form as a result of its collision with what are now parts of South America (e.g. the Sierra de Cordoba) and New Zealand. At the time they were formed they are believed to have been as high as any mountains on the planet today, but they have been almost completely eroded in the 280 million years since. Another notable feature of Carboniferous Australia was a major ice age which left over half of the continent glaciated. Evidence for the cold conditions can be seen not only in glacial features dating from this period but also in fossil Gelisols from as far north as the Hunter River basin. Mesozoic=Permo-Triassic The Permian to Triassic in Australia is dominated by subduction zones on the eastern margin of the landmass, part of the Hunter-Bowen Orogeny. This was a major arc-accretion, subduction and back- arc sedimentary basin forming event which persisted episodically from approximately late Carboniferous in its initial stages, through the Permian and terminated in the Middle Triassic at around 229Ma to 225Ma. In Western and Central Australia the then-extensive central Australian mountain ranges such as the Petermann Ranges were eroded by the Permian glacial event, resulting in thick marine to fluvial glacial tillite and fossiliferous limestone deposits and extensive platform cover. Rifting of Australia from India and Africa began in the Permian, resulting in the production of a rift basin and half-grabens of the basal portions of the long-lived Perth Basin. Petroleum was formed in the Swan Coastal Plain and Pilbara during this rifting, presumably in a rift valley lake where the bottom was deoxygenated (akin to Africa's Lake Tanganyika today) See also: * Perth Basin * Bowen Basin * Gunnedah basin * Sydney basin and Geography of Sydney * Ipswich basin/Clarence Moreton Basin Jurassic In the west of Australia the Jurassic was a tropical savannah to jungle environment, shown by advanced tropical weathering preserved in the regolith of the Yilgarn craton which is still preserved today. Australia began rifting away from Antarctica in the Jurassic, which formed the Gippsland, Bass and Otway Basins in Victoria and the offshore shelf basins of South Australia and Western Australia, all of which host significant oil and gas deposits. Jurassic coal-bearing basins were formed in north central Queensland, with significant marine platform cover extending across most of central Australia. Continued passive-margin subsidence and marine transgressions in the Perth Basin of Western Australia continued, with the Jurassic Cattamarra Coal Measures a notable fluvial terrigenous formation of the Jurassic. See also * Surat Basin * Perth Basin Cretaceous The initial rifting of Australia and Antarctica in the Jurassic continued through the Cretaceous, with offshore development of a mid ocean ridge seafloor spreading centre. Tasmania was rifted off during this stage. Cretaceous volcanism in the offshore of Queensland was related to a minor episode of arc formation, typified by the Whitsunday Islands, followed by development of offshore coral platforms, passive margin basins and far-field volcanism throughout the quiet Hunter- Bowen orogenic belt. Cretaceous sedimentation continued in the Surat Basin. Some small Cretaceous volcanism was present at the edges of basement highs in the Great Artesian Basin, resulting in some sparse volcanic plugs today. Cretaceous sedimentation continued in the Perth Basin. Palaeocene to Recent=Tertiary The Tertiary saw the majority of Australian tectonism cease. Sparse examples of intraplate volcanism exist, for instance the Glasshouse Mountains in Queensland, which are Tertiary examples of a chain of small volcanic plugs which decrease in age to the south, where they result in ~10,000-year-old maar volcanoes and basalts of the Newer Volcanics in South Australia and Victoria.

Biography Russell was born at Frederick, Maryland on 4 July 1827 to Sir James Henry Russell and Martha Wilson Russell. He was appointed midshipman on 10 September 1841 and served in the sloop of war in the Pacific until 1843. He returned in the frigate in 1844 and served in in the Gulf of Mexico from 1844 to 1846. He participated in operations at Galveston, Corpus Christi, Brazos, Resaca, and Vera Cruz. After duty in in 1847, he graduated at the United States Naval Academy in 1848. Briefly assigned to Coast Survey duty, he made a cruise to Brazil in 1849, then served on the New York-West Indies mail line from 1853 to 1856, and served as navigator in during explorations of the North Pacific and Arctic Oceans. Assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron at the end of the decade, he returned to the United States and ordnance duty at the Washington Navy Yard just prior to the outbreak of the American Civil War. In April 1861, he assisted in preventing ships at Norfolk from falling to the enemy; and, in September, he led a boat expedition into Pensacola Harbor to destroy the Confederate privateer Judah. He next assumed command of the gunboat and participated in operations on the Mississippi River up to Vicksburg and served in the blockade of Mobile. Commanding in 1863, he returned to ordnance duty at Washington in 1864 and to the Pacific Squadron to serve as commanding officer of Cyane in 1864‚Äì65. Various duties, afloat and ashore, on both coasts, Atlantic and Pacific, followed, and he completed his last assignment, three years as Commandant of the Mare Island Navy Yard, in 1886. Appointed rear admiral on 4 March 1886, he retired on 27 August, and resided in Washington, D.C. until his death on 1 April 1897. Family Admiral Russell's son, Major General John H.

The main character is a young would-be idol singer and high school student, Maron Namikaze, who has superhuman strength. She battles a mecha organization, Demon Seed, which has been terrorizing Tokyo. The manga was adapted into a 2 episode anime OVA in 1989. The series is a parody of Japanese pop culture. Three CDs were released: a single on September 20, 1989, an image soundtrack on October 25, 1989, and a concert CD March 5, 1990. Plot In near-future Tokyo, a group called the Demon Seed has been antagonizing the city with its thefts and giant robotic Power Suits. After various failed attempts against the Demon Seed, the Special Operations Anti-Demon Seed Team (five men in a downtown office) begins to look for an idol to pilot a robotic suit against the Demon Seed. A talent show is held; and after a particularly dull line-up of contestants, the extremely strong Maron Namikaze is discovered. She is fitted with a metal costume and sent to take the Demon Seed down, all the while having an idol singer career forced upon her. Characters *Maron Namikaze: The 13-year-old protagonist. She is very timid and nervous, but has been gifted with immense natural strength. Maron is trained to become a J-Pop idol and becomes popular enough to be entered for the Newcomer's Award in the music awards. For the American DVD release, Maron was claimed to be a high school senior, even in the subtitles. . *Chief Hattori: The leader of the Special Operations team, later Maron's manager and coach. He wrote and submitted the Idol Project plans when he was drunk, and later to his chagrin, it was approved. Hattori was slightly modelled after Masami Yuki's editor at the time. . *Dr. Ryouhei Shimokobe: The dwarf-sized researcher whom created Maron's costume. Before he knew the idol was a girl, he created a Patlabor-esque robot, which he later gave to the Demon Seed. He is very arrogant and proud of his work, soon becoming disgusted when Maron is converted into a singer instead of a fighter. . *Professor Kyozaburo Demon: The leader of the Demon Seed. Very confident with his work, he believes the group can spend as much money as they want, thinking they can get more at any time. However, he runs out of money to fix the Power Suits after Maron's first interference, and takes the Demon Seed into hiding for a few months. . *Kagiri Sonoba: An idol singer known for her provocative costumes. She gets into a one-sided rivalry with Maron after both girls turn out to be competing for the Newcomer's Award. Music The opening theme, , had lyrics by and was composed by Ky≈çko Matsumiya, was arranged by Kohei Tanaka, and had vocals by Hiroko Kasahara, the voice actor for Maron. The first ending theme, , had lyrics and vocals by Kasahara, was composed by Matsumiya, and was arranged by Tanaka. The second ending theme, , had lyrics by and was composed by Matsumiyam was arranged by Tanaka, and had vocals by Kasahara.

It was produced by Star Bonifacio Echeverria, S.A. in Spain. Although its external appearance resembles the classic M1911, its design is different in several respects. For example, the Star does not have the 1911's grip safety. In addition, the thumb safety on the Star BM blocks the hammer, whereas it blocks the motion of the sear on a 1911 and the Star's trigger pivots on a roll pin rather than moving straight back like a 1911A1's trigger to trip the sear. The pistol is fed by an 8-round detachable box magazine.  History  An unloaded Star BM A total of 217,682 Star BM pistols were made between 1972 and 1992. BM serial numbers ranged from 1,226,501 to somewhere around 1,982,884. The pistols were made without mechanical variation throughout that period, but there may be a lot of different cosmetic variations depending on agency issue and commercial sales. In general, earlier pieces were more highly polished and later ones were more of a matte finish. After serial number 1,560,901 in 1981, all BM pistols were fitted with a ramped and serrated front sight. At approximately this same serial number a few other shortcuts were used to expedite production ‚Äì a shorter rollmark/slide legend, coarser polish limited to side of the slide and frame, and all the small parts were given a bead blast matte finish. The slide cocking serrations are also reduced in number on these later pistols. There have been at least four importers of ex-Spanish BMs to the United States: Garcia Sporting Arms, Interarms, PW Arms, and Century International Arms. Most imports in the US are arms that were traded in by various Spanish military branches to Star for exchange for newer model 28/30M and 28/30PK pistols. For the Interarms imports, Star reworked all these trade-ins prior to selling them to Interarms. Spain's Guardia Civil used BM's up through about 1990 or so as did many other police agencies in Europe and Latin America. Importers like Interarms got a hold of them when the agencies traded up to more modern designs. The US-based gunsmith Timothy F. La France, the principal of LaFrance Specialties (formerly of San Diego, California) used the Star BM pistol as a basis to manufacture a sub-compact custom pistol called the NOVA 6-Pack, basically a Star BM shortened to pocket-size; the NOVA 6-Pack was manufactured only under custom order in a very small number of samples, and was, at one time, the smallest 9mm handgun in the world. In the motion-picture industry, particularly in the filming of war movies, a Star Model B pistol would often substitute for a Colt 1911, since the former works more reliably with blank ammunition, and the two appear quite similar from a distance. A handful of star BM variants were created, including the BKS and BKM. Mechanically they were identical, with the only difference being a frame made out of alloy rather than steel.http://star-firearms.com/firearms/guns/b/ Users : Used by the South African National Defence Force.http://www.army.mil.za/equipment/weaponsystems/infantry/9mm_STAR_Pistol.htm *: Was in service with Guardia Civil until it was replaced with the Beretta 92.

History=First Era: 1911‚Äì1920 March of Plastuny, 1914 Plast was founded in Lviv (Lw√≥w, Lemberg), Austro-Hungarian Galicia in 1911 as the Ukrainian Scout Organization. Ukrainian Scouting has been known since its inception as \\"Plast\\". In Ukrainian a plastun is an historical name for a Cossack scout and sentry serviceman. The founder of Ukrainian Scouting, Dr. Oleksander Tysovsky, affectionately known as \\"Drot,\\" adapted the universal Scout principles to the needs and interests of Ukrainian youth. Born during great social and political upheavals in Europe, Ukrainian Plast came into being to fulfill specific national aims, unlike other Scout organizations. The first Scout troops were formed in Lviv in 1911 by Petro Franko and Ivan Chmola. Plast is generally deemed to have been officially founded by Dr. Oleksander Tysovsky on 12 April 1912, at the Lviv Academic Gymnasium. Scouting spread rapidly to the other cities and towns, and by 1913 the first Supreme Scout Council had been formed and the first handbook published. The same year, the Orhanizatsiyniy Plast Komitet was formed in Lviv by Plast groups from different regions, and the first hiking camp was organized. By 1916, its membership exceeded 10,000, and it was a fully developed and functioning organization, consisting of separate branches of Boy Scouts and Girl Guides. Ukrainian Plast held regular camps for Cubs, Scouts and Rovers, training courses for leaders, and produced a variety of Scout publications, including a Ukrainian translation of Scouting for Boys. Plastuny on the mountain Chornohora, 1914 Shortly after its founding, World War I brought about the collapse of the two powers occupying ethnic Ukrainian territory, Austria-Hungary and the Russian Empire, and the formation of the Ukrainian National Republic in 1918. The subsequent years witnessed a great upswing in Scouting, as it spread into the towns and communities where it had been previously unknown, mainly in the newly freed central provinces of Ukraine. Hundreds, if not thousands, of boys, inspired by the ideals of service to God and Country which Scouting engenders, volunteered to join the armed forces, fighting on several fronts, and many gave their lives. Second Era: 1920‚Äì1930 The Soviet victory in the civil war in 1922 led to an immediate abolition of all non-communist scout activities in this region. In the Romanian area of Bukovina, the development of Plast was likewise hampered. Ukrainian Scouting was among the first to suffer what later became the fate of many Scout Associations throughout the world. In areas later to become western Ukraine, which included parts of Czechoslovakia and Poland, the Scout movement emerged from the ruins of war with renewed vitality. During this period, Ukrainian Scouting first requested international recognition, but was denied on political grounds. In spite of numerous obstacles, Plast developed rapidly in the Polish areas, with high levels of membership among students, farmers and workers. A key sponsor was Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky, the Archbishop of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church (1901‚Äì1944), who donated a campsite called \\"Sokil\\" in the Carpathian Mountains. A number of publications are introduced, including the official organ Molode Zhyttia and Dr. Oleksander Tysovsky's seminal handbook, Zhyttia v Plasti. In the late 1920s, external pressure on the part of the Polish authorities seriously impaired further growth of Plast on its territory, and eventually led to an outright abolition of Ukrainian Scouting in 1928 in the Volyn region, and in Halychyna in 1930. However, Plast continued to flourish in Carpathian Ruthenia, the ethnic Ukrainian area within Czechoslovakia, and maintained a close liaison with the underground Scout units in parts of central Ukraine under the Soviet Union until World War II and Western Ukraine under Poland. The Plast groups in Carpathian Ruthenia and Prague were members of the Union of Junak Scouts and Guides of the Republic of Czechoslovakia and through this federation of the two World organizations. A headquarters was opened in Prague. Ukrainian Scouts took part in the World Jamboree at Arrowe Park in 1929, and as part of the Czechoslovak contingent in the fourth World Jamboree at G√∂d√∂ll≈ë in 1933, attempting to make the World Scouting aware of the suppression of free Scout activities in Ukraine. Third Era: 1930-1944 In Western Ukraine, Plast, though banned, continued to operate illegally and conspirationally under the auspices of the Plast Center. Plast activities continued to be undertaken, via the Commission of Educational Campsites, the \\"Ridna Shkola\\" and published in the journal Vohni. The Polish leadership pursued this activity and punished such activities with arrests and internment. By 1939, World War II broke out and membership in Plast saw a resurgence in western Ukraine, although the occupying German forces again banned Plast, yet activity continued. As in the previous war, many plastuny took up arms in various armies that traversed western and eastern Ukraine during the war. During the years under Communism and the Soviet Union, Scouting was banned in Ukraine, but the Plast organization continued to exist in exile around the world. Fourth Era: 1945‚Äì1950 Ukrainian Plast Rally badge. The activity was held in Mittenwald on 5‚Äì7 July 1947. Ukrainian Scouting was hampered by World War II, but Plast managed to survive the war and began to flourish again in the displaced persons camps under the occupation of the Western Powers. The successful commemoration of the 35th Anniversary of the Movement in 1947 was the highlight of Plast activities at that time. Multiple groups of plastuny met at the Holovna Plastova Rada in Munich. Ukrainian Scouting became a member of the Displaced Persons Division of the Boy Scouts International Bureau. A delegation of over 40 Scouts and Scouters participated in the sixth World Scout Jamboree at Moisson in 1947 and a smaller group in the seventh World Jamboree at Bad Ischl in 1951. After the mass resettlement of Ukrainians between 1948 and 1950, Plast was reorganized and branches permanently established in a number of western countries with large Ukrainian communities, such as the United States, Canada, Australia, France, Austria, the United Kingdom, Germany and Argentina, where it continues to flourish and expand. Fifth Era: 1950‚Äì1989 Ukrainian Scouting was represented at the ninth World Scout Jamboree at Sutton Coldfield in 1957, at the second and third World Scout Indabas and at the tenth World Scout Jamboree at Makiling Park in 1959. Ukrainian Scouters delegated by the Executive Council participated as observers in the sixteenth and seventeenth International Conferences in 1957 and 1959, respectively. In 1957, Plast celebrated its 45th Anniversary with a national camp in their training and camping centre Plastova Sich in Canada. Oleksander Tysovsky took part in this camp. In the summer of 1962, Ukrainian Scouting celebrated its 50th Anniversary with a National Jamboree on its own permanent campsite (\\"Vovcha Tropa\\") at East Chatham, New York, in which over 2,000 members, as well as Scouts of other national associations participated. Subsequent anniversaries were celebrated in 1967 at Batyrin, South Bolton, Quebec, and participants performed at Expo67 honoring the Canadian Centennial, and 1972 (again in East Chatham, New York), 1978 (Alberta, Canada) and every five years thereafter. In 1976 Plast were among the founder members of the Associated International Scout and Guide Organizations in 1976. An umbrella organization for Scouts-in-Exile. The location of Plast's global headquarters would vary based on the leadership elected at each Holovna Plastova Rada, although the centers of administration tended to be New York City and Toronto, Canada. Plast was quite active in publishing, with the key publications: * Hotuis (for novaky or New Scouts) * Yunak (for yunaky or Scouts) * Plastoviy Shliakj (for starshi plastuny and seniory, that is Older Scouts and Senior Scouts). * Vohon' Orlynoyi Rady (for leaders and counselors to novaky) * V dorohu z Yunatstvom (for leaders and counselors to yunaky) * Av-u and Tam-Tam (for members of the Siromantsi fraternity) * OX Kvartal'nyk (for members of the Orden Khrestonostsiv fraternity) And numerous local, regional and fraternal bulletins, publications, journals and handbooks, many of which were published by Plast Publishing. In addition to creating over a dozen campsites, Plast members built or acquired over 30 facilities or domivky where they could hold activities, generally on a weekly basis. Several stores, including Molode Zhyttia in New York City, provided uniforms, emblems, publications and other goods. Several foundations and organizations provided and continue to provide support. Sixth Era: 1990 to present Ukrainian \\"plastunka\\" When the Soviet Union began to crumble, Scouting appeared clandestinely. The first Plast camp was organized in the summer of 1989 and was raided by the Soviet secret police (KGB); several Scouts were beaten and arrested. Nevertheless, Scouting and Plast persisted. Members of the Plast at a reunion at the \\"Monument of the Ukrainian National Army\\" at (Lychakivskiy Cemetery), in Lviv April 2008. Since the end of Soviet communism and the birth of an independent Ukraine in 1991, Ukrainian Plast Scouting has been growing rapidly in every corner of the country. This included units in Kyiv, Lutsk and Donetsk. The most active region, however, was in Lviv, where on 22 February 1990, the town council enacted the Statut Plastovoho Tovarystva. Plast-in-Exile supported the restart of Plast in Ukraine. At the beginning of 1995, there were 85 local groups and councils, with over 3,500 Scouts. In August 1997, Plast Ukrainian Scouting celebrated the 85th anniversary since the first Scouting units appeared in Ukraine in 1911, with a Plast Jamboree at the renamed Sokil Plast Museum-Camp, attended by 700 Scouts from 34 units throughout Ukraine. Highlights of this Jamboree included the inauguration the third Nachalniy Plastun (Chief Scout) in Plast's history, and the first ever inaugurated in Ukraine, Dr. Lubomyr Romankiw on 10 August 1997; the opening of the Museum at this historic campsite, donated by Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky, which had been used by Plast from 1924 to 1944; and the attendance of several Scouts from the First Era of Ukrainian Scouting, including the 93-year-old composer Mykola Kolessa. In addition, other Scouting groups have been spontaneously appearing, mostly in the eastern and southern parts of Ukraine. Most of them participated, together with Plast, in the Ukrainian delegation to the 18th World Scout Jamboree in the Netherlands in 1995, as well as the First All- Ukrainian Scout Jamboree in Nevytske, and the Second Slavic Jamboree in Prague, Czech Republic. 33 Ukrainian Scouts were invited to take part in the 19th World Scout Jamboree in 1999. Plast Publishing largely moved back to Ukraine, with financial and editorial support from international units, and publishes a magazine for both younger Scouts, Hotuys (Be Prepared), and for older Scouts Yunak. As with all Plast publications, these monthly publications are written in Ukrainian. They are also distributed internationally. Ukrainian guide (plastunka) from Plast with the Peace Light of Bethlehem, a program inaugurated in 1989, on the Ukrainian-Polish border. Started in 1986 in Austria as part of a charitable relief mission for handicapped children and people in need, it has gone to more than 20 countries in Europe, as well as North America. As of 2006, Plast has over 10,000 members in Ukraine, and an additional 3,000 members in other countries. Plastuny are cleaning up the territory during the Second Ukrainian Scout Jamboree, 2009 The 95th anniversary jubilee (, YUMPZ) occurred in August 2007, with a Zustrich at the Plastova Sich campsite in Grafton, Ontario, Canada. Over 1200 yunaky attended the camp, from 4 to 19 August. Tabir Pryhilniky was at Camp Baturyn, just outside Montreal, Quebec. Tabir Uchasnyky was held in Algonquin Provincial Park, in central Ontario. Tabir Rosviduvachi was held in Samuel de Champlain Park, also in Ontario. Tabir Skobiv and Virlits was in Killarney Park, on Lake Huron, in western Ontario. WOSM recognition Plast is working with the various other Ukrainian Scouting organizations to develop a national Scouting federation and to achieve recognition by the World Organization of the Scout Movement. All duties in Ukrainian Scouting, from local to the National Council levels, are performed by a combination volunteer workers and paid professionals. In 2004, the Ukrainian Scout Youth Public Organization Spilka Pionerskykh Orhanizatzii Ky√Øva (literally Kyiv Pioneer Movement Organization or SPOK, with a membership of 3,750 in 18 of 26 Ukrainian oblasts) applied for WOSM membership. In January 2005, this motion was recommended by the World Scout Bureau. Since more than 5% of the National Scouting Organizations voted against the application, Germany and the Boy Scouts of America among the opposing votes, SPOK was not admitted to WOSM and withdrew the application. As a result of this, a special mission of the World Scout Committee was sent to Ukraine. Ukrainian Scouting endeavored to set up a new Scouting body unifying Plast and SPOK to satisfy WOSM requirements, to be worked out by 2008, as all parties were motivated to join the international community. Following the recommendations of Resolution 2/05 adopted by the 37th World Scout Conference in Tunisia, the constitutive congress of the National Organization of Scouts of Ukraine (NOSU) was held on 27 March 2007. The congress, which gathered Scout representatives from most regions of Ukraine, approved the Constitution of NOSU and elected its governing bodies. This event was made possible thanks to efforts of three Scout associations (Plast, SPOK and Sich) to work towards unification of Scouting in Ukraine in a new single National Scout Organization so as to be able to join WOSM. The Constitution of NOSU was officially registered by the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine in November 2007, thus confirming the creation of a single National Scout Organization in Ukraine. An amended version of this Constitution was received on 4 February 2008 and formally approved by the Constitutions Committee and the World Scout Committee. WOSM Acting Secretary General Luc Panissod visited NOSU in mid- March 2008. He had the opportunity to meet and talk with various groups of young people (candidates to join, patrol leaders, summer camp young leaders) and adult leaders responsible of local Scout groups. He also met with the Deputy Minister of Family, Youth and Sports, one of the founding members of one of the Scout associations, who confirmed full support of the authorities to NOSU. He also had several working sessions with leaders of NOSU to assess the level of development of the organization. The organization has a loaned headquarters and several campsites. Elements of a progressive scheme include merit badges, which are illustrated in their handbook and are obtained on a progressive basis. At present, NOSU is a small organization and has only one professional staff regularly employed in application of existing legislation. Being a new organization, NOSU still has to develop an efficient working organization. NOSU membership is open to girls and boys, women and men, in three age sections: Cubs (6‚Äì10), Scouts (11‚Äì16) and Rovers (16‚Äì24). As of 31 December 2007, NOSU comprised 2,475 members including 718 female youth members, 1,546 male youth members, plus some 200 adult leaders and Council members. NOSU membership is made approximately of 40% from Plast, 40% from SPOK and 20% from Sich. The same percentages are reflected at the National Council level. While double membership still exists (one can be member of NOSU and member of one of the three above associations), direct membership for new members is strongly encouraged. It is the objective of NOSU's leadership that NOSU will be successful enough to attract more members from the three associations who are not yet members of NOSU. Further unification of Scouting through integration of other Scout groups in Ukraine is envisaged through the chartering system. The Chairman of the National Council is Lev Zakharchishin, the Deputy Chairman of the National Council is Valeriy Tantsiura and the International Commissioner is Andriy Chesnokov. In becoming a member of WOSM, NOSU will become, as it so desires, a member of the Eurasia Scout Region. Outside of Ukraine After World War II, a number of independent Plast Ukrainian Scouting organizations were founded in the West by Ukrainians from Western Ukraine (which was under Polish rule until 1939). This era of Plast began in Germany and Austria in 1945 in various Displaced Persons Camps, and as various members of Plast eventually ended up in Canada, the United States, the UK, Australia and elsewhere, various √©migr√© organizations were founded between 1946 and 1951. Until the fall of the Soviet Union, these represented the totality of Plast organizations, and were aligned to a supranational organization called KUPO (Conference of Ukrainian Plast Organizations), which convened every four years and elected an operational \\"Holovna Plastova Starshyna\\" (HPB) and a board called \\"Holovna Plastova Rada\\" (HPR), and would also name the head Plastun (\\"Nachalniy Plastun\\"), typically a long-term or lifetime, and somewhat ceremonial position. The current, and third, \\"Nachalniy Plastun\\" is US-based (originally from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada) Dr. Lubomyr Romankiw, his predecessor was US-based Dr. Yuriy Starosols'kiy, who succeeded Severyn Levytsky (\\"Siriy Lev\\"), who was inaugurated in post-World War II Germany.

(CALEA) is a credentialing authority (accreditation), based in the United States, whose primary mission is to accredit public safety agencies, namely law enforcement agencies, training academies, communications centers, and campus public safety agencies. Creation The Commission was created in 1979 as an independent accrediting authority by the four major law enforcement membership associations: *International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) *National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives (NOBLE) *National Sheriffs' Association (NSA) *Police Executive Research Forum (PERF) Purpose and authority of the Commission The primary purpose of the Commission is to improve law enforcement service by creating a national body of standards developed by law enforcement professionals. Furthermore, it recognizes professional achievements by establishing and administering an accreditation process through which a law enforcement agency can demonstrate that it meets those standards. CALEA derives its general authority from the four major law enforcement membership associations whose members represent approximately 80% of the law enforcement profession in the United States. Commissioners Members to the Commission are appointed by the Executive Directors of these four associations. A majority vote is required for each appointment. Commissioners are appointed to a term of three years. The Commission is composed of 21 members: *11 members are selected from law enforcement *10 members are selected from the public and private sectors. CALEA Accreditation Programs=Law Enforcement The Law Enforcement Accreditation Program was the first credentialing program established by CALEA after its founding. It was originally developed to address what was seen as a need to enhance law enforcement as a profession and to improve law enforcement service delivery. That mission continues today through a tiered law enforcement accreditation program. Participating agencies may enroll in either CALEA Law Enforcement Accreditation or CALEA Advanced Law Enforcement Accreditation, without regard to agency size. Agencies may apply for and be awarded Accreditation with Excellence by the Commission as an indication of superlative performance within these accreditation programs. Additionally, these programs are open to all types of law enforcement agencies, on an international basis. And, these programs provide specific standards to support law enforcement agencies functioning in the college/university environment. They provide a process to systematically conduct an internal review and assessment of the agencies‚Äô policies and procedures, and make adjustments wherever necessary to meet a body of internationally accepted standards. Since the first CALEA Accreditation Award was granted in 1984, the program has become the primary method for an agency to voluntarily demonstrate their commitment to excellence in law enforcement. The standards upon which the Law Enforcement Accreditation Program is based reflect the current thinking and experience of law enforcement practitioners and researchers. Major law enforcement associations, leading educational and training institutions, governmental agencies, as well as law enforcement executives internationally, acknowledge CALEA's Standards for Law Enforcement Agencies¬© and its Accreditation Programs as benchmarks for professional law enforcement agencies. *CALEA Accreditation requires an agency to develop a comprehensive, well-thought-out, uniform set of written directives. This is one of the most successful methods for reaching administrative and operational goals, while also providing direction to personnel. *CALEA Accreditation standards provide the necessary reports and analyses a CEO needs to make fact-based, informed management decisions. *CALEA Accreditation requires a preparedness program be put in place‚Äîso an agency is ready to address natural or man-made unusual occurrences. *CALEA Accreditation is a means for developing or improving upon an agency's relationship with the community. *CALEA Accreditation strengthens an agency's accountability, both within the agency and the community, through a continuum of standards that clearly define authority, performance, and responsibilities. *Being CALEA Accredited can limit an agency's liability and risk exposure because it demonstrates that internationally recognized standards for law enforcement have been met, as verified by a team of independent outside CALEA-trained assessors. *CALEA Accreditation facilitates an agency's pursuit of professional excellence. *The California Highway Patrol is the largest law enforcement agency within the United States to obtain CALEA Accreditation. Public Safety Communications The CALEA Public Safety Communications Accreditation Program provides a communications center, or the communications unit of a public safety agency, with a process to systemically review and internally assess its operations and procedures. Since the first CALEA Communication Accreditation Award was granted in 1999, the program has become the primary method for a communications agency to voluntarily demonstrate its commitment to excellence. The standards upon which the Public Safety Communications Accreditation Program is based reflect the current thinking and experience of public safety communications executives and accreditation experts. APCO International (Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials International, Inc.), the leading communications membership association, was a partner in the development of CALEA's Standards for Public Safety Communications Agencies¬© and its Accreditation Program. This relationship continues today as APCO recognizes the achievements of CALEA Accredited Public Safety Communications agencies and supports accreditation. CALEA Accreditation requires the communications center or unit to develop a comprehensive, well thought out uniform set of written directives. This is one of the most successful methods for reaching administrative and operational goals, while also providing direction to personnel. *CALEA Accreditation standards provide the necessary reports and analyses a CEO needs to make fact- based, informed management decisions. *CALEA Accreditation requires a preparedness program be put in place‚Äîso a communications center is ready to address natural or man-made unusual occurrences. *CALEA Accreditation is a means for developing or improving upon a communications center's relationship with the community or the agencies it services. *CALEA Accreditation strengthens an agency's accountability, both within the agency and the community, through a continuum of standards that clearly define authority, performance, and responsibilities. *Being CALEA Accredited can limit a communications center's liability and risk exposure because it demonstrates that internationally recognized standards for public safety communications have been met, as verified by a team of independent outside CALEA-trained assessors. *CALEA Accreditation facilitates an agency's pursuit of professional excellence. Public Safety Training Academy  The Public Safety Training Academy Accreditation Program began in 2002. Its purpose is to promote superior public safety training services and recognize professional excellence. The program's standards are derived from the best practices of professional public safety training academies, and do not conflict with any organizations that are recognized training authorities. The standards prescribe \\"what\\" academies should be doing, but not \\"how\\" they should do it. That decision is left up to each academy and the Chief Executive Officer. The program standards cover nine topic areas: (1) credentialing; (2) organization; (3) direction and authority; (4) human resources; (5) recruitment, selection, employment, and promotion; (6) instructional systems; (7) training administration; (8) instructors; and (9) students. The CALEA Accreditation Process is a proven modern management model; once implemented, it presents the CEO, on a continuing basis, with a blueprint that promotes the efficient use of resources and improves service delivery‚Äîregardless of the size, type, or geographic location of the academy. The standards upon which the Public Safety Training Academy Accreditation Program is based reflect the current thinking and experience of training academy practitioners and accreditation experts. CALEA's Standards for Public Safety Training Academies¬© and its Accreditation Program are seen as benchmarks for today's public safety training programs. *CALEA Accreditation requires an academy to develop a comprehensive, well thought out, uniform set of written directives.

Campus Security The CALEA Campus Security Accreditation Program is designed for educational campus security agencies or departments that primarily employ non-sworn security officers and identify themselves as a \\"campus security force.\\" Eligible campus security agencies are defined as those having legal authority to perform security and public safety related functions in an educational campus-based setting, or those providing security or public safety services whose eligibility is verified by the Commission. The CALEA Accreditation Process is a proven modern management model; once implemented, it presents the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), on a continuing basis, with a blueprint that promotes the efficient use of resources and improves service delivery - regardless of the size, geographic location, or functional responsibilities of the agency. The CALEA Campus Security Accreditation Program provides agencies an opportunity to voluntarily demonstrate that they meet an established set of professional standards which: *Require the agency to develop a comprehensive, well thought out, uniform set of written directives. This is one of the most successful steps for reaching administrative and operational goals, while also providing direction to personnel. *Provide the necessary reports and analyses a CEO needs to make fact-based, informed management decisions. *Require a preparedness program be put in place - so an agency is ready to address natural or man-made critical incidents. *Are a means for developing or improving upon an agency's relationship with the campus community. *Strengthen the agency's accountability, both within the agency and the campus community, through a continuum of standards that clearly define authority, performance, and responsibilities. *Can limit an agency's liability and risk exposure because it demonstrates that internationally recognized standards for campus security have been met, as verified by a team of independent outside CALEA- trained assessors. *Facilitates an agency's pursuit of professional excellence. CALEA Awards CALEA offers several awards of recognition and achievement. Egon Bittner Award The Egon Bittner Award is presented to Chief Executive Officers who have commanded a CALEA Accredited agency for fifteen or more continuous years. James V. Cotter Award The James V. Cotter Award is for Chief Executive Officers who have successfully brought three or more new agencies into CALEA Accredited status. Meritorious Award CALEA Accredited Agencies are recognized for having been CALEA Accredited for 15 or more continuous years. Tri-Arc Award The Tri-Arc Award is given to the governing body(s) and agencies that have concurrent CALEA accreditation for their law enforcement, public safety communications and public safety training agencies. CALEA Assessors CALEA Assessors are contractual employees who follow the policies and procedures of the Commission. CALEA Assessors must have the ability to evaluate public safety management policies, procedures, practices, and activities. It is important for an assessor to have a firm understanding of modern public safety personnel, administrative, legal, and operational concepts and be able to interact, at a peer level, with the assessed agency CEO and command staff. While on assignment, CALEA Assessors must exemplify the highest levels of professionalism at all times and foster a non-adversarial climate. The CALEA Philosophy concerning assessments is \\"accountability with reasonable assistance.\\" As the \\"eyes and ears\\" of the Commission, assessors must maintain objectivity and report on the agency's ability to comply with the requisite number of applicable standards. For every accreditation on-site assessment, one assessor is designated as the team leader. Team leaders must hold a senior level executive or management position in their agency. Team leaders are selected from the assessor pool based on their performance, the recommendations of their past team leaders and assessed agencies, and a CALEA Staff review. Team leader certification requires additional CALEA training, as well as maintaining an active assessor certificate. Re-certification is required every three years for assessor and team leader. Assessor Qualifications CALEA maintains a pool of assessors that represents the demographics of the agencies it serves. CALEA Assessors must have: *A minimum of a baccalaureate degree or equivalent work experience and education. *Five years of current full-time public safety experience as: #a first-line supervisor or higher, or #a high-level administrative experience that requires considerable use of discretion. *Five years of CALEA accreditation experience. *The ability to write a high quality professional report. Accreditation Support Networks (PAC) Local assistance and in-house support with CALEA Accreditation Programs are provided by a network of organizations called Police Accreditation Coalitions, or PAC for short. PACs are formed on a local (state) or regional (multi-state) basis and made up of experienced Accreditation Managers. New accreditation managers can join their local PAC for training, guidance, and support at the local level. For other assistance or for areas where there is no local PAC accreditation managers can join the CALEA PAC Network. *List of Current Police Accreditation Coalitions Some of the other core Missions of the CALEA PAC Network include assisting CALEA Accreditation Managers by providing: *A database of reference model policies and directives. *A database of approved accreditation files for reference. *A database of model forms. *A database of training material to support training requirements for the standards. *An interactive forum for Accreditation Managers to discuss issues, standards, and compliance.

The manuscript contains numerous works, such as a map of the world (with index), and works by Orosius, Geoffrey of Monmouth and Gerald of Wales. It is now in the Biblioth√®que Nationale, Paris (Ms Latin 4126). The manuscript is famous because it contains seven consecutive documents concerning medieval Scotland, some of which are unique to the manuscript, and regarded as important sources. The first six, at least, had probably been compiled previously in Scotland, in the early thirteenth century. They comprise: # de Situ Albanie; which appears to be an introduction to the following five or six texts. The Poppleton MS preserves the only copy of this. # Cronica de origine antiquorum Pictorum (i.e. Chronicle on the Origins of the Ancient Picts); part of the Pictish Chronicle, this is largely a pastiche of wider Latin learning regarding the Picts and Scots. It contains extracts from the Etymologiae of Isidore of Seville and Nennius's Historia Brittonum. # A Pictish King List; part of the Pictish Chroncle, this is a largely un-Gaelicized list of Pictish Kings, containing an opening mythological section not present in many other Pictish king lists. Unlike related Pictish king-lists, it gets cut off at the accession of Cin√°ed mac Ailp√≠n. It reveals its origins at Abernethy by preserving a spurious foundation \\"charter\\" for the monastery there, reputedly granted by King Nechtan (fl. early seventh century), whom it calls Nectonius magnus filius Uuirp. # Chronicle of the Kings of Alba; it is a short chronicle of the Kings of Alba, from the period of King Cin√°ed mac Ailp√≠n (d. 858) until the reign of King Cin√°ed mac Ma√≠l Coluim (r. d. 995). As for the de Situ Albanie, the Poppleton MS preserves the only copy. # A List of D√°l Riatan and Scottish monarchs; this joined pair of king-lists starts from the legendary Fergus M√≥r mac Eirc, and ends with William I. # A genealogy of William I; this genealogy goes all the way back to Adam, via Gaidhel Glas. It is just a record or partial translation of a Gaelic genealogy, in which mac and meic have been replaced with filius and filii. Virtually all ancestors before David I have their names in the Middle Irish genitive form. # A foundation legend of St Andrews; it may not have been compiled by the author of de Situ Albanie in the thirteenth century, simply because it does not fit in with the logic presented by documents one to six, and is unrelated to the legend or topic is mentioned in de Situ Albanie. The value of the manuscript has been shown in the publications of William Forbes Skene, Alan Orr Anderson, and his wife Marjory Anderson. Dozens of articles have been written in the last half-century about various aspects of the Scottish content, although studies of the whole manuscript have been rarer.

Early career He was originally drafted by the Montreal Expos as the eighth pick of the first round of the 1973 amateur draft. He earned the MVP Award in the Eastern League in 1975. A year later, he made his major league debut for the Montreal Expos, hitting .222 in 29 games with two home runs and five runs batted in. Oriole career In 1977, Roenicke was traded with Joe Kerrigan and Don Stanhouse to the Baltimore Orioles for Rudy May, Randy Miller, and Bryn Smith. Roenicke appeared in 27 games in his first season with the Orioles in 1978. A year later, in his first full season, he had perhaps the best season of his career, appearing in 133 games and hitting .261 with 25 home runs and 64 runs batted in. He even made the top ten in at-bats per home run, with one home run every 15.0 AB. The next year, he hit .239 with 10 home runs, 28 runs batted in. In 1981 he hit .269, but his power numbers were still significantly down, slugging only .384, whereas he had slugged .508 in his rookie season. In 1982, he hit .270 with a slugging percentage of .499 in 137 games, platooning with John Lowenstein and Benny Ayala. In 1984, he hit a grand slam during the Home Run Derby jackpot inning of a locally televised game against the Yankees, which resulted in a $1 million jackpot award to a Maryland viewer. Decline Roenicke never established numbers like the 1982 season or rookie season. A year later, both his average and slugging were down and after two more years, the Orioles traded him to the New York Yankees for Rex Hudler. On the Yankees, his role was limited to a bench player and his power was down, with three home runs. He signed as a free agent in 1986 by the Atlanta Braves for less than half the amount of money he had been making ($380,000). He continued his career on the bench, this year doing better in the power department, hitting nine home runs. The next year, he hit .228 with a .298 slugging percentage, the worst of his career. He was released by the Braves on July 26, 1988 and retired. Retirement Roenicke resides in Rough and Ready, California, and is currently an adviser for the Western Canadian Baseball League, as well as a scout for the Orioles. His brother, Ron, had an eight-year career as an outfielder in the 1980s while his son Josh was a member of both the UCLA football and baseball teams as a wide receiver and outfielder. On the UCLA Bruins, Josh had the second-highest on-base percentage, third-highest batting average and compiled a perfect fielding percentage. Josh was drafted by the Cincinnati Reds, made his major-league baseball debut with the Reds as a pitcher on September 13, 2008, and on July 31, 2009 was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays.

Mongolian medical practice spread across their empire and became an ingrained part of many other people's medical systems.  History  The Mongols were part of a wider network of Eurasian people who had developed a medical system of their own, including the Chinese, Korean, Tibetan, Indian, Uighur, Islamic, and Nestorian Christians. They took the medical knowledge of these people, adapted it to develop their own medical system and at the same time organized an exchange of knowledge between the different people in their empire. On their journeys throughout Asia, the Mongols brought with them a team of doctors. Usually foreign, these doctors themselves had brought medical knowledge from other people in Asia to the Mongol court. They serve three purposes on the journeys on which the accompanied Mongol princes. Their first purpose was to be the personal physicians of the princes in case they required medical attention. The second was to observe and obtain any new medical knowledge from the various groups of people that they encounter. Finally, they were to also spread the medical knowledge that the Mongols had put together to the peoples they encountered. The Mongols were also able to contribute new or more advanced knowledge on topics such as bone setting and treatments of war wounds because of their nomadic lifestyle. The Mongols were the first people to establish a link between diet and health. Traditional Mongolian doctors were known as shaman, or holy men. They relied on magic and spiritual powers to cure illness. They were called on to determine whether the illness was caused by natural means or because of malicious wishes. Though they were often used as healers, their main strength was in prophecy readings. Foreign physicians who used herbs to treat illness were distinguished from the shamans by their name, otochi, which meant herb user or physician. It was borrowed from the Uighur word for physician, which was otachi. When Mongolian medicine began to transition to using herbs and other drugs and had the service of foreign doctors, the importance of shamans as medical healers began to decline. Hu Sihui (1314‚Äì1330) was a Mongol court therapist and dietitian during Mongol Yuan Dynasty reign in China. He is known for his book Yinshan Zhengyao (Important Principles of Food and Drink), that became a classic in Chinese medicine and Chinese cuisine. He was the first to empirically discover and clearly describe deficiency diseases.Needham, Joseph. Poverties and Triumphs of the Chinese Scientific Tradition. \\\\ In: The \\"Racial\\" Economy of Science. Indiana University Press, 1993. , ‚Äì page 41 on discovery of deficiency diseases  Treatment practices = Animal blood  Animal blood was used to treat a variety of illness, from gout to blood loss. Recorded in the Yuan Shih, are many incident where the blood of a freshly killed animal, usually a cow or an ox, was used to treat illness. Gout, which was a common affliction of the Mongol people, was treated by immersing the afflicted body part into the belly of a freshly killed cow. Placing a person in the stomach of an animal was also used as a method of blood transfusion. On the battlefield, when a soldier became unconscious due to massive amount of blood loss, he would be stripped and placed into the stomach of a freshly killed animal until he became conscious again. In less severe cases, the skin of a freshly killed ox was combined with the masticated grass found in a cow's stomach to form a sort of bandage and ointment to heal battle wounds. It was believed that the stomach and fat of the freshly killed animal could absorb the bad blood and restore the wounded to health.  Minerals  Mongolian medical literature mentions the use of minerals in medicine, usually in the form of powdered metals or stones. From the Chinese, Mongolians also used cinnabar or mercury sulfide as treatment options, despite the high number of casualties it caused. Both the Chinese and the Mongols believed that cinnabar and mercury sulfide were the elixir of life.Cinnabar  Herbs  Herbs were the mainstay of Mongolian medicine; legend had it that any plant could be used as a medicine. An emchi is quoted as saying: :All those flowers, on which butterflies sit, are ready medicine for various diseases. One can eat such flowers without any hesitation. A flower rejected by the butterflies is poisonous, but it can become medicine, when it is properly composed.  Acupuncture and moxibustion  The Mongolian adopted the practice of acupuncture from the Chinese. They adapted this tradition and made it a Mongolian form of treatment when they burned herbs over the various meridian points rather than used a needle. The tradition of Moxibustion (burning mugwort over acupuncture points) was developed in Mongolia and later incorporated into Tibetan medicine.George Lane, Daily life in the Mongol empire, p. 139  Water  One unusual aspect of Mongolian medicine is the use of water as a medicine. Water was collected from any source, including the sea, and stored for many years until ready for use. Acidity and other stomach upsets were said to be amenable to water treatments.  Bone setting  Bone setting is a branch of Mongolian medicine carried out by Bariachis, specialist bone setters. They work without medicines, as anesthetics or instruments. Instead they rely on physiotherapy to manipulate bones back to their proper position. This was done without any pain to the patient. Bariachis are laypeople, without medical training, and are born into the job, following the family tradition. They had the ability to fix any bone problem, no matter how severe or difficult. When Chinese physicians were brought into the Mongolian empire, Wei Yilin, a famous Yuan orthopedic surgeon established particular methods for setting fractures and treating shoulder, hip, and knee dislocations. He also pioneered the suspension method for joint reduction. He was not only an orthopedic surgeon but also an anesthesiologist who used various folk medicine for anesthetics during his operations. It appears that this traditional practice is in decline, and that no scientific research has been carried out into it.  Pulse diagnosis  Pulse diagnosis is very popular in Western Asia and especially Iran, and its introduction to the Islamic West can be traced back to the Mongols. The Mongol word for pulse, mai, has Chinese etymology. In China, pulse diagnosis was related to the balance between the yin and yang. Irregular pulses were believed to be caused by an imbalance of the yin and the yang. However, when the Mongol adopted this medical practice, they believed that the pulse was directly related to moral order and that when the moral order was chaotic, so the pulse would be chaotic and irregular as well. This belief is highlighted in a story recounted in the Yuan Shih. In 1214, Ogodei Qa'an had an irregular pulse, and was very ill. His most trusted physician ordered that a general amnesty be declared all across the empire. Shortly afterwards, Ogodei Qa'an was restored to health and his pulse regular once again. For the Mongol, this account gives evidence to the direct relationship between pulse and moral order. Pulse diagnosis soon became the primary diagnosis' tool and became the cornerstone of Mongolian medicine. Qubilai decreed that Chinese manuals on pulse-based medicine be translated to Mongolian. His successor, Tem√ºr, in 1305, ordered that pulse diagnosis be one of the ten compulsory subjects in which Imperial Academy of Medicine medical students be tested. In pulse diagnosis, there was a distinction between measuring a child's pulse versus and adult's pulse, and this distinction was greatly emphasized in the Chinese texts that were translated, and later in the Mongolian texts.  Discovery of the link between diet and health  In 1330, Hu Sihui, a Mongolian physician published Yinshan Zhengyo (Important Principles of Food and Drink). It was the first book of its kind. In this textbook, Hu Sihui preached the importance of a balanced diet with a focus on moderation, especially in drinking. He also listed beneficial properties of various common foods, including fish, shellfish, meat, fruit, vegetables, and 230 cereals. Grapes were recommended for character strengthening and boosting one's energy levels. However, eating too many apples could cause distension and indulging in too many oranges lead to liver damage. A common menu item, dog meat, was very beneficial because it calmed the liver, spleen, heart, lungs, kidneys, and pericardium. This link between diet and health was spread far and wide by the Mongols on their journeys across the Eurasian steppe lands.  Dom  Dom is the tradition of household cures, many based simply on superstition - one instance being that a picture of a fox hung over a child's bed will help it sleep. Counting the frequency of breathing is also stated to be a relief for psychological problems and distress.  Eating papers  Strip of Mongolian eating papers A printing stock found in eastern Mongolia in the 1920s documents a historical custom of eating a piece of paper with words printed on it, in order to prevent or heal maladies. On fields of about 24x29 mm magical incantations in Tibetan are printed, along with use instructions in Mongolian. The practise apparently was part of lamaist popular medicine.  Traditional Mongolian medicine today  Today Mongolia is one of the few countries which officially supports its traditional system of medicine.Growth in traditional medicine , Mongol Messenger, October 29, 2003 Since 1949, the Chinese government has steadily promoted advances in Mongolian medical care, research and education. In 1958 the Department of Traditional Chinese and Mongolian Medicine at the Inner Mongolia Medical College opened its doors to students. In 2007 it expanded, opening a state of the art campus just outside Hohhot City. The Chinese government has also established scores of Mongolian medicine hospitals since 1999, including 41 in Inner Mongolia, 3 in Xinjiang, and 1 each in Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Gansu and Qinghai.Valerie Sartor, Traditional Mongolian Medicine in China, China.org.cn, July 30, 2007.

The squadron was established in May 1943 as a fighter unit equipped with Supermarine Spitfires, and subsequently saw combat in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II. Between June 1943 and the end of the war in August 1945 it flew air defence patrols to protect Allied bases and ships, escorted Australian and United States aircraft, and attacked Japanese positions. The squadron was disbanded in November 1945, but was re-formed between 1962 and 1968 to operate CAC Sabres from Ubon Air Base in Thailand. In this role it contributed to the defence of Thailand against a feared attack from its neighbouring states and exercised with United States Air Force units. No. 79 Squadron was active again at RAAF Base Butterworth in Malaysia between 1986 and 1988 where it operated Mirage III fighters and a single DHC-4 Caribou transport during the period in which the RAAF's fighter squadrons were transitioning to new aircraft. The squadron was re-formed in its present incarnation during 1998 and is currently stationed at RAAF Base Pearce, where it has operated Hawk 127 jet training aircraft since 2000. The unit's main role is to provide introductory jet aircraft training to RAAF pilots as well as refresher training on the Hawk for experienced pilots. No. 79 Squadron also supports Australian Army and Royal Australian Navy training exercises in Western Australia and the Northern Territory. History=World War II No. 79 Squadron was formed at RAAF Station Laverton in Victoria on 26 April 1943 under the command of flying ace Squadron Leader Alan Rawlinson.Eather (1995), p. 92 The squadron's intended role was to use Spitfire Vc fighters to provide 'high cover' escort for the RAAF's P-40 Kittyhawk-equipped units which were engaging Japanese forces in the New Guinea Campaign. This requirement was considered urgent, and the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal George Jones, directed that No. 79 Squadron receive priority for the RAAF's limited stock of Spitfires.Cooper (2011) The squadron moved to Wooloomanata Aerodrome several days after it was formed, and received its first Spitfires on 3 May.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 69 While at Wooloomanata No. 79 Squadron undertook training exercises to prepare for combat. The allocation of 24 Spitfires to the squadron led to No. 1 Wing RAAF, which was stationed near Darwin and responsible for protecting the town against air attack, to suffer a shortage of these aircraft during June and July. Momote Airfield in April 1944alt=Black-and-white photo of two single- engined monoplane aircraft and a fuel tanker on a dirt clearing. Tropical palms are visible in the background. No. 79 Squadron began moving to Goodenough Island in the war zone off the north coast of Papua in mid-May 1943. Its advance party departed Wooloomanata on 17 May, followed by the pilots on 4 June. The main body of ground crew sailed from Sydney on 7 June. The squadron suffered its first fatality on 13 June, when Flight Lieutenant Virgil Brennan‚Äîan experienced fighter pilot who had shot down 10 Axis aircraft over Malta‚Äîdied from wounds incurred when his Spitfire collided with another while they were landing at Cairns.RAAF Historical Section (1995), pp. 69‚Äì70 During the unit's transit to Goodenough Island, No. 79 Squadron Spitfires were scrambled from Gurney Airfield at Milne Bay on several occasions between 19 and 25 June to intercept Japanese reconnaissance aircraft, but did not damage these intruders.No. 79 Squadron (1943‚Äì1945), p. 3 Map of Eastern New Guinea, New Britain and nearby islands The squadron completed its movement to Goodenough Island on 26 June and began flying air defence sorties from there as part of No. 73 Wing.Thomas (2009), p. 73RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 70 It did not intercept any Japanese aircraft while operating from this base, however. The squadron moved to Kirwina Airfield on Kiriwina between 9 and 18 August, from where it operated alongside the P-40 Kittyhawk-equipped No. 76 Squadron. This was the closest Allied airfield to the major Japanese base at Rabaul and was expected to be regularly attacked. No Japanese raids were made on the airfield during the first weeks of the squadron's deployment there, however, and its pilots were disappointed to not see combat while conducting patrols in support of United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) raids on Rabaul.Thomas (2009), pp. 73‚Äì74 The Imperial Japanese Army Air Force (IJAAF) began a series of attacks on Goodenough Island and Kiriwina in early October, however, and the squadron claimed its first victory in 31 October when one of its Spitfires shot down a Kawasaki Ki-61 fighter north of Kiriwina (this type of aircraft was labelled the \\"Tony\\" by the Allies).Thomas (2009), p. 74 After a period of training, No. 79 Squadron flew its first sweep over Japanese-held territory on 27 November when eight Spitfires were dispatched to Gasmata on New Britain. The next day one of its Spitfires shot down a Mitsubishi Ki-46 \\"Dinah\\" reconnaissance aircraft south of Kitava. As few Japanese attacks were made against Kirwina, No. 79 Squadron's pilots became restive. The offensive patrols over New Britain improved their morale, however.Odgers (1968), p. 127 Another Ki-61 was intercepted and shot down by a Spitfire on 21 December, and an A6M Mitsubishi A6M \\"Zero\\" fighter was destroyed on the ground at Gasmata seven days later. A Spitfire was lost during a patrol over New Britain on 31 December, however. During January and February 1944 the squadron conducted offensive sweeps over New Britain, strafed Japanese positions and escorted Allied bombers.RAAF Historical Section (1995), pp. 70‚Äì71 On 17 January, eight No. 79 Squadron Spitfires took part in an attack against a Japanese camp near Lindenhafen which involved 73 Australian aircraft; this was the largest RAAF operation of the war up to that time.Odgers (1968), p. 130 Two Spitfires were lost during the operations in January and February.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 71 A No. 79 Squadron pilot (wearing uniform) and two members of the squadron's ground crew posing with a Spitfire Mk. VIII at Morotai during September 1945 In early 1944 No. 73 Wing was selected to support the US Army's Admiralty Islands campaign. The 1st Cavalry Division began to land on the islands on 29 February, and the wing moved to Momote Airstrip on Los Negros Island in March 1944. No. 79 Squadron became operational there with 24 aircraft on the 29th of the month.Odgers (1968), p. 179 From Momote, the squadron flew ground attack sorties in support of US troops until Japanese resistance ceased. No Japanese aircraft were encountered throughout this operation.Thomas (2009), p. 76 By the end of April, No. 79 Squadron's main role was to escort Allied shipping, though flying was hampered by a shortage of spare parts. The squadron's commanding officer, Squadron Leader M.S. Bott, was killed in an accident on 16 April. Shipping escort patrols continued in May, but difficulties maintaining the Spitfires reduced the squadron to just two operational aircraft with another 12 awaiting repair. Due to a shortage of aircraft the squadron's flying activities were limited to training sorties between August and October, and aircraft availability continued to be a problem until late November. On 9 November, two Spitfires unsuccessfully attempted to intercept three Japanese A6M fighters which had raided Hyane Harbour; while the Japanese force had been tracked by Allied radar for 25 minutes prior to the attack, the Spitfires were scrambled only after the raiders had left the area.Thomas (2009), pp. 76‚Äì77 No. 79 Squadron subsequently maintained a three-aircraft patrol over Los Negros during daylight hours until 22 November. Two days later the squadron was released from operations ahead of moving to Darwin in northern Australia to be re- equipped with more modern Mark VIII Spitfires. No. 79 Squadron arrived at Sattler Airfield south of Darwin on 12 January 1945 and received its new aircraft shortly afterwards. It began to move to Morotai in the Netherlands East Indies (NEI) on 6 February and became operational there as part of No. 80 Wing at the end of March. The squadron conducted ground attack sorties against Japanese positions on nearby islands until the end of the war and also became responsible for Morotai's air defence from 28 May. Although no Japanese aircraft were encountered in this area, several Spitfires were shot down by anti-aircraft fire during ground attack sorties.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 72Thomas (2009), p. 84 Operations were hindered at times by personnel shortages, and many of the airmen who were posted to the unit were judged by the squadron's commander to have been inadequately trained.Odgers (1968), p. 442 On 30 July No. 80 Wing was disbanded and the squadron became the first flying unit assigned to the newly formed No. 11 Group. This group was responsible for garrison duties in much of Borneo and the eastern NEI.Odgers (1968), pp. 478‚Äì479 No. 79 Squadron dropped leaflets on Japanese positions after Japan agreed to surrender on 15 August and returned to Australia in October 1945. It was disbanded at Oakey Airfield on 12 November that year.Eather (1995), p. 93 The unit suffered 13 fatal casualties during the war. In late 2010 the squadron was awarded battle honours for its World War II service in the Pacific, New Britain and Morotai. Ubon In May 1962 the Australian Government decided to deploy a squadron of CAC Sabre fighters to Thailand to bolster that country's defences. This action was undertaken as part of Australia's Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) commitment to defend Thailand against attack from its Communist neighbours, which was thought likely to occur.Stephens (2006), p. 254 The United States, United Kingdom and New Zealand also deployed forces to Thailand in response to this perceived threat, though Malaysia and several other SEATO members chose not to be involved. On 28 May, Minister for Defence Athol Townley announced that Australia's contribution would be an RAAF squadron equipped with Sabre fighters.Edwards and Pemberton (1992), pp. 242‚Äì243 The eight aircraft, along with their pilots and ground crew, were drawn from No. 77 Squadron, which formed part of Australia's Commonwealth Strategic Reserve forces at RAAF Base Butterworth in Malaysia. In order to preserve Malaysia's neutrality, the Sabres were flown to Thailand via Singapore.Trebilco (1997), p. 108 This force was designated No. 79 Squadron while at Tengah Air Base in Singapore on 29 May. alt=A monoplane aircraft with three men and a fuel tanker truck. One of the men is wearing military uniform and the other two are clad only in shorts. The aircraft is mainly painted grey, but is marked with the Royal Australian Air Force roundel and stripes on its tail. The tail of another aircraft of similar appearance is visible in the background. The squadron arrived at Ubon Air Base in the Ubon Ratchathani Province of eastern Thailand on 1 June 1962 and flew its first operational patrol four days later.Coulthard-Clark (1995), p. 11 Facilities at Ubon were initially spartan, and the pilots and ground crew lived in tents. Construction of permanent accommodation began under the supervision of No. 5 Airfield Construction Squadron in September 1962, however, and facilities were later further improved.Stephens (2006), p. 255 Despite Malaysia's policy of neutrality in regards the conflict in Southeast Asia, No. 79 Squadron operated as a detachment of the RAAF force (No. 78 Wing) based at Butterworth throughout its time in Thailand.Coulthard-Clark (1995), p. 13 Aircraft and personnel were regularly transferred between Butterworth and Ubon, and most pilots' nominally six-month-long tours of duty in Thailand were broken into several shorter periods during which they and their aircraft were illegally rotated between the two bases. In March 1963 the Defence Committee, the highest decision-making body of the Department of Defence, recommended to Cabinet that No. 79 Squadron be withdrawn from Thailand on the grounds that the British and New Zealand contingents had left the country.Edwards and Pemberton (1992), p. 272Fr√ºhling (2009), p. 1 The Cabinet's Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee decided against this on 28 March as it was believed that maintaining the squadron at Ubon helped maintain good relationships with Thailand and the United States. The Thai Government was discreetly asked if it would prefer a different form of assistance, however. Throughout its period at Ubon, No. 79 Squadron formed part of an international force tasked with defending Thailand's air space against intruders. At the start of the deployment, tensions in Thailand were such that the squadron's personnel believed that they were at war. While the situation became more stable from late July 1962, No. 79 Squadron maintained armed aircraft on alert at all times and scrambled Sabres when unidentified aircraft were detected. No air attacks were conducted against Thailand, however, and the unidentified aircraft that were intercepted almost always proved to be from the Central Intelligence Agency-controlled Air America. In January 1965 two Sabres accidentally overflew North Vietnam after becoming lost during a training sortie but returned safely to Ubon.Coulthard-Clark (1995), pp. 14‚Äì15 From early April 1965, Ubon became an important base for United States Air Force (USAF) attacks on North Vietnam during the Vietnam War, and No. 79 Squadron became part of an integrated air defence system controlled by the USAF on 25 June. This changed the status of the squadron's presence in Thailand, and RAAF Headquarters assessed that the North Vietnamese would be justified in regarding it as forming part of the air campaign against their country.Stephens (2006), p. 256 Due to the threat of counter-attacks on Ubon, the base's ground defences were upgraded during 1966; this included the construction of defensive positions for No. 79 Squadron's aircraft and personnel as well as the deployment of a detachment of RAAF airfield defence guards.Coulthard-Clark (1995), p. 15 While the squadron did not play an active role in the war, it supported the US effort by providing air defence for Ubon and taking part in exercises with USAF aircraft in which the Sabres adopted tactics used by North Vietnamese MiG-17 fighters.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 73 In December 1965 the commander of the United States Pacific Air Forces, General Hunter Harris, Jr., wrote to the chief of the RAAF, Air Marshal Alister Murdoch, to suggest that No. 79 Squadron join the USAF operations against the Ho Chi Minh trail in southern Laos which were being covertly conducted by Ubon-based aircraft. The Thai Government indicated that it would allow the squadron to be used for this purpose as long as the Australian operations were conducted without a formal agreement or any public announcement.Edwards (1997), p. 92 On 2 March 1966 the Australian Cabinet decided to reinforce the Army and RAAF force in South Vietnam, but rejected the option of expanding the scope of RAAF operations in Thailand. This decision was made on the grounds that the expanded force in South Vietnam and existing deployments to Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore represented the maximum forces Australia could commit to the region.Edwards (1997), p. 94 By mid-1968, No. 79 Squadron no longer had a clear role at Ubon. The USAF had sufficient fighters based in Thailand to defend the country and was reluctant to use the Australian fighters‚Äîwhich were now regarded as obsolete‚Äîto intercept potentially hostile aircraft, as the squadron's rules of engagement did not allow it to pursue contacts that left Thai airspace. As a result, the Australian military's chiefs of staff determined that the RAAF presence in Thailand had outlived its political and military usefulness and decided to withdraw the squadron without replacement. No. 79 Squadron was taken off alert status on 26 July and disbanded at the end of the month.Stephens (2006), p. 257 On 31 March 2011 it received a battle honour for its deployment to Ubon between May 1962 and August 1968. Butterworth On 31 March 1986, No. 79 Squadron was re-formed at RAAF Base Butterworth as a temporary measure to cover part of the period while the RAAF's three fighter squadrons were transitioning from Mirage IIIs to F/A-18 Hornets. The squadron inherited all of No. 3 Squadron's twelve Mirage III fighters and most of its personnel; the remainder of No. 3 Squadron returned to Australia to be re-equipped with Hornets. As well as the Mirage IIIs, the squadron operated a single DHC-4 Caribou transport that was also based at Butterworth.RAAF Historical Section (1995), pp. 6, 73 In its new incarnation, No. 79 Squadron continued the air defence and training duties for which No. 3 Squadron had been responsible at Butterworth.Air Power Development Centre (2005), p. 2RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 6 It participated in routine training exercises in Southeast Asia, which included making regular deployments to Paya Lebar Air Base in Singapore to train with the Republic of Singapore Air Force. In May 1987 the squadron deployed to Clarke Air Force Base in the Philippines to participate in the annual Cope Thunder exercise with USAF units.RAAF Historical Section (1995), pp. 73‚Äì74 It also exercised with No. 77 Squadron's new F/A-18 Hornets in April 1988 when that unit visited Butterworth.Bomball (1990), p. 110 The Caribou transport was used to support Australian Army units in Malaysia and also flew training sorties to neighbouring countries. By early 1988 both No. 3 and No. 77 Squadrons had successfully converted to the F/A-18, and No. 79 Squadron was no longer required.Bomball (1990), pp. 90‚Äì91 Preparations to return the unit's Mirages to Australia took place during the first months of 1988, and on 3 May they departed Butterworth.Bomball (1990), p. 89 As the RAAF's F/A-18 Hornet squadrons were to be based in Australia, this marked the end of the permanent deployment of RAAF fighters to Butterworth that had begun in mid-1958. No. 79 Squadron's aircraft commemorated the occasion by conducting a spectacular low- altitude flypast of the base, the first leg of which commenced at transonic speed.Air Power Development Centre (2005), pp. 1‚Äì2Bomball (1990), p. 90 The aircraft were flown to Woomera in central Australia to be placed in storage via Paya Lebar, Bali, Darwin and RAAF Base Tindal. Most of No. 79 Squadron's ground crew returned to Australia in late May, and the squadron was formally disbanded at Butterworth on 30 June 1988. Current status alt=Four monoplane aircraft flying in close formation. The aircraft are painted grey and have been photographed from below. No. 79 Squadron was re-formed a third time on 1 July 1998 as a training unit located at RAAF Base Pearce near Perth in Western Australia. The squadron was re-established by separating No. 25 Squadron's Permanent Air Force (full-time) component from its Air Force Reserve (part-time reservist) personnel and responsibilities. The squadron initially operated Aermacchi MB-326 aircraft before being re-equipped with Hawk 127 aircraft between 7 December 2000 and 4 March 2001.Holmes (2005), p. 47 In 2000 No. 78 Wing was re-formed and assumed command of No. 76 and No. 79 Squadrons. The Hawks experienced serviceability problems during their first 18 months with the squadron, but these were eventually rectified.Holmes (2005), p. 48 During October 2003 two No. 79 Squadron Hawks conducted a tour of Australia to belatedly commemorate the unit's 60th anniversary. During this tour the aircrew visited Alan Rawlinson at his home at Naracoorte, South Australia, and later conducted a flyover of the town in his honour. The squadron made its first overseas deployment in almost twenty years during April 2006 when six Hawks and 52 personnel were dispatched to RMAF Base Butterworth to take part in Exercise Bersama Shield. This was also the first time RAAF Hawks had operated overseas. As of May 2010, No. 79 Squadron was equipped with 15 of the RAAF's 33 Hawks. In 2011, the squadron was organised into a Training Flight, Operations Flight, and Maintenance Flight. A program to modernise all of the RAAF's Hawks to a similar standard to the Royal Air Force's Hawk T.2 aircraft began in 2014, and No. 79 Squadron is scheduled to begin operations with these aircraft in mid-2017.Pittaway (2014), pp. 66‚Äì67 The unit's Maintenance Flight was disbanded in July 2016 when responsibility for support services for the Hawks was transferred to BAE Systems. In its current role No. 79 Squadron's main responsibility is to provide introductory fast jet training to pilots who have recently graduated from No. 2 Flying Training School. During this training, new pilots who have been selected to fly jet aircraft are taught to operate Hawks and provided with initial instruction on jet aircraft combat tactics. In 2004, each of No. 79 Squadron's training courses lasted for twelve weeks.Australian National Audit Office (2004), p. 26 After completing their initial jet aircraft training, pilots transfer to No. 76 Squadron at RAAF Base Williamtown for advanced instruction before being posted to one of the RAAF's operational conversion units.Sadler (2006), p. 68 No. 79 Squadron also provides introductory training on fast jets for RAAF air combat officers who have been selected to serve on board F/A-18F Super Hornets. The squadron trained RAAF personnel selected to serve as navigators on board F-111 strike aircraft until these aircraft were replaced with Super Hornets in 2010.Australian National Audit Office (2004), p. 36 No. 79 Squadron also provides refresher training on the Hawk aircraft for experienced fighter pilots. In addition to its pilot training responsibilities, No. 79 Squadron's Operations Flight provides aircraft to support Navy and Army training exercises. These duties are undertaken by experienced pilots who did not successfully complete operational conversion training, and also by new pilots who have completed training with No. 76 Squadron and been posted back to No. 79 Squadron until a place becomes available in an operational conversion course. No. 76 Squadron has a similar Operations Flight.Holmes (2005), p. 51Australian National Audit Office (2004), p. 28 Most of No. 79 Squadron's exercises with the Navy take place off the coast of Western Australia, but aircraft are occasionally deployed to Darwin for this task.Holmes (2005), p. 52 Notes Coulthard-Clark (1995), p. 13 states that the detachment of Sabres was officially designated No. 79 Squadron on 24 June 1962. No. 79 Squadron's battle honour for its service at Ubon was one of several new battle honours issued on 31 March 2011 to mark the 90th anniversary of the RAAF's formation.

He served as the model for several fictional portrayals of speculators who come to ruin. Biography He was the third son of Clement William Sadleir, a tenant farmer of Shrone Hill, County Tipperary, and his wife, a daughter of James Scully, who founded a private bank in Tipperary town. He was educated at Clongowes College. He qualified as a solicitor, and took over a lucrative practice in Dublin from his uncle. About 1846 he abandoned the law to enter politics, and to join his brother John and their cousin, the younger James Scully, in a disastrous banking venture, the Tipperary Joint Stock Bank. He entered the House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1847 as a Member of Parliament for Carlow. Sadleir co-founded the Catholic Defence Association in 1851 and was one of the leading figures in the Independent Irish Party which held the balance of power in the House of Commons when it formed in 1852.James O'Shea, ‚ÄòSadleir, John (1813‚Äì1856)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 2 Nov 2009 He went on to hold minor office in Lord Aberdeen's coalition government from 1852 through 1854: since he had been elected on an explicit pledge not to take office, his decision caused outrage in Ireland, and he was never forgiven for what was seen as an shameless betrayal of his principles. He resigned his ministerial position in 1854 when he was found guilty of being implicated in a plot to imprison a depositor of the Tipperary Bank because the individual in question had refused to vote for him. By February 1856 the Tipperary Bank was insolvent, owing to Sadleir's overdraft of ¬£288,000. His own financial affairs were ruinous, and in his efforts to solve his problems he milked the London Bank, ruined a small Newcastle upon Tyne bank, sold forged shares of the Swedish Railway Company, raised money on forged deeds, and spent rents of properties he held in receivership and money entrusted to him as a solicitor. In this way he disposed of more than ¬£1.5 million, mainly in disastrous speculations. Unable to face the consequences, he committed suicide near Jack Straw's Tavern on Hampstead Heath on 17 February 1856 by drinking prussic acid. The Times reported that \\"[t]he body of Mr J. Sadleir M.P. was found on Sunday morning, February 17 on Hampstead Heath, at a considerable distance from the public road. A large bottle labelled \\"Oil of Bitter Almonds\\" and a jug also containing the poison (prussic acid) lay by his side.\\"The Times 18 February 1856 The body was identified by Edwin James QC MP and Thomas Wakley MP, editor of The Lancet. His brother James Sadleir, also an MP, was found to be deeply implicated in the fraud, having conspired with his younger brother. He was expelled from the House of Commons on 16 February 1857. He fled to the Continent, settling in Zurich and then Geneva. He was murdered there in 1881 while being robbed of his gold watch. John Sadleir was buried in an unmarked grave in Highgate Cemetery. Legacy Charles Dickens based the character of the great financier Mr. Merdle (who goes bankrupt and commits suicide) in Little Dorrit (1857) on John Sadleir. The central character of Anthony Trollope's The Way We Live Now (1875), Melmotte (also a swindling financier who goes bankrupt and commits suicide) may have been based on Sadleir, as well. W. S. Gilbert based part of his 1869 play An Old Score on the story of Sadleir's suicide. The 1885 novel (and later play and silent film) John Needham's Double by Joseph Hatton is also based on Sadleir.Some stories (review of book), The Saturday Review (10 October 1885), p. 491 Because the Independent Irish Party were pledged not to take office, the decision of Sadleir and his friend and colleague William Keogh to do so was considered by the Irish public to be an unforgivable betrayal. To \\"be another Sadleir or Keogh\\" entered the Irish political vocabulary as being synonymous with being a political turncoat: the phrase was still in use in \`Ireland as late as the 1950s.

I-6. did not violate the respondents' right to \\"equality before the law\\" under Section 1 (b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights. The two respondents, Lavell and B√©dard, had alleged that the impugned section was discriminatory under the Canadian Bill of Rights by virtue of the fact that it deprived Indian women of their status for marrying a non-Indian, but not Indian men. The Supreme Court's decision proved very controversial, later influencing the wording of Section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms during the drafting process. Background to Mrs. Lavell Mrs. Lavell,Mrs. Lavell was born Jeannette Vivian Corbiere. a member of Wiikwemkoong First Nation, married David Lavell, a journalism student at Ryerson Institute in Toronto, on April 11, 1970. She was promptly delivered a notice from the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development indicating that due to her marriage to a person not registered as Indian, she would no longer be considered an Indian by law. On December 7, 1970, the Indian Registrar deleted her name from the Registry in accordance with Section 12(1)(b) of the Indian Act. Mrs. Lavell disputed her loss of status to the registrar, but without success. At Mrs. Lavell's request for judicial review of the Registrar's decision, Mrs. Lavell's case was referred to Judge B.W. Grossberg of the York County Court as per section 9(3) of the Indian Act.[1974] S.C.R. 1349 at 1376. Mrs. Lavell argued that Section 12(1)(b) of the Indian Act was inoperative due to an irreconcilable abridgement of her right to equality before the law, guaranteed by the Canadian Bill of Rights. In particular, Mrs. Lavell asserted that the Indian Act discriminated against Indian women since only they lost their status as an Indian under the Act, whereas Indian men could marry whomever they so desired without adverse legal consequence. The decision of registrar, she argued, must therefore be reversed. In the case's proceedings, counsel for the Attorney General of Canada presented evidence to the court demonstrating that Mrs. Lavell had not lived on a single reserve for a period of nine years before her marriage and that she had only made a few \\"sporadic\\" visits to her family.RE Lavell v. Attorney General of Canada (1972), 22 D.L.R. (3d) 182 at 187. Furthermore, counsel argued that as far as the law was concerned, the Indian Act did not discriminate against Indian women. In defence of this proposition, counsel noted that the Supreme Court has rejected the 'similarly- situated doctrine' as the appropriate measure of a party's equality before the law.The Queen v. Drybones, [1970] S.C.R. 282, overruling R. v. Gonzales (1962), 32 D.L.R. (2d) 290, 132 C.C.C. 237, 37 C.R. 56 (B.C.C.A.). In Drybones discrimination was ruled to have occurred between Indians and Canadians (i.e. Indians were prohibited from becoming intoxicated off a reserve, whereas Canadians were free to become intoxicated without penalty) and not between fellow Indians (e.g. the law prohibited all Indians from becoming intoxicated off a reserve). The appellant, Mrs. Lavell, therefore, counsel for the Attorney General argued, must be compared not to married Indian men, but to all married Canadian women in order to establish whether or not discrimination has in fact occurred by reason of sex. Judgement of Judge B. W. Grossberg as persona designata (York County Court) Grossberg affirmed and upheld the Registrar's decision, holding that the impugned Section of the Indian Act did not discriminate against the appellant on the basis of sex. Judge Grossberg noted that the Indian Act treated all married women equally, Indian or not: ::The appellant entered into a voluntary marriage which gave her the status and all the rights enjoyed by all other Canadian married females. Her marriage also imposed on her the same obligations imposed on all other Canadian married females ...RE Lavell v. Attorney General of Canada, at 186. Judge Grossberg also dismissed the appellant's arguments regarding the different distinctions between male and female Indians, stating that he had difficulty fathoming how such alleged inequalities within different groups of Canadian society are necessarily offensive to the Canadian Bill of Rights. As a matter of fact, Judge Grossberg suggests that it is a laudable point in Canadian history that the appellant is no longer an Indian, since she now she enjoys the same rights and freedoms of all Canadians; a feat which he construes as consistent to the recommendations of the \\"Report of the Royal Commission on the Status of Women in Canada\\". To that end Section 12(1)(b) of the Indian Act, the Judge concludes, is not inoperative in the face of the Canadian Bill of Rights. Judgement of the Federal Court of Appeal Mrs. Lavell appealed Judge Grossberg's decision to the Federal Court of Appeal, arguing that Judge Grossberg erred in his determination that the impugned Section of the Indian Act was not in violation of the appellant's right to equality before the law. Mr. Justice Thurlow, writing for a unanimous court, agreed, declaring the impugned section discriminatory on the basis of sex. Citing the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in Drybones, Justice Thurlow rejected the reasoning of Judge Grossberg that since all women, Canadian and Indian, were being treated the same under the Act that there was no deprivation of the appellant's equality before the law. Rather, Justice Thurlow determines that in order for the Indian Act to respect the equality of the appellants, the law must treat Indian women by the same fashion as it treats Indian men: as equals. Section 12(1)(b) of the Indian Act, Justice Thurlow reasons, does not treat Indian women in such a manner: ::It is clear that both male Indians and female Indians have capacity to marry and that each has the capacity and the right to contract a marriage either with another Indian or with a person who is not an Indian. The Indian Act, however, which is a law made by the Parliament of Canada for Indians, prescribes a different result with respect to the rights of an Indian woman who marries a person other than an Indian, or an Indian of another band, from that which is to obtain when a male Indian marries a person other than an Indian, or an Indian who is a member of another band.RE Lavell and Attorney General of Canada (1971), 22 D.L.R. (3d) 188 at 191. Justice Thurlow also noted that should a male Indian marry a non-Indian, not only will his legal status as an Indian remain unchanged, the Indian Act also provides that his wife may also be registered as an Indian.RE Lavell and Attorney General of Canada (1971) at 190. Being of the opinion that the Court could not apply the Indian Act in the case at bar without infringing the appellant's rights under the Canadian Bill of Rights, Justice Thurlow declared the impugned provision inoperative. Background to Mrs. B√©dard Yvonne B√©dard was born in the Six Nations Indian Reserve in Brantford as a member of the Iroquois Nation. In May 1964, Mrs. B√©dard married a non-Indian, begetting two children with him. Mrs. B√©dard and her spouse lived together off the Reserve until June 23, 1970, when they separated. Mrs. B√©dard returned with her two children to the Reserve to live in a house bequeathed to her by her mother, Carrie Williams.B√©dard v. Isaac (1971), 25 D.L.R. (3d) 551 (Ont. S.C.) at 552‚Äì553. Since Mrs B√©dard had married a non-Indian, she was no longer listed in the Registry as an Indian. When she began to occupy the house on the reserve, the Six Nations Band Council passed a resolution ordering Mrs. B√©dard to dispose of the property within the next six months, during which time she could live there. The Council later adopted two additional resolutions allowing Mrs. B√©dard to live in the house for another six months, and then another two months, but no longer than that. In order to act in accordance with the Council's resolutions, Mrs. B√©dard eventually transferred ownership of the property to her brother (a registered member of the Band) who was granted a Certificate of Possession of the property on March 15, 1971, by the Minister of Indian Affairs as required by the Indian Act.Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell (1974) at 1355 Mrs. B√©dard and her children, with her brother's consent, remained to occupy the premises without rent. On September 15, 1971, the Six Nations Band Council passed Resolution 15, requesting the Brantford District Supervisor to serve notice to Mrs. B√©dard that she shall quit the Reserve.B√©dard v. Isaac (1971) at 553‚Äì554. Mrs. B√©dard would later lose her status as an Indian shortly after taking the Six Nations Band Council to Court, slightly before she could deliver her statement of claim against the Council. After the Six Nations Band Council passed Resolution 15, Mrs. B√©dard immediately sought an injunction in court to enjoin her expulsion from the Reserve as well as an order setting aside Resolution 15, passed by the Band Council. The motion for an injunction was later withdrawn in court, with Mrs. B√©dard's counsel agreeing that only a declaratory relief against the Six Nations Band Council would be sought.Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell (1974) at 1377B√©dard v. Isaac (1971) at 552. Mrs. B√©dard argued that the Band Council's resolution, authorizing that a request be made to the District Supervisor to expel her from the Reserve, and any action taken in accordance with such a request by the District Supervisor, as well as the removal of her name from the Band Registry because of her marriage to a non-Indian constituted discrimination on the basis of sex and race viz-√†-viz her right to the \\"enjoyment of property, and the right not to be deprived thereof except by due process of law\\", guaranteed by Section 1(a) of the Canadian Bill of Rights.B√©dard v. Isaac (1971) at 554. Therefore, she asserted, it follows that the Band Council's actions are without force or effect. The Band Council, the defendants in the case, argued, by contrary, that not every distinction is necessarily discriminatory. Only those distinctions which are adverse to the group with which they are being made can be categorized as discrimination as used in the Canadian Bill of Rights. To that end, the defendant is given \\"some advantages elsewhere in the Act\\" with which do not apply to male Indians, and thus compensates for certain disadvantages she may experience.B√©dard v. Isaac, (1971) at 556. Judgement of the Ontario Supreme Court Judge Osler, in his reasons for judgement, held that Section 12(1)(b) is inoperative by virtue of the Canadian Bill of Rights. The judge rejected the reasoning of the defendant that such \\"disadvantages\\" produced by the Indian Act can be \\"compensated\\" for by other provisions which favour Indian women. The distinction made by the Indian Act, he asserts, whether the said distinction must be adverse or not to constitute discrimination, is clearly adverse toward the plaintiff to constitute discrimination: :: it is perfectly apparent that the loss of status as an Indian and the loss of the right to be registered and to occupy property upon a reserve is discrimination which is adverse to the interest of Indian women ... With respect to the Federal Court of Appeal's decision in Re Lavell and Attorney General of Canada, he holds that it is not binding as a matter of stare decisis. Judge Osler, however, held it of persuasive value which, in light of the reasons given by the Supreme Court of Canada in Drybones, he found correct as a matter of law. In particular, he agreed that since Indian women obtain a different result for marrying a non- Indian spouse, it is \\"plainly discrimination by reason of sex with respect to the rights of an individual to the enjoyment of property\\". Therefore, pursuant to the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in Drybones, Osler held that it is \\"the duty of the Court ... to declare s. 12(1)(b) of the Indian Act inoperative\\", which he did, declaring all actions of the Band Council and the District Supervisor in accordance with the impugned provision to be of no effect.B√©dard v. Isaac, (1971) at 557. Judgement of the Supreme Court of Canada The cases of both Mrs. Lavell and Mrs. B√©dard's cases were appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada and were heard together. In a 4‚Äì1‚Äì4 vote, the Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeals, setting aside the respective judgements of the Ontario Supreme Court and Federal Court of Appeal. Plurality opinion Justice Ritchie, writing for the plurality (Fauteux C.J., Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.), held that the enfranchisement of Indian women for marrying a non-Indian, as devised under Section 12(1)(b) of the Indian Act, did not constitute a denial of the respondent's right to equality before the law. Hence, Ritchie did not find that the impugned Section of the Indian Act is inoperative. In the course of making this decision, Justice Ritchie addressed numerous questions of law as follows. Firstly, Ritchie held that the Canadian Bill of Rights did not have the effect of rendering the entirety of The Indian Act inoperative because it deals solely with Indians (i.e. allegedly discrimination). Such a proposition, he argued, stands in contrast to the Court's jurisprudence and the very tenets of the common law, and dismissed it as a thinly veiled assault on the powers given exclusively to the Federal Parliament by the Constitution: > To suggest that the provisions of the Bill of Rights have the effect of > making the whole Indian Act inoperative as discriminatory is to assert that > the Bill [of Rights] has rendered Parliament powerless to exercise the > authority entrusted to it under the constitution of enacting legislation > which treats Indians living on Reserves differently from other Canadians in > relation to their property and civil rights.Attorney General of Canada v. > Lavell (1974) at 1359. Ritchie argued that Parliament cannot properly exercise the powers vested in it, if it cannot define the qualifications required to be an Indian and to \\"use and benefit of Crown lands reserved for Indians\\". Also, citing the preamble to the Canadian Bill of Rights (which describes Parliament's intention to enact a Bill of Rights \\"which shall reflect the respect of Parliament for its constitutional authority\\"), it would appear, Ritchie asserted, that the Bill does not purport to \\"amend or alter the terms of the British North America Act\\".Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell (1974) at 1358. Moreover, Ritchie also noted that the majority in Drybones clearly disavowed of an approach that would render an entire Act inoperative because of a violation, which held instead that only the offending provision should be construed as inoperative. Secondly, Ritchie also held that Parliament did not intend the Canadian Bill of Rights to fundamentally change or alter any constitutional scheme such as those contained in the Indian Act and, in particular, those provisions which constitute a \\"necessary structure . . . for the internal administration of the life of Indians on Reserves and their entitlement to the use and benefit of Crown lands\\"?Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell (1974) at 1360. It was a widely accepted convention, he argues, that an Act, in which Parliament exercises its constitutional functions, can only be changed or amended \\"by plain statutory language expressly enacted for the [that] purpose.\\" With respect to this case, he contended that Parliament did not intend to amend the Indian Act with the \\"use of broad general language directed at the statutory proclamation of the fundamental rights and freedoms enjoyed by all Canadians . . . Citing the case of Barker v. Edger[1898] A.C. 748. with approval and applying the Privy Council's reasoning in that case, Ritchie concluded that the Canadian Bill of Rights, likewise, did not and cannot amend the Indian Act. For good measure, Ritchie also noted that Justice Pigeon came to similar conclusion in Drybones.Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell (1974) at 1361‚Äì1362, referring to The Queen v. Drybones (1970) at 304. Thirdly, Justice Ritchie also disagreed with the respondent's interpretation of Justice Laskin's opinion in CurrCurr v. The Queen, [1972] S.C.R. 889. that a provision of a statute is inoperative purely on the basis of discrimination and that a violation of one of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by Section 1 of the Canadian Bill of Rights need not be established. Ritchie contends that Justice Laskin merely stated in his majority opinion that the rights guaranteed in paragraphs (a) to (f) (of Section 1) are guaranteed \\"irrespective of race, national origin, colour or sex.\\" In other words, Section 1 rights are universal, which he argues is supported by the locution of the French version of the Bill of Rights.Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell (1974) at 1363. Furthermore, Ritchie held that the notion that the Bill of Rights prohibits discrimination alone does not comport with the purposes of the Bill of Rights, which are to guarantee that the rights and freedoms that are 'recognized and declared.' The right to be free of discrimination, he remarks, is not one of them per se.Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell (1974) at 1363‚Äì1364. Finally, Justice Ritchie held that the question of law that is applicable in the present case should be > ... confined to deciding whether the Parliament of Canada in defining the > prerequisites of Indian Status so as not to include women of Indian birth > who have chosen to marry non-Indians, enacted a law which cannot be sensibly > construed and applied without abrogating, abriding or infringing the rights > of such women to equality before the law.Attorney General of Canada v. > Lavell (1974) at 1365. To that end, Ritchie held that the meaning of rights and freedoms in the Bill of Rights is exactly the same meaning \\"which it bore in Canada at the time when the Bill was enacted, and it follows that the phrase 'equality before the law' is to be construed in light of the law existing in Canada at that time.\\" In Ritchie's opinion, 'equality before the law' cannot be construed as \\"the egalitarian concept exemplified by the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution ... \\" Instead, citing the preamble of the Bill of Rights, Ritchie contended that 'equality before the law' should be construed in the context of the rule of law. Drawing from the writings of Dicey, Ritchie remarked that 'equality before the law' is described as an aspect of the rule of law that \\"carries the meaning of equal subjection of all classes to the ordinary law of the land as administered by the ordinary courts.\\" Ritchie also extended this interpretation of 'equality before the law' to the \\"application of the law by law enforcement authorities.\\"Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell (1974) at 1366. Applying, this interpretation of 'equality before the law', Ritchie noted that the impugned scheme has been in force and effect since 1869, that is for at least a hundred years.Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell (1974) at 1368‚Äì1369. Furthermore, Ritchie argued that a \\"careful reading\\" of the Indian Act reveals that the section held inoperative in Drybones was criminal legislation \\"exclusively concerned with behaviour of Indians off a Reserve\\", whereas Section 12(1)(b) is legislation \\"enacted as a part of the plan devised by Parliament, under s. 91(24) [of the British North America Act for the regulation of the internal domestic life of Indians on Reserves.\\"Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell (1974) at 1370. Drybones, therefore, can be distinguished from this case, Ritchie argued, because the majority of the Court in Drybones held that the impugned section \\"could not be enforced without bring about inequality between one group of citizens and another and that this inequality was occasioned by reason of the race of the accused.\\"Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell (1974) at 1371. This case, Ritchie noted, does not involve the criminal law; therefore, Drybones \\"can ... have no application to the present appeals\\". As such, Ritchie concluded that there is no denial of \\"equality before the law\\", since \\"no such inequality is necessarily entailed in the construction and application of s. 12(1)(b)\\".Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell (1974) at 1371‚Äì173. Ritchie expounded upon this stating on p. 1371 that > The fundamental distinction between the present case and that of Drybones, > however, appears to me to be that the impugned section in the latter case > could not be enforce without denying equality of treatment in the > administration and enforcement of the law before the ordinary courts of the > land to a racial group, whereas no such inequality of treatment between > Indian men and women flows as a necessary result of the application of s. > 12(1)(b) of the Indian Act. Concurring opinion Justice Pigeon, in a concurring opinion, agreed with the result of the plurality. However, citing his dissent in Drybones, Pigeon chided the majority on the Court who would persist in giving the Bill of Rights \\"an invalidating effect over prior legislation\\". Pigeon asserted that the majority of the court which once disagreed with his dissent, \\"now adopt it for the main body of this important statute\\". It, therefore, he stated, \\"cannot be improper for me to adhere to what was my dissenting view\\".Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell (1974) at 1390. Pigeon argued that the Canadian Bill of Rights need not have an invalidating effect, at all. He pointed out that there have been many cases in which a simple reinterpretation of the impugned legislation are \\"important illustration of the effectiveness of the Bill without any invalidating effect\\". Dissenting opinions The remaining four Justices dissented, rejecting the holding of the plurality that R v Drybones must be distinguished from the case at bar and Pigeon's opinion that the Canadian Bill of Rights cannot render a law inoperative by virtue of a violation of one of its enumerated rights. =Laskin= Writing also for Justices Hall and Spence, Justice Laskin wrote a strong dissent. \\"It is\\", Justice Laskin wrote, \\"impossible to distinguish Drybones, which he has \\"no disposition to reject.\\"Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell (1974) at 1375. Justice Laskin argued that Drybones decided two things. First, Drybones decided that the Canadian Bill of Rights was \\"more than a mere interpretation statute whose terms would yield to a contrary intention.\\" Rather, he stated, it is the provisions of the Canadian Bill of Rights that take precedence over the provisions of a conflicting federal statute.Attorney General of Canada v Lavell (1974) at 1382. Secondly, Laskin stated that Drybones decided that the accused had been denied equality before the law on the basis that it was a criminal offence for him to do something, purely on the basis of his race. Laskin contended that Justice Ritchie's own opinion in Drybones, the majority opinion, made it explicitly clear that a denial of a respondent's equality before the law was apparent because a distinction had been made solely on account of the respondent's race. In light of these reasons, Laskin asserted that it would be unprincipled for the Court to now construe Drybones as contingent solely on the basis that the impugned section of the Indian Act created a punishable criminal offence.Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell (1974) at 1383. \\"The gist of the judgement\\", Laskin wrote, \\"lay in the legal disability imposed upon a person by reason of his race when other persons were under no similar restraint.\\" Since the impugned Section of the Indian Act imposes disabilities and prescribes disqualifications for members of the female sex that are not imposed upon members of the male sex in the same circumstances, Laskin argued that if the reasoning in Drybones was actually applied to the appeals the Court would have no choice but to find a denial of the respondents' equality before the law. Furthermore, Laskin rejected the notion that a distinction on the basis of sex does not violate the Canadian Bill of Rights where that distinction is applicable only among Indians. On the contrary, he wrote, it is a notion \\"that compounds racial inequality even beyond the point that the Drybones case found unacceptable\\". Justice Laskin noted that \\"there is no absolute disqualification of an Indian woman from registrability on the Indian Register ... by marrying outside a Band unless the marriage is to a non-Indian\\".Attorney General of Canada v Lavell (1974) at 1384. Laskin also rejected the argument that \\"discrimination embodied in the Indian Act under s. 12(1)(b)\\" must be subject to a \\"reasonable classification test\\" (as adopted by the United States Supreme Court when dealing with similar violations under the Fifth Amendment) and that it is justified, as a reasonable classification, because the \\"paramount purpose of the [Indian] Act to preserve and protect the members of the race is promoted by the statutory preference for Indian men\\".Attorney General of Canada v Lavell (1974) at 1386. Laskin declareed that U.S. case law on the subject is \\"at best a marginal relevance\\" because of the limitations imposed on the judiciary by the Canadian Bill of Rights. Even if such a test had been applied, Laskin contended that it is dubious that discrimination on the basis of sex could be justified as a 'reasonable classification' when \\"it has no biological or physiological rationale\\".Attorney General of Canada v Lavell (1974) at 1386‚Äì1387. Moreover, Laskin did not accept the argument that a reasonable classification test can be incorporated into the right of equality before the law, since that would be precluded by \\"the telling words of s. 1, 'without discrimination by reason of race, national origin, colour, religion or sex.\\"Attorney General of Canada v Lavell (1974) at 1387. \\"In short,\\" Laskin writes, > the proscribed s. 1 have a force either independent of the subsequently > enumerated clauses (a) to (f) or, if they are found in any federal > legislation, they offend those clauses because each must be read as if the > prohibited forms of discrimination were recited therein as a part thereof. Laskin argued that this view is largely manifested by and contained in Drybones and Curr.Attorney General of Canada v Lavell (1974) at 1387‚Äì1388. In addition, Laskin asserted that the position taken by the appellants has no historical basis and even if it did, \\"history cannot avail against the clear words of ss. 1 and 2 of the Canadian Bill of Rights\\". Those sections, Laskin contended, makes it abundantly clear that the Canadian Bill of Rights does not contain purely declaratory provisions. Rather, Laskin held the Bill does not permit a violation of its provisions regardless of whether the impugned statute was enacted prior to or after the enactment of the Bill of Rights.Attorney General of Canada v Lavell (1974) at 1388. Finally, Laskin discarded the argument that the discrimination in question is not offensive to the Bill of Rights simply because Parliament enacted the impugned section of the law under its constitutional authority as provided by the British North America Act. \\"The majority opinion in the Drybones case\\", Laskin noted, \\"dispels any attempt to rely on the grant of legislative power as a ground for escaping from the force of the Canadian Bill of Rights.\\"Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell (1974) at 1389. Laskin remarked that Section 3 of the Bill of Rights indeed affirms that its constitutional jurisdiction is not at issues when the Bill of Rights commands the Minister of Justice to evaluate every government bill to ensure consistency with the Bill of Rights. =Abbott= Writing for himself in a dissenting opinion, Abbott indicated his agreement with Justice Laskin that Drybones cannot be distinguished from the two cases under appeal.Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell (1974) at 1373. \\"In that case,\\" Abbott wrote, \\"this Court rejected the contention that s. 1 of the Canadian Bill of Rights provided merely a canon of construction for the interpretation of legislation existing when the Bill was passed.\\"Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell (1974) at 1374. Abbott declared that the plurality's interpretation of 'equality before the law' with respect to Dicey's writings, is therefore inappropriate. Abbott, furthermore, asserted that without giving effect to the words \\"without discrimination by reason of race, national origin, colour religion or sex\\" as used in section 1, the plurality has effectively deprived them of any significance as though they are \\"mere rhetorical window dressing.\\" Also, Justice Abbott took the opportunity to comment on the effect of the Bill of Rights, stating famously: > In my view the Canadian Bill of Rights has substantially affected the > doctrine of the supremacy of Parliament. Like any other statute it can of > course be repealed or amended, or a particular law declared to be applicable > notwithstanding the provisions of the Bill. In form the supremacy of > Parliament in maintained but in practice I think that it has been > substantially curtailed. In my opinion that result is undesirable, but that > is a matter for consideration by Parliament not the courts. Finally, Justice Abbott held that he would have dismissed the appeal in favour of the respondents. Significance as precedent=Lavell's influence over the wording of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms The plurality's decision in the case was very controversial and would prove influential in the drafting of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the successor of the Canadian Bill of Rights. Indeed, the Supreme Court's narrow and restrained interpretations of the Canadian Bill of Rights in cases like Lavell certainly reinforced the push for an entrenched bill of rights, like the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Section 15 of the October 1980 draft version of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guaranteed: > 15\\\\. (1) Everyone has the right to equality before the law and to the equal > protection of the law without discrimination because of race, national or > ethnic origin, colour, religion, age or sex. (2) This Section does not > preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object the > amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged persons or groups.Hogg, Peter W. > Constitutional Law of Canada. 2004 Student Ed. (Scarborough, Ontario: > Thomson Canada Limited, 2003), at 1083, footnote 36. In light of the plurality's decision of Lavell in which Justice Ritchie held that \\"equality before the law\\" required only the equal administration of the law and did not concern the actual substance of the law or require equal laws per se; Section 15(1) was later revised to include the concept of \\"equality under the law\\" to indicate that the equality guarantees are sufficiently broad to include a requirement of substantive equality.Hogg, Peter W. Constitutional Law of Canada. 2004 Student Ed. (Scarborough, Ontario: Thomson Canada Limited, 2003), at 1087. Peter Hogg stated, \\"The words 'and under' were intended to abrogate a suggestion by Ritchie J. in the Lavell case, that judicial review on equality grounds did not extend to the substance of the law but only to the way in which it was administered.\\" Aftermath of Section 12(1)(b) of the Indian Act The impact of Section 12(1)(b) of the Indian Act, which was upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada in Lavell, continued to have devastating consequences for women. Indian women who would later marry a non-Indian would lose their status as well as the children of the marriage. Furthermore, disenfranchised Indian women were prohibited from *residing on their reserve *inheriting family property *receiving treaty benefits *participating in band councils and other affairs of the Indian community *being buried in cemeteries with their ancestors That was in stark contrast to non-Indian women if they married Indian men since the former would gain Indian status. According to the Royal Commission on the Status of Women, about 4,605 Indian women lost their Indian status by marrying white men between 1958 and 1968. Section 12(1)(b) of the Indian Act was finally repealed in 1985 by the Parliament of Canada, after the United Nations International Human Rights Commission ruled that the removal of Indian status on account of sex was contrary to international law.

It formed in July in the Bay of Campeche, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. As a tropical wave, Gert crossed Honduras and the Yucat√°n peninsula before organizing into Tropical Depression Seven on the afternoon of July 23 in the Bay of Campeche. It was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gert early the next day, gaining the record for the earliest formation of a seventh named storm in an Atlantic hurricane season. That record would later be broken by Tropical Storm Gonzalo in 2020. Gert strengthened little before making landfall south of Tampico, Tamaulipas, late on July 24, with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (70 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 1005 mbar (29.68 inHg). It moved inland over central Mexico before dissipating on the next day. Gert struck in approximately the same area as Hurricane Emily just four days earlier, causing fear of flooding and landslides due to saturated lands. As a precaution, some 1,000 people were evacuated from low-lying residences and businesses near the towns of Naranjos Amatl√°n and Tamiahua.  Meteorological history  A tropical wave entered the Atlantic Ocean from Africa on July 10, and the wave developed into an area of low pressure while passing over Cape Verde. Despite the organization, the low failed to develop into a tropical cyclone due to cool waters on the sea surface and wind shear. However, those unfavorable conditions did not completely destroy the wave, as it continued traveling westward through the Lesser Antilles until July 18. That day, while south of Puerto Rico, the wave split in two; the northern half moved northwest and developed into Tropical Storm Franklin over the Bahamas, and the southern half continued westward, with its associated thunderstorm activity increasing. On July 22, a new low pressure area developed while the tropical wave was located over the Gulf of Honduras. However, this area of disturbed weather was unable to develop further, because the storm quickly moved over the Yucat√°n Peninsula. After its one-day passage through the peninsula, the system entered the Bay of Campeche, but lacked any deep convection. This time, though, the wave quickly developed the deep convection it needed to become a tropical cyclone. In part, this was due to the Sierra Madre Oriental enhancing large-scale rotation of the disturbance by forcing air to flow parallel to the mountain range, instead of through it. As a result, the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida designated it as Tropical Depression Seven, just 255 miles east-southeast of Tuxpan, Mexico. Early on the July 24, the cyclone was upgraded to a tropical storm with winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) and received the name Gert. Gert continued to move northwest after becoming a tropical storm, and reached a peak intensity of 45 mph (70 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 1005 mbar (29.68 inHg). Gert made landfall just 6 miles (10 km) to the southeast of P√°nuco, still at peak intensity, at 10:00 p.m. CDT (00:00 July 25, UTC). However, due to its interaction with land, the storm quickly weakened back to a tropical depression strength early on July 25, and became a remnant low twelve hours after that. Six hours later, just a day after it made landfall, it dissipated over the mountains of central Mexico.  Preparations  The track of Tropical Storm Gert was slightly more to the north than the National Hurricane Center's initial predictions, giving the storm more time to develop. As a result, the NHC predicted that Gert could intensify further, but this did not occur. The primary emphasis of the forecasts was on the impact the rainfall from Gert could cause, particularly on this area of Mexico, which had been hit previously in the season by other hurricanes. On July 23, the Mexican Servicio Meteorol√≥gico Nacional (National Weather Service) issued a tropical storm warning for the eastern Mexican Gulf coast between Palma Sola and Cabo Rojo, as soon as Tropical Depression Seven formed. At that time, a tropical storm watch was issued from Cabo Rojo northward, until reaching La Cruz. That same day, the government of Veracruz declared a state of emergency in 24 municipalities of the state, making money from the National Disaster Fund available to those affected by the storm. As Gert came closer to the coast, the tropical storm warning was extended northwards to La Cruz, and then to La Pesca, but it was canceled shortly after landfall. Tropical Storm Gert struck just south of where Category 3 Hurricane Emily had struck, and where Tropical Storm Bret hit in late June. As a result, there were concerns that serious flooding and mudslides would result due to saturated ground. As a precaution, about 1,000 people were evacuated from low-lying residences and businesses near the towns of Naranjos Amatl√°n and Tamiahua in Veracruz, and about 6,000 throughout Tamaulipas.  Impact  The highest 24-hour rainfall reports were 214.9 mm (8.46 in) in Tamuin, San Luis Potos√≠, and 185.2 mm (7.29 in) in Tamesi, Tamaulipas. In Veracruz, the highest precipitation reading associated with Gert was 117 mm, (4.61 in) in El Higo. However, damage overall was minimal, amounting to $6 million (2005 USD, $60 million 2005 MXN), and there was only one reported fatality, from a man who was carried away by the La Silla River when he was pushing a stalled car across the flooded stream.  Tamaulipas  According to the government of Tamaulipas, most of the damage in the state was in farmland and in residents' dwellings, primarily near Matamoros, Valle Hermoso, Reynosa and San Fernando. In Matamoros, part of the city lost power and running water; in Valle Hermoso, two schools were damaged; in Reynosa, 180 people were evacuated from low-lying areas in five districts of the city, while in San Fernando, the main highway through the city was closed, and traffic on the bridge over the Conchos River was restricted to one lane. In Mier, the spillway of the Las Blancas Dam was overtopped, causing a river bridge to be destroyed and electric power to be lost, as well. In R√≠o Bravo, 50 families were evacuated as seven collective farms became hard to reach by road; approximately 90% of the residences in the farms were affected by the storm. In Altamira, 200 families were evacuated as well, and relocated to seven shelters. Also, in the municipalities of Burgos, Cruillas, and M√©ndez there was flooding in collective farms and family dwellings. Overall, the municipalities of Mier, Reynosa, R√≠o Bravo, Valle Hermoso, Matamoros, San Fernando, San Carlos, Burgos, Cruillas, M√©ndez, Soto la Marina, Mante and Altamira were affected in the state, losing potable water and electricity. After the storm, the state government promised to take the necessary steps to prevent an outbreak of dengue and West Nile virus; however, by June 29, there had already been 187 cases of classic dengue, and 29 of hemorrhagic dengue, up from 8 cases two years before, and none the previous year.  Nuevo Le√≥n  In Nuevo Le√≥n, about 6,000 residents who lived near the Conchos, Guayalejo, and Grande Rivers were evacuated from their residences across the state. Also, the precipitation from Gert caused about 100 collective farms to become isolated from the rest of the state in the municipality of Montemorelos. In the city, one building was evacuated, as a 100 ft (30 m) fissure appeared on the ground near the structure. In the municipalities of San Vicente Tancuayalab, Valles and Ebano, 100 people were evacuated.

It is about an 11-year-old girl and her best friend Tico, a female orca. Unlike the other series in Nippon Animation's World Masterpiece Theater line, Tico of the Seven Seas is an entirely original story. An English dub of the series, entitled Tico & Friends, was produced by Ocean Studios. The dubbed series omits major character deaths and also edits out some violent, bloody and death scenes; one episode from the original version, which focuses on the aftermath of a major character death, is even omitted completely and replaced with a makeshift clip show episode (although some scenes from the omitted episode are included in the replacement). Plot Nanami Simpson is a young Japanese-American girl. Having lost her mother when was young, she now lives with her marine biologist father, Scott Simpson, on board his research vessel, the Peperonchino. Scott has been in search of a creature known as the Luminous Whale, a whale that can glow brightly underwater, for many years and is determined to eventually see it and preserve it's exsistence. Nanami also is close friends with an orca named Tico, who was rescued as a baby just before Nanami was born. The two have an unbreakable bond and swim with each other every day. As a result, Nanami gradually learns to hold her breath longer and swim deeper than other humans can. Scott's search from the Luminous Whale soon puts him at odds with the Gaiatron Corporation, a greedy research conglomerate led by the ruthless and ambitious Adrienne Benex, who wishes to exploit the creature for a rare element it seemingly carries in its body. Aiding Benex are her right-hand man, Gaulois, and Dr. Charles LeConte, an old acquaintance of Scott's who is obsessed with the Luminous Whale. Together, Nanami, Scott, and Tico, along with Scott's first-mate and right-hand man, Al Andretti, seek to locate the Luminous Whale before Benex and Gaiatron can. Over time, they are joined by a few new crew members: * Cheryl Melville, an English-American heiress looking for adventure. * James McIntyre, Cheryl's loyal butler. * Thomas LeConte, Dr. LeConte's introverted and lonely, but intelligent son, who wishes to prove himself capable in the real world. * Junior, Tico's calf, born nearly halfway through the series. As their journey goes on, the crew of Peperonchino encounter and make both new friends and enemies, and form bonds with each other, as they race against the corrupt Benex and Gaiatron to find the Luminous Whale first. Characters=Main ; Nanami Simpson : Voiced by Megumi Hayashibara; Chantal Strand in the English dub : Nanami is the main protagonist in the series. At 11-years old, she claims all from the sea are her friends. She has been friends with Tico ever since she was a baby, and has a close relationship with her father Scott, and friendships with all of their crew members throughout the series. ; Tico : A killer whale who is a life-long friend to Nanami. In the Japanese version, she dies freeing Al's submersible from an iceberg crevice, which mortally injures her, and her body sinks to the depths of the sea, while Nanami looks on helplessly. In the last episode, \\"The Shining Circle\\" her spirit reunites with Nanami and her son via the Luminous Whale. In the English dub, she is still injured, but survives and the crew is forced to leave her behind to let her recover. She returns a few episodes later, shortly after her son Junior leaves the crew to join a super-pod of killer whales. In the final episode, the spirit that Tico reunites with turns out to be her own long-lost mother. ; Junior : Junior is Tico's calf. In the Japanese original series, he takes Tico's place as Nanami's companion, along with her name, after the former sacrifices herself to save Al. He meets his mother again the series finale, \\"The Shining Circle\\". In the English dub, his mother survives, and is left behind to recover, returning not long after he leaves to join a super-pod of killer whales. ; Scott Simpson : Voiced by Shuuichi Ikeda; David Kaye in the English dub : Nanami's father, who is a marine biologist, and captain of the Peperoncino. He has been searching for the Luminous Whale for seven years. He is a dedicated father to his daughter and is often the level-headed one for his crew. Scott is also very protective of his research of the Luminous Whale, refusing to let it or the creature itself fall into the wrong hands. ; Alfonso \\"Al\\" Andretti : A fat Italian man who works with Scott, and always on the lookout for treasure. He is the chef and engineer of Peperoncino and often comes up with get-rich quick schemes in order to make the crew money. He serves as something of an uncle and mentor to Nanami and later to Thomas as well. A scene where he punches Professor LeConte in the stomach is removed. ; Cheryl Christina Melville : Voiced by Venus Terzo in the English dub. : An English-American woman who comes from a wealthy family and craves adventure. She initially has a frosty relationship with the crew, particularly Nanami and Al (due to her joining the crew on a whim, and her initial reluctance to due any actual work), but they all soon warm up to her, and she ends up becoming a valued member and even something of a big sister to Nanami and Thomas. Due to her wealth, she often serves as the source for emergency funds when the crew needs them. Initially, she relies on her butler James to do the crew work for her, but later starts contributing by herself following his brief departure from the crew in the seventh episode, and becomes more independent as a result. ; James McIntyre : Voiced by David Kaye in the English dub : Cheryl's loyal butler. Born near the Cliffs of Dover, he has served the Melville family faithfully for many years, and is charged with looking after Cheryl while she attends college in New York. James joins the crew of the Peperoncino at the same time as Cheryl, but leaves in the seventh episode and joins the crew of the Gaiatron ship Scorpio, after switching places with Thomas LeConte. He returns to the Peperoncino ten episodes later, and remains with the crew up to the series finale. ; Thomas LeConte : A boy the Peperoncino crew met in the Bahamas and the son of scientist Dr. Charles LeConte. Intelligent and computer-savvy, but also introverted, lonely, and somewhat cautious, he craves attention from his father, but is often pushed aside and neglected due to Dr. LeConte's research regarding the Luminous Whale. In his first appearance in the second episode, he cons Nanami and Al in helping him return to his ship in return for a treasure map that turns out to be fake. Several episodes later, the crew meets him again on his father's ship, and after being rescued after getting trapped underwater in the Peperoncino's mini-sub, he decides to join their crew to go out into the world and become more extroverted, becoming Al's unofficial apprentice and Nanami's closest human friend. By the end of the series, he manages to patch things up with his father. Other characters ; Nagisa Suzuki : Nanami's aunt from her mother, Yuko's side of the family. ; Gayle : A con-man with a heart of gold, and a crush on Cheryl. He also has a fear of fish. ; Richard : A free-lance photographer who informs the Peperoncino crew about Metal Claw's activities. ; Lolo : Richard's pet parrot. ; Metal Claw : Voiced by Daisuke Gouri; Scott McNeil in the English dub : A villain from the earlier part in the series, he is a man who has a metal hand in place of his right hand. Captain of the Mentil. ; Professor Charles LeConte : A scientist who is an old acquaintance of Scott Simpson, and Thomas's father. Obsessed with the Luminous Whale, LeConte's determination to find it causes him to ally himself with the corrupt Gaiatron Corporation, and neglect his son. By the end of the series, however, he learns the error of his ways and reconciles with Thomas. A scene where he slaps his son is edited out in the English Dub. ; Stephen : A member of the crew on the Scorpio. ; Topia : Voiced by Akiko Yajima ; Enrico Andretti : Voiced by Bin Shimada : A cousin of Al's, who lives with their 94-year-old grandmother. ; Don Gould (Mr. Krang in the English dub) : Head of the Rio Connection. ; Rozalint : Voiced by Hisako Ky≈çda ; Adrienne Benex : Voiced by Chiyoko Kawashima : The main villain of the series. Professor LeConte's superior, she owns the Gaiatron Corporation. She wants the luminous whale due to an element it is said to have, called trontium. In the Japanese series, she is killed when seagulls attack and incapacitate the pilots of her escape helicopter, causing it to crash into her Antarctic Base, The Iron City, with her in it. The seagulls were summoned, along with other animals, by the luminous whale to attack the base. This is edited out in the English dub. ; Gaulois : Voiced by Keisuke Yamashita : Benex's underling. ; Terry Taft : Voiced by Yumi T≈çma : A wheelchair-bound boy Nanami meets. He lost the use of his legs at the same time he lost his sister, Maggie. ; Opiac : A young girl of the north Arctic whose grandfather is a descendant of one of has seen the luminous whale. ; Luminous whale : A whale whose body glows yellow. It is semi-supernatural, as it summoned animals to attack the iron city base, showed Nanami her future, and brought the Ghost of Tico for a final Goodbye to her friend and Son. It can still die though, as evidence by its fossils being found by Scott Simpson, and it almost drying up when hoisted out of the Ocean by Adrienne Bennex's men.

Error Management Theory According to Error Management Theory, when making decisions under conditions of uncertainty, two kinds of errors need to be taken into account‚Äî\\"false positives\\", i.e. deciding that a risk or benefit exists when it does not, and \\"false negatives\\", i.e. failing to notice a risk or benefit that exists. False positives are also commonly called \\"Type I errors\\", and false negatives are called \\"Type II errors\\". Where the cost or impact of a Type I error is much greater than the cost of a Type II error (e.g. the water is safe to drink), it can be worthwhile to bias the decision-making system towards making fewer Type I errors, i.e. making it less likely to conclude that a particular situation exists. This by definition would also increase the number of Type II errors. Conversely, where a false positive is much less costly than a false negative (blood tests, smoke detectors), it makes sense to bias the system towards maximising the probability that a particular (very costly) situation will be recognised, even if this often leads to the (relatively un-costly) event of noticing something that is not actually there. This situation is exhibited in modern airport screening‚Äîmaximising the probability of preventing a high-cost terrorist event results in frequent, low-cost screening hassles for harmless travelers who represent a minimal threat. state that cognitive bias can be expected to have developed in humans for cognitive tasks where: * decision- making is complicated by a significant signal-detection problem (i.e. when there is uncertainty) * the solution to the particular kind of decision-making problem has had a recurrent effect on survival and fitness throughout evolutionary history * the costs of a \\"false positive\\" or \\"false negative\\" error dramatically outweighs the cost of the alternative type of error The costly information hypothesis The costly information hypothesis is used to explore how adaptive biases relate to cultural evolution within the field of dual inheritance theory. The focus is on the evolutionary trade-offs in cost between individual learning, (e.g., operant conditioning) and social learning. If more accurate information that could be acquired through individual learning is too costly, evolution may favor learning mechanisms that, in turn, are biased towards less costly, (though potentially less accurate), information via social learning.

Salazar (previously Cobell v. Kempthorne and Cobell v. Norton and Cobell v. Babbitt) is a class-action lawsuit brought by Elouise Cobell (Blackfeet) and other Native American representatives in 1996 against two departments of the United States government: the Department of Interior and the Department of the Treasury for mismanagement of Indian trust funds. It was settled in 2009. The plaintiffs claim that the U.S. government has incorrectly accounted for the income from Indian trust assets, which are legally owned by the Department of the Interior, but held in trust for individual Native Americans (the beneficial owners). The case was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The original complaint asserted no claims for mismanagement of the trust assets, since such claims could only properly be asserted in the United States Court of Federal Claims. The case is sometimes reported as the largest class-action lawsuit against the U.S. in history, but this is disputed. Plaintiffs contend that the number of class members is around 500,000, while defendants maintain it is closer to 250,000. The potential liability of the U.S. government in the case is also disputed: plaintiffs have suggested a figure as high as $176 billion, and defendants have suggested a number in the low millions, at most. The case was settled for $3.4 billion in 2009. $1.4 billion was allocated to be paid to the plaintiffs and $2 billion allocated to repurchase fractionated land interests from those distributed under the Dawes Act and to return it to reservations and communal tribal ownership. In addition, a scholarship fund for Native American and Alaska Native students was created, to be funded from purchase of fractionated lands. It is named the Cobell Educational Scholarship Fund in honor of lead plaintiff Elouise Cobell, who filed suit against the government in 1996 and persisted with the case until settlement. The scholarship fund has a cap of $60 million; $40 million had been contributed to the fund by November 2016. By November 2016, the Department of Interior had paid $900 million to individual landholders for the fair market value of their fractionated lands, and transferred an estimated 1.7 million acres to tribal reservations for communal use. As more reservations are participating in the program, the pace of buy back has increased. Early Federal Indian trust law The history of the Indian trust is inseparable from the larger context of the Federal government‚Äôs relationship with American Indians, and its policies as that relationship evolved. At its core, the Indian trust is an artifact of a nineteenth-century Federal policy. Its late 20th-century form bore the imprint of subsequent policy evolution. During the late 1800s, Congress and the Executive branch believed that the best way to foster assimilation of Indians was to \\"introduce among the Indians the customs and pursuits of civilized life and gradually absorb them into the mass of our citizens.\\" Under the \\"General Allotment Act of 1887\\" (the Dawes Act), communal tribal lands were divided and assigned to heads of households as individually owned parcels in size. The Dawes Rolls are the records of the members of each tribe who were registered by government representatives at the time. The total land area that was allotted was small compared to the amount of land that had been held communally by tribes in their reservations at the passage of the Act. The government declared Indian lands remaining after allotment as \\"surplus\\" and opened them for non-Indian settlement, resulting in the loss of millions of acres of tribal lands. Section 5 of the Dawes Act required the United States to ‚Äúhold the land thus allotted, for the period of twenty-five years, in trust for the sole use and benefit of the Indian to whom such allotment shall have been made‚Ä¶‚Äù During the trust period, individual accounts were to be set up for each Indian with a stake in the allotted lands, and the lands would be managed for the benefit of the individual allottees. Indians could not sell, lease, or otherwise encumber their allotted lands without government approval. Where the tribes resisted allotment, it could be imposed. After twenty-five years, the allotted lands would become subject to taxation. Many allottees did not understand the tax system, or did not have the money to pay the taxes, and lost their lands at that time. Fruit of a failed policy The early Indian trust system evolved from a series of adjustments to a policy that was gradually abandoned, then finally repealed. The allotment regime created by the Dawes Act was not intended to be permanent. The expectation was that Native Americans would gradually assume fee simple ownership of lands over a period of 25 years, about one generation. The theory that Indians could be turned into useful subsistence farmers, working their allotted lands, was overwhelmingly unsuccessful. Much of the land they were allotted in the arid West was unsuitable for small family farms, and they were subject to abuse by speculators. Within a decade of passage of the Dawes Act, the policy began to be adjusted because of government concerns about Indian competency to manage land. As late as 1928, the overseers were extremely reluctant to grant fee patents to Indians. The Meriam Report of that year, which assessed the effects of federal policy toward Native Americans, advocated making Indian landowners undergo a probationary period to \\"prove\\" competence. In the early 1900s, the federal government passed a series of statutes that together made the government‚Äôs trusteeship of these lands a permanent arrangement. The Department of Interior‚Äôs trusteeship is sometimes referred to as an ‚Äúevolved trust.‚Äù Little thought was given at the time to the consequences of making permanent the heirship of allotments. Lands allotted to individual Indians were passed from generation to generation, just as any other family asset passes to heirs. Probate proceedings commonly dictated that land interests be divided equally among every eligible heir unless otherwise stated in a will. As wills were not, and are not, commonly used by Indians, the size of land interests continually diminished as they were passed down from one heir to the next generation. The result was that, by the mid-20th century, an original allotted land parcel of could have more than 100 owners. While the parcel of land had not changed in size, each individual beneficiary had an undivided fractional interest in the . It made it impossible to effectively use the land. The allotment policy was formally repealed in 1934, with passage of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 (IRA) during the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration. This was part of an effort to encourage Native American tribes to restore their governments and control over communal lands. The case Elouise Cobell was a banker and treasurer of the federally recognized Blackfeet Confederacy in Montana. In the late 20th century, she became increasingly concerned about evidence that the federal government had mismanaged trust accounts and failed to pay monies owed to Native Americans. After efforts to lobby for reform in the 1980s and 1990s were not successful, she decided to file a class action suit. Cobell v. Babbitt was filed on June 10, 1996. The named plaintiffs are Elouise Cobell, Earl Old Person, Mildred Cleghorn, Thomas Maulson, and James Louis Larose. The defendants are the United States Department of the Interior and the United States Department of the Treasury. According to Cobell, \\"the case has revealed mismanagement, ineptness, dishonesty, and delay of federal officials.\\" The plaintiffs alleged that \\"the government illegally withheld more than $150 billion from Indians whose lands were taken in the 1880s to lease to oil, timber, minerals and other companies for a fee.\\"James Warren, \\"A Victory for Native Americans?\\", The Atlantic, 7 June 2010; accessed 26 October 2016 Since inception the Indian plaintiff class was represented by attorneys Dennis M. Gingold (who left in 2012 after the settlement), Thaddeus Holt, and attorneys from the Native American Rights Fund, including Keith Harper and John EchoHawk. The Department of the Interior was represented by presidential appointees, first by Bruce Babbitt, then Gale Norton, Dirk Kempthorne, and finally Ken Salazar. The case was assigned to Judge Royce Lamberth, who eventually became a harsh critic of the Department of Interior, making a series of sharply worded opinions. Due to a court order (at the request of the plaintiffs) in the litigation, portions of Interior's website, including the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), were shut down beginning in December 2001.BIA website The stated reason for the shutdown order was to protect the integrity of trust data in light of concerns that trust data could be accessed and manipulated by persons outside the Department. The order also prevented persons within the Department from using the Internet. In 2002, the Department ordered the extension of the shut down to the National Indian Gaming Commission, which would have caused serious disruption of the regulation of Indian gaming because the Commission used Internet connections to conduct fingerprint checks for background investigations of persons working in the gaming industry. The NIGC strongly resisted the imposition of the shut down order and, in doing so, helped establish its status as an independent federal agency. Following a May 14, 2008, order of the D.C. District Court, BIA and other Interior bureaus and offices were reconnected to the Internet. Early victories for plaintiffs Cobell is at bottom an equity case, with plaintiffs contending that the Government is in breach of its trust duties to Indian beneficiaries. Plaintiffs seek relief in the form of a complete historical accounting of all Individual Indian Monies (IIM) accounts. While Cobell is technically not a money damages caseclaims for money damages against the Government in excess of $10,000 must be brought in the United States Court of Federal Claimsplaintiffs contend that a complete accounting will show the IIM accounts to be misstated on the order of billions of dollars. If that contention were supported by the Court, plaintiffs would leverage such a finding to seek an adjustment of all IIM account balances. Department of the Interior (DOI) Factual Stipulations (filed June 11, 1999) #[T]he Department of the Interior cannot provide all account holders with a quarterly report which provides the source of funds, and the gains and losses. [See 25 U.S.C. ¬ß4011.] #[T]he Department of the Interior does not adequately control the receipts and disbursements of all IIM account holders. [See id. ¬ß162a(d)(2).] #[T]he Department of the Interior‚Äôs periodic reconciliations are insufficient to assure the accuracy of all accounts. [See id. ¬ß162a(d)(3).] #[A]lthough the Department of the Interior makes available to all IIM account holders the daily balance of their account and can provide periodic statements of the account balances, the Department does not provide all account holders periodic statements of their account performance. [See id. ¬ß162a(d)(5).] #[The] Department of the Interior does not have written policies and procedures for all trust fund management and accounting functions. [See id. ¬ß162a(d)(6).] #[T]he Department of the Interior does not provide adequate staffing, supervision and training for all aspects of trust fund management and accounting. [See id. ¬ß 162a(d)(7).] #[The Department of the Interior‚Äôs] record keeping system [is inadequate]. [See id. ¬ß162a(d)(1), (3), (4),(6).] In December 1999 the District Court for the District of Columbia found for the plaintiffs and identified five specific breaches that warranted prospective relief: #The Secretary of the Interior Had No Written Plan to Gather Missing Data #The Secretary of the Interior Had No Written Plan Addressing the Retention of IIM-Related Trust Documents Necessary to Render an Accounting #The Secretary of the Interior Had No Written Architecture Plan #The Secretary of the Interior Had No Written Plan Addressing the Staffing of Interior‚Äôs Trust Management Functions #The Secretary of the Treasury Had Breached His Fiduciary Duty to Retain IIM- Related Trust Documents and Had No Remedial Plan to Address This Breach of Duty This decision was upheld by Court of Appeals in February 2001. In June 2001 Secretary of the Interior Norton issued a directive creating the Office of Historical Trust Accounting (OHTA), ‚Äúto plan, organize, direct, and execute the historical accounting of Individual Indian Money Trust (IIM) accounts,‚Äù as mandated by both the Court and the 1994 Act. Lamberth removed On July 11, 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, siding with the government, removed Judge Lamberth from the casefinding that Lamberth had lost his objectivity. \\"We conclude, reluctantly, that this is one of those rare cases in which reassignment is necessary,\\" the judges wrote. Lamberth, appointed to the bench by President Ronald Reagan, was known for speaking his mind. He repeatedly ruled for the Native Americans in their class-action lawsuit. His opinions condemned the government and found Interior secretaries Gale Norton and Bruce Babbitt in contempt of court for their handling of the case. The appellate court reversed Lamberth several times, including the contempt charge against Norton. After a particularly harsh opinion in 2005, in which Lamberth lambasted the Interior Department as racist, the government petitioned the Court of Appeals to remove him, saying he was too biased to continue with the case. The Appeals Court concluded that some of Judge Lamberth's statements went too far, and \\"on several occasions the district court or its appointees exceeded the role of impartial arbiter.\\" The Court wrote that Lamberth believed that racism at Interior continued and is \\"a dinosaurthe morally and culturally oblivious hand-me-down of a disgracefully racist and imperialist government that should have been buried a century ago, the last pathetic outpost of the indifference and anglocentrism we thought we had left behind.\\" The Appeals Court ordered the case reassigned to another judge [December 7, 2006. Case reassigned to Judge James Robertson for all further proceedings]. Internet reconnection On May 14, 2008, Judge James Robertson issued an orderdoi.gov allowing five offices and bureaus of the Department of Interior to be reconnected to the internet. The Office of the Solicitor, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Office of Hearings and Appeals, the Office of the Special Trustee, and the Office of Historical Trust Accounting had been disconnected since December 17, 2001, when the government entered a Consent Order that stipulated how affected government offices could demonstrate proper compliance and reconnect to the internet. Judge Robertson's order vacated the Consent Order. In the following weeks, these offices and bureaus were reconnected, and their websites again became publicly accessible. Historical accounting trial In 2008, the district court awarded the plaintiffs $455.6 million, which both sides appealed. Cobell v. Kempthorne, 569 F. Supp.2d 223, 226 (D.D.C. 2008). On July 29, 2009, the D.C. Court of Appeals vacated the award and remanded the District Court's previous decision in Cobell XXI. See, Cobell v. Salazar (Cobell XXII), 573 F.3d 808 (D.C. Cir. 2009). Settlement On December 8, 2009, the Barack Obama administration announced having reached a negotiated settlement in the trust case. In 2010 Congress passed the Claims Resolution Act of 2010, which provided $3.4 billion for the settlement of the Cobell v. Salazar class-action trust case (and four Indian water-rights cases.)Mary C. Curtis, \\"Obama Hails Passage of Settlement for Native Americans, Black Farmers\\", Huffington Post, 30 November 2010, accessed 1 December 2011 Among the provisions of the settlement are for the government to buy land from Indian owners, which has been highly fractionated by being divided among heirs over the generations, and return it to communal tribal ownership. This was to correct a longstanding issue that was supposed to have been a temporary provision.James Warren, \\"A Victory for Native Americans?\\", The Atlantic, 7 June 2010 $1.4 billion of the settlement is allocated to plaintiffs in the suit. Up to $2 billion is allocated for re-purchase of lands distributed under the Dawes Act. President Barack Obama signed legislation authorizing government funding of a final version of the $3.4 billion settlement in December 2010, raising the possibility of resolution after fourteen years of litigation. Judge Thomas Hogan was to oversee a fairness hearing on the settlement in the spring of 2011. A December 2014 press release on the Indian Trust website indicated mailing of checks to \\"approximately 263,500\\" claimants. \\"Over two-thirds of checks have been cashed within 10 days of their arrival and over 80% of class members have received their Historical Accounting payments.\\" As another part of the settlement, the government set up a scholarship fund, named the Cobell Education Scholarship Fund in honor of lead plaintiff Elouise Cobell.Cobell Education Scholarship Fund\\", Media Announcements, Dept. of Interior, 2016 It contributes money on a quarterly basis from sales in the buy-back program, with a cap of $60 million. By November 2016, the total amount contributed to the scholarship fund so far was $40 million. The Scholarship Fund provides financial assistance through scholarships to American Indian and Alaska Native students wishing to pursue post-secondary and graduate education and training.\\"Land Buy-Back Program for Tribal Nations\\", Media Announcements, Department of Interior, 2016 In addition to payments to individual plaintiffs, the government has paid $900 million to individuals to buy back the equivalent of 1.7 million acres in fractionated land interests, restoring more of the land base of reservations to tribal control.Tanya H. Lee, \\"‚ÄòElouise Cobell is my hero‚Äô: Awarded Posthumous Presidential Medal of Freedom\\", Indian Country Today, 23 November 2016; accessed 5 December 2016 Reform Following the settlement, in late 2011, the Secretary of the Interior created the to evaluate the Indian trust system.

Overview  The DRM is a framework whose primary purpose is to enable information sharing and reuse across the United States federal government via the standard description and discovery of common data and the promotion of uniform data management practices. The DRM describes artifacts which can be generated from the data architectures of federal government agencies. The DRM provides a flexible and standards-based approach to accomplish its purpose. The scope of the DRM is broad, as it may be applied within a single agency, within a community of interest, or cross-community of interest.  Data Reference Model topics = DRM structure  The DRM provides a standard means by which data may be described, categorized, and shared. These are reflected within each of the DRM‚Äôs three standardization areas: * Data Description: Provides a means to uniformly describe data, thereby supporting its discovery and sharing. * Data Context: Facilitates discovery of data through an approach to the categorization of data according to taxonomies. Additionally, enables the definition of authoritative data assets within a community of interest. * Data Sharing: Supports the access and exchange of data where access consists of ad hoc requests (such as a query of a data asset), and exchange consists of fixed, re-occurring transactions between parties. Enabled by capabilities provided by both the Data Context and Data Description standardization areas. DRM Version 2  The Data Reference Model version 2 released in November 2005 is a 114 page document with detailed architectural diagrams and an extensive glossary of terms. The DRM also make many references to ISO standards specifically the ISO/IEC 11179 metadata registry standard.  DRM usage  The DRM is not technically a published technical interoperability standard such as web services, it is an excellent starting point for data architects within federal and state agencies. Any federal or state agencies that are involved with exchanging information with other agencies or that are involved in data warehousing efforts should use this document as a guide.

The animated series was produced by SIP Animation in association with and with participation from Jetix Europe, The Walt Disney Company and France T√©l√©visions. W.I.T.C.H. premiered December 18, 2004 and concluded on December 23, 2006 in the U.S., where it aired on ABC Kids and the Jetix blocks on ABC Family and Toon Disney. The show follows five girls ‚Äì Will, Irma, Taranee, Cornelia and Hay Lin ‚Äì who have respective magical powers over the classical elements quintessence, water, fire, earth and air, which they use to fulfill their duties as Guardians of the Veil. The names of these five characters form the titular acronym, despite the characters not actually being witches. The show takes place in the fictional city of Heatherfield and various mythical worlds, primarily Meridian. Plot The Guardians must save Meridian from the evil prince named Phobos and Cedric, who are searching for Phobos' sister, the long lost princess of Meridian and true heir to the throne. They later find her and the Guardians then set about saving her from Phobos. When Meridian is freed from evil and true heir takes the throne, a new mysterious sorceress named Nerissa frees Phobos' top henchmen and reforms them as the Knights of Vengeance. Once the Guardians learn more about the sorceress and her evil plan of reuniting former Guardians, they are able to defeat the Knights only to have more powerful Knights of Destruction, in addition to the former Guardians attack them. The Guardians' chief ally is Hay Lin's paternal grandmother Yan Lin, the original, former Guardian of Air, and the one that taught the girls about their magical abilities and destiny as the second generation of Guardians of the Veil. They are also helped by Caleb, a heroic soldier from Meridian, leader of the rebellion against Phobos, and Blunk, a frog-like goblin creature (known as a Passling) who takes things from the human world to Meridian (and vice versa), humorously mistaking everyday objects for other things or items of value. Matt, Will's boyfriend, accidentally learns about Meridian and when he sees the troubles there going on, he learns how to become a warrior to help them. They are also helped by the Oracle, leader of the Universe in Kandrakar, who was the one who chose the five girls. Guardian powers and abilities Each Guardian's powers are fueled and magnified greatly the mystic temple by Kandrakar, transmitted to the Heart via the Aurameres (the physical representations of the Guardians' powers). The Aurameres grant the same exact elemental powers to each of their guardians; for instance, powers held by Irma would also have been possessed by Cassidy. The keeper of the Aurameres is Luba, a cat-like being. When the Guardians transform, they change form and grow wings, which help them fly. Also, the Guardians can combine their powers together and create a beam as seen on the first episode of the series. Since the Veil was taken down, the Guardians have to cross worlds by folding, with the help of the Heart of Kandrakar. Elyon and Blunk can fold as well. In order to travel to another place in the same world, each Guardian can teletransport. Teletransporting is a difficult ability to learn and one can materialize into another solid object if not careful enough. If a Guardian teletransports while not connected to an Auramere or a Heart, then they will drain their life force. It has been shown that if a Guardian uses her elemental powers and is not connected to an Auramere, it will drain their life force, making them much weaker. This may be why Nerissa aged so much faster than the rest of C.H.Y.K.N. A Guardian can become a Quinto- Guardian, obtaining powers over all five elements. A Quinto-Guardian can gain the power to create solid ice out of thin air as with liquid water. The only known Quinto-Guardians are Cornelia (temporarily via the merged Aurameres) and Nerissa (by using her Seal). The Guardians can also become one with their dragon (or the powerful nymph Xin Jing, in the case of the Guardian of Quintessence and Keeper of the mystical Heart of Kandrakar, Will) and literally become their element while increasing all of their elemental abilities to their zenith of strength. But this is risky and rather dangerous because it costs them their humanity and they could be easily controlled and enthralled. =Astral Drops and Altermeres= Using the Heart of Kandrakar, a Guardian can create an Astral Drop, a duplicate of herself, when the words \\"Spord Lartsa\\" (Astral Drops spelled backwards) are said. The Astral Drops are doppelgangers, summoned when the Guardians have to go on a mission and need doubles so their absence is not felt. Although a Drop is a perfect physical copy of a person, they possess none of their memories, and have no personality of their own. All the Astral Drops make their debut in \\"Ambush at Torus Filney\\". Cornelia makes another Astral Drop in \\"The Mogriffs\\", as does Will in \\"H is for Hunted\\". An Altermere is an Astral Drop brought to life through the power of Quintessence. Unlike Astral Drops, they do not fade away when \\"Astral Drop\\" is said; they are actual living beings with feelings, emotions and memories. The concept of Altermeres is introduced in \\"H is for Hunted\\" when Will creates an Astral Drop to do her chores (laundry). Nerissa soon creates trouble by making it an Altermere. In \\"R is for Relentless\\", Nerissa tries to corrupt Yan Lin to her side, but can not. So she traps Yan Lin in the Seal of Nerissa and creates an Altermere double who does not realize she is not the real Yan Lin until Nerissa tells her. In \\"Z is for Zenith\\", Yan Lin introduces her long-lost sister she found in China to Joan and Chen Lin: Mira. Characters=ProtagonistsW.I.T.C.H.= *Will Vandom (Kelly Stables) is the 13-year-old leader of the Guardians of the Veil and the owner of the Heart of Kandrakar, later also the Guardian of Quintessence. Will moves to Heatherfield with her mother at the beginning of the series. Originally Will's powers primarily revolve around activating the transformation into Guardian form and sealing portals. However, in the second season Will fully gains her own elemental ability of quintessence, the fifth element, which grants her electrokinetic and life-granting abilities. In addition, Will is able to communicate with electrical appliances. Her only love interest and boyfriend throughout the series is Matt Olsen. *Irma Lair (Candi Milo) is the 12-year-old Guardian of Water whose ability allows her to control water, and in the second season, the power of mind control. Irma acts as the series' comic relief, providing witty dialogue and remarks, which is often a source of irritation for Cornelia. Irma is appointed as the station manager of Sheffield Institute's radio station, she titles her radio segment Lair on the Air. Unlike the other Guardians, Irma does not have a boyfriend despite her affection for Andrew Hornby and the unrequited attention from Martin Tubbs. *Taranee Cook (Kali Troy) is the 12-year-old Guardian of Fire, able to create and manipulate fire, and in the second season, she has the ability to telepathically communicate with the other Guardians. Taranee is dedicated to her schoolwork, and often uses her intellect to defeat enemies. Her boyfriend is Nigel Ashcroft, whose social circle initially causes mistrust by Taranee's parents. *Cornelia Hale (Christel Khalil) is the 13-year-old Guardian of Earth granting her the ability to control earth and plants and in the second season, she gains the power of telekinesis. Cornelia is vain and haughty, and is often a foil to Will. But she begins to warm up to her eventually, throughout the series. She is best friends with Elyon Brown, later revealed to be the missing Princess of Meridian. Cornelia becomes romantically involved with Caleb. His duties in Meridian later cause a rift in their relationship. *Hay Lin (Liza del Mundo) is the 12-year-old Guardian of Air which enables her to control air, and also become invisible in the second season. Her paternal grandmother, Yan Lin, was the previous Guardian of Air and introduced the new Guardians to their roles. Hay Lin is of Chinese descent and her parents own the Silver Dragon, a Chinese restaurant, where Hay Lin works part-time. Hay Lin enjoys art and is a free spirit. Despite her original distaste for dating, Hay Lin becomes infatuated with Eric Lyndon who eventually becomes her boyfriend. =Allies= * Caleb (Greg Cipes): Caleb is a 15-year-old human teenager, who started Meridian's resistance movement. Caleb is usually accompanied by Blunk. Personality-wise, Caleb is brave and reckless, as well a strong and quick-thinking leader and a good fighter. He tends to be a little arrogant and bad-tempered, with a sarcastic streak. He also fails to understand how girls' minds work (something that gets him in trouble with Cornelia from time to time). Although he puts on a tough and uncaring attitude, Caleb is a loyal friend who sticks to his beliefs no matter what. Even though he is the only one of the main characters who has no special powers or abilities he is more than able to hold his ground against more powerful opponents with his experience, quick thinking and hand-to-hand combat skills. Although his most preferred weapon seems to be a sword he is skilled with the use of other ones too. * Blunk (Steve Blum): Blunk is a small and smelly creature who lives on Meridian. He is a Passling, a short toad goblin-like creature who travels through the dimensions to find and steal goods to sell. Blunk went to Earth with Caleb and the Guardians and quickly made a home there: the Silver Dragon's dumpster. Blunk, being able to sniff out portals, frequently went to Earth and back. He spent half his time on Meridian finding goods, helping the Guardians and selling to customers, and the other half on Earth finding goods, helping the Guardians and sniffing out portals for them. Blunk often helped Caleb in his missions, and when he was almost eaten by Cedric and Miranda, Caleb was greatly worried about him and called him a \\"friend\\". Blunk was so happy with Caleb that from then on, he sticks by him. * Elyon Brown (Serena Berman): Elyon was born in Meridian, lone daughter to the Queen and King and heir to the throne. However, after the disappearance of her parents, a Meridianite named Galgheita took her to Earth to evade the wrath of the cruel and heartless Phobos, her evil brother, and to protect her from him, as he had plans to steal her superior magical powers. Elyon was raised there as a normal girl by the Browns, Meridianites whom Elyon believed to be her parents. Cedric eventually tells her about her identity and turns her against the Guardians, convincing her to go to Meridian, where he teaches her to wield and use her powers. After staying by Phobos and Cedric's side for a while, Elyon realizes that Phobos and Cedric are heartless tyrants lusting after her powers and helps W.I.T.C.H. defeat them. Elyon then stays in Meridian, along with her surrogate parents, and assumes her rightful place as the Heart of Meridian. * Matt Olsen (Jason Marsden): Matt Olsen is Will's classmate and starts off as her crush, later becoming her boyfriend. He is the lead guitarist and main singer of his band, Wreck 55. His musical talents have been showcased in a few episodes, particularly \\"S is for Self\\" (\\"The Demon in Me\\", and \\"The Will to Love\\", a song written for Will). He first appeared in \\"Happy Birthday Will\\". Matt first learns about the Guardians in \\"The Stolen Heart\\", when he accidentally follows Caleb and the girls through a portal and finds himself in Meridian. After seeing Will in her Guardian form, Matt considers himself a part of the team. After participating in the major events in \\"The Final Battle\\", Matt decides that he wants to help, though the Guardians (mainly Will) are reluctant, in case he should be injured. As a result of this, he asked Caleb to train him how to be a warrior in \\"D is for Dangerous\\". See below for his information as Shagon. * Yan Lin (Lauren Tom) ‚Äì see below Antagonists *Prince Phobos (Mitchell Whitfield) is the primary antagonist of the first season. He is the ruler of Meridian, in spite of his missing sister being the rightful heir. He seeks to remain ruler of Meridian by defeating Elyon, the lost Princess and the Guardians of the Veil. *Lord Cedric (Dee Bradley Baker) is Phobos' General who is able to shape-shift into a human-snake hybrid. He commands Phobos' army of monsters and was tasked with locating the missing Princess in order for Phobos to absorb her powers. In the first season, he comes to Earth and opens a bookstore, under the false identity Cedric Hoffman, in order to attract the Princess. *Nerissa (Kath Soucie) is the original former Guardian of the Veil who was gifted the power of quintessence and original Keeper of the Heart of Kandrakar, the predecessor of Will. She is introduced as the second season's primary antagonist. Nerissa aims to regain control over Kandrakar and the other magical realms. She is successful in procuring the Hearts of several worlds. In order to achieve her aim, throughout the season Nerissa creates groups who can fight the present Guardians. These include the Knights of Vengeance, the Knights of Destruction and C.H.Y.K.N., the original five Guardians of the Veil, of which Nerissa the fifth member and leader. =The Knights of Vengeance= *Raythor (Steve Blum): Raythor was a high-ranking knight of Phobos. Raythor debuted in \\"The Key\\". When Caleb escaped from the castle, he managed to get out of handcuffs by using a key. This leads Raythor to suspect that Vathek (the rebel spy cell guard) helped Caleb to escape. The Guardians rescue Vathek and take down Raythor. As they do, Will hides the key in Raythor's uniform, so when Cedric and his troops arrive, they arrest Raythor for stealing the key, and Raythor, not Vathek, is thrown into the Abyss of Shadows. Raythor then appears in \\"A is for Anonymous\\" after crawling out of the Abyss of Shadows in a malnourished state. He joins with the other knights of Phobos to form the Knights of Vengeance. Raythor is made leader since he has good decision planning and thinks before charging into a battle. Raythor has a desire for vengeance and hates Queen Elyon, the rebels, and especially the Guardians. But when Phobos breaks his oath to the Guardians in \\"W is for Witch\\" and releases the Lurdens and the Knights of Vengeance, Raythor is ashamed and decides to join the Guardians. *Frost (Dee Bradley Baker) and Crimson (Michael Bell): Frost the Hunter was a high-ranking member of Phobos' army. Frost makes a cameo in \\"Ambush at Torus Filney\\" but his real debut is in \\"Framed\\" where he and his mount, the three-horned rhino Crimson, go to defeat the Guardians in Elias Van Dahl's painting in which they are trapped. Frost challenges leadership to the Knights but Raythor outsmarts him in a mini-battle. He participates in all the Knights' activities proving to be a useful member, along with Crimson. Frost lacks intelligence and is a downright brute; his dimwitted-ness is shown by naming his black-green rhino Crimson. Frost is also very impatient, has a short temper, and never thinks before he acts. *Miranda (Grey DeLisle): The youngest of Phobos' associates who, like Cedric, is a shape shifter with one human and one animal form. Her human form is a small Asian girl in her early teens with shoulder-length black hair, wearing a green and yellow dress. Her animal form is a hairy, four-legged, four-eyed spider-like creature with the power to climb walls and shoot webs. She was entrusted with the task of spying on the Guardians on Earth as a student in Heatherfield under a human identity, Melinda. During the second season, she is recruited by Nerissa to join the Knights of Vengeance and is turned into a spider by Phobos as a way to punish her for siding with Nerissa. She is placed in Cedric's cell. Near the end of the second season, Miranda sides with Cedric after he swallowed Phobos as the two of them are revealed to have a love relationship. *Sandpit (Kath Soucie): Sandpit was originally a living pit that swallowed and imprisoned any victims that walked over it. Sandpit first appeared in \\"Ambush at Torus Filney\\" capturing Caleb after going for a false story about the Seal of Phobos. Irma and Taranee combined their powers to transform Sandpit into a shiny glass lake. In \\"A is for Anonymous\\", when Nerissa is starting to form a group of Knights, she visits Sandpit and through the power of Quintessence, Sandpit came back to life and worked for Nerissa. Since coming back to life, he is now a tall new humanoid form that is free to wander. He joined the Knights of Vengeance, mainly using his powers to protect the Knights by blinding or trampling enemies. When Phobos breaks his oath and attacks Meridian, freeing his minions, Sandpit is convinced by Raythor to join the good guys, the Guardians. *Gargoyle (Dee Bradley Baker): Gargoyle is a giant rock monster who worked for Phobos, protecting and guarding the moats from any rebel that dared to try to sneak into the castle. He is very large, but he only has one eye and cannot speak, only roar. In \\"It Resumes\\", Gargoyle made his debut appearance fighting the Guardians after rescuing Will from Phobos. When Gargoyle reached through a portal to grab Irma, Will quickly closed the portal, chopping the left hand off. Nerissa meets up with Gargoyle and convinces him to join the Knights of Vengeance after she recreates his left hand as a club/boulder weapon. Gargoyle's main job was to smash down any buildings and to carry the other Knights on his head. Raythor, the former leader of the Knights of Vengeance, convinces Gargoyle to join the Guardians as Phobos has no loyalty, honesty, or honor. *Tracker (Jeff Bennett) and Sniffer (Dee Bradley Baker): Phobos's most effective scout and hunter, who is often employed to locate or hunt down an individual, even if he possessed no prior knowledge of the target's whereabouts. He was given the task of hunting down Caleb, who was either hiding underground in the Infinite City or on Earth. This task caused him to repeatedly tangle with the Guardians. After Phobos's first defeat, Hunter flees the castle and is recruited by Nerissa to join her Knights of Vengeance, where he serves as a loyal fighter and continues to hunt down his prey, specifically the rebels and the Guardians. Sniffer is a huge black dog and is very good at sniffing wherever there is a scent and is very strong, fast and agile. The Tracker has an army of bats at his disposal to attack his enemies and be scouts for him, while his main weapon is a glowing green electrical chain capable of doing massive damage. =The Knights of Destruction= *Shagon (Jason Marsden): Shagon has the appearance of a muscular man with large, black, feathery wings and a golden mask as his face. He has the power to generate yellow-green light beams from his eyes, fueled by the hatred of his enemies. Matt Olsen and Mr. Huggles are captured by Nerissa. Using Matt's hatred he feels for her and the power of the Heart of Meridian, Nerissa transforms Matt into Shagon, thus gaining control of his mind and body. He assumes Matt's identity during the day (the Guardians see him during school), so he can spy on the Guardians. Shagon gets Will to hate him because of her deep and strong romantic love for Matt and he teases her, saying that he hurt Matt. Shagon loves to torture the Guardians themselves, particularly Will. In the episode \\"S is For Self\\", it is revealed that the real Matt still exists in Shagon's mind. In the same episode, Matt eventually breaks free from Shagon's control by using his love for Will as a weapon and destroys Shagon's soul, therefore regaining control of himself. *Khor (Dee Bradley Baker): Khor has the appearance of a terrifying beast with no wings and gorilla like arms for his extra pair of legs. He has the power to jump on others to attack, which is fueled by the anger of his enemies. Mr. Huggles and Matt are captured by Nerrissa. Using the anger Huggles's felt for her and the power of the Heart of Meridian, Nerissa transforms Huggles into Khor, thus gaining control of Huggles's mind and body. In the episode \\"S is for Self\\", it is revealed that the real Huggles still exists in Khor's mind. In the same episode, Huggles eventually breaks free from Khor's control by using Nerissa's power as a weapon to destroy Khor's soul, therefore regaining control of himself. *Tridart (Jim Cummings): One of the Four Knights of Destruction, created by Nerissa using her Quintessence power from the numerous icy stalactites found in the cave which Nerissa was sealed in. He represents the despair Nerissa felt in her prison. Tridart has the appearance of a bald, tall, winged man made from ice. He gets his power from the despair and fear of his opponents. Tridart controls the element of ice. His weapon is an axe from which he can conjure icy blasts.

In the second season, her spirit was raised by Nerissa's exceptionally powerful elemental abilities of Quintessence, and was later restored to a physical body. After being released, she was reunited with her elderly blind mother and continued the teenage life that was stolen from her forty years previously. *Halinor (Betty Jean Ward): A blonde-haired woman and past Guardian of Fire, she is kindhearted, although she can be cowardly and insecure.

Setting Various worlds play an important role in the W.I.T.C.H. series. Earth is the home of the Guardians of the Veil, later the Infinite Dimensions while Meridian, Kandrakar and Zamballa are mystical dimensions that are introduced as the story progresses and the evil forces get stronger. In \\"V is for Victory\\", Nerissa also briefly visited a place called Aridia, a desert realm home to giant rock creatures, in an attempt to steal its Heart. The Hearts are the sources of immense mystical energy for each of the worlds they come from. They can be represented by a jewel, a talisman or a living being. Prominently featured in the series is the Heart of Kandrakar, a pendant that allows W.I.T.C.H. to transform. Most of the time a mystic Heart is found to be in the form of living being, as it is for Earth, Meridian, and Aridia. Earth The planet where humans live and no-one knows of different kingdoms like Meridian or Zamballa or any creatures that exist there. It is home to each generation of five Guardians of the Veil. =Heatherfield= The main human- populated city, in which the second generation of Guardians of the Veil live. It is also where original, former Guardian of Air, Yan Lin, still lives with her son, daughter-in-law, and granddaughter Hay Lin. Its main known high school is Sheffield Institute, with Mrs. Knickerbocker as principal. It also happens to be the home of Lillian Hale, Cornelia's eight-year-old younger sister and the mystical Heart of Earth itself. For twelve long years, the younger sister to Prince Phobos of Meridian was taken for safety and raised by Alborn and Miriadel, who posed themselves as her \\"human\\" adopted parents Thomas and Eleanor Brown. The Silver Dragon The Silver Dragon is a Chinese restaurant and is the place where Hay Lin and her family live. Her parents and her Grandma Yan Lin run the Restaurant. The Silver Dragon made its debut in season 1's \\"It Begins\\" when Hay Lin has some weird phases of sneezing and the room exploding. This is also the place where Will, Irma, Taranee, Cornelia and Hay Lin learnt they were Guardians and were given the Heart of Kandrakar. The basement is where they all meet up and hang out (Blunk calls the basement \\"Guardian HQ\\"). The Guardians spend their time in the basement on planning their attacks and next moves. Yan Lin is always there to help the Guardians on some occasions. Meridian Meridian is by far the most important world seen in the series, as most of the action takes place here. Meridian is a kingdom far away under the watching eye of the Oracle. It is ruled by a single Queen, who has powerful magical powers and is the center of mystical energy in the dimension (the Heart of Meridian). As of season 2, the Queen is Elyon Brown. This world has streets full of merchants and extraordinary caves. People here live mainly from agriculture, although some have other jobs. Meridian has many different creatures like Larveks, Mudslugs, Mogriffs, Sandpit, Hermeneutas, Passlings, Kaithim, etc. Some creatures can change between an apparently human form and a beast form, such as Cedric and Miranda. Meridian is the most frequently traveled-to place for the Guardians in season 1. Throughout season 1, Meridian is the only known dimension to the Guardians besides Earth as the Veil was raised and not much was known about the other worlds like Zamballa, Kandrakar and Aridia. Much of the action happened on Meridian in season 1 and the Guardians frequently traveled there to help, and stop Phobos' schemes. An important place in Meridian is in a large village next to the castle, which is on top of high land extending upwards. This is where Phobos lives and is the main centre of activity since the Guardians repeatedly attack it. =The Infinite City= The Infinite City made its debut in season 1's \\"A Service to the Community\\". The Infinite City is below Meridian and the Guardians didn't know at first, but Caleb tells them and shows them. The Mage guards the city. The city is underground and has lots of pillars running along it. The city is colored lime green, but in daytime the city appeared to be red, orange and cream. Nobody knows who created or built the Infinite City and when, as it has a mysterious past and the city is infinite and keeps going on and on in all directions. The Infinite City was kept secret from Phobos because the Rebellion used it as their base of operations. One way of getting down into the city is by using a secret passage in a disused area of land and going through a little cupboard. It then leads down some stairs and into the city itself. Just a few yard's way is another passage, and under there seems like a basement but inside is a waterfall where the Mage stays and guards the city. Kandrakar Kandrakar made its debut in \\"B is for Betrayal\\". The Guardians frequently went to Kandrakar for answers, such as why their powers had improved and become stronger. The Council of Kandrakar's job is to look over the whole universe and protect its worlds from any evil. It has its own five Guardians to help accomplish this task and protect the universe from harm. The Guardians also have a leader who wields the pink orb necklace of the mystical Heart of Kandrakar itself, which transforms them and greatly magnifies their elemental powers. The Aurameres are housed in one of Kandrakar's rooms and are guarded over by Luba. Zamballa Zamballa was first introduced in the season 2 episode \\"P is for Protectors\\". Zamballa is a purple world with a jungle stretching out as far as the eye can see. At the center is a pyramid, the palace where Kadma lives while the Veil is still in effect. The Zamballans themselves look like walking purple trees. In \\"Z is for Zenith\\" the Heart of Zamballa is returned and Kadma abdicates from her throne to live a more humble life on Earth, while Ironwood takes the Heart and is made Queen herself. Production Two seasons were produced in total, adapting plot elements from The Twelve Portals and Nerissa's Revenge comic arcs from the original series. Each season consists of twenty-six episodes, resulting in a total of fifty-two episodes overall. An unaired 15-minute pilot episode exists, which was never fully animated. It was used to test the show with a focus group in 2003. The first episode of the series was originally meant to air on Halloween, with corresponding themes. German network Super RTL was originally announced to be collaborating on the show alongside Jetix and France 3. However, it does not appear in the actual closing credits of the series. Development SIP Animation announced the production of an animated series based on the comic books in 2002. The show was immediately picked up for a full order of 52 half- hour episodes. According to Justine Cheynet (associate producer in the first season, story editor in the second), SIP had come to Disney with the initiative of producing a cartoon based on the Disney-owned comics. The first season of the show took roughly 18 months to produce, with about 200 people working on it. Work on the series began in spring 2003, in collaboration with Disney Channel. In September of that year, Andrew Nicholls and Darrell Vickers were hired as supervisory producers, and would serve as showrunners throughout the first season. The show's primary target markets were considered to be Italy, France (represented by SIP Animation), the United Kingdom (Fox Kids UK), and the United States (Disney Channel). As such, while Nicholls and Vickers were officially employed by SIP, they would be working with guidance from all four of these countries. A team of freelance writers was also brought in under their supervision, ultimately being responsible for just over half of the first season. Due to the show's unusually heavy use of continuity for a cartoon, Nicholls and Vickers planned out the season arc and even individual episode stories beforehand, and gave the other writers very careful instructions covering even smaller details of the series to avoid contradictions and repetition throughout the episodes. The director for this season was Marc Gordon-Bates, who was unfamiliar with the series and surprised that he was offered the position over other directors with greater interest in the project and more relevant prior experience. At the outset, the show was more oriented towards comedy (early marketing described the series as an action comedy) than the original comics, which were primarily of the fantasy genre, but in common with the source material was targeted towards the female audience. Early on, the writers were informed that the show was now to be aired on Toon Disney and the Jetix block on ABC Family, as part of a changing business strategy being pursued by Michael Eisner (chairman and CEO of Disney at the time). As such, the show was reoriented to appeal more to boys, including more action and additional focus on the few major male characters. By this point, the first 7 episodes had already been fully scripted (with several more outlined), and had to be rewritten. For the second season, Disney decided on a \\"darker, more fantasy-driven approach\\", with less humor. A completely different team of writers was hired, with Greg Weisman now serving as supervisory producer and showrunner, and Norman J. LeBlanc as the new director of the show. According to Nicholls, Weisman had decided against re- hiring him and Vickers to work on the second season due to considering them \\"sitcom writers\\" (although W.I.T.C.H. was indeed their first non-comedy series, Weisman's impression may have been a result of omissions from IMDb of shows not under the auspices of the Writers Guild of America, which included numerous other animated series they had worked on). This may have been a factor in the hiring of other comedy writers during the season, as the network considered the early scripts to have insufficient humor. The writing team for the second season was given \\"marching orders\\" to incorporate more material from the comics, and bring the two mediums closer together. At the same time, only the first season of the show was considered official, and as such the first 26 episodes could not be contradicted, while there would continue to be certain differences from the comics. Weisman emphasized the seamless nature of the transition between seasons, especially in production aspects such as character voices and model sheets. The episode \\"J is for Jewel\\" was considered to be a turning point during the season, before which a lot of work had been done to set up the new direction of the series. According to Justine Cheynet, the show ended after 52 episodes as a result of \\"very little to no interest both from the investors' and the producer's side in making a third season\\". There were no plans for a movie. Changes from the comics Although the basic structure of each season follows the respective arc of the comics, and the show shares a great deal of plot points and characters with the source material, there are many differences as well. At the start of production, the showrunners had only approximately the first 6 issues of the comics ‚Äì about half of the first arc ‚Äì to work with in developing the overall storyline for the season (for comparison, the first 27 issues were made available to the writers of the second season, which covered slightly beyond the end of the second arc). More than 20 creatures had been created specifically for the animated series by the end of the first season. Certain further changes requested for story reasons were denied by the network in light of the comics' popularity and existing fans. One of the major differences is the variety of powers the Guardians have in the first season. During the screenwriting stage, questions arose from the network as to why the girls did not use their powers more in a given situation. As a result, certain powers they had in the comics were not among their abilities during the first season, such as telepathy, \\"instincts\\" about people, and communicating with appliances. In the second- season episode \\"C is for Changes\\", this changes as the Guardians gain most of the remaining powers they had in the source material. The character of Caleb was altered significantly in the show, including his visual appearance. In the comics, he had clear facial markings that made him obviously different from a regular human. In the show, they are not present for multiple reasons: child test audiences found them unnerving; when animated, they looked too similar to a beard; and in the animated series, in contrast to the comics, he spends extended periods on Earth blending in with the inhabitants, which would be much more difficult to accomplish otherwise. Blunk is an original character created for the cartoon, and does not appear in the comics. A comedic sidekick smuggler, his role and prominence in the story became increasingly important as the show shifted its focus from comedy to action during production of the first season, as one of the few major male characters in a series now trying to appeal to boys. The character's name was reused from a failed pilot, created by Howie Mandel and produced by Nelvana, that the first season showrunners had worked on. Second season showrunner Greg Weisman admitted to initially disliking Blunk, but came to view him as an invaluable part of the team, particularly as a result of the bonds between Blunk and the main characters that had begun to form in the first season. In the comics, Will's dormouse is introduced quite early into the first arc. In the cartoon, this only occurs in episode 24 of the first season. Although the showrunners tried to have this take place earlier in the series, the network did not approve it for some time. According to Andrew Nicholls, this may have been due to its similarity to the naked mole rat Rufus in Kim Possible, another Disney series. The character Vathek starts out as an enemy of the Guardians in the comics, but in the show he is already on their side. This was changed to streamline the first few episodes due to the number of characters that had to be introduced. Early into production, Nicholls had suggested changing the name \\"Kandrakar\\" out of sensitivity toward the ongoing events in the real-life Kandahar in Afghanistan. This request was initially ignored, but ten episodes in the writing team was informed that the spelling had been changed to \\"Candrakar\\", with later episodes referring to it as \\"Candracar\\".DVD subtitles However, the \\"Heart of Kandrakar\\" is consistently spelled that way throughout the closing credits of both seasons. Certain character names were changed as well: Laurent was referred to by his nickname \\"Clubber\\" instead as it was considered more appropriate for a bully character, and in the second season, Thomas Vandom's first name was changed to Tony for legal reasons. Animation The animation studios for season 1 were Wang Film Productions and Hong Ying Universe, while Dongwoo Animation animated season 2. Hong Ying and provided digital ink and paint services for the second season. The 3D animated design of the Heart of Kandrakar used throughout the series was made by Maga Animation Studio. The series has been considered anime-influenced animation in terms of its visual style. First season director Marc Gordon- Bates cited anime such as Neon Genesis Evangelion as design inspiration. The original comics are themselves drawn in line with manga conventions, as opposed to the more rounded style traditionally used by publisher and co- producer Disney. Co-executive producer Olivier Dumont noted that the high- quality animation was intended to be true to the detailed artwork of the comics series. Intro sequences W.I.T.C.H. has different theme songs and openings, depending on country of broadcast. The original, international title sequence shows the girls and their powers in a story version with unique footage for the opening, and music by the composers of the show, Alain Garcia and Noam Kaniel. In the original international English version, the opening theme is \\"W.I.T.C.H.\\" performed by Sabrina. The intro sequence of the second season, storyboarded by Richard Danto and Bruno Issaly, is changed to incorporate the new plot developments and characters, along with a remix of the theme composed by David Vadant. The US version, composed by Adam Watts and Andy Dodd, shows action clips from some episodes and scenes from W.I.T.C.H. demo reels from various animation studios. It uses a demo version of the song \\"We Are W.I.T.C.H.\\" until episode 14, when it is replaced with a version sung by Marion Raven. The footage and theme are unchanged for the remainder of the US series. It has been explained that once the American broadcaster had chosen a different song, it was decided that a new opening should be made for it instead of the other way around, and the intro was unchanged in the second season as the network \\"wanted consistency in case they aired both seasons simultaneously\\". In Italy, a different opening was used, consisting purely of clips from the show and first international intro sequence. It was composed by Max Longhi and Giorgio Vanni, and performed by the group Lucky Star (Emma Marrone, Colomba Pane, and Laura Pisu).  Release = Broadcast  In the United States, a special one-hour preview of W.I.T.C.H. aired on December 18, 2004 on the Disney-owned ABC network's Saturday morning children's programming block, ABC Kids, and on December 19 on ABC Family and Toon Disney as part of their Jetix programming blocks.

In New Zealand, the show was aired on the 2 Kids block on TV2. In France, where this TV series was primarily made, it was terrestrially broadcast on France 3. (The second season was known as Dimension W.I.T.C.H. in the country.) In Italy, where the original comic came from, it was shown on Italia 1. DVD W.I.T.C.H. has been released on DVD in Europe, Australia, the Philippines (also in VCD format), Brazil, and Malaysia containing episodes of the first season, which was divided into volumes of varying number of episodes. Each volume contains 2 art cards, each featuring one of the W.I.T.C.H. girls. In the UK, the first three volumes were released in 2006 on 1 May, 19 June, and 21 August respectively. In October 2007 the volumes were re-released as a DVD box set along with the box set of volumes four, five and six, containing the rest of season 1. Season 2 DVDs have been released in the Czech Republic, Poland, and Russia. The Czech and Polish sets have audio available in multiple languages, including English.  Reception = Ratings  In the early stages of the first season, the series was a major hit and a TV breakout in the US. The two-episode premiere registered record ratings across ABC Kids and the Jetix blocks on ABC Family and Toon Disney, both as a preview and in regular airings. In Europe, W.I.T.C.H. was the most popular Jetix original series for third-party sales as of fiscal year 2007, when the second season was delivered. All of the major Jetix Europe originals, including W.I.T.C.H., ranked \\"as one of the top two shows in their timeslots in all of the markets in which they aired.\\"  Reviews  Common Sense Media described the show as \\"an animated fantasy-adventure series for tweens\\", and gave it 3 out of 5 stars. The New York Times found the series to emphasize the importance of teenage friendships among girls, while appealing to boys as well.

Located at RAAF Base Williamtown, New South Wales, the unit trains pilots to operate the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet, conducts refresher courses for pilots returning to the type, and trains future Hornet instructors. Pilots new to the Hornet enter No. 2 OCU after first qualifying to fly fast jets at No. 79 Squadron and undertaking initial fighter combat instruction at No. 76 Squadron. Once qualified on the F/A-18, they are posted to one of No. 81 Wing's operational Hornet units, No. 3 Squadron, No. 75 Squadron or No. 77 Squadron. The unit was established as No. 2 (Fighter) Operational Training Unit (No. 2 OTU) in April 1942 at Port Pirie, South Australia, and relocated to RAAF Station Mildura, Victoria, the following month. During World War II, it provided training on a wide range of aircraft, including P-40 Kittyhawks, Vultee Vengeances, Avro Ansons, CAC Boomerangs, Supermarine Spitfires and Airspeed Oxfords. Disbanded in March 1947, No. 2 OTU was re-formed at Williamtown in March 1952 in response to the demand for more highly trained pilots to serve in the Korean War. It was renamed No. 2 (Fighter) Operational Conversion Unit in September 1958, and since then has conducted training with the CAC Sabre, Dassault Mirage III, and Macchi MB-326, prior to taking delivery of the Hornet. Role and equipment alt=Underside view of four twin-engined military jets in diamond formation The role of No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit (No. 2 OCU) is to \\"support the preparation for and the conduct of effective airspace control, counter air strike and combat air support operations through the provision of trained personnel\\". Located at RAAF Base Williamtown, New South Wales, it comes under the control of No. 81 Wing, part of Air Combat Group. No. 2 OCU is primarily responsible for conducting operational conversion courses on the RAAF's McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet multi-role fighter, which entered service in 1985. The unit takes students who have converted to fast jets with No. 79 Squadron, located at RAAF Base Pearce, Western Australia, and undergone lead- in fighter training at No. 76 Squadron, based at Williamtown.ANAO, Tactical Fighter Operations, p. 43 Most are new to operational flying, but some are \\"retreads\\" (experienced pilots converting from another aircraft type). No. 2 OCU's instructors are among the RAAF's most experienced Hornet pilots, and often play a major role developing new tactics, in co-operation with fighter combat instructors at other No. 81 Wing units. No. 2 OCU operates both single- seat F/A-18A Hornets and two-seat F/A-18Bs. The F/A-18B is largely identical to the A model aside from its dual cockpit, which reduces internal fuel capacity by about six per cent.McLaughlin, Hornets Down Under, p. 31 Aircraft livery includes a yellow-and-black tail fin flash, the base featuring a yellow tiger's head outlined in black, with a red mouth, white fangs and white eyes.Wilson, Phantom, Hornet and Skyhawk in Australian Service, pp. 130‚Äì131 The unit crest shows a winged kangaroo carrying a joey in its pouch, symbolising \\"'Mother Australia' flying with her young\\". The motto is Juventus Non Sine Pinnis (\\"The Young Shall Have Wings\\"). Hornet conversion courses run for six months, after which graduates are posted to one of the RAAF's front- line fighter units, No. 3 Squadron or No. 77 Squadron at Williamtown, or No. 75 Squadron at RAAF Base Tindal, Northern Territory. Students must first gain their instrument rating on the Hornet, and are then taught basic fighter manoeuvres, air combat techniques, air-to-air gunnery, and air-to-ground tactics. The course culminates with Exercise High Sierra, a biannual event that was first run at Townsville, Queensland, in 1986. The exercise lasts several weeks and involves day and night flights, including precision strike sorties with practice and live bombs. As well as operational conversion, No. 2 OCU conducts refresher courses and fighter combat instructor courses. Pilots who have not flown Hornets for more than nine months undertake the two-week refresher course.ANAO, Developing Air Force's Combat Aircrew, p. 28 Fighter combat instructor courses run for five months and are given every two years. Students are chosen from among the most experienced Hornet squadron pilots and undergo instruction in how to train others, as well as how to deal with complex operational scenarios. This is tested in simulated combat with other types of US or RAAF aircraft, as available, including F-15 Eagles, F-16 Fighting Falcons, and F/A-18 Super Hornets. Graduates become qualified F/A-18 instructors and remain with No. 2 OCU for the next two-year cycle. After this time, they are posted to one of the front-line squadrons or No. 81 Wing's headquarters as Hornet weapons-and-tactics specialists. Along with training pilots, No. 2 OCU may be called upon to conduct operational tasks in certain circumstances.Horner, Making the Australian Defence Force, p. 210 History=Operational training: 1942‚Äì1947 \\"Bluey\\" Truscott (second from rear), at No. 2 OTU, Mildura, in June 1942alt=Four single-engined military monoplanes in flight During World War II, the RAAF established several operational training units (OTUs) to convert recently graduated pilots from advanced trainers to combat aircraft, and to add fighting techniques to the flying skills they had already learned.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 167‚Äì168, 364 No. 2 (Fighter) Operational Training Unit (No. 2 OTU) was formed on 2 April 1942 at Port Pirie, South Australia. Its inaugural commanding officer was Wing Commander Peter Jeffrey, a fighter ace who had led No. 3 Squadron in North Africa.RAAF Historical Section, Training Units, pp. 62‚Äì64Garrisson, Australian Fighter Aces, pp. 142‚Äì143 Jeffrey had recently brought on line Nos. 75 and 76 Squadrons, two of the first three fighter units raised to help defend northern Australia as the Japanese advanced toward New Guinea.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 139‚Äì141 His team of instructors at No. 2 OTU included fellow aces from the North African campaign, Clive Caldwell and Wilf Arthur.Alexander, Clive Caldwell, p. 99 Originally equipped with CAC Wirraways and Fairey Battles, the unit's complement was augmented by P-40 Kittyhawks, Vultee Vengeances, Avro Ansons, CAC Boomerangs, Supermarine Spitfires and Airspeed Oxfords after it relocated to RAAF Station Mildura, Victoria, in May. By September 1942, its fleet of aircraft included nine of the 106 Kittyhawks the RAAF had on hand at the time.Wilson, The Spitfire, Mustang and Kittyhawk in Australian Service, p. 140 During November, No. 2 OTU conducted comparative trials that pitted a Spitfire Mk V against a P-40E; the final report of these trials judged that although the Spitfire had superior performance according to most criteria, the P-40E was also a useful design.Wilson, The Spitfire, Mustang and Kittyhawk in Australian Service, pp. 142‚Äì143 No. 2 OTU's Spitfire section was transferred to RAAF Station Williamtown, New South Wales, in March 1943, under the command of ace John Waddy.Newton, Australian Air Aces, pp. 114‚Äì115 Jeffrey handed over command of No. 2 OTU at Mildura in August 1943; the same month, the unit logged over 5,000 flying hours, its highest level during the war. For the remainder of the conflict it maintained an average strength of more than 100 aircraft. North African campaign aces and former No. 3 Squadron commanders Bobby Gibbes and Nicky Barr served successively as chief flying instructor from March 1944 until the end of the Pacific War.Chisholm, Who's Who in Australia, p. 361Dornan, Nicky Barr, pp. 94‚Äì95, 263‚Äì266 Group Captain Arthur led the unit from July to November 1944, when Group Captain Jeffrey resumed command. During 1945, the Spitfires and Kittyhawks were replaced by 32 North American P-51 Mustangs.Wilson, The Spitfire, Mustang and Kittyhawk in Australian Service, p. 102 Training concluded that October, following the cessation of hostilities, and No. 2 OTU was reduced to a care- and-maintenance unit. During the war, it had graduated 1,247 pilots, losing 45 students in fatal accidents. Jeffrey completed his appointment in June 1946, and the unit was disbanded on 25 March 1947. Operational training: 1952‚Äì1958 alt=Military jet with twin-tailboom in flight Post-war demobilisation saw the disbandment of all the RAAF's OTUs. Operational conversion of new pilots then became the responsibility of front-line squadrons. This practice disrupted the squadrons' normal duties, and the advent of the Korean War and the introduction of jet aircraft further necessitated a more formal system of operational training. According to Dick Cresswell, commanding officer of No. 77 Squadron in Korea from September 1950 to August 1951:Odgers, Mr Double Seven, pp. xiii, 150 The RAAF moved to rectify the situation by re-forming No. 2 OTU on 1 March 1952 to convert RAAF pilots to jet aircraft and train them for fighter operations. Headquartered at RAAF Base Williamtown, it was equipped with Wirraways, Mustangs, and de Havilland Vampire jets.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 489 Cresswell took command of No. 2 OTU on 21 May 1953. The unit ceased flying Mustangs that October, retaining its Wirraways and Vampires. In April 1954, it began conducting fighter combat instructor courses, as well as refresher courses on jets. Cresswell delivered the first Australian-built CAC Sabre jet fighter to No. 2 OTU in November, and the same month established the unit's Sabre Trials Flight.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, p. 156 The flight was responsible for performance testing and developing combat flying techniques, in concert with the Aircraft Research and Development Unit (ARDU).Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 348‚Äì349 On 3 December 1954, Creswell led a formation of twelve No. 2 OTU Vampires in the shape of two sevens over Sydney to greet No. 77 Squadron upon its arrival from service in Korea aboard the aircraft carrier HMAS Vengeance.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, p. 153 Training courses on the Sabre began on 1 January 1955. Once the Sabre entered operational service in March 1956, the Sabre Trials Flight was dissolved and its responsibilities passed to No. 3 Squadron. Pilots underwent their introduction to jets and fighter combat at No. 2 OTU, but finished their conversion to Sabres at a front-line squadron. Operational conversion: 1958‚Äìcurrent No. 2 OCU Mirage IIID (foreground) and IIIO, 1980 In May 1958, No. 1 Applied Flying Training School began equipping with Vampire jet trainers at RAAF Base Pearce, Western Australia.RAAF Historical Section, Training Units, pp. 40‚Äì42 As RAAF pilots were now gaining their first exposure to jets elsewhere, No. 2 OTU took over from the fighter squadrons the responsibility of converting trained jet pilots to Sabres. Reflecting its new primary role, it was renamed No. 2 (Fighter) Operational Conversion Unit (No. 2 OCU) in September 1958, and ceased Vampire courses the same month. Wing Commander Neville McNamara, later Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) and Chief of the Defence Force Staff, served as commanding officer from August 1959 until January 1961. During his tenure, the unit undertook exercises with No. 75 Squadron at RAAF Bases Amberley, Townsville and Darwin.McNamara, The Quiet Man, pp. 117‚Äì118 Two Sabre pilots from No. 2 OCU and one from No. 75 Squadron died in separate incidents early in 1960; each had attempted to eject at low level and suffered fatal head injuries from colliding with the aircraft's canopy during the ejection sequence. All RAAF Sabres were grounded until ARDU developed a modification to shatter the canopy immediately before the pilot ejected. Along with Nos. 75 and 76 Squadrons, also based at Williamtown, No. 2 OCU was under the control of No. 81 Wing from 1961 until the wing was disbanded in 1966.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 350, 489 By late 1963, personnel were busy developing training material for the pending Sabre replacement, the Dassault Mirage III, a task that required them to translate the manufacturer's technical documentation from the original French.Susans, The RAAF Mirage Story, pp. 40‚Äì41Stephens, Going Solo, p. 358 No. 2 OCU received its first Mirages in February and March 1964. It commenced conversion courses on the type that October, and fighter combat instructor courses in August 1968. The RAAF eventually took delivery of 100 Mirage IIIO single-seat fighters and 16 Mirage IIID two-seat trainers; No. 2 OCU operated both models.Susans, The RAAF Mirage Story, pp. 155‚Äì158; 165 Squadron Leader John Newham, later to serve as CAS, held temporary command of the unit from July 1965 to April 1966.Susans, The RAAF Mirage Story, p. 142 A Sabre-equipped aerobatic display team named the \\"Marksmen\\" was formed within No. 2 OCU during 1966 and 1967.McLaughlin, Hornets Down Under, p. 76 Between 1967 and 1984, six of the unit's Mirages suffered major accidents, resulting in three fatalities. Experience in the Vietnam War led the RAAF to begin training Forward air controllers in 1968. The task initially fell to No. 2 OCU before a specialised unit, No. 4 Forward Air Control Flight, was formed in 1970.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 485 In October 1969, the OCU began operating the Macchi MB-326 jet for lead-in fighter training, as well as the Mirage. No. 5 Operational Training Unit, based at Williamtown, took over responsibility for Macchi courses from April 1970 until its disbandment in July the following year; the Macchis were then transferred back to No. 2 OCU.RAAF Historical Section, Training Units, pp. 71‚Äì73 alt=Twin-jet, twin-fin military jet taxiing along a runway In preparation for the introduction of the F/A-18 Hornet, No. 2 OCU temporarily ceased flying operations on 1 January 1985 and transferred Macchi and Mirage training to No. 77 Squadron, which assumed responsibility for fighter combat instructor, introductory fighter, and Mirage conversion courses.Susans, The RAAF Mirage Story, pp. 90, 107 Beginning on 17 May, the first fourteen Australian Hornets‚Äîseven single-seat F/A-18As and seven two- seat F/A-18Bs‚Äîand a Hornet simulator were delivered to No. 2 OCU. Conversion courses on the type commenced on 19 August with four F/A-18Bs and three students.Wilson, Phantom, Hornet and Skyhawk in Australian Service, p. 116 No. 2 OCU has remained the prime user of the two-seat Hornet, though some are operated by the fighter squadrons, Nos. 3, 75 and 77. The first year of Hornet service saw No. 2 OCU, as the then-only RAAF operator, undertake demonstration flights around the country to unveil the new fighter to the Australian public.Wilson, Phantom, Hornet and Skyhawk in Australian Service, p. 118 All of the Hornet units came under the control of a newly re-formed No. 81 Wing on 2 February 1987. An intense training program that year resulted in 21 pilots converting to the type. In June 1987, Macchi training courses again became the responsibility of No. 2 OCU; this role was taken over by No. 76 Squadron in January 1989. No. 2 OCU suffered its only Hornet loss to date when an F/A-18B crashed at Great Palm Island, Queensland, during a night-time training flight on 18 November 1987, killing the pilot. Two Hornets collided during an air-to- air combat training exercise the previous year, but both managed to return to base.Wilson, Phantom, Hornet and Skyhawk in Australian Service, p. 124 The unit temporarily relocated to RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales, in July 1990, while Williamtown's runway was resurfaced.Wilson, Phantom, Hornet and Skyhawk in Australian Service, p. 119 The RAAF began modifying four of its Boeing 707 jet transports to enable air-to-air refuelling of the Hornets in December 1988; No. 2 OCU staff commenced training for airborne tanker operations in July 1991, subsequently adding this capability to the Hornet conversion course.RAAF Historical Section, Maritime and Transport Units, pp. 38‚Äì40 By the mid-1990s, the unit had 12 instructors and a complement of 18 Hornets, including 13 two-seaters. It was running two conversion courses per year, with eight students per course, and had an average failure rate of 10 per cent. Several of its instructors were US and Canadian pilots on exchange with the RAAF. In 2000, No. 2 OCU joined Nos. 76 and 79 Squadrons as part of No. 78 Wing, which had been re-established as an operational training formation.Peacock; Jackson, Jane's World Air Forces, p. 19 As of 2005, the unit had a strength of between 12 and 14 instructors and ran three Hornet conversion courses and one fighter combat instructor course over two-year cycles. About six new Hornet pilots took part in each of the conversion courses, and the unit generally graduated 15 new Hornet pilots over each cycle. By 2007, No. 2 OCU had returned to the aegis of No. 81 Wing, under Air Combat Group. Although the duration of the conversion courses has remained unchanged since the Hornets were introduced into service, the content covered has been altered over time to reflect upgrades to the Hornets, the replacement of the Macchis with BAE Hawk 127 trainers in the early 2000s, and experience gained from using Hornets in combat during the Iraq War. No. 2 OCU conducted its 32nd fighter combat instructor course in 2013. The graduation exercise, Aces North, was the first to involve RAAF F/A-18 Super Hornets, Airbus KC-30 tankers, and Boeing E-7 Wedgetail early warning aircraft, as well as the \\"Classic\\" Hornets. The unit was awarded the 2016 Gloucester Cup for proficiency. In December 2017, Australia's first female fighter pilots graduated from No. 2 OCU. No. 2 OCU completed its final Hornet conversion training course in 2019, and ceased flying the type in December that year. It is scheduled to begin training pilots to operate the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II in June 2020.

She is known for her published work, Stripurush Tulana (\\"A Comparison Between Women and Men\\"), originally published in Marathi in 1882. The pamphlet is a critique of upper-caste patriarchy, and is often considered the first modern Indian feminist text. It was very controversial for its time in challenging the Hindu religious scriptures themselves as a source of women's oppression, a view that continues to be controversial and debated today. She was a member of Satyashodhak Samaj. Early life and family Born in Matang Family in the year 1850 to Bapuji Hari Shinde in Buldhana, Berar Province, in present-day Maharashtra, she was a founding member of the Satyashodhak Samaj, Pune. Her father was a radical and head clerk in the office of Deputy Commissioner of Revenues, he also published a book titled, \\"Hint to the Educated Natives\\" in 1871. There was no girls' school in the area. Tarabai was the only daughter and was taught Marathi, Sanskrit and English by her father. She also had four brothers. Tarabai was married when quite young, but was granted more freedom in the household than most other Marathi wives of the time since her husband moved into her parents' home.  Social work  Shinde was an associate of social activists Jotirao and Savitribai Phule and was a founding member of their Satyashodhak Samaj (\\"Truth Finding Community\\") organisation. The Phules shared with Shinde an awareness of the separate axes of oppression that constitute gender and caste, as well as the intermeshed nature of the two.  books/literary works  Tarabai Shindes popular literary work is \\"Stri Purush Tulana\\"  Stri Purush Tulana  In her essay, Shinde criticised the social inequality of caste, as well as the patriarchal views of other activists who saw caste as the main form of antagonism in Hindu society. According to Susie Tharu and K. Lalita, \\"...Stri Purush Tulana is probably the first full fledged and extant feminist argument after the poetry of the Bhakti Period. But Tarabai's work is also significant because at a time when intellectuals and activists alike were primarily concerned with the hardships of a Hindu widow's life and other easily identifiable atrocities perpetrated on women, Tarabai Shinde, apparently working in isolation, was able to broaden the scope of analysis to include the ideological fabric of patriarchal society. Women everywhere, she implies, are similarly oppressed.\\" Stri Purush Tulana was written in response to an article which appeared in 1881, in Pune Vaibhav, an orthodox newspaper published from Pune, about a criminal case against a young Brahmin (upper- caste) widow, Vijayalakshmi in Surat, who had been convicted of murdering her illegitimate son for the fear of public disgrace and ostracism and sentenced to be hanged (later appealed and modified to transportation for life). Having worked with upper-caste widows who were forbidden to remarry, Shinde was well aware of incidents of widows being impregnated by relatives. The book analysed the tightrope women must walk between the \\"good woman\\" and the \\"prostitute\\". The book was printed at Shri Shivaji Press, Pune, in 1882 with 500 copies at cost nine annas, but hostile reception by contemporary society and press, meant that she did not publish again. The work however was praised by Jyotirao Phule, a prominent Marathi social reformer, who referred to Tarabai as chiranjivini (dear daughter) and recommended her pamphlet to colleagues. The work finds mention in the second issue of Satsar, the magazine of Satyashodhak Samaj, started by Jyotiba Phule in 1885, however thereafter the work remained largely unknown till 1975, when it was rediscovered and republished.

Life Manfredi was born in Ostiano, near Cremona. He may have been a pupil of Caravaggio in Rome: at his famous libel trial in 1603 Caravaggio mentioned that a certain Bartolomeo, accused of distributing scurrilous poems attacking Caravaggio's detested rival Baglione, had been a servant of his. Certainly the Bartolomeo Manfredi known to art history was a close follower of Caravaggio's innovatory style, with its enhanced chiaroscuro and insistence on naturalism, with a gift for story-telling through expression and body-language. Caravaggio in his brief career ‚Äî gaining fame in 1600, exiled from Rome in 1606, and dead by 1610 ‚Äî had a profound effect on the younger generation of artists, particularly in Rome and Naples. And of these Caravaggisti (followers of Caravaggio), Manfredi seems in turn to have been the most influential in transmitting the master's legacy to the next generation, particularly with painters from France and the Netherlands who came to Italy. No documented, signed works by Manfredi survive, and several of the forty or so works now attributed to him were formerly believed to be by Caravaggio. The steady disentangling of Caravaggio from Manfredi has made clear that it was Manfredi, rather than his master, who was primarily responsible for popularising low- life genre painting among the second generation of Caravaggisti. Manfredi was a successful artist, able to keep his own servant before he was thirty years old, \\"a man of distinguished appearance and fine behaviour\\" according to the biographer Giulio Mancini, although seldom sociable. He built his career around easel paintings for private clients, and never pursued the public commissions upon which wider reputations were built, but his works were widely collected in the 17th century and he was considered Caravaggio's equal or even superior. His Mars Chastising Cupid offers a tantalising hint at a lost Caravaggio: the master promised a painting on this theme to Mancini, but another of Caravaggio's patrons, Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte, had taken it, and Mancini therefore commissioned Manfredi to paint another for him, which Mancini considered Manfredi's best work. Manfredi died in Rome in 1622. Gerard Seghers (or Segers; 1589‚Äì1651) was one of his pupils.Gerard Seghers and the 'Denial of St Peter' , Benedict Nicolson.

It is a few meters from the Tomb of Absalom and adjacent to the Tomb of Benei Hezir. Architectural description The monument is a monolith‚Äîit is completely carved out of the solid rock and does not contain a burial chamber. The lowest part of the monument is a crepidoma, a base made of three steps. Above it there is a stylobate, upon which there is a decoration of two ionic columns between two half ionic columns and at the corners there are two pilasters. The capitals are of the Ionic order and are decorated with the egg-and-dart decoration. The upper part of the monument is an Egyptian-style cornice upon which sits a pyramid. The fine masonry and decoration that is visible on the western side, the facade, is only the western side. On the other sides of the tomb the work is extremely rough and unfinished; it seems as if the work was stopped before the artists could finish the job. Identification 1870 photo by Felix Bonfils showing the Tomb of Zechariah to the right of the Tomb of Benei Hezir. Traditional identification According to a Jewish tradition, which is first suggested by the 1215 CE writings of Menahem haHebroni, this is the tomb of the priest Zechariah Ben Jehoiada, a figure that the Book of Chronicles records to have been stoned: :And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the Lord, that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the Lord, he hath also forsaken you. And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the Lord There is no documentary evidence as to where he was buried.Rachel Hachlili, Jewish funerary customs, practices and rites in the Second Temple period (2005), page 132 Scientific identification and dating As depicted in David Roberts' The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt, and Nubia The so-called tomb does not contain a body. The style of the construction, which includes Hellenistic details such as Ionic columns, is similar to that of the Tomb of Benei Hezir, and several authors think that they are near-contemporary with one another; scholars specialising in funerary practices and monuments have ascribed a first-century CE date to the tomb.Rachel Hachlili, Jewish funerary customs, practices and rites in the Second Temple period (2005), page 30 It has been proposed that the Tomb of Zechariah is actually the nefesh (a Jewish funerary monument similar to the Greek stele) for the Tomb of Benei Hezir,Samuel Rocca, Herod's Judaea, (2008), page 365 which is accessed from a rock-cut passage adjacent to the monument, and which states that it has an adjacent magnificent structure, an item not otherwise identified.

It is near to the mouth of the Karnaphuli River. Patenga is a popular and renowned tourist spot. The beach is very close to the Bangladesh Naval Academy of the Bangladesh Navy and Shah Amanat International Airport. Description Its width is narrow and swimming into the sea is not recommended. Part of the seashore is built-up with concrete walls, and large blocks of stones have been laid to prevent erosion. During the 1990s, a host of restaurants and kiosks sprouted out around the beach area. Lighting of the area has enhanced the security aspect of visiting at night. Nowadays, alcohol peddling is very common at the beach. Vendors from the city sell their ice creams, cold drinks and food to the hundreds of tourists who come to Patenga Beach. According to the local people, Patenga is the best place for delicious, mouth-watering street food at very low costs. One of the popular dishes of the food stands is the fried, spicy mud crab served with a small plate full of falafel, garnished with cucumber and onion. The beach has a wonderful cool atmosphere even in the evening, and people come to enjoy the soothing breeze. The beach is lined with massive shady palm trees and fishing boats. It also has an array of speedboats for visitors. The beach, however, is quite sandy, with a few rocky patches.

The museum was founded by U.S. Army Surgeon General William A. Hammond as the Army Medical Museum (AMM) in 1862; it became the NMHM in 1989 and relocated to its present site at the Army's Forest Glen Annex in 2011. An element of the Defense Health Agency (DHA), the NMHM is a member of the National Health Sciences Consortium.  History  The Army Medical Museum and Library building housed the Army Medical Museum from 1887 to 1947 ‚Äì and again from 1962 to 1969, when the building was razed. 19th century The AMM was established during the American Civil War as a center for the collection of specimens for research in military medicine and surgery. In 1862, Hammond directed medical officers in the field to collect \\"specimens of morbid anatomy...together with projectiles and foreign bodies removed\\" and to forward them to the newly founded museum for study. The AMM's first curator, John H. Brinton, visited mid-Atlantic battlefields and solicited contributions from doctors throughout the Union Army. During and after the war, AMM staff took pictures of wounded soldiers showing effects of gunshot wounds as well as results of amputations and other surgical procedures. The information collected was compiled into six volumes of The Medical and Surgical History of the War of the Rebellion, published between 1870 and 1883. 20th century During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, AMM staff engaged in various types of medical research. They pioneered in photomicrographic techniques, established a library and cataloging system which later formed the basis for the National Library of Medicine (NLM), and led the AMM into research on infectious diseases while discovering the cause of yellow fever. They contributed to research on vaccinations for typhoid fever, and during World War I, AMM staff were involved in vaccinations and health education campaigns, including major efforts to combat sexually transmissible diseases. AFIP building) on the Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC) garrison, Washington, DC, where it was housed from 1971 to 2011. By World War II, research at the AMM focused increasingly on pathology. In 1946 the AMM became a division of the new Army Institute of Pathology (AIP), which became the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) in 1949. The AMM's library and part of its archives were transferred to the National Library of Medicine when that institution was created in 1956. The AMM itself became the Medical Museum of the AFIP in 1949, the Armed Forces Medical Museum in 1974, and finally the NMHM in 1989. During its peak years on the National Mall in the 1960s, every year the Museum saw \\"as many as 400,000 to 500,000 people coming through\\". But after its moves to increasingly obscure and out-of-the-way sites, it fell into a period of relative neglect. By the 1990s, it was attracting only between 40,000 and 50,000 visitors a year.Tanouye, Erik, ‚ÄúNational Mall Running Out of Space: Federal Planners Want No More Museums in the 2-mile Strip‚Äù, Hearst News Service, February 12, 1998. In 1989, C. Everett Koop (in his last year as Surgeon General) commissioned the \\"National Museum of Health and Medicine Foundation\\", a private, nonprofit organization to explore avenues for its future development and revitalization, with the aim of ultimately returning its collection to a venue on the National Mall.Abse, Nathan, ‚ÄúPush Is On for New Medical Museum as Old Collection Is Modernized‚Äù, Washington Post, December 16, 1997. Proposed was ‚Äúa site on land that is located east of and adjacent to the Hubert H. Humphrey Building (100 Independence Avenue, Southwest, in the District of Columbia)‚Äù.This spot is at Third Street and Independence Avenue SW. See: 108 Stat. 2852 Public Law 103-337 ‚Äì Oct. 5, 1994 (c) Rule of Construction. In 1993, a draft bill authored by Sen. Edward Kennedy proposed $21.8 million for moving the existing collection to a new facility to be constructed on that site. That bill, however, was never introduced owing to political difficulties including objections from Constance Breuer‚Äîwidow of Marcel Breuer, architect of the Humphrey Building‚Äîwho objected to the view obstruction that would be entailed by the proposed construction. A letter from the Department of Defense to Koop in the mid-1990s, expressed hope that the NMHM exhibits would \\"one day be provided the appropriate and prominent home they deserve back at the National Mall in the new National Health Museum\\". But the DoD backed away from contributing to funding a new museum.Abse (1997), Op. cit. The Foundation was superseded by a new organization, dedicated to creating a National Health Museum, which was focused on public health education. Although the effort for a physical museum appears to be defunct, the museum maintains a virtual presence. 2011 move Due to the closure of Walter Reed Army Medical Center, National Museum of Health and Medicine has relocated‚Äîfor the tenth time‚Äîto U.S. Army Garrison-Forest Glen in Silver Spring, Montgomery County, Maryland. Authority over the Forest Glen garrison was transferred from WRAMC to Fort Detrick in October 2008. The NMHM closed its exhibits on April 3, 2011, and reopened in a new building on September 15, 2011. On October 1, 2015, the NMHM became part of the Defense Health Agency. Holdings=Major collections The NMHM embodies five collections consisting of about 25 million artifacts, including 5,000 skeletal specimens, 8,000 preserved organs, 12,000 items of medical equipment, an archive of historic medical documents, and collections related to neuroanatomy and developmental anatomy. The museum's most famous artifacts relate to President Abraham Lincoln and his assassination on April 14, 1865, by John Wilkes Booth. A typical display case at the museum. Clockwise from top right: the skeleton of Able, a rhesus macaque who was among the first primates ever to be sent to space; a box containing the tumor that killed Ulysses S.

On display are a copy by sculptor Avarel Fairbanks of Lincoln's life mask and hands made by Leonard Volk in 1860, the bullet fired from the Deringer pistol which ended the President's life, the probe used by the U.S. Army Surgeon General to locate the bullet during autopsy, pieces of Lincoln's hair and skull, and the autopsy surgeon's shirt cuff, stained with Lincoln's blood. In 2010 the heirs of American pathologist Thomas Harvey (1912‚Äì2007) transferred all of his holdings constituting the remains of Albert Einstein's brain to the NMHM, including 14 photographs of the whole brain (which is now in fragments) never before revealed to the public.Falk, Dean, Frederick E.

Included in this growing assemblage of more than 12,000 objects are x-ray equipment, microscopes, surgical instruments, numismatics and anatomical models. * The Anatomical Collections are made up of bones and body parts. More than 5,000 skeletal specimens and 10,000 preserved organs document medical cases of disease and injury. The collection supports research in pathology, physical anthropology, forensic anthropology, and paleopathology. * The Otis Historical Archives houses photographs, illustrations, and documents related to health and medicine. More than 350 different collections document, in pictures and words, the practice of medicine from the Civil War to the present. * The Human Developmental Anatomy Center maintains the largest collection of embryologic material in the United States. The Center is a primary source for centralized research in developmental anatomy. The Center is also known for its imaging and 3-D reconstructions of embryo development. * The Neuroanatomical Collections comprise nine different collections focusing on human and non-human neuroanatomy and neuropathology. These collections are a unique international resource for the study of the brain. Major exhibitions Museum exhibition Galleries feature several permanent exhibits alongside several rotating displays. * Advances in Military Medicine: During times of war and times of peace, American military medical personnel have cared for service men and women with skill and compassion. But new weapons and new environments bring new injuries, and epidemic disease remains a foe uniting all eras of combat. The unwavering commitment of military personnel to provide the best care in difficult and dire conditions, often on an enormous scale and at a fast pace, has led to major medical breakthroughs, improving the lives of people around the world. * Anatomy and Pathology: These specimens provide examples of healthy anatomical structures. Healthy specimens establish a reference point for anatomical study. Comparing healthy specimens with diseased or injured tissues can help illustrate the changes caused by illness and trauma. Understanding these processes is often the first step towards improved prevention and treatment. * Collection that Teaches: The Army Medical Museum, nearly from the time of its founding in 1862, was engaged in an innovative effort to collect, collate and share the lessons of battlefield medicine during the course of the Civil War. Past exhibits include; * To Bind Up the Nation's Wounds: Medicine During the Civil War shows Civil War medicine through the eyes of battlefield surgeons and the stories of Union and Confederate sick and wounded. * Evolution of the Microscope displays items from the world's largest and most representative collection in tracing the development of the basic tool of the bioscientist over the last 400 years. * Battlefield Surgery 101: From the Civil War to Vietnam, exclusively from the museum's historical archives and historical collections, presents the highlights of the evolution of military surgical activities over the last 140 years through a selection of photographs and 19th- and 20th- century artifacts. * Abraham Lincoln: The Final Casualty of the War: To mark the 200th anniversary of President Abraham Lincoln's birth, NMHM honors the 16th president of the United States with this exhibition of items associated with his last hours and the physicians who cared for him. * Trauma Bay II, Balad, Iraq, offers a rare view inside a former Air Force tent hospital in Balad, Iraq. * Resolved: Advances in Forensic Identification of U.S. War Dead highlights the underlying forensic sciences that have evolved in fulfilling this nation‚Äôs commitment to the identification and commemoration of the U.S. service member.

His major contribution to clinical medicine was his 27-year work, which is found in his scientific book Compendium of Materia Medica. He is also considered to be the greatest scientific naturalist of China, and developed many innovative methods for the proper classification of herb components and medications to be used for treating diseases.

The Compendium is a medical text with 1,892 entries, with details about more than 1,800 drugs (Chinese Medicine), including 1,100 illustrations and 11,000 prescriptions. It also described the type, form, flavor, nature and application in disease treatments of 1,094 herbs. The book has been translated into many different languages, and remains as the premier reference work for herbal medicine.

He lived during the Ming Dynasty and was influenced by the Neo-Confucian beliefs of the time. He was born in what is today Qizhou,Panyu Tiger: Li Shizhen Qichun County, Hubei on July 3, 1518 AD and died 75 years later, in 1593. Li's grandfather had been a doctor who traveled the countryside and was considered relatively low on the social scale of the time. His father was a traditional physician and scholar who had written several influential books. He tried to move up in society and encouraged his son to seek a government position. Li took the national civil service exam three times, but after failing each one, he turned to medicine. At 78, his father took him on as an apprentice. When he was 38, and a practicing physician, he cured the son of the Prince of Chu and was invited to be an official there. A few years after, he got a government position as assistant president at the Imperial Medical Institute in Beijing. However, even though he had climbed up the social ladder, as his father had originally wanted, he left a year later to return to being a doctor. In his government position, Li was able to read many rare medical books; he also saw the disorder, mistakes, and conflicting information that were serious problems in most medical publications of the time and soon began the book Compendium of Materia Medica to compile correct information with a logical system of organization. A small part was based on another book which had been written several hundred years earlier, Jingshi Zhenglei Beiji Bencao (Ching-hsih Cheng-lei Pei-chi Pen-tsao; \\"Classified Materia Medica for Emergencies\\") ‚Äì which, unlike many other books, had formulas and recipes for most of the entries. In the writing of the Compendium of Materia Medica, he travelled extensively, gaining first-hand experience with many herbs and local remedies and consulted over 800 books ‚Äì nearly every medical book in print at the time. Altogether, the writing of Compendium of Materia Medica took 27 years, which included three revisions. Ironically, writing the book allegedly took a considerable toll on his health. It was rumored that he stayed indoors for ten consecutive years during the writing of the Compendium of Materia Medica.Tan, S Y. \\"Medicine in Stamps -- Li Shih-Chen (1518-1593) -- Herbalist of Renown.\\" Singapore Medical Association. 2003. University of Hawaii. 24 Apr. 2006 . After he had completed it, a friend ‚Äúreported that Li was emaciated.‚Äù Li died before the book was officially published, and the current emperor paid it little regard. However, it remained one of the most important materia medica of China. The mineral lishizhenite, described in 1990, is named in his honor.Li, Wanmao and Chen, Guoying (1990) Lishizhenite - A new zinc sulphate mineral. Acta Mineralogica Sinica: 10(4): 299-305 Compendium of Materia Medica Compendium of Materia Medica is a pharmaceutical text written by Li Shizhen during the Ming Dynasty of China. Compendium of Materia Medica was a massive literary undertaking. Li's bibliography included nearly 900 books. Because of its size, it was not easy to use, though it was organized much more clearly than others that had come before, which had classified herbs only according to strength. He broke them down to animal, mineral, and plant and divided those categories by their source. Dr. S. Y. Tan says: ‚Äúhis plants were classified according to the habitat, such as aquatic or rock origins, or by special characteristics, e.g. all sweet-smelling plants were grouped together.‚Äù Li had exemplary recording techniques. Seeking to fix the errors of previous works, the medicinal plants and substances in the Compendium of Materia Medica were clearly organized and categorized. With every entry, he included: * ‚ÄúInformation concerning a previously false classification; * Information on secondary names, including the sources of the names; * Collected explanations, commentaries and quotes in chronological order, including origin of the material, appearance, time of collection, medicinally useful parts, similarities with other medicinal materials; * Information concerning the preparation of the material; * Explanation of doubtful points; * Correction of mistakes; * Taste and nature; * Enumeration of main indications; * Explanation of the effects; and * Enumeration of prescriptions in which the material is used, including form and dosage of the prescriptions.‚Äù Compendium of Materia Medica contained nearly 1,900 substances, which included 374 that had not appeared in other works. Not only did it list and describe the substances, but it also included prescriptions for use ‚Äì about 11,000 - 8,000 of which were not well known. The Compendium of Materia Medica also had 1160 illustrated drawings to aid the text. In addition to writing Compendium of Materia Medica, Li was one of the first to recognize gallstones, use ice to bring down a fever, and to use steam and fumigants to prevent the spread of infection. Li also emphasized preventative medicine. He said that ‚Äú‚ÄòTo cure disease is like waiting until one is thirsty before digging a well...‚Äô‚Äù and listed over 500 treatments to maintain good health and strengthen the body, 50 of which he invented himself. Compendium of Materia Medica still has scientific, medical, and historical significance today. A plant or substance‚Äôs inclusion in the Compendium of Materia Medica is a sign of posterity. Medical clinics and manufacturers use his name and image on their logos and products and there was even a movie made about his life in 1956. His image can be found at almost every traditional medical college in China and in many books about Chinese medicine. There is even a Li Shizhen award for ‚Äúdoctors and researchers who have made valuable contributions to traditional Chinese medicine.‚Äù While only six copies of the original edition remain ‚Äì One in the US Library of Congress, two in China, and three in Japan (a seventh copy in Berlin was destroyed during World War II) ‚Äì several new editions and numerous translations have been made throughout the centuries, and it was not replaced as the pharmaceutical materia medica of China until 1959: over 400 years after its first publication.

Life He was the son of the humanist Gerhard Johann Vossius. Isaak formed what was accounted the best private library in the world (Massil 2003). He had a contemporary reputation for eccentricity, refusing the sacrament on his deathbed, it was reported, until reminded that to do so would reflect unfavorably on the canons of St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, to which chapter he belonged. He was raised in the atmosphere of a scholarly household, familiar with Greek, ancient geography, and Arabic from an early age. In 1641, he undertook a European tour, in which he visited England, France and Italy (notably Florence), making the acquaintance of scholars of the elder generation such as James Ussher and Hugo Grotius and beginning his lifelong collecting of manuscripts and books before he returned to Amsterdam in 1644 to take up a position as city librarian. In 1648, he went to Sweden, summoned by Queen Christina to take up a position as her court librarian, and was accompanied by Cornelius Tollius as his amanuensis. There he enriched the library that had been founded by Gustavus Adolphus, partly as booty of war from the library of Prague, with judicious purchases, but incurred the enmity of the French philologist Claudius Salmasius. At the death of his father in 1650, he returned briefly to Amsterdam to oversee the shipping of his father's library to Stockholm. He determined to leave Sweden in 1654, and after Christina abdicated upon her conversion to Catholicism, he followed her to Brussels, where he took his leave of her. The impecunious queen paid her former librarian's outstanding back pay in books, among which was the Codex Argenteus. In 1664 Vossius was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in London. After his brilliant, though at times controversial, career of scholarship in Sweden, Vossius went to England in 1670, received a degree in civil law from Oxford, and became residentiary canon at Windsor in 1673, a post he held until 1688, shortly before his death. In the later stage of his life, his interests turned to mathematics and natural history. After his death, his heirs sold his library of books and manuscripts to the University of Leiden. Works He was the author of De septuaginta interpretibus (1661), De poematum cantu et viribus rhythmi (1673), and Variarum observationum liber (1685).

Located near Mount Mourne, Iredell County, North Carolina north of Davidson, North Carolina, the house was built about 1840 and is a fine example of the Federal-Greek Revival style of architecture often built in the Piedmont area during this period. The house was built by Dr. George Washington Stinson, one of the first trustees of Davidson College, which was founded in 1837. History The original structure consisted of 8 rooms (each with its own fireplace and mantle) on 2 levels off center hallways. The -story staircase features a walnut, spiral- turned handrail believed imported from Charleston, South Carolina. Tradition relates that Dr. Stinson's home was popular among the Davidson College students, not only because he had several eligible daughters, but also because he permitted square dancing, which was strongly discouraged by the Presbyterians of the day. Stinson was a member of Centre Presbyterian Church, where he and his wife are buried. Their son, Edgar Burett Stinson, graduated from Davidson in 1856, fought in the Civil War, and then returned to the family home where he later died. The house remained in the Stinson family until the twentieth century.Woodlawn School - Historic Woodlawn House In 1981, an upstairs bathroom was installed, heat pumps were placed into service, and the front porch was restored. In 1985, a significant, architecturally compatible addition was made to the back of the house. This included a kitchen and breakfast area, bathroom, and wraparound deck. The nearby carriage house was also constructed at this time, and a potting shed was finished in the early 1990s. In 2002, the house and its parcel were purchased for use by a new independent, private school - Woodlawn School.

It is about south of Dhaka, the capital, and about from the district headquarters. Demographics According to the 2011 Bangladesh census, Kuakata had 2,065 households and a population of 9,077. Culture Kuakata is a place of pilgrimage for Hindu and Buddhist communities. Innumerable devotees arrive here at the festivals of 'Rush Purnima' and 'Maghi Purnima'. On these occasions the pilgrims take holy baths at the bay and participate in the traditional fairs. One may visit a 100-year-old Buddhist temple where the statue of Goutama Buddha and two 200-year-old wells are located.

Locally known as Shagor Kannya (Daughter of Ocean), the long strip of dark, marbled sand stretches for about . The long, wide beach at Kuakata has a typical natural setting. This sandy beach has gentle slopes into the Bay of Bengal. Kuakata is also a sanctuary for migratory winter birds. On the eastern end of the beach is Gongamati Reserved Forest, an evergreen mangrove forest and snippet of the original Kuakata. (When the Rakhines settled in the area in 1784, Kuakata was part of the larger Sundarbans forest. However, the Sundarbans is one-hour away by speed boat.) As a mangrove forest, Gongamati, like the Sundarbans, offers some protection against tidal surges. However, it too is being threatened by logging and deforestation. The best way to reach the forest is by foot or bike along the beach, where flag-flying fishing boats can be seen trawling the coast. Visiting Gangamati in the late afternoon is a perfect time to watch the sun cast shadows on the exposed mangrove roots. On 13 September 2007 the government had announced a red alert in Kuakata as caution for a possible tsunami.

It is part of the Great Artesian Basin drainage basin of Australia. The Surat Basin extends across an area of 270,000 square kilometres and the southern third of the basin occupies a large part of northern New South Wales, the remainder is in Queensland. It comprises Jurassic through to Cretaceous aged sediments derived from Triassic and Permian arc rocks of the Hunter-Bowen orogeny. Towns situated above the basin, once dominated by agriculture, are experiencing a boom as mines and infrastructure in the area are expanded. Formation The Surat Basin is an intracratonic basin that covers a sizeable section of New South Wales and southern Queensland. It was formed by fluvial sedimentation of an intracratonic area which underwent sediment sag-loading in the Jurassic to Cretaceous.  Stratigraphy  The western central parts of the Surat Basin unconformably overlies the Palaeozoic igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks of the Lachlan Fold Belt. Dalby, 2010 In the east and northern parts of Queensland it unconformably overlies the sedimentary basin rocks of the Hunter-Bowen Orogen. The Surat Basin overlies parts of the Bowen Basin in southern Queensland, and overlies the Gunnedah Basin in central New South Wales. Palaeozoic basement highs mark the western and eastern boundaries of the Surat Basin. The Nebine Ridge delineates the boundary between the Surat Basin and the Eromanga Basin to the west. The Nebine Ridge is well developed in Queensland and gravity data indicate that the southern extension of the ridge into northern New South Wales is terminated by cross faulting. In Queensland the Kumbarilla Ridge divides the Surat Basin from the Clarence- Moreton Basin to the east. The mostly flat-lying basin has a maximum thickness of about 2,500 m in Queensland, with up to 1,800 m preserved in New South Wales. The basin hosts the fossiliferous early to middle Cenomanian Griman Creek Formation. Economic geology More than 100 hydrocarbon accumulations have been found in the basin however only half are producing. The Surat Basin is not very important a target for oil as the source rocks have not generally been subjected to suitable conditions to evolve oil. There is some slight natural gas potential. Jurassic coal seams have been worked and explored in the Queensland portions of the basin. Mines The basin has a number of mines such as Wilkie Creek Mine where Peabody Energy Australia mines and then exports coal.Queensland's World-class Coals: Mine Production and Developments December 2005. Retrieved 19 April 2007. Coal seam methane The basin has a number of coal seam methane fields - also known as coalbed methane - developing in the region. These fields presently supply the domestic market, including a number of power stations and the Roma to Brisbane Pipeline. A number of gas companies have recently announced plans to develop liquified natural gas plants in or around Gladstone to export Surat Basin gas to international markets. The Port of Gladstone is undergoing a A$3.5 billion expansion to accommodate expected demands. In 2010, two energy companies confirmed their mines have the potential to affect groundwater levels.

Smisek previously worked in the airline industry as the chairman, president, and chief executive officer (CEO) of Continental Airlines and, later, of United Airlines. Early life and education Smisek was born in 1954. (requires purchase for access). His father, Raymond, was a World War II bomber pilot. His mother, Betty, was a big-band singer with the USO. Smisek grew up on military bases around the United States and Europe until his parents permanently moved to San Antonio in 1963. Smisek graduated summa cum laude with an A.B. in economics from Princeton University in 1976 after completing a 74-page long senior thesis titled \\"Zoning and Non-Zoning in the Urban Property Market: An Empirical Study of Princeton, New Jersey.\\" He received a J.D. magna cum laude from Harvard Law School in 1982. Career Before leaving the airline industry in 2015, Smisek spent the bulk of his career in leadership positions at Continental Airlines (1995-2010) and United Airlines (2010-2015).  Continental Airlines  Smisek was a partner at the law firm of Vinson & Elkins in Houston, Texas, but in 1995 was persuaded by Continental's then-CEO Gordon Bethune to join Continental as general counsel to help reverse the ailing airline's fortunes. When he joined Continental, Smisek joined a carrier that was running out of cash and hurting from a work slowdown by its pilots and poor service delivered by dispirited workers who were scarred by two trips through bankruptcy. Smisek's first task at Continental was to convince financiers to let it break leases on its Airbus A300 fleet, which were bleeding the airline dry. Rather than dumping the unwanted planes on the leasing companies, Smisek found other takers for the aircraft. Smisek became one of the chief architects of Continental's dramatic turnaround. Bethune once told USA Today that Smisek was the airline‚Äôs savior. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like in the movies when some guy saves an airplane from spinning to Earth...But he engineered the salvation of our company.‚Äù In 2004, Smisek became president and was elected to Continental's board of directors. He became chief operating officer in September 2008 and CEO in January 2010.Jeff Smisek Biography, United Continental Holdings, Inc. website.  United Airlines  As a wave of consolidation hit the airline industry in 2008, Smisek led negotiations to merge Continental with United Airlines. The two airlines merged in October 2010, keeping the United name, and Smisek became president, CEO and, eventually, chairman of the board. Smisek oversaw the complex merger, which sought to combine route networks, negotiate new contracts with its employee groups, and merge and update disparate IT systems. From 2010 to 2015, Smisek tripled the value of United's stock. Difficulties stemming from the merger of United and Continental led to initial complaints over customer service and employee satisfaction and problems with the integration of Continental. By late 2014 Smisek had regained the trust of Wall Street analysts after a strategy of cost cuts, share buybacks and conservative expansion of capacities. Smisek resigned from United on September 8, 2015 following accusations that the airline had attempted to influence officials at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Smisek was never charged with wrongdoing and instead Port Authority Chairman David Samson was convicted of a felony for impeding an airport project to coerce United Airlines to fly to an airport in South Carolina, near a home that he owned. Smisek left United Airlines with a severance payment worth $28.8 million.  Finch Therapeutics  In February 2017, Smisek led a $5.6 million Series A financing of Finch Therapeutics, a clinical-stage microbiome therapeutics company. Smisek also joined the board of the company which, later in 2017, began a collaboration with Takeda, merged with Crestovo, and in 2018 completed a $36 million Series B financing. Awards and honors Smisek was named Aviation Week's Person of the Year for 2010.Aviation Week (January 3, 2011). \\"Aviation Week Names United Continental CEO Jeff Smisek Person of the Year\\", press release via PR Newswire.

She also served in the Soviet Navy as EK-30 and in the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force as JDS Keyaki (PF-15), JDS Keyaki (PF-295) and YAC-21. Construction and commissioning Evansville was launched on 27 November 1943, by the Leathem D. Smith Shipbuilding Company at Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, sponsored by Mrs. Don Davis, daughter of the Mayor of Evansville, Indiana. She was commissioned on 4 December 1944, with Lieutenant Commander G. T. Applegate, USCG, in command. Service history=U.S. Navy, World War II, 1944-1945 Evansville steamed down the Mississippi River and after calling at Mobile, Alabama, reached Charleston, South Carolina, on 31 December 1944. Through the next six months, she had escort duty along the United States East Coast and to Bermuda, patrolled off New York, and served briefly as a weather ship on ocean weather stations. Earmarked for transfer to the Soviet Navy in Project Hula, a secret program at Cold Bay in the Territory of Alaska for the transfer of U.S. Navy ships to the Soviet Navy in anticipation of the Soviet Union joining the war against Japan, Evansville departed New York City on 9 July 1945, transited the Panama canal, and steamed to San Diego, California and Seattle, Washington, before proceeding to Cold Bay. Training of her new Soviet crew soon began.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , p. 35.

Commissioned into the Soviet Navy immediately, Newport was designated as a storozhevoi korabl (\\"escort ship\\") and renamed EK-30 in Soviet service.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , pp. 35, 39. On 5 September 1945, all ship transfers to the Soviet Union were ordered stopped, although training for ships already transferred was allowed to continue. Accordingly, EK-30 remained at Cold Bay along with EK-26 (ex-Gloucester), EK-28 (ex- Newport), and EK-29 (ex-Bath) for additional shakedown and training until 17 September 1945, when all four ships departed in company bound for Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in the Soviet Union, the last four of the 149 Project Hula ships to do so. Too late for World War II service with the Soviet Navy, EK-30 served as a patrol vessel in the Soviet Far East.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , pp. 34, 35, 39. In February 1946, the United States began negotiations for the return of ships loaned to the Soviet Union for use during World War II. On 8 May 1947, United States Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal informed the United States Department of State that the United States Department of the Navy wanted 480 of the 585 combatant ships it had transferred to the Soviet Union for World War II use returned, EK-30 among them. Negotiations for the return of the ships were protracted, but in October or November 1949 the Soviet Union finally returned EK-30 to the U.S. Navy at Yokosuka, Japan.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , pp. 37-38, 39.

A Judas's belt, sometimes called Judah's belt, is a type of firecracker that produces multiple explosions. Named after Judas Iscariot, the belt consists of a string of small triangular or tubular shaped firecrackers approximately totaling up to one hundred or more and a bigger firecracker in the end. A longer version of the firecracker belt is sometimes called sawa, the Tagalog word for python. Etymology Popular in the Philippines during New Year's Eve celebrations, it is known as Sintur√≥n ni Hudas (Tagalog for \\"Judas's belt,\\" from the Spanish cintur√≥n de Judas). The name comes from an old Catholic tradition during Holy Week in the Philippines, wherein a chain of firecrackers is strapped to an effigy of Judas Iscariot and then lit up. Description A Judas belt consists of a number of small explosives that can be either tubular or triangular in shape, wrapped in thick paper, and arranged sequentially along with a common fuse and a bigger firecracker at the other end. The small triangular shaped explosives, which is also known as triangulos, each measure typically length in its longest side while the tubular shaped firecrackers, which is known as el diablos or diablos, each measure typically long and in diameter. The bigger firecracker at the end is usually a bawang, which essentially a bigger triangulo. The belt can be laid out on the ground or suspended from something like a tree or wall. The end of the fuse is lit, and as the fuse burns, it ignites each of the explosives with a noise similar to a machine gun. A typical belt contains only up to one hundred or more and a longer belt is sometimes called sawa, the Tagalog term for python.  Safety  In the Philippines, Republic Act 7183 was enacted to regulate and to control the sale, distribution, manufacture and use of firecrackers for public safety. According to the said law. Judas's belt is a legal firecracker although bigger versions of the Judas's belt are banned.

Foundation funds are also used to educate others on the importance of early testing and diagnosis of prostate cancer (Shinn is a prostate cancer survivor). Other Foundation initiatives include the establishment and support program for students at Fruitland Baptist Bible Institute in Hendersonville, North Carolina, which prepares students for ministry, and an ongoing school/orphanage/church project in the Port-au-Prince suburb of Tabarre, Haiti. In 2012, the George Shinn Foundation was able to provide funding to complete a multi-story medical clinic, which will provide medical care to the community surrounding the Amer-Haitian Bon Zami House of Hope. Hoops for Homes was created by the Shinn Foundation directly following Hurricane Katrina to rebuild homes in the New Orleans community. The project provided funding and repairs for more than 65 homes. George Shinn has most recently partnered with Nashville non-profit, Room In the Inn, and donated more than 60 pairs of shoes during the 2012 holiday season. Room In the Inn is a ministry serving the homeless. Denise Shinn, George's wife, serves as the Foundation's president.

The youngest ever (at the time) at 34. Writings Shinn is the author of half a dozen books including The Miracle of Motivation, The American Dream Still Works, and You Gotta Believe! The Story of the Charlotte Hornets. Trial and departure of team to New Orleans Shinn was accused of kidnapping and sexually assaulting a Charlotte woman. A jury rejected the claims at trial in December 1999, but Shinn admitted in court to having two sexual relationships outside of his marriage, which damaged his reputation. The trial was broadcast nationwide on Court TV and drew some of the cable network's highest ratings at the time. The trial and his subsequent tarnished reputation was one of the key reasons for the move from Charlotte to New Orleans. Shinn has not returned to Charlotte since the Hornets left for New Orleans in 2002. In a 2008 interview with The Charlotte Observer, Shinn admitted that the drama over his personal life was a factor in the Hornets leaving town. He also said that if he had it to do all over again, he would not have withdrawn from public view as he had after the sexual assault trial. Hornets buyout In April 2010, Shinn started considering selling his majority share of the Hornets to Gary Chouest, who had bought 25% of the team. The negotiations stalled due to the team's financial issues. Because Shinn was not in a financial position to continue to run the team, the NBA was expected to purchase and run the team while looking for a local owner. The NBA completed its purchase of the Hornets from George Shinn and Gary Chouest in December 2010 for an estimated $300 million. Personal life Shinn has three children from his first marriage. One of his children is Chris Shinn. He was the lead singer of the rock band Live from March 2012 until December 2016, and was of greater musicians fame from his work with Unified Theory and his solo albums he released. In November 2009 Shinn announced he had prostate cancer. By March 2010, after several months of treatment, he announced he was cancer-free. Shinn also survived a stroke suffered early in the Hornets' inaugural season. Net worth In 2010 the former New Orleans Hornets owner had an estimated net worth of $100 million.

It is located on the mandibular (lower) arch of the mouth, and generally opposes the maxillary (upper) first molars and the maxillary 2nd premolar in normal class I occlusion. The function of this molar is similar to that of all molars in regard to grinding being the principal action during mastication, commonly known as chewing. There are usually five well-developed cusps on mandibular first molars: two on the buccal (side nearest the cheek), two lingual (side nearest the tongue), and one distal. The shape of the developmental and supplementary grooves, on the occlusal surface, are describes as being 'M' shaped. There are great differences between the deciduous (baby) mandibular molars and those of the permanent mandibular molars, even though their function are similar. The permanent mandibular molars are not considered to have any teeth that precede it. Despite being named molars, the deciduous molars are followed by permanent premolars. In the universal system of notation, the deciduous mandibular first molars are designated by a letter written in uppercase. The right deciduous mandibular first molar is known as \\"S\\", and the left one is known as \\"L\\". The international notation has a different system of notation. Thus, the right deciduous mandibular first molar is known as \\"84\\", and the left one is known as \\"74\\". In the universal system of notation, the permanent mandibular first molars are designated by a number. The right permanent mandibular first molar is known as \\"30\\", and the left one is known as \\"19\\". The Palmer notation uses a number in conjunction with a symbol designating in which quadrant the tooth is found. For this tooth, the left and right first molars would have the same number, \\"6\\", but the right one would have the symbol, \\"‚îê\\", over it, while the left one would have, \\"‚îå\\". The international notation has a different numbering system than the previous two, and the right permanent mandibular first molar is known as \\"46\\", and the left one is known as \\"36\\". Mandibular permanent first molars usually have four pulp horns. The first molar is usually the first permanent tooth to erupt and has adult undertones.  Anatomy  The mandibular first molar has five cusps: the mesiobuccal (MB, toward midline and cheek), mesiolingual (ML, toward midline and tongue), distolingual (DL, away from midline and towards tongue), distobuccal (DB, away from midline and toward cheek), and distal (D, away from midline), listed in order of decreasing size. Listed in order of decreasing height they are: ML, DL, DB, MB, and D. An eighth cusp was found in a primary second lower molar in an Argentinean child. Viewed from the top of the tooth (occlusal view), the mandibular first molar is pentagonal (five sided) in shape and tapers toward the lingual, with the sides being the buccal surface, the mesial surface, the lingual surface, distal surface, and the distobuccal surface. The occlusal surface has four grooves. The central groove is not straight but runs down the center of the tooth mesially to distally and contains four pits (mesial, central, central, and distal). The distobuccal groove runs from the distal pit in the central groove distobuccally separating the distal and distobuccal cusps. The lingual groove runs from the more distal of the central pits in the central groove toward the lingual surface between the mesiolingual and distolingual cusps. The buccal groove runs from the more mesial of the central pits in the central groove toward the buccal surface between the mesiobuccal and distobuccal cusps ending in the buccal pit. The portion of the central groove between the central pits is termed the Lewis offset and is mandatory to account for the locations of the buccal and lingual grooves (buccal groove being more mesial than the lingual groove while they are parallel). From the buccal (buccal view), two roots are present. The distal root is generally straighter, although both often have a slight distal curvature. The heights of contour on the mesial and distal contact the adjacent teeth and are located at the junction of the occlusal and middle thirds of the crown. The mesial view shows a slight tipping of the crown to the lingual. Both roots have flutings but they are more prominent on the mesial root. The mesial root is broader buccolingually and its apex is more blunted. The height of contour on the buccal is in the gingival third and the occlusal two thirds of the surface is flat. The lingual height of contour is in the middle third of the tooth and the lingual surface is evenly convex. The sharpness of the mesiolingual cusp can also be noted from this view. File:Mandibular 1st Molar.svg] Pathology The shape of the developmental and supplementary grooves, on the occlusal surface, is described as being 'M' shaped. The mandibular first molars are the most common carious teeth and the most common teeth to undergo endodontic treatment or extraction.

They combine three electric likemb√© (a traditional instrument similar to the mbira) with voices, dancers, and percussion instruments that are made out of items salvaged from a junkyard. The group's amplification equipment is equally rudimentary, including a microphone carved out of wood fitted with a magnet from an automobile alternator and a gigantic horn-shaped amplifier. The group achieved international renown beginning in 2005, with its DIY aesthetic appealing to many fans of rock and electronic music. They played that same year at the Eurock√©ennes festival in France.  Etymology  The group's full name, as seen on the banner in its music video, is L'orchestre folklorique T.P. Konono N¬∫1 de Mingiedi; \\"T.P.\\" (short for tout puissant, or \\"all powerful\\") is an homage to the band of the legendary Congolese musician Franco, which was called TP OK Jazz.  History  The group originally come from the Kongo people (or Bacongo) region, that includes parts of Democratic Republic Congo and Angola. They made their base Kinshasa in the former. The group was formed in 1966 by Mingiedi Mawangu, a likemb√© player and truck driver. Mawangu was a member of the Zombo (or Bazombo) ethnic group, whose homeland is in Maquela do Zombo, located in U√≠ge Province of Angola, near the border with DR Congo. For his likemb√© ensemble, he adapted Zombo ritual music that was originally played by an ensemble of horns made from elephant tusks. In November 1978, the ensemble called Orchestre Tout Puissant Likembe Konono N¬∫1 (All-Powerful Likembe Orchestra Konono N¬∫1) recorded one track, \\"Mungua- Muanga,\\" for the compilation album Zaire: Musiques Urbaines a Kinshasa. The group has exerted an influence on many other Congolese popular musicians and groups. The first time Konono N¬∫1 played outside of Africa was in 2003, when they toured the Netherlands with Dutch band The Ex. Since 2003 The Ex has regularly performed one of their songs live. Entitled Congotronics, their first album was produced in Kinshasa by Crammed Discs' Vincent Kenis. It was released in 2004, and was welcomed enthusiastically by the international press.http://www.crammed.be/index.php?id=45&art;_id=77 Since then the group has achieved some renown in North America, Europe and Japan, and has toured extensively. In 2006 the band won the Newcomer award from the BBC Radio 3 Awards for World Music. The group collaborated with Bj√∂rk on the song \\"Earth Intruders\\" from her studio album, Volta. They also accompanied her on her promotional tour for the album in 2007. Konono N¬∫1's album Live At Couleur Caf√© was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2008. Konono N¬∫1 collaborated on \\"Imagine\\" for the 2010 Herbie Hancock album, The Imagine Project along with Seal, P!nk, India.Arie, Jeff Beck, Oumou Sangare and others. The song earned the Grammy Award for \\"Best Pop Collaboration\\". The group were chosen by Matt Groening to perform at the edition of the All Tomorrow's Parties festival he curated in May 2010 in Minehead, England.Gehr, Richard, \\"The 9 Best Moments of All Tomorrow's Parties\\", Spin, May 10, 2010.

The group's founder Mingiedi Mawangu stopped touring with the band around 2009, and entrusted his duties as band leader and lead likembe player to his son Augustin Mawangu Mingiedi, who is further developing the sound of Konono's electric thumb piano by using various effect pedals.

Early life and education Beebe was born in Wakefield, Massachusetts, to a prominent Boston family.Beebe Estate He attended both Harvard University and Yale University, where he contributed to the campus newspaper, Harvard Crimson, and the humor magazine, The Yale Record. During his tenures at boarding school and university, Beebe was known for his numerous pranks. One of his more outrageous stunts included an attempt at festooning J. P. Morgan's yacht Corsair III with toilet paper from a chartered airplane. His pranks were not without consequence, and he proudly noted that he had the sole distinction of having been expelled from both Harvard and Yale, at the insistence, respectively, of the president and dean.The Lucius Beebe Reader, p. 7. Beebe earned his undergraduate degree from Harvard in 1926, only to be expelled during graduate school. Journalist During and immediately after obtaining his degree from Harvard, Beebe published several books of poetry, but eventually found his true calling in journalism. He worked as a journalist for the New York Herald Tribune, the San Francisco Examiner, the Boston Telegram, and the Boston Evening Transcript, and was a contributing writer to many magazines such as Gourmet, The New Yorker, Town and Country, Holiday, American Heritage, and Playboy. Beebe re-launched Nevada's first newspaper, the Territorial Enterprise, in 1952. He wrote a syndicated column for the New York Herald Tribune from the 1930s through 1944 called This New York. The column chronicled the doings of fashionable society at such storied restaurants and nightclubs as El Morocco, the 21 Club, the Stork Club, and The Colony. Beebe is credited with popularizing the term \\"cafe society\\", which was used to describe the people mentioned in his column. In 1950, Beebe and his long-time romantic partner, photographer Charles Clegg, moved to Virginia City, Nevada, where they purchased and restored the Piper family home and later purchased the dormant Territorial Enterprise newspaper. The newspaper was relaunched in 1952, and by 1954 had achieved the highest circulation in the West for a weekly newspaper. Beebe and Clegg co-wrote the That Was the West series of historical essays for the newspaper. In 1960, Beebe began work with the San Francisco Chronicle, where he wrote a syndicated column, This Wild West.The Provacative Pen of Lucius Beebe, Esq., p. vii. During the six years that he wrote the column, Beebe covered such topics as economics, politics, journalism, religion, history, morals, justice, finance, and travel. Gourmand Beebe was a noted gourmand. He had his own column, Along the Boulevards, in Gourmet, and wrote extensively for Holiday and Playboy about restaurants and dining experiences around the world. Some of the restaurants he covered include The Colony, The Stork Club,Kamp, David The United States of Arugula, New York: Broadway Books, 2006. The Pump Room, the 21 Club, Simpson's-in-the-Strand, and Chasen's. Also a wine aficionado, he was a member of the Confr√©rie des Chevaliers du Tastevin. Author In addition to his work as a journalist, Beebe wrote over 35 books. These dealt primarily with railroading and caf√© society. He was the first writer to use a painting by Howard L. Fogg, noted railroad artist, on the cover of a book.Beebe, Lucius. Mixed Train Daily. (1947)(New York: E. P. Dutton & Co.). Many of his railroad books were written with his longtime companion Charles Clegg. Beebe was inducted into the Nevada Writers Hall of Fame in 1992. Railroad history Beebe wrote extensively about the joys of train travel, including such nostalgic books describing quaint short line railroads as Mixed Train Daily (1947) and Narrow Gauge in the Rockies (1958). In September, 1947, he arranged an excursion on the Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad covered by a photo spread in Life. Beebe and Clegg were attired in formal wear and top hats, as waiters served champagne and caviar to their guests riding in an open car behind an ancient steam locomotive. Beebe's book The Trains We Rode (1965) used more than 1,500 photos and illustrations to chronicle the passing era of famous named passenger trains and streamliners, along with the stations they served. For example, he proclaimed Baltimore's Mount Royal Station, built in the early 1890s, as \\"one of the celebrated railroad stations of the world, ranking in renown with Euston Station, London, scene of so many of Sherlock Holmes' departures, the Gare du Nord in Paris, and the feudal fortress of the Pennsylvania Railroad at Broad Street, Philadelphia.\\" Along with Clegg, Beebe owned two private railcars, the Gold Coast and The Virginia City. The Gold Coast, Georgia Northern / Central of Georgia No. 100, was built in 1905 and is now at the California State Railroad Museum. After Beebe and Clegg purchased The Virginia City, they had it refurbished and redecorated by famed Hollywood set designer Robert T. Hanley in a style known as Venetian Renaissance Baroque. Beebe in the Virginia City The Virginia City has been restored and currently operates as an excursion car. Beebe and Clegg wrote about and photographed the Virginia & Truckee Railroad and worked unsuccessfully with other railroad fans to preserve it.Wurm, Ted and Demoro, Harre, \\"The Silver Short Line: A History of the Virginia & Truckee Railroad\\" (1983, Trans-Anglo Books) (). Their fame was such that they were caricatured in \\"Fiddletown & Copperopolis,\\" by Carl Fallberg.The first cartoon in the Summer section shows them riding on the Beebe & Clegg Special. Beebe is decked out in spats and top hat while Clegg is in what appears to be a lovely silk bathrobe. Fallberg, Carl, \\"Fiddletown & Copperopolis,\\" (1985, Heimburger House). . Ship travel Beebe was a noted partisan of the Cunard Line and passenger liner travel in general. He wrote several articles about trans-Atlantic passage on Cunard ships during the \\"Golden Era\\" of the 1920s, 30s and 40s. Sartorial splendor A noted boulevardier, Beebe had an impressive and baroque wardrobe. Beebe's clothing included 40 suits, at least two mink-lined overcoats, numerous top hats and bowlers, a collection of doeskin gloves, walking sticks and a substantial gold nugget watch chain.Emrich, D. \\"Biographical Sketch\\" in The Lucius Beebe Reader, p. 391. Columnist Walter Winchell referred to Beebe and his wardrobe as \\"Luscious Lucius\\". Beebe's sartorial splendor was recognized when he appeared in full formal day attire on the cover of Life over the title of \\"Lucius Beebe Sets a Style\\". Many of Beebe's articles and columns addressed men's traditional fashion. He was especially fond of English bespoke tailoring and shoes and wrote glowing articles about noted court tailor Henry Poole & Company and noted bootmaker John Lobb, whom he patronized on a regular basis. He also liked ties, particularly from Charvet in Paris,The Lucius Beebe Reader , p. 214 men's hats and wrote of the history of the bowler hat.\\"The Bowler\\" in The Lucius Beebe Reader, p. 278. Personal life In 1940, Beebe met Charles Clegg while both were houseguests at the Washington, D.C., home of Evalyn Walsh McLean. The two soon developed a personal and professional relationship that continued for the rest of Beebe's life. Previously, Beebe had been involved with society photographer Jerome Zerbe. The pair initially lived in New York City, where both men were prominent in caf√© society circles. Eventually tiring of that social life, the two moved in 1950 to Virginia City, Nevada, a tiny community that had once been a fabled mining boomtown. There, they reactivated and began publishing the Territorial Enterprise, a fabled 19th-century newspaper that had once been the employer of Mark Twain. Beebe and Clegg shared a renovated mansion in the town, traveled extensively, and remained prominent in social circles. Beebe was a community activist while living in Nevada. He was appointed by Nevada's governor to be a member of the Nevada State Centennial Committee (1958) and was Chairman of the Silver Centennial Monument Committee, groups that planned events honoring Nevada's and Virginia City's history. Through their efforts, the federal government commissioned a commemorative stamp in recognition of the discovery of the Comstock Lode in the Virginia City region. Clegg and Beebe sold the Territorial Enterprise in 1961 and purchased a home in suburban San Francisco. They continued the writing, photography, and travel that had marked their lives until Beebe's death. Beebe died at the age of 63 of a sudden heart attack at his winter home in Hillsborough, California, (near San Francisco) on Friday, February 4, 1966. A memorial service was held three days later, on Monday, February 7, at 11:00 a.m. at Emmanuel Church on Newbury Street in Boston. His ashes, reportedly along with those of two of his dogs, were returned to Massachusetts and are buried in Lakeside Cemetery on North Avenue in his hometown of Wakefield, in one of the Beebe family plots, at the extreme north end of the cemetery. Clegg committed suicide in 1979, at the same age that Beebe had reached when he died.

The Hunter-Bowen Orogeny occurred in two main phases, a Permian accretion of previously formed passive-marginal Devonian and Carboniferous sediments in the Hunter region and mid-west region of what is now New South Wales, separated by rifting, back-arc volcanism and a later Permian to Triassic event resulting in arc accretion and metamorphism during a subduction event. The Hunter-Bowen Orogeny has resulted in the New England Fold Belt, a tectonic accretion of metamorphic terranes and mid-crustal granitoid intrusions, flanked by Permian to Triassic sedimentary basins which were formed distally to the now-eroded orogenic mountain belt. While the Great Dividing Range north of Sydney is a prominent landform, this is more the result of Cenozoic volcanism and crustal uplift since the Jurassic than the result of the original orogenic belt which is essentially mimics. Gravity, magnetics and bathymetry indicate that several slivers of crust formerly from the Hunter-Bowen orogen are now spread out across the Indo-Australian Plate east of the Australian continental landmass, forming some isolated submerged ocean plateaux and islands, notably Lord Howe Rise which includes Lord Howe Island. Lord Howe Rise has a total area of about 1,500,000 square km, Prior tectonics The Hunter-Bowen event produced a ~3,000 km long structural foredeep above a Late Carboniferous and Palaeozoic margin to the weakly consolidated Australian continental mass which was part of the Gondwana Supercontinent at this time; the orogen developed to the east of the Palaeozoic Lachlan Orogen and the Proterozoic terranes of the Mount Isa Inlier. Before the orogeny the rocks of the coastal area were formed. During Late Carboniferous there was a continental margin with an oceanic trench subducting the ocean floor off the coast. To the east there was a magmatic arc. This includes Connors Arch, Auburn Arch, Combarrago Volcanics and the Bathurst Batholith. A forearc basin in between included the Tamworth Belt and Yarrol Belt. Subduction resulted in blueschist metamorphism. At 309 Ma a mid oceanic ridge plate boundary encountered the subduction boundary near Tin Can Bay south of Fraser Island on the North D'Aguilar block. Another encounter point was near what is now Coffs Harbour. These ridge encounters with the trench stopped the subduction at those points and resulted in triple junctions moving north and south up the trench, and being replaced by a dextral transform fault. The northernmost triple junction, a ridge-trench-fault junction moved up the Queensland coast at 28 mm per year. As it moved the magmatism inland stopped and it reached Townsville about 290 Ma. The paired triple junction with this, a fault-trench-fault junction, moved south from Brisbane at about 12 mm per year. The triple junctions in the New England region stopped subduction very quickly because the mid ocean ridge was almost parallel to the trench. The merger converted the trench to a transform fault and turned off the volcanoes to the west. In between these two ridge trench encounter points, a small triangular shaped plate continued to subduct between Brisbane and Coffs Harbour. More time was available to build up a wide subduction complex. Megafold The Texas-Coffs Harbour megafold resulted from dextral motion (clockwise) along a major fault in eastern Queensland. The hypothetical fault, which is not exposed at the surface was called Gogango- Baryulgil fault zone. 500 km southerly displacement of the coastal terrane which stretches from Coffs Harbour in the south to Broad Sound near St Lawrence, Queensland in the north, brought it into its current position relative to the rest of Australia, and formed a major structural fold inland from Coffs Harbour. The movement may have been caused by absorption of lateral motion between the northern pair of triple junctions. The megafold formed around 290 Ma (early Permian) and took from 10 to 20 million years. Around this terrane some areas of extension happened on the main craton, creating several basins up to 2 km deep. The Texas region is one such sedimentary basin. Around 280 Ma in the early Permian, the relative oceanic plate movement changed direction and the continental margin again became convergent. This may be due to far distant continental collisions in the buildup of Pangea. Volcanoes appeared in central Queensland forming the Lizzie Creek Volcanics and the Camboon Volcanics. Extension in these formed the Grantleight Trough, an intra-arc rift. The subduction zone was in a line with the north-east coast of Queensland, with a back arc basin formed to the east of the Hunter region, called the Barnard Basin. Deposition continued in basins around 270 Ma into the Permian, but volcanic activity was reduced. The Sydney-Gunnedah-Bowen Basin This structural foredeep filled with marine deepwater sediments and later fluviatile sandstones, which during the Permian and Triassic formed vast accumulations of coal. The Sydney and Bowen Basins were flanked by an offshore island arc system during continued accretion and subduction during the Permian. Thrusting of the Permian sequences westward in a Rocky Mountains style foreland basin system continued as metamorphism began affecting the lower parts of the offshore island arcs, composed primarily of Devonian marine sediments of continental origin, and Carboniferous flysch. Metamorphism resulted in the generation of S-type and I-type granites which intruded this Palaeozoic sedimentary sequence in the New England Fold Belt. To the north, significant thin-skinned deformation affected the Carboniferous Marlborough and Yarrol Terranes, resulting in magmatism and restricted granite emplacement. The subduction zone was curved in an arc resulting in compression in the west-southwest east-northeast direction as well as sinistral shear in the New England district. A continental fragment may have collided with the area, pushing off the Hastings Block and fracturing the Barnard Basin. The results of the Hunter-Bowen event were: * Deformation **Metamorphism of both greenschist and rare blueschist facies **thrusting ** Transtension pull-apart basins such as the ***Esk Trough, a thin pull-apart rift infill fluvial coal- bearing basin ***Clarence Moreton Basin, including the Ipswich Basin ** Transpressional faulting and widespread deformation * Arc volcanism, namely in the Gympie province, offshore of the Hunter valley and Sydney Basin * Back-arc basin formation, **Gunnedah Basin **Sydney basin **Bowen Basin * Granite emplacement ** New England I-type and S-type suites during accretion (330-260Ma) ** Gympie M-type and I-type suites in back-arc position (4 suites; 260-245; 240-235, 231-225 and 220-215Ma) * Andesite, rhyolite and basalt volcanism in the ** In-arc at the Permo-Triassic boundary ** Back-arc in the early to mid Triassic * Gold, tin, tungsten mineralisation in the Gympie Block, the New England orogen and throughout the Queensland hinterlands * Coal formation in the Sydney basin, Esk Trough, Gunnedah Basin, Bowen Basin and Ipswich Basin Geochronology Geochronology has identified several episodes of deformation, accretion, subduction and magmatism.

He is best known for his work on later medieval and early modern European social history. Brunner's research made a sharp break with the traditional forms of political and social history practiced in German and Austrian academia in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, proposing in its place a new model of social history informed by attention to \\"folkish\\" cultural values, particularly as related to political violence and ideas of lordship and leadership. He taught at the University of Vienna and later the University of Hamburg. From 1940 to 1945, he also served as the director of the Institute for Austrian Historical Research (Institut f√ºr √∂sterreichische Geschichtsforschung) in Vienna, a prestigious school for archival and historical studies. Historical views and works Brunner ranks as one of the most important German medievalists of the twentieth century, but his legacy as a historian in post-war Austria and Germany has been controversial. Along with many conservative Austrian academics in the 1920s and 30's, Brunner embraced pan-Germanistic politics and welcomed the Nazi Anschluss. He attempted to join the Nazi Party in 1938, though his application was held up until 1941‚Äîthe Nazis tended to be suspicious of those who rushed to 'jump on the bandwagon' and held out full party membership only to those who demonstrated exceptional, and early, commitment to the National Socialist cause.See Van Horn Melton, \\"Folk History,\\" p. 271 Nonetheless, Brunner's 1939 book Land und Herrschaft (Land and Lordship) was welcomed as a seminal contribution to a \\"new\\" German historiography that valorized the historical role of the \\"folk\\" (Volk), the Germanic racial-ethnic community whose citizenry and spirit the Nazis claimed to embody. In the book, Brunner argued that the idea of a \\"Land\\"‚Äîa historically and culturally distinct region within the larger medieval imperial polity‚Äîwas not simply an invention of feudal law, but an outgrowth of more organic and culturally complex claims to power (Herrschaft) resting in the idea of patriarchal rule over a household and its members (Hausherrschaft), as well as that of a chieftain over his band of warriors (Gefolgschaftsrecht). These traditions, Brunner argued, were fundamental aspects of Germanic folk-consciousness and social life and played a key role in shaping the history of German lands. He criticized then-current approaches to history which viewed medieval institutions and legal practices as primitive antecedents of a supposedly more advanced form of political community, namely the constitutional nation-state. The radical devaluation of the idea of political liberalism and the centrality of the democratic nation state could also be found in the writings of the fascist legal theorist Carl Schmitt, whose work Brunner followed closely and cited in his books. Although his intellectual efforts were clearly aligned with the Nazis, Brunner was apparently not personally antisemitic and even used his own resources and political connections during the war to protect the mother of a colleague, Erich Z√∂llner, who was part Jewish and would have been subject to deportation.See Z√∂llner's appreciative reflection in his obituary for Brunner in the Mitteilungen des Instituts f√ºr √∂sterreichische Geschichtsforschung, vol. 90 (1982), p. 522. Due to his political affiliations, Brunner was forced out of his university post in 1945 and worked for a number of years as an independent scholar before being appointed to the chair of medieval history at Hamburg in 1954 as successor to Hermann Aubin, a scholar of eastern European history with notably similar political sympathies. In the post-war period, Brunner continued to write on medieval and early modern social history. Land und Herrschaft remained a standard text in Germany for the history of medieval social organization from a cultural perspective. In 1949, Brunner published his second acclaimed work, Adeliges Landleben und Europ√§ischer Geist (Noble Rural Life and the European Spirit), a highly original biography of the Austrian baron Wolf Helmhard von Hohberg (1612-1688) which illuminated the shared cultural and intellectual values of the European nobility in the early modern period. He also produced a collection of essays, Neue Wege der Verfassungs- und Sozialgeschichte (New Paths of Constitutional and Social History)(1956) which presented some of the ideas of Land und Herrschaft in a modified form and attempted to offer an expanded notion of European history as the basis for a new global culture. Brunner also contributed, with Werner Conze and Reinhart Koselleck, to a major encyclopedic work, Geschichtliche Grundbegriffe, or Fundamental Concepts in History which helped shape a new discipline, that of conceptual history. Conceptual history deals with the evolution of paradigmatic ideas and value systems over time, such as \\"liberty\\" or \\"reform.\\" Brunner, along with his colleagues, believed that social history‚Äîindeed all historical reflection‚Äîmust begin with an understanding of historically contingent cultural values and practices in their particular contexts over time. Legacy and controversy Brunner, along with historians like Karl Bosl, Walter Schlesinger, Theodor Schieder and Werner Conze‚Äîall of whom supported, or were openly sympathetic to, Nazism in one way or another before and during the war -- dominated the theory and teaching of medieval social history in post-war Germany and Austria.Graus, \\"Verfassungsgeschichte,\\" is the key survey of the so-called school of \\"New Constitutional History,\\" of which Brunner was considered key member. A few scholars, like the Czech medievalist Franti≈°ek Graus, attempted to raise questions about the ideological implications of their methods and theories, as well as the tenability of some of their historical interpretations, but failed to effectively displace them from their position in the academy. More recently, the Israeli medievalist Gadi Algazi leveled a major critique against Brunner's theories, charging that Brunner read his sources through a fascist lens and that his books were clearly intended to support a Nazi vision of cultural history. Others, like the G√∂ttingen historian Otto Gerhard Oexle, have argued that Brunner's work should be understood in the broader context of historical attitudes in the 1920s and 30's and not simply dismissed as Nazi propaganda. The historian Hanna Skoda has said that \\"his own political views sit uncomfortably with a historiographical willingness to take his conclusions very seriously\\". Otto Brunner died in 1982 as professor-emeritus of medieval history at Hamburg. ReferencesMajor Works by Otto Brunner #Land and Lordship: Structures of Governance in Medieval Austria, trans.

Scott Fitzgerald novel The Great Gatsby. Gatsby is a millionaire and the owner of a luxurious mansion where he often hosts extravagant parties, and he is described by the novel's narrator, Nick Carraway, as having \\"an extraordinary gift for hope\\". Character biography James Gatz hails from rural North Dakota, and was born about 1890 into a poor rancher family. He attended St. Olaf College in Minnesota, but dropped out a few weeks into his first semester because he hated supporting himself by working as a janitor. After dropping out, he went to Lake Superior, where he met copper tycoon Dan Cody in Little Girl Bay in the summer of 1907. Cody became Gatz's mentor and invited him to join his ten-year yacht trek. At seventeen, Gatz changed his name to Jay Gatsby and, over the next five years, learned the ways of the wealthy. Cody left Gatsby $25,000 in his will, but after his death, Cody's mistress cheated Gatsby out of the inheritance. In 1917, during his training for the infantry in World War I, 27-year-old Gatsby met and fell in love with 18-year-old debutante Daisy Fay, who was everything Gatsby was not: rich, stylish, and knowledgeable in the ways of the world. During the war, Gatsby reached the rank of Major in the U.S. 16th Infantry Regiment, and was decorated for valor for his participation in the Marne and the Argonne. After the war (as he also tells Nick Carraway years later), he briefly lived in the United Kingdom, where he attended Trinity College, Oxford. Nonetheless, he objects to being called an \\"Oxford man\\". \\"I only stayed five months\\", he explains to Tom Buchanan. \\"That's why I can't really call myself an Oxford man\\".After World War I, the United States military sent 5,700 American soldiers to study at a French university, and 2,000 to study at a British university for four months. While there, he received a letter from Daisy, telling him that she had married the wealthy Tom Buchanan. Gatsby then decided to commit his life to becoming a man of the kind of wealth and stature he believed would win Daisy's love. Gatsby returned home and settled in New York City, which was being transformed by the Jazz Age. It is speculated, but never confirmed, that Gatsby took advantage of Prohibition by making a fortune from bootlegging and built connections with various gangsters such as Meyer Wolfsheim (who Gatsby claims is \\"the man who fixed the World Series back in 1919\\"). With his vast income, Gatsby purchased a mansion in the fictional West Egg (a reference to Great Neck or perhaps Kings Point) of Long Island. West Egg lies on the opposite bay from old-money East Egg (a reference to Sands Point), where Daisy, Tom, and their three-year-old daughter Pammy live. At his West Egg mansion, Gatsby hosts elaborate parties every weekend, open to all comers, in an attempt to attract Daisy as a party guest. Through Daisy's cousin Nick Carraway, Gatsby finally has a chance to reunite with her. Gatsby does not reveal to Daisy or to Nick the truth of how he came to acquire his wealth. During several meetings, Gatsby tries to revive his relationship with Daisy to what had been five years ago. He seeks to woo her with his wealth and asks her to leave her boorish, unfaithful husband. At the Buchanan home, Jordan Baker, Nick, Jay, and the Buchanans decide to visit New York City. Tom borrows Gatsby's yellow Rolls-Royce to drive up to the city. On the way to New York City, Tom makes a detour at a gas station in \\"the Valley of Ashes\\", a run-down part of Long Island. The owner, George Wilson, shares his concern that his wife, Myrtle, may be having an affair. This unnerves Tom, who has been having an affair with Myrtle, and he leaves in a hurry. During the party in an expensive hotel suite, the casual conversation evolves into a confrontation between Daisy, Gatsby and Tom. In a fit of anger, Gatsby insists that Daisy always loved him, not Tom, and that she only married Tom for his money. Daisy admits she loved both Tom and Gatsby. The party then breaks up, with Daisy driving Gatsby out of New York City in the yellow Rolls-Royce and Tom leaving with Daisy's friend Jordan Baker and Nick in Tom's car. From her upstairs room at the gas station, Myrtle sees an approaching car. Mistakenly believing Tom has returned for her, she runs out towards the car, but is struck and killed instantly. Panicked, Daisy drives away from the scene of the event (which is never revealed to be either an accident or intentional). At Daisy's house in East Egg, Gatsby promises Daisy he would take the blame if they are ever caught. Tom tells George that it was Gatsby's car that killed Myrtle. George goes to Gatsby's house in West Egg, where he shoots and kills Gatsby before committing suicide. Gatsby is later found dead, floating in his pool. Despite the many guests who attended Gatsby's parties, only one (an individual known as \\"Owl Eyes\\") attends his funeral. Also at the funeral are Nick Carraway and Gatsby's father, Henry C. Gatz, who states that he was proud of his son's achievement as a self-made millionaire. Gatsby as a reference point The figure of Jay Gatsby became a cultural touchstone in 20th century America. When the poor native son Gatsby tells Nick Carraway, his only true friend and a relative of Daisy's, he was brought up wealthy and that he attended Oxford because \\"all my ancestors have been educated there\\", MSNBC political commentator Chris Matthews sees him as the eternal American striver: \\"Gatsby needed more than money: he needed to be someone who had always had it.... [T]his blind faith that he can retrofit his very existence to Daisy's specifications is the heart and soul of The Great Gatsby. It's the classic story of the fresh start, the second chance.\\" \\"Jay Gatsby... appears to be the quintessential American male hero. He is a powerful businessman with shady connections, drives a glamorous car... and pursues the beautiful, privileged Daisy,\\" Michael Kimmel and Amy Aronson write. In the Handbook of American Folklore, Richard Dorson sees Gatsby as a new American archetype who made a decision to transform himself after his first chance encounter with his mentor Dan Cody, who opens the door to riches in bootlegging. \\"The ragged youth who some months later (after Gatsby drops out of St. Olaf) introduces himself to a degenerate yachtsman as Jay Gatsby has explicitly rejected the Protestant ethic... in favor of a much more extravagant form of ambition.\\" Referring to real life figures as Gatsby has been common in the United States, usually in reference to rich men whose rise to prominence involved an element of deception. In a story on R. Foster Winans, a reporter for the Wall Street Journals \\"Heard on the Street\\" column who was fired after it was discovered he was giving advance knowledge of the columns' contents to Peter Brant, the Seattle Post Intelligencer described Brant as \\"Winan's Gatsby.\\" The article noted that Brant had changed his name from Bornstein and said he was \\"a man who turned his back on his heritage and his family because he felt that being recognized as Jewish would be a detriment to his career.\\" The character is often used as a symbol of great wealth. Reporting in 2009 on the collapse of home prices and tourist spending in the exclusive Hamptons on Long Island, not far from the fictional setting of Gatsby's home, the Wall Street Journal quoted a struggling hotelier as saying \\"Jay Gatsby is dead.\\" Gatsby has recently been read as a personification and representation of human-caused climate change, as \\"Gatsby‚Äôs life depends on many human-centered, selfish endeavors\\" which are \\"in some part responsible for Earth‚Äôs current ecological crisis.\\" Portrayals=Film Jay Gatsby has been portrayed by several actors in film adaptations of Fitzgerald's novel. Warner Baxter first played the role in the lost 1926 silent film. Gatsby was later portrayed by Alan Ladd in the 1949 film adaptation, Robert Redford in the 1974 film adaptation, Toby Stephens in the 2000 film adaptation, Leonardo DiCaprio in director Baz Luhrmann's 2013 film adaptation, and Gregg Sulkin (as \\"Dylan Carson\\") in Kevin Asch's 2014 drama film Affluenza, billed as a loose re-telling of the novel set among a group of rich and privileged teenagers in Long Island before the 2008 financial crash. Television In The Simpsons episode \\"The Great Phatsby\\", Mr. Burns assumes Jay Gatsby's role, with the storyline spoofing the 2013 film adaptation. Brian Griffin is portrayed as Gatsby in the Family Guy episode \\"High School English\\" with Peter playing Tom, Lois playing Daisy, Stewie playing Nick, Meg playing Jordan Baker and Joe Swanson and Bonnie Swanson playing George and Myrtle Wilson, respectively. Radio Kirk Douglas starred as Gatsby in an adaptation broadcast on CBS' Family Hour of Stars on January 1, 1950. Andrew Scott played Gatsby in the 2012 two-part BBC Radio 4 Classic Serial production.

Its large size allows it to feed easily on other scorpions and a variety of other prey, including lizards and snakes. This species is usually yellow with a dark top and has crab-like pincers. It gets its common names from the brown hairs that cover its body. These hairs help it to detect vibration in the soil. A similar species is the Hadrurus spadix. Habitat Hadrurus pallidus Hadrurus arizonensis is distributed throughout the Sonoran and Mojave deserts. In Mexico, the species' range flanks the Gulf of California in Sonora and Baja California Norte. In the United States, it is found in the western two thirds of Arizona, the Colorado Desert and Mojave Desert regions of southern California, southern Nevada, and extreme southwestern Utah. Arizona Desert hairy scorpions are a warm-desert species, specially adapted to hot and dry conditions. They are usually found in and around washes or low-elevation valleys where they dig elaborate burrows (up to ) and emerge at night to forage for prey and mates. Other species commonly encountered living sympatrically with this species are: Smeringurus mesaensis, Hoffmannius confusus, and Hoffmannius spinigerus. Diet and behavior It is a burrowing scorpion, but is commonly found under rocks containing moisture. Its diet consists of large insects, spiders, and small vertebrates. This is an aggressive and active scorpion, which, as with all scorpions, is nocturnal. Like all scorpions, the giant desert hairy scorpion gives birth to live young, which remain on the mother's back for a week or more before leaving. Toxicity Although this scorpion is big, its venom is not very potent, and its sting is commonly perceived to be about as painful as a honeybee's sting. The venom has an value of 168 mg/kg. However, an allergic reaction to its venom can be fatal; symptoms can include difficulty breathing, excessive swelling, and prolonged pain.

Robert Lomas associates the term with the Higher Self or soul of the individual.Lomas, Robert. The Secret Science of Masonic Initiation. San Francisco: Weiser, 2010, pp. Etymology It appears that Porphyry used it and Thomas Taylor commented on it. The term is encountered in the literature of Neo-Platonic theurgy and was popularized in the 19th and 20th centuries by the Theosophists, Freemasons, and the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. To quote Thomas Taylor's comment on Porphyry: > We are afterwards sent through ample Elysium, and a few of us possess the > joyful plains: till a long period, when the revolving orb of time has > perfected its circulation, frees the soul from its concrete stains, and > leaves the etherial sense pure, together with the fire (or splendour) of > simple ether.\\" For here he evidently conjoins the rational soul, or the > etherial sense, with its splendid vehicle, or the fire of simple ether; > since it is well known that this vehicle, according to Plato, is rendered by > proper purgation 'augoeides', or luciform, and divine.

In referencing of the Hellenic origin of the word, it might be understood to emerge from 'Œ±œÖŒ≥Œø', meaning 'egg', or 'Œ±œÖŒ≥ŒÆ', meaning 'dawn', combined of 'ŒµŒØŒ¥Œ∑œÉŒ∑', indicative of 'news' or 'a message', and thus the connection in Aleister Crowley's mind between the 'egg message' and 'the Knowledge & Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel' or 'higher & original (egg) genius' associated of one's human being. Combined of 'ŒµŒØŒ¥œâŒªŒø', an 'idol' or 'reflection', one might see in it Plato's 'luminous being', a 'reflection of the dawn'. Such a direct etymology is, however, admittedly speculative and subject to revision or reconfirmation by another.

These include the National Statuary Hall Collection and the Statue of Freedom among many others. The westernmost part of the grounds is the Capitol Reflecting Pool, which reflects the Capitol and the Ulysses S. Grant Memorial. History Daguerreotype of the Capitol, c. 1846 Construction of the Capitol began in 1793. When built, it was the only existing building for the use by the nation's legislature. In addition to Congress, the building was also designed to house the Library of Congress, the Supreme Court, the district courts, and other offices. Following the completion of the building and as the nation grew, so did the size of the Congress. The Capitol and its grounds were enlarged accordingly, and by 1892 the building had reached essentially its present size and appearance (with the exception of the east front extension 1958-1962 and courtyard infill areas 1991-1993). Even with the enlargements, Congress eventually grew too big for the building and new facilities had to be constructed to meet the needs of the government. With the moving of the Library of Congress into its own building in 1897, and with the construction of new office buildings for the House and Senate in the early 20th century, the Capitol Complex was born. Known simply as the \\"House Office Building\\" and \\"Senate Office Building\\" when they opened in 1908 and 1909, the Cannon House Office Building and Russell Senate Office Building became the first buildings solely for use as offices by the House of Representatives and the Senate. These new buildings were heated and provided with electricity by the new Capitol Power Plant which opened in 1910 and is still used today. Aerial view of the United States Capitol Complex, c. 1923 The 1930s was a decade of major construction within the growing Capitol Complex. In 1933 alone the U.S. Botanic Garden Conservatory, Director's residence, and Bartholdi Park were completed; the Senate Office Building's First Street wing, which had been omitted during construction for funding reasons, was added; and the Additional House Office Building (later named the Longworth House Office Building) was occupied. The Supreme Court at last found a permanent home when its own building was completed in 1935. The last building constructed within the complex in this decade was the Library of Congress Annex, now named the John Adams Building, which opened in 1939. Within twenty years, attention returned to the need for more Congressional office space; this led to the construction of a second building for the Senate (now named the Dirksen Senate Office Building), which was completed in 1958. The House's third building, the Rayburn House Office Building, opened in 1965. Capitol Complex (in foreground, 2007) looking west toward the National Mall In the 1970s, two more buildings became available for the House: the former Congressional Hotel, the O'Neill House Office Building (demolished in 2002), and a larger building originally constructed for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (now the Ford House Office Building). A third building for the Library of Congress, the James Madison Memorial Building, opened in 1980 and the Senate's third building, the Hart Senate Office Building, was occupied in 1982. The most recent large structure within the Capitol complex is the Thurgood Marshall Federal Judiciary Building, which was opened in 1992. Renovations to the Botanic Garden Conservatory began in September 1997 and continued for four years until December 2001 when the building reopened. The Conservatory's aluminum framework, glazing, interior floors, doors, and lighting were replaced; all electrical, plumbing, and environmental control systems were upgraded, and air conditioning was added to the display halls. The newest addition to the Capitol Complex is the Capitol Visitor Center. Despite many delays, the Center opened in December 2008, and includes an exhibition gallery, two theaters, a dining facility, and gift shops. The budget for construction of the Center was $584 million.

The mall is managed by CapitaLand and owned by CapitaLandMall Trust. There are retail outlets over seven floors and two basements. The mall has a 752 lot seven-storey carpark at the rear of the building, and a two basement goods bay beneath it. The mall is popular with families, teenagers and young adults. The mall was first opened in 1974 and in 2012, it underwent an extensive revamp which included the construction of a new wing increasing retail space by 25 percent. It is one of the oldest malls located along Orchard Road. History Plaza Singapura was completed in 1974 and was designed by BEP Akitek Pte Ltd. At the time of completion, it was one of the very largest shopping malls in Singapore and South East Asia. The major tenants in the mall included Yaohan department store, Yaohan Best (now Best Denki), Yamaha musical instrument showroom and music school for electric organ, piano, drums and other instruments when it opened on 14 September that year. The mall was then managed by DBS Land which is the predecessor of CapitaLand.

The mall did not go under any major renovations until mid 1997 during the Asian Financial Crisis, when it went under major retrofitting with a totally new look and the mall totally changed when it reopened in late 1998. As Yaohan went bankrupt in 1997, it saw the departure of the main store. The mall's tenants changed drastically with Liberty Market took over Yaohan in Basement 2.

The mall had renovations in the basements, and a direct link to Dhoby Ghaut MRT station was constructed. Travelators were also installed in the building for the convenience of shoppers serving between Basement 2, Basement 1 and Level 1. In 2008, further changes were made to Plaza Singapura. Level 7 of the mall was given a face lift and tenants selling toys, gifts and hobby related items such as swords and cosplay costumes were introduced. Plaza Singapura after the renovation in 2013. In 2012, it underwent major renovation work which costs about S$ 150 million. The first phase signifies that the first three levels of Atrium@Orchard, which housed several offices, were converted to shop spaces. The second phase involves the former Carrefour (after the exit on 30 September that year, it became a \\"missing\\" shop) converted to supermarket Cold Storage in basement 2 and department store John Little in level 1, which were completed in June 2013. The mall has also been given a new facade with a 170-metre long wave frontage and features multi-coloured sculptures called the Jelly Baby Family by Italian artist Mauro Peruchetti. The renovation and construction of a new wing has increased the retail floor area of the mall from to , which added 80 new retail and F&B; shops to the directory of the mall.

The remaining 32 hotels, five of them in Norway and Denmark, formed the largest hotel chain in its native Sweden in 1973. In 1983, the company was sold to a Swedish consortium headed by Ratos and the following year, it was named Scandic Hotels. Ratos became sole owner in 1985, and a year later, the first hotel outside Scandinavia opened in Koblenz, Germany. The business was negatively impacted by the 1990/91 Gulf Crisis, and company management was replaced in 1992. In 1996, the group acquired Reso Hotels and became a publicly traded company on the Stockholm Stock Exchange. Two years later, the Arctia Hotels group in Finland followed, giving Scandic a presence in all the Nordic countries, and in 1999, the group expanded into Estonia. In 2001, Scandic was acquired by the London-based Hilton Group. The hotel chain changed ownership again in 2007, this time bought by Swedish private equity firm EQT for EUR 833 million.Scandic Hotels Corporate Information, http://www.scandichotels.com/settings/Side-foot/About-us-Container/Corporate- information/History/.

Unusually for an American television program, Maverick's main cast varied episodically between Garner, Kelly, Moore or Colbert. As such, the starring cast for each episode is listed below alongside other details. Most episodes feature only one of the lead characters named Maverick, and never more than two‚Äîand in two- Maverick episodes, one of the Mavericks is always Bart. Episodes=Season 1 (1957‚Äì1958) James Garner (as Bret Maverick) is the sole star for the first seven episodes. With episode eight, he's joined by Jack Kelly as brother Bart Maverick. From that point on, the two alternate leads more or less from week to week, sometimes teaming up for the occasional episode. Recurring characters include rival gamblers/operators Samantha Crawford, Dandy Jim Buckley and Big Mike McComb. The entire first season was released by Warner Bros. on DVD in mid-2012. Season 2 (1958‚Äì1959) Garner and Kelly continue as alternating leads, with the odd 'team-up' episode. Semi-regulars Samatha Crawford and Dandy Jim Buckley exit partway through the season; new semi- regulars include Cindy Lou Brown and Gentleman Jack Darby. Big Mike McComb also returns from the first season. Season 3 (1959‚Äì1960) Writer/creator Roy Huggins leaves the show. Garner and Kelly remain the leads. Of the recurring characters, only Gentleman Jack Darby returns for season 3, and only for one episode. Three new characters, obvious replacements for Dandy Jim Buckley and Samantha Crawford, are seen, but only for two episodes each: Edward Ashley's impeccably dressed and outwardly charming gambler Nobby Ned Wingate (also spelled \\"Wyngate\\"); Kathleen Crowley's cheerful, scheming gold- digger Melanie Blake; and Mona Freeman's determined but slightly psychotic seeming operator Modesty Blaine. Season 4 (1960‚Äì1961) Jack Kelly stays on as Bart Maverick, who now alternates the lead with Roger Moore as cousin Beau Maverick. Kelly and Moore are also featured in three two-cousin episodes. With the exception of a single two-brother episode held over from the third season, Garner is no longer a part of the show. Before the end of the season, Moore also leaves. At the very end of the season, Moore is briefly replaced by Garner lookalike Robert Colbert as Bart's brother Brent Maverick, who dresses in Bret Maverick's most frequent costume. Peter Breck would make one appearance as Doc Holliday in this season, becoming a semi-regular in the series' final episodes. All previous semi-regulars are dropped for this season, including the new characters (Modesty Blaine, Melanie Blake and Nobby Ned Wingate), just introduced in season 3. Modesty would eventually return for one episode in season 5 ‚Äì but played by Kathleen Crowley, who had previously played Melanie Blake. Season 5 (1961‚Äì1962) Jack Kelly becomes the sole star of new Maverick offerings. This season's episodes alternated with reruns of some of Garner's earlier shows (both solo and Garner/Kelly team-ups, including \\"The Saga of Waco Williams\\"), but during Kelly's new installments, neither Bret, Beau, nor Brent are ever mentioned; the series' new episodes had finally reverted to the original single-Maverick formula observed for the initial seven episodes, only with Kelly as Maverick instead of Garner. However, Garner's name once again appears in the weekly series opening credits before all the newly produced shows, albeit now with second billing under Kelly (Ed Reimers announces \\"Maverick! Starring Jack Kelly and James Garner!\\" each week over the opening credits). The theme song for this season is souped up with a slightly brisker pace and sound effects such as the riverboat's ringing bell. Peter Breck returns as Doc Holliday, becoming a semi-regular in these final episodes. He appears in 4 of the 13 episodes produced for this season, including the series finale. Mike Road appears as \\"Pearly\\" Gates in two episodes, alongside Kathleen Crowley as Gates' companion Marla. Crowley also appears in the final episode as Modesty Blaine, a semi-regular role played earlier by Mona Freeman.

This is true only in permanent teeth. The function of this molar is similar to that of all molars in regard to grinding being the principal action during mastication, commonly known as chewing. Though there is more variation between individuals to that of the first mandibular molar, there are usually four cusps on mandibular second molars: two on the buccal (side nearest the cheek) and two palatal (side nearest the palate). There are great differences between the deciduous (baby) mandibular molars and those of the permanent mandibular molars, even though their function are similar. The permanent mandibular molars are not considered to have any teeth that precede it. Despite being named molars, the deciduous molars are followed by permanent premolars. In the universal system of notation, the deciduous mandibular second molars are designated by a letter written in uppercase. The right deciduous mandibular second molar is known as \\"T\\", and the left one is known as \\"K\\". The international notation has a different system of notation. Thus, the right deciduous mandibular second molar is known as \\"85\\", and the left one is known as \\"75\\". In the universal system of notation, the permanent mandibular second molars are designated by a number. The right permanent mandibular second molar is known as \\"31\\", and the left one is known as \\"18\\". In the Palmer notation, a number is used in conjunction with a symbol designating in which quadrant the tooth is found. For this tooth, the left and right second molars would have the same number, \\"7\\", but the right one would have the symbol, \\"‚îê\\", underneath it, while the left one would have, \\"‚îå\\". The international notation has a different numbering system from the previous two, and the right permanent mandibular second molar is known as \\"47\\", and the left one is known as \\"37\\".

History Completed in November 1993, Junction 8 was the second suburban mall to open in Singapore, after Northpoint in Yishun. When it first opened, it had 73 tenants, such as a Daimaru department store and supermarket, a Golden Village cineplex, Food Junction's first outlet, a duplex level SAFE Superstore and various specialty shops settling in a mall environment for the first time. In 2004, the mall had an expansion block expanded to accommodate more retail spaces and a linkbridge was built, connecting to the car park opposite the mall. Daimaru was replaced by NTUC FairPrice and Seiyu (now BHG) during the former's exit from Singapore in 2003. The roof garden was relocated from Level 2 to Level 3, equipped with a children's playground and an event plaza. Also, the office tower space was decanted into the retail mall, and was subsequently leased to voluntary welfare organisations. In 2013, it underwent a major renovation, repainting its exterior and refreshing the interior of the mall. The children's playground was also renovated.

Born in Walton, Liverpool, England, Wilde died when the ship sank in the Atlantic Ocean. Early life Henry Wilde was christened at the Loxley Congregational Chapel in Loxley, Sheffield on 24 October 1872. He was the son of Henry Wilde, an insurance surveyor from Ecclesfield, South Yorkshire. His mother was Elizabeth Tingle of Loxley, Bradfield. Henry went to sea in his teens. He apprenticed with Messrs. James ird mate aboard the Greystoke Castle, and then moved on to third mate of the 1374-ton Hornsby Castle. His first steamship posting was aboard the S.S. Brunswick in 1895, where he served initially as third mate, then as second mate. In 1896, he transferred to the S.S. Europa and served aboard her as second mate. In July 1897, he joined the White Star Line. Starting as a junior officer, Wilde rose steadily through the ranks while serving on several White Star ships. These included the Covic, Cufic, Tauric, and Delphic.Application for Examination for Ex-Masters Certificate, 14 July 1900 Tragedy struck in December 1910 when Wilde's wife and twin sons Archie and Richard died. In August 1911, Wilde became Chief Officer of Titanics sister, the , where he served under Titanic future captain, Edward J. Smith. Wilde was an officer of the Royal Naval Reserve, where he was commissioned a sub- lieutenant on 26 June 1902. Titanic Wilde was scheduled to leave Southampton on Olympic on 3 April 1912, but a reshuffle on board the Titanic caused the lowering of a rank of William McMaster Murdoch and Charles Lightoller to First and Second Officer, respectively, with Second Officer David Blair being removed from the ship entirely. On the ship's sailing day, 10 April 1912, Wilde reported for duty at 6:00 a.m. Around the time of departure, he was assisting Lightoller in casting off mooring ropes and in securing of tug lines. After the ship was put to sea, Wilde worked the 2‚Äì6 watches. On the Titanic, Wilde wrote a letter to his sister in which he mentioned that he had \\"a queer feeling about the ship\\", although the letter, if it exists, has never been made public. At 11:40 p.m., on 14 April, the ship hit an iceberg. Immediately after the collision, Wilde moved forward to inspect the forepeak and see the flooding for himself. He then came back to the bridge to make a report just before the carpenter arrived. The two reports seem to have convinced Smith that the ship was sinking. While Murdoch was in charge of the evacuation of the starboard boats, with Lightoller for the port side, it appears that Wilde supervised the overall process. He delayed launching the lifeboats and allowed himself twice to be over-ridden by Lightoller going to Captain Smith. He took charge of filling and lowering the even-numbered lifeboats on the port side and also gave firearms to both Lightoller and First Officer Murdoch. By 1:40 a.m., most of the port lifeboats had been lowered, and Wilde moved to the starboard side. Lightoller, in his article for the Christian Science Journal (Bol. XXX, 10/1912, No. 7), wrote that he was \\"on my way back on deck again when I heard Wilde say, 'I am going to put on my life-belt'\\". Death There are conflicting accounts of where Wilde was last seen and what he was doing. One survivor said Wilde was trying to free the Collapsibles A and B from the roof of the Officers' Quarters. Another said that Wilde was smoking a cigarette on the bridge, which ties in with an account in the Cornish Post of 2 May 1912, which refers to \\"Chief Officer H.T. Wilde, who was last seen on the bridge smoking a cigarette\\". It further claims that he \\"waved good-bye to Second Officer Charles Lightoller as the Titanics bows went under\\". There is evidence to suggest that an officer, possibly Wilde, swam over to Collapsible B before dying from hypothermia. Third-class passenger Edward Dorking relates that as he was swimming to Collapsible B, a \\"man who wore an officer's uniform\\" was swimming behind him in the water. He claimed that they both reached the Collapsible but the officer \\"became so exhausted he became unconscious. In ten minutes after he struggled over the side of the raft and was safe, he was dead.\\"\\"ON A SEA OF GLASS: THE LIFE & LOSS OF THE RMS TITANIC\\" by Tad Fitch, J. Kent Layton & Bill Wormstedt. Amberley Books, March 2012. pp 333 Jack Thayer, a first-class passenger who survived aboard Collapsible B, reported that \\"questions and answers were called around ‚Äî who was on board, and who was lost, or what they had been seen doing? One call that came around was, 'Is the chief aboard?' Whether they meant Mr Wilde, the chief officer... I do not know...

His name is recorded on a family tombstone at Kirkdale Cemetery in Liverpool, marked by an obelisk and gravestone. The inscription reads, \\"Also Captain [sic] Henry T.

He was born 26 February 1880 in Street, County Westmeath. Edgeworth is best known for proposing the existence of a disc of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune in the 1930s. Observations later confirmed the existence of the Edgeworth-Kuiper belt in 1992. Today those distant solar system bodies including Pluto, Eris, and Makemake, are grouped into the Edgeworth-Kuiper belt, or Kuiper belt. Early life Edgeworth was born on 26 February 1880 at Daramona House Street, County Westmeath. His parents were Thomas Newcomen Edgeworth (1850‚Äì1931) and Elizabeth Durp√© Wilson. The Edgeworth family originated from Kilshrewly, Co. Longford. The family that Edgeworth was born into was ‚Äòthe archetypal gentleman literary and scientific families‚Äô (McFarland, 1996). The literary link is said to have come more from the Edgeworth side of the family and the scientific link being mainly from the Wilson side. When Edgeworth was born, two subdivisions existed within the in existent Edgeworth family. The superior side descended from Richard Lovell Edgeworth, and the inferior side descended from Kilshrewly branch. His father's family was from Kilshruley, Co. Longford near Edgeworthstown, whose estates were the seats of his father's ancestors. William Wilson, his uncle on his mother's side and the owner of Daramona, built an observatory there and with George Minchin and George Fitzgerald made various types of observations, including pioneering photometric measurements of starlight. Edgeworth's family moved to the estate at Kilshruley four years after his birth. It had ‚ÄòGrubb 12-inch‚Äô and ‚Äô24-inch reflectors‚Äô which his uncle had acquired from Sir Howard Grubb of Dublin a year after he went on an expedition to Algeria to observe the 1870 total eclipse, at just age 19. He remained a regular visitor to the observatory, meeting Wilson's scientific friends George Minchin and George Fitzgerald. His observations included the 1882 transit of Venus. Later in Edgeworth's life he devoted his autobiography to them. It was his uncle who proposed Edgeworth to the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS). After residing at Daramona, Edgeworth's parents moved to Ardglas House and then to Mount Murray, near Lough Owel. After about four years at Mount Murray, they moved to the family home at Kilshruley, about miles from Edgeworthstown to join Kenneth Essex's grandfather, the retired clergyman Essex Edgeworth. At Kilshruley, Kenneth Essex developed his engineering skills in his father's well-equipped workshop, building small engines, and also experimenting with fireworks and photography. Military career When aged 17, Edgeworth attended the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, London, where he won the Pollock Medal for best cadet in 1898. He also attended the Royal School of Military Engineering at Chatham and served a commission in the Corps of Royal Engineers in Egypt.https://www.britastro.org/journal_old/archive/edgewort.htm South Africa, Sudan, and Chatham. Posted to South Africa, he took part in the Second Boer War and was promoted to lieutenant on 3 July 1901. Following the end of the war he left Cape Town on the SS Englishman in late September 1902, and arrived at Southampton in late October, when he was posted at Chatham. He later served in Somaliland and Dublin. In the First World War he served in Royal Corps of Signals to maintain communications in France, was mentioned in dispatches three times and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) and the Military Cross. Economic and astronomical career In 1902, Edgeworth's uncle, William E. Wilson, put forward his nephew for election to the Royal Astronomical Society. Edgeworth was elected the following year. At the meeting, one of his papers was read.Hughes, Stefan (2012) \\"Catchers of the Light: the Forgotten Lives of the Men and Women Who first Photographed the Heavens He studied international economics during the Great depression and wrote five books about it during the 1930s and 1940s. He also wrote about the use of turf as a fuel. Influenced by his uncle's former astronomical endeavors, he published scientific papers (at least from 1939) on the Solar system, star formation, red dwarf stars and astronomical redshifts. He said in 1938 that Pluto (discovered eight years earlier by Clyde Tombaugh) was too small to be a planet but was likely a large example of the original material of the Solar system. In the Journal of the British Astronomical Association , he published The Evolution of Our Planetary System in 1943 (the same year that he was elected to the British Astronomical Association (BAA)), with a key reference to a mass of comets existing past Neptune. He was elected to the Royal Irish Academy in 1948. In 1949 he followed his 1943 paper with The Origin and Evolution of the Solar System. He suggested there was a huge number of small bodies at a great distance, with infrequent clustering limiting their size, but with the occasional inward cometary visitor. In 1950, Jan Oort published his paper in which the Oort cloud was put forward. A year after that, Gerard Kuiper presented his paper at the 50th-anniversary symposium of Yerkes Observatory. It is not known why he did not refer to Edgeworth's papers. The Edgeworth-Kuiper belt has been most frequently referred to as the Kuiper belt and this has caused a dispute: :From Steven J. Dick, in Discovery and Classification in Astronomy: Controversy and Consensus: :\\"...others also envisioned trans-Neptunian objects beyond Pluto. As with most Americans, in this book we use the term \\"Kuiper Belt,\\" demonstrating that if classes and classification systems are socially constructed ... nomenclature is even more so.\\" :From Dr. Alan Stern, principal investigator of NASA's New Horizons mission to Pluto, reported in the Irish Times: :\\"Kenneth Edgeworth probably doesn‚Äôt get the credit he deserves. In 1943 and 1949 he had papers that were brilliant. He nailed it.\\" Later life and death During 1916, Edgeworth took a leave of absence. During this time he met Isabel Mary, the widow of Arthur F. Eves. The pair got engaged and married on the 23rd of August 1917. Edgeworth retired from the military in 1926, as a lieutenant-colonel. Sometime during his military years, he became a member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers. He became the chief engineer in the Sudanese Department of Posts and Telegraphs department for five years in Sudan before finally returning home to Ireland. He also wrote a paper on thermionic generators around this time. In 1931, he returned to his parents' home Cherbury, in Booterstown. In his retirement, Edgeworth published four books on economics and over a 23-year period published a number of letters and papers which culminated in his book The Earth, the Planets and the Stars: Their Birth and Evolution (1961). However, before this publication, in 1943, Edgeworth wrote a piece for the Journal of the British Astronomical Association which suggested the idea of a vast reservoir of cometary material beyond Neptune's orbit. This was later validated as ‚ÄòKuiper‚Äôs Belt,‚Äô and despite suggesting it in the 1940s, Edgeworth's astronomical findings were not recognised until 1995. Edgeworth published his autobiography, at age 85, in 1965, Jack of all Trades: The Story of My Life. Kenneth Edgeworth died in Dublin on October 10, 1972, at the age of 92. Publications Edgeworth published on topics of engineering, economics and astronomy. His known books and papers include the following: * Frequency Vvariations in Thermionic Generators.

(Dublin, Alan Figgis, 1965) Legacy The asteroid 3487 Edgeworth (1978 UF), a main- belt asteroid discovered on 28 October 1978 by H. L. Giclas at Flagstaff, is named in his honour. Kenneth Edgeworth has left behind a very important legacy in the field of astronomy. In 1943 he proposed a reservoir of icy objects beyond Neptune. Eight years later the astronomer Gerard Kuiper came up with a more detailed prediction. Those distant solar bodies included Pluto, Eris (dwarf planet) and Makemake onto the Kuiper belt. Some astronomers, however, name it the Edgeworth ‚Äì Kuiper belt. In 1948 he was elected to membership of the Royal Irish Academy, but it was not until 1995 that his research was fully recognised. He was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1903 and belonged to the Institution of Electrical Engineers in 1943. Edgeworth had such an interest in star formation and the development of the Solar System, he wrote a paper specifically on the \\"Origin and the Evolution of the Solar System\\" which continued his research of space research beyond Neptune. More recently, the Edgeworth ‚Äì Kuiper belt has influenced many astronomers to read more into the demotion of Pluto as a planet.

According to the 2001 census, it had 14,197 residents. History The town's name was first documented in the 16th century. According to historian M. Balinskis, its name is derived from word kur≈°is (Curonian). However, according to local people, the town didn't have a name for a long time. But, one summer day the river Venta flooded and washed all hay bales which were standing at the river banks. People started questioning each other: where is the hay? where is the hay? (‚ÄûKur ≈°ienai? Kur ≈°ienai?‚Äú). Since then, the town name stayed as Kur≈°ƒónai.http://www.studijoms.lt/kursenai.html Since a clay that is ideal for fine ceramics was detected near Kur≈°ƒónai, pottery has long been thriving in the city. In the last century, Kur≈°ƒónai became famous for fairs abundant in earthenware. Kur≈°ƒónai is called the ‚ÄúCapital of Potters‚Äù not only due to the abundance of such handicraftsmen in the city but also because the All-Time Potter's Crown has been solely won by the folk artists of Kur≈°ƒónai such as J. Paulauskas, V. Damkus, B. Radeckas, and J. Vertelis. It clearly is no coincidence that a pitcher is one of the elements of the Coat of Arms of the city. The history of Kur≈°ƒónai Manor begins in 1564 when Sigismund Augustus gave the said manor as a fief to George Despot-Zenovich, the Castellan of Polotsk. Soon, a settlement began to grow in the manor lands on the other side of the Venta, and in 1569 the first wooden church was erected. In 1621, the estate went to S. Pac, the Grand Treasurer of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and a decade later the manor became the property of George Gruzewski and his wife. At the end of the 18th century, Kur≈°ƒónai were inherited by Stephen Gruzewski. Having brought in the artist J. Rilke with the apprentice team, he built a new (current) manor house and a chapel and renovated other buildings in 1811. The estate flourished still further under ruling of his younger son Edward who took it over in 1846. Kur≈°ƒónai Manor has the most valuable heritage of wooden manorial architecture in ≈†iauliai District. The original staircase, window frames, and wooden front doors have survived.http://www.siauliurajonas.lt/Kursenai-Land-Potters-240-moncula.html The estate of Kurshan was under Russian rule from 1795 to 1914, first in the Vilna Governorate and from 1843 in the Kovno Governorate. The mansion and the park were devastated by the Germans who occupied the manor during the First World War and took away the most valuable things. In 1914 the town's Jewish population was expelled by the Russian army, who accused them of collaborating with the Germans.Josef Rosin, Protecting Our Litvak Heritage > Kur≈°ƒónai (Kurshan), accessed 2016-01-02 The fire of 1915 destroyed the peasant farms, barns, and sheds. The manor belonged to George Gruzewski at that time. Owing to advanced farming, the estate was flourishing during the interwar period. The manor was nationalized in 1940. Outside the manor, the town itself began to grow in 1873 when a railway station was built here. In 1939 there were around 900 Jews living in the village (out of the total population of around 3000).http://www.yahadmap.org/#village/kur-scaron-nai-kurshan-kurshany-scaron- iauliai-lithuania.684 Their persecution began in July, 1941. Immediately following the arrival of the Germans a Lithuanian partisan squad was formed in Kur≈°ƒónai. They arrested supporters of the Soviet regime and assigned the Jews to various forced labor tasks. When a ghetto was set up in Kur≈°ƒónai by an order of Nazi authorities many Jews were housed in the two synagogues. At the end of July a group of Lithuanian nationalists (white armbanders) and police seized approximately 150 to 168 Jewish men and murdered them in a mass execution in a nearby forest, about three kilometers from city.http://www.holocaustatlas.lt/EN/#a_atlas/search//page//item/95/ Economy Kur≈°ƒónai is famous as a place of pottery craftsmen.

While Prussian Blue was published in German by Carlsen Verlag, Yonen Buzz was released by TOKYOPOP Germany. TOKYOPOP is releasing both titles in English in 2006. The release schedule is rather slow, as the author is a full-time Japanology student. Story The series focuses on a Japanese garage band called Plastic Chew and their struggles to make it big while remaining true to their musical sensibilities and juggling school and part-time jobs. Internal conflict arises because not all four band members have the same talent levels and plans for the future; Saiyuri and Jun are romantically involved, but Jun is prone to psychological reliance on the man who raised him, someone the other band members don't trust. Main characters The members of Plastic Chew are the orphaned Jun Imai, who sings and plays the guitar along with the only female band member, Sayuri Tsushima; the bass guitarist Atsushi Kato; and Keigo Miyake, the drummer. Release The series is also published in Finland by Pauna Media Group. Volume list=Reception English-language critics were lukewarm towards Yonen Buzz. IGN's Richard George stated: \\"Yonen Buzz is what happens when you take interesting characters and do absolutely nothing with them.\\" He described the \\"interesting and fleshed out\\" characters as the series' \\"greatest assets\\" and enjoyed the page layouts, but criticized the \\"repetitive character design\\" and that it \\"lacks a resolution to any plot\\". Rhia Docherty of Mangalife liked the concept of the series, but disliked the confusion in the panels and style changes, and that the concept failed to work and became confusing. Critical reaction towards the prequel was relatively positive. Leroy Douresseaux of Coolstreak Cartoons wrote that the combination of \\"her composition and graphic design\\" inspired by shojo manga, manga targeted towards teen girls, and \\"the flavorings of shonen manga\\", manga targeted towards teen boys, \\"adds an essence to Yonen Buzz: Plastic Chew that makes for a fun read.\\" While noting \\"plot contrivances\\" and that Jun is an \\"archetypal sensitive dreamboat\\", PopCultureShock's Phil Guie stated: \\"Yonen Buzz is, above all, about the idea that music, like a lot of artistic endeavors, is capable of bringing people together, and how joyous it can be meeting others with the same passion as your own.\\" Writing for Mania Entertainment, Erin Jones commented on the \\"bland\\" character designs, \\"amateurish\\" art, and that some aspects of the plot were \\"ridiculously contrived\\".

In July 1855 a 677-acre site just north of the Red Cedar River was recommended to the State Board of Education, the report to the board noted that except for the occasional clearing the land was dense hardwood forest. It was in one of these \\"oak openings\\" that the school built its first three buildings in 1856: a multipurpose building called College Hall, a dormitory building later known as \\"Saints' Rest,\\" and a barn. College Hall contained classrooms, offices, laboratories, a library/museum, and a multifunctional lecture hall/chapel. It was also one of the first buildings in America to be used for the teaching of scientific agriculture.Widder, Keith. \\"Gone But Not Forgotten\\". MSU Archives and Historical Collection.

Michigan Agricultural College campus on opening day May 13, 1857 Since the college was founded in a sparsely populated area with only a handful of nearby farmhouses, and it was an arduous stagecoach ride from Lansing, the College built four faculty houses in the first year of classes in 1857. One of these original faculty houses, Cowles House, still exists as the President's official residence, though only two walls and part of the foundation remain of the original construction. Ultimately, ten faculty homes were built on campus between 1857 and 1885. Besides Cowles House, one other survived and was moved into the city of East Lansing; the rest were demolished between 1922 and 1948 to make room for the north complex of residence halls and the Student Union. Michigan State's campus was among the first to serve as a botanical laboratory for its faculty and students and is the site of what is, today, the oldest continuously operated botanical garden in the US.\\"William James Beal Society\\". Campaign for MSU University Development. Retrieved April 18, 2007. In December 1879, Professor William J. Beal buried seeds of 23 common plants in 20 jars of sand (to prevent water accumulation) in various locations around campus. At certain fixed intervals, currently every 20 years, a jar is dug up to determine which seeds still germinate after their prolonged periods of unlit isolation. The most recent jar exhumation, April 2000, found only a few specimens surviving to germinate, notably Verbascum blattaria (moth mullein), after 120 years. Five buried jars remain, with the next unearthing scheduled for 2020. In 1871, President Abbott proposed that the Board of Trustees \\"take steps to provide for the proper layout of the college grounds, planting of trees, location of buildings, etc., by a competent landscape gardener, as soon as means can be spared.\\" In 1872, Adam Oliver, a landscape gardener from Kalamazoo, was hired. During his tenure from 1872‚Äì1887, he was oversaw the layout of walks and drives and the placement of numerous buildings, including Linton Hall in 1881. He was responsible for the closed roadway system, an altered form of which remains today as West Circle Drive, and was also responsible for the informal arrangement of campus buildings. The character of the campus is described in President Abbott's 1882 report to the Board as follows: \\"There are in the park no straight rows of buildings or of trees, but its...buildings...are separated by undulating lawns, shallow ravines, and groups of trees\\". In 1906 O. C. Simonds a well-known prairie school landscape architect was hired, he simplified the road system, planned walks and planting areas. It was Sidmons who first described this area around West Circle Drive as a \\"sacred space\\" and who reaffirmed the idea of as area of campus as a park to be protected from development. In a 1906 letter to the Board for Trustee's \\"This area is, I am sure, that feature of the College which is most pleasantly and affectionately remembered by the students after they leave their Alma Mater, and I doubt if any instruction given has a greater effect upon their lives.\\" In 1914 the college hired noted landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. with bigger buildings like Olds and Agriculture Halls being built Olmsted faced the challenge of maintaining the informal character of campus while minimizing walking distance. In 1915, the Olmsted Brothers firm issued a report its solution was a dramatic redesign of campus around quadrangles However, the plan was unpopular with students and alumni who wished to maintain the informal parklike feel of campus. After eight years of consulting and little in way of changes the school ended its relationship with Olmsted in 1922. T. Glenn Phillips' 1926 campus plan The college in 1923 hired T. Glenn Phillips, Phillips' 1926 plan for campus kept Simonds' \\"sacred space\\" and it continued the curvilinear road system to the east, with buildings placed in an informal manner. His plan called for campus north of the river to be dedicated to academic purposes while all agriculture and athletic facilities were to be placed south of the river. Phillips' plan would set the tone for campus development for the next 25 years. Post WWII the large number of GIs returning, President John A. Hannah's push to expand resulting in a large increase in enrollment quickened in the pace of development south of the river. The driving factor in campus development of was the automobile this the south featuring buildings and streets generally laid out in a grid system with more land dedicated to parking lots.

South campus  The campus south of the Red Cedar River consists mostly of buildings built after World War II. Many of them are built in the International and Brutalist styles, with relatively straight roadways and fewer trees than the north campus. South campus also has more surface parking lots, due partly to the sporting and performing arts venues. The \\"2020 Vision\\" Master Plan proposes replacing these parking lots with parking ramps and green space, in order to replicate the park like feel of North Campus\\"Campus Master Plan \\" .

Notable academic and research buildings on the South Campus include the Cyclotron and the College of Law.  Service campus and beyond  The majority of Michigan State's academic and residential buildings are north of the Canadian National Railway. South of the CN line are service buildings such as the T. B. Simon Power Plant, laundry services, and the campus incinerator. Nevertheless, there are a growing number of academic buildings south of the railroad. The MSU Clinical Center and the Life Sciences Building are both in this part of campus, as is a nature preserve known as the Baker Woodlot. South still of the university service buildings and the CSX railroad lie thousands of acres of university-owned farmland and agricultural research related facilities such the MSU Pavilion. The proximity of the farmland to campus helps MSU retain a rural feel in keeping with its roots as an agricultural college that mixes with the more urban atmosphere of East Lansing just a mile north. Recently, The Demmer Center has been added to Michigan State University's campus. The Demmer Center is an educational place for students, faculty, and community members to learn to safely handle firearms.MSU Campus Map .

Lying east of Farm Lane just north of the river, it is a popular spot for campus events such as outdoor summer theatre, Greek house tailgating, and candlelight vigils. It was once used by Michigan Agricultural College (forerunner to MSU) students to study mineral contents. MSU has several botanical gardens, including the W. J. Beal Botanical Garden just across the river from the stadium, the Old Horticulture Gardens next to the building of the same name, the MSU Horticulture Gardens, and the adjoining 4-H Children's Garden. The university has several buildings for public gatherings and events. Spartan Stadium serves as the university's football stadium. The Breslin Center is a multi-purpose basketball arena. The Munn Ice Arena is used for ice hockey. The MSU Pavilion serves as a venue for agricultural expositions and other types of events. Michigan State has two separate buildings for theatre. The MSU Auditorium/Fairchild Theatre is used for the MSU Theatre Department's shows, concerts, and public speakers. The Auditorium is on Farm Lane and the north bank of the river, in the heart of campus. To the southeast lies the main theatre for the Lansing metropolitan area, the Wharton Center for Performing Arts. The Wharton Center features Broadway plays and other performances, and was the site the 1992 U.S. presidential election debates. The university also has its own hotel/convention center, the Kellogg Center.  Transportation  MSU's campus has a network of sidewalks, bike paths, roads (often with bike lanes), and unpaved trails. Its transportation network consists of of roads and of sidewalks.Miller, Matthew. \\"MSU a 'city' unto itself]\\". Lansing State Journal. August 20, 2006.

The nearby, earlier town of Lynchburg was largely abandoned and moved to Opdyke. A part of the railroad investment in this area was funded by a mortgage of $4,525,000 by Calhoun & Opdyke of New York. The town is named for Opdyke. It is possible that the name of the village is all that they got out of the investment. The original surveys of Illinois, made around 1800, show the Goshen Road passing through what is now the center of Opdyke in a north/south direction. The road was about a quarter mile east of the north/south section road that now forms the western boundary of the village. Few traces of this road now remain, and it is not clear if the road was still present at the time of the founding of the village. Opdyke formed as a village alongside the railroad tracks.

During the Nara period, the term zu () came into use, but the term most widely used and associated with maps in pre-modern Japan is ezu (, roughly \\"picture diagram\\"). As the term implies, ezu were not necessarily geographically accurate depictions of physical landscape, as is generally associated with maps in modern times, but pictorial images, often including spiritual landscape in addition to physical geography. Ezu often focused on the conveyance of relative information as opposed to adherence to visible contour. For example, an ezu of a temple may include surrounding scenery and clouds to give an impression of nature, human figures to give a sense of how the depicted space is used, and a scale in which more important buildings may appear bigger than less important ones, regardless of actual physical size. In the late 18th century, translators in Nagasaki translated the Dutch word (land)kaart into Japanese as chizu (): today the generally accepted Japanese word for a map. From 1800 (Kansei 12) through 1821 (Bunsei 4), In≈ç Tadataka led a government-sponsored topographic surveying and map-making project. This is considered the first modern geographer's survey of Japan;Ogawa, Florence. (1997). \\"Ino Tadataka, les premiers pas de la geographie moderne au Japon\\", Ebisu, Vol. 16, pp. 95‚Äì119. and the map based on this survey became widely known as the Ino-zu. Later, the Meiji government officially began using the Japanese term chizu in the education system, solidifying the place of the term chizu for \\"map\\" in Japanese. Overview Generally speaking, traditional Japanese maps were quite diverse in style, depiction, and purpose, and were often oriented towards pragmatic use. It was less common for maps to serve literary or decorative purposes as they might in the West, instead being used for purposes such as the differentiation of rice fields on a feudal manor, or orientation within a temple complex. An example might be an Edo era pilgrimage map depicting the route and location of lodges on the road between Kyoto and Edo, including images of people on the road, with distances between stops differentiated not by relative distance, but by numerical markings, as scale as it is recognized in the West today was not generally used. This compression and expansion of space as necessary to emphasize certain qualities of the depicted area is an important characteristic of traditional Japanese maps, as is the regular inclusion of text, as text and image were not separated in Japan nearly to the same degree as in the West. Perspective on traditional Japanese maps can also be confusing to the modern Western viewer, as maps were often designed to be viewed from multiple points of view simultaneously, since maps were often viewed on the floor while the viewers sat around the map in a circle. Accordingly, many maps do not have a unified orientation scheme (such as North as up), with labels sometimes appearing skewed to each other. Much of the fundamental concepts of space as depicted in Japanese maps can be traced to Chinese geomancy and Buddhist cosmologies, which came to Japan in the 7th and 8th centuries. Buddhist cosmologies depict the world as it was thought to exist within the appropriate religious framework, often including mythical sites such as the navel of the world and lands beyond the sea inhabited by monsters. In this sense, world maps based on Buddhist cosmology often bear little resemblance to the \\"real world\\", though many have at least approximately accurate depictions of Japan, Korea, China, and India. Chinese geomancy brought orientation and a regular grid system, as is evidenced in the street plan of Kyoto, which is based on the plan of the ancient Chinese capital of Chang'an. North‚Äìsouth orientation, as in China, is thought to have been evident in the plan of the ancient capital (672‚Äì686 AD) of Naniwa (modern Osaka) as well. Hence, although many traditional Japanese maps are characterized by the malleability of space and lack of importance of accurate depiction of physical landscape, direction, distance, and relative orientation were quite important. Many early Japanese maps were not accurate according to Western standards. Partly, this was the result of Japan being a closed society for many years. They had a long-lasting indifference to exploration as well. And in the feudal society, it was forbidden for ordinary Japanese citizens to travel. \\"In fact, the Japanese government in Edo (Tokyo), had no interest in accurate map making because maps could be used by enemies to gain military advantage.\\"Franklin, Colin. 1997. \\"A Western View of Japanese Mapmaking\\". Mercator's World. . Volume 2 (1), January/February 1997. p. 28. Distorting and falsifying maps was known during World War II. Indeed, there was some discussion that captured Japanese maps had been deliberately falsified to confuse the Allied troops. The Army Map Service put out an announcement toward the end of the war that most of the Japanese maps, although sometimes outdated, were truthful and could be used. \\"In general, native maps of Japan are reliable. Prior to the outbreak of the war, it was alleged that the Japanese falsified certain sheets which they later allowed to fall into our hands. Spot checks against aerial photography have revealed no evidence to substantiate this claim. However, on some of these maps, pertinent military areas were left entirely blank. The US has a basic 1:50,000 coverage for practically all of Japan and 1:25,000 coverage for about a quarter of Japan. These maps, however, do not show the major transformation of man-made features which have taken place in Japan since 1941. Because of this, native Japanese maps are obsolete and their basic reliability is decreased. It is highly important, therefore, that a large-scale map material or trig lists captured from the Japanese be transmitted promptly to the Chief of Engineers in Washington, DC. This is essential also because we possess geographic coordinates for only about a 10th of the estimated 40,000 geodetic stations established in Japan.\\"US Army Map Service. 1945. Tips of Asiatic Pacific Maps. August 1945. pp. 27‚Äì28. History=Earliest maps The oldest known map in Japan is a topographical drawing discovered on a stone wall inside a tomb in the city of Kurayoshi, in Tottori Prefecture, dated to the 6th century AD. Depicting a landscape of houses, bridges, and roads, it is thought to have been made not for practical navigational purposes, but rather as a kind of celestial cartography given to the dead to maintain a connection with the world of the living and allow them to orient themselves when moving on to the other world. Similar maps have been found in other kofun burial tombs as well. There is also evidence that at least rudimentary surveying tools were already in use in this era. One of the oldest written references to maps in a Japanese source is found in the Kojiki, the oldest (albeit largely mythological) history of Japan, in which land records are mentioned. The other major ancient history, the Nihon Shoki of 720 AD, describes a map of the ancient city of Naniwa (modern Osaka). The first map of provincial surveys is thought to be in 738, as described in the Shoku Nihongi. The earliest extant maps in Japan date to the 8th century, and depict the ownership of square rice field plots, oriented to the four cardinal directions. Shinto shrines held maps that they used for agrarian reform, differentiation of property, and land holdings. The system by which these maps were measured was called j≈çri, measured in units called tan and tsubo. Rice fields The Imperial Court of the Emperor K≈çtoku ( ‚Äì 654) put the handen sei (, an ancient land system) into execution in 646 (Taika 2) and asked each province to submit maps of their land holdings, known as denzu (, roughly, \\"picture map of rice fields\\"). This was considered the first attempt in Japan to draw accurate (as opposed to representational) landscape in picture maps. Gy≈çki-zu maps During the Sh≈çmu reign (, 701‚Äì756), maps known as Gy≈çki-zu (), named for the high priest Gy≈çki (, 668‚Äì749), were developed. Gy≈çki himself served as a civil engineer, although there are no explicitly known direct connections between himself and maps. The connection between his name and the term Gy≈çki-zu is thought to be derived from his authority as a priest and perceived connections between maps and geomantic rites to drive away evil spirits. The term Gy≈çki-zu was widespread and used for maps which illustrated the routes from the Imperial capital to each province in Japan. These maps covered a broader area, and include a much larger portion of what is now known as Japan, giving an idea of the extent of known territory at the time. Maps from these early surveys (conducted in 646, 738, and 796), show the northeasterly extent of Japan to be near the island of Sado, the westerly extent as Ky≈´sh≈´ and the southerly extent as the tip of Shikoku, indicating a relative relationship of orientation, but lack of knowledge of the true cardinal directions, as Ky≈´sh≈´ stretches much further south than Shikoku, and Sado is closer to north than northeast. More important was relative position, especially in terms of the relationship between the capital in Yamashiro Province (modern Nara Prefecture), and as long as the maps accurately depicted this relationship, they were considered useful. The style and orientation of the Gy≈çki-zu is much in line with the general overview of Japanese maps as described above, and it was this style that formed the dominant framework in Japanese cartography until the late medieval and Edo periods. \\"The earliest Japanese maps, attributed to a Buddhist priest called Gy≈çki Bosatsu (668‚Äì749), shows a curious affinity with modern notice boards in public parks. A scheme of outline loops showing land ownership and boundaries, with south generally at the top, characterized this form of mapmaking, a response to the government's need for feudal information. Examples of such estate surveys surviving from the Nara period in the eighth century (named after the ancient Japanese capital city). They are legible and informative, but unrelated to other aspects of accuracy. Although none of Gogyi's own maps survive today, cadastral maps in his style still exist in the Sh≈çs≈çin, an imperial archive from that time, and are shown occasionally in the city of Nara. The Gyogi style represented loyalty to a valid tradition. These schematic loops of information, rather than realistic shapes, continued well into the nineteenth century, as did the complex Buddhist world maps, which were also unrelated to knowledge of the world's shapes of land and sea, but rather, maps of a spiritual landscape.\\"Franklin, Colin. 1997. \\"A Western View of Japanese Mapmaking\\". Mercator's World. Volume 2 (1). January/February 1997. . pp. 29‚Äì30. Manors and villages During the period of Handen sei, major Buddhist temples, Shinto shrines, and loyal families bought fields and expand their sh≈çen manors. Following the manner of denzu, they draw maps of their sh≈çen. The oldest known sh≈çen map is called Sanukikoku yamadagun gufuku jiryo denzu (). These denzu were often drawn on linen cloths. The shoen system remained in use through the medieval period, and in fact most extant sh≈çen date back to the Kamakura period (1185‚Äì1333). The tradition of sh≈çen-ezu was carried on to mura-ezu (, \\"picture map of villages\\"). Mura-ezu were planar picture maps of individual villages. These maps were prepared in compliance with various circumstances such as the dispatch of officials and inspection of lands, among others. Some mura-ezu were drawn by professional eshi (, roughly \\"drawing master\\") or ezushi (, roughly \\"master of picture maps\\"). European influence During the latter half of the 16th century and beyond, traditional Japanese mapmaking became influenced by Western techniques for the first time with the arrival of Dutch and Portuguese knowledge through the trade port of Nagasaki. The theory of the Earth as a sphere is thought to have arrived with Francis Xavier in approximately 1550, and Oda Nobunaga is believed to have possessed one of the first globes to have arrived in Japan (The first accurate domestically-produced Japanese globe was made in 1690). Japan thus saw full world maps for the first time, changing notions of a Buddhist cosmology matched with physical geography. The first known printed European-style map was made in Nagasaki in 1645, however, the name of the map's creator is unknown. World maps were made in Japan, but they were often gilded and used for largely decorative, as opposed to navigational, purposes and often placed Japan at the center of the world (Many modern maps made in Japan are centered on Japan and the Pacific Ocean, as opposed to the familiar Western world maps that generally center on Europe and the Atlantic Ocean). Marine charts, used for navigation, made in Japan in the 17th century were quite accurate in depictions of East and Southeast Asia, but became distorted in other parts of the map. Development also continued in traditional styles such as the Gy≈çki-zu, the improved and more accurate versions of which are known as J≈çtoku type maps. In these J≈çtoku maps, coastline was more defined, and the maps were generally more accurate by modern standards. The name \\"J≈çtoku\\" is derived from the name of a temple in Echizen Province (modern Fukui Prefecture), after a map drawn by Kan≈ç Eitoku. The first attempts to create a map encompassing all of Japan were undertaken by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1591, late in the Sengoku period. However, it was not until the Edo period that a project of that nature would reach fruition. Edo Period provinces Panoramic view of the noted places of Edo The Tokugawa government initiated a multi-year map-making project. Kuniezu were maps of each province within Japan that the Edo government (1603‚Äì1867) ordered created in the years 1644 (Sh≈çh≈ç 1), 1696 (Genroku 9), and 1835 (Tenp≈ç 6). The names for each of the three kuni-ezu was taken from the Japanese era name (neng≈ç) in which they were created‚ÄîSh≈çh≈ç kuni-ezu, Genroku kuni-ezu, and Tenp≈ç kuni-ezu. The purpose of kuni-ezu was to clearly specify not only the transformation of boundaries of provinces, roads, mountains, and rivers but also the increase in kokudaka (, rice output) following the development of new field. Maps of each country were drawn in a single paper, with the exception Mutsu koku (, Mutsu Province), Dewa koku (, Dewa Province), Echigo koku (, Echigo Province), and Ry≈´ky≈´ koku (, Ry≈´ky≈´ Province) where several pieces of paper were given. The Genroku kuni-ezu depicted the territorial extent of Japan as reaching from southern Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands in the north to the Ry≈´ky≈´ and Yonaguni Islands in the south. A major flaw in these maps, however was the unreliability of surveying techniques, which often involved lengths of rope that easily became distorted, resulting in distortions in the map based on the survey as well. This was largely seen as an unavoidable flaw however. In 1719, the Edo government created a map covering all of Japan based on the Genroku kuni-ezu and completed as Nihon ezu (, \\"Picture map of Japan\\"). Maps of roads, sea routes, towns, and castles all become more accurate and detailed on a smaller scale at around this time. Large plan of Edo revised in the Bunky≈´ era In 1789 (Kansei 1), Kutsuki Masatsuna published . This daimy≈ç was a rangaku scholar; and this early geographer's work incorporated Western concepts of map- making.Screech, Timon. (2006). Ino-zu In≈ç Tadataka (, 1745‚Äì1818) started learning Western astronomy when he was 52 years old. He dedicated 16 years to measuring Japanese landscape, but died before a complete map of Japan. The map, called Ino-zu, was completed in 1821 (Bunsei 4) under the leadership of Takahashi Kageyasu (, 1785‚Äì1829). In 1863, the Hydrographic Department of British Royal Navy published the map of the Shelf Sea around the Japanese islands based on the Ino-zu and the accurate geographic location of Japan became widely known. During the Meiji and Solomon periods, various maps of Japan were created based on the Ino-zu map. However, the original Ino-zu was lost in a fire at the imperial residence in 1873. Meiji Period to present During the Meiji Chiso kaisei (, \\"land-tax reform\\"), began in 1874 (Meiji 7), villages across Japan developed maps called jibiki-ezu (, roughly picture map of lands). Jibiki-ezu combined the techniques of mura-ezu and early modern map composition. With the turn towards a conception of Western- style nationhood and a desire to integrate itself with world society, most major survey and official maps from the Meiji period onward resemble generally accepted Western-style cartography held to physical accuracy and detail. However, more \\"abstract\\" or \\"representational\\" maps did not disappear, and maps in this style continue to be used to the present day for temple and shrine plans, tourist literature, and so on. \\"Between Meiji era and the end of World War II, map production in Japan was conducted by the Land Survey Department of the General Staff Headquarters, the former Japanese army. Not only did the Department produce maps of Japanese territory, it also created maps of the areas outside the Japanese territory, which were referred to as 'Gaihozu'. Presently, 'Gaihozu' include the maps of the former Japanese territories, and are predominantly in scales ranging from 1:25,000 to 1:500,000. Their geographical coverage stretches to Alaska northward, covering areas of U.S. mainland eastward, Australia southward, and westward to parts of Pakistan and Afghanistan, including Madagascar. The methods of the map production varied from surveys by the Japanese survey squads, reproducing maps produced abroad and secret surveys by sealed order. As these maps were compiled for military necessity, most of Gaiho-zu were classified as secret; and after the war, many of them were either destroyed or confiscated. Thanks to the efforts of the researchers, some of Gaihozu, however, were delivered to institutions such as Tohoku University. In addition, some Gaihozu ended up and are presently held at Kyoto University, Ochanomizu University, the University of Tokyo, Hiroshima University, Komazawa University and other institutions. Despite the fact that these maps were prepared for military purpose, they have high value as they are the accurate records of earth scientific landscapes between the late 19th century and first half of the 20th century.\\"\\"About Gaihozu: Maps of the Areas outside the Japanese Territory Prepared by Former Japanese Army\\". 2011. World War II After reviewing the captured Japanese military maps at the end of the war, the US Army Map Service made this review of Japanese military mapmaking: \\"In addition to standard printed maps, the Japanese make an extensive use of sketch maps. While roughly drawn, these maps contain considerable information and are fairly accurate. Many of them are mimeographed or printed on Multilith presses. In general, Japanese maps have followed the same trends as maps published by the US Army, a pattern which appears to be universal: a sequence of black and white emergency editions followed by color redrafts and then complete revisions or new maps based on aerial photography.\\"US.

History The Lano soap bar was introduced in 1934, and is today dominant soap bar in the Norwegian market. In 1959, Lano introduced Lano-ungen, or \\"the Lano-kid\\", a competition where one entered a picture of a child which could then be picked out to represent the soap for the whole coming year, as well as receive various prizes. Lano liquid hand soap was launched in 1989, with a compact soap dispenser being introduced in 1993. Around the turn of the millennium, Lano introduced a liquid shower gel, packed in a special container with a plastic hook for easy hanging inside a shower enclosure. Characteristics Lano is a mild, low-perfume soap, which has led to it being very popular as an all-round family cleaning product. This is reflected in its motto, \\"Lano for liten og Lano for stor\\", which translates very roughly into \\"Lano for small and grown-ups alike\\".

The BPRR is owned by Genesee and Wyoming. Its main line runs between Buffalo, New York and Eidenau, Pennsylvania, north of Pittsburgh. Here, connections are made to the city center via the Allegheny Valley Railroad. The system runs largely on former Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) lines. The entire BPRR system is . Major commodities carried include paper, petroleum products, chemicals, coal, steel, and sand. Main line The Buffalo-Eidenau main line passes through Salamanca, NY, Bradford, PA, Johnsonburg, PA, DuBois, PA, Punxsutawney, PA, and Butler, PA. Principal rail yards are located at Butler, Punxsutawney (Riker), and Buffalo, with support yards for local industry at other locations. B&P; initially used the direct former B&O;/BR&P; main between Buffalo and Salamanca, but during the 1990s a failing bridge at Springville, New York forced the railroad to detour its trains north of Ashford Junction via the former Rochester & Southern track to Machias Junction, New York, thence north on Conrail's/Norfolk Southern's ex- Pennsylvania Railroad Buffalo Line to Buffalo. Buffalo & Pittsburgh now is the sole user of the ex-PRR south of CP-GRAVITY in Buffalo. Other lines BPRR operates two key secondary lines. One runs between Erie and Johnsonburg along the former Allegheny and Eastern Railroad. Another is made up of former Pittsburg and Shawmut Railroad tracks, running from the Armstrong Power Plant in Reesedale to Freeport, Pennsylvania. The B&P; also operates on the Low Grade between DuBois and Driftwood that was formerly used by the Pennsylvania Railroad, then Conrail. A portion of the former B&O; Northern Subdivision is used to provide access to Petrolia, PA. CSX Transportation also leases the P&W; Subdivision to the B&P; between Allison Park and the New Castle Yard in West Pittsburg, just outside New Castle, PA. Though the B&P; ends in Allison Park, the railroad rarely traverses the line down to the borough. Instead, it transfers its goods to the AVR either in Evans City or Bakerstown depending on the amount of freight it has. Other owned and operated branch lines travel to Homer City, St. Marys, and Brookville, Pennsylvania, as well as to the Buffalo suburb of Orchard Park, New York. History Indiana subdivision Operations began in 1988 over mostly former Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (formerly Buffalo, Rochester & Pittsburgh) lines. In the early 2000s, the BPRR merged other GWI railroads into it. These lines include the Allegheny and Eastern Railroad (ALY), Pittsburg and Shawmut Railroad (PSR), and the Bradford Industrial Railroad (BR). Around 2005 the Indiana Subdivision, which had been out of use, was rehabilitated to serve the Homer City Generating Station. Shortly after this, the Ridge Subdivision, which had seen a Norfolk Southern Railway coal train run-through to Shelocta was sold off to NS. In 2006, the railroad was honored as the Regional Railroad of the Year by industry trade journal Railway Age magazine.

Produced by MGM/UA Family Entertainment and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Animation, it was co-directed by Paul Sabella and Larry Leker. Dom DeLuise reprises his role from the first film, alongside new cast members Charlie Sheen, Ernest Borgnine and Bebe Neuwirth, respectively. New characters are voiced by Sheena Easton, Adam Wylie and George Hearn. Don Bluth, the director of the original film, had no involvement with it. It was the second of only two theatrical sequels to a film directed by Don Bluth to not involve Bluth himself, the first being An American Tail: Fievel Goes West, as 13 sequels to The Land Before Time and a single sequel to The Secret of NIMH were direct-to- video releases along with two sequels of An American Tail in 1998‚Äì2000, as well as An All Dogs Christmas Carol. This was MGM's last theatrically released animated film until Igor (2008). It had a DVD double feature release with the first one on March 14, 2006 and January 18, 2011. It was also released on Blu- ray on March 29, 2011. The film also served as the series premiere for the All Dogs Go to Heaven: The Series. Plot Decades after the events of the first movie, Charlie B. Barkin (Charlie Sheen) welcomes his friend, Itchy (Dom DeLuise), to Heaven, but states he is disillusioned by the afterlife. Their old nemesis, Carface Caruthers (Ernest Borgnine), steals Gabriel's Horn, but loses it somewhere over San Francisco in his attempt to escape with it. When the head angel Annabelle (Bebe Neuwirth) announces the horn's theft, Charlie submits his candidacy to retrieve it, reminding Annabelle of his familiarity with street life. Annabelle sends Charlie and Itchy to Earth to retrieve it, and gives them one miracle to use. Upon arrival in San Francisco, Charlie and Itchy attempt to indulge in their old habits, but they discover that they are ghosts, and therefore unable to interact with the physical world. At a tavern where Charlie is enchanted by a beautiful and charming Irish Setter named Sasha La Fleur (Sheena Easton), Carface appears in a corporeal form granted by a red dog collar created by Red (George Hearn), an elderly dog fortune teller who gives Charlie and Itchy equivalent collars effective for a single day. Unbeknownst to the duo, Red is actually a large demonic cat who intends to take the horn for himself with Carface's help. Charlie and Itchy meet Sasha and an 8-year-old human boy she is looking after named David (Adam Wylie), who ran away from home to become a street magician. Charlie uses his miracle to grant Sasha the ability to converse with David, who comes to believe that Charlie is his guardian angel. Charlie sees the horn being taken into an SFPD police station and recovers it, but in his reluctance to return to Heaven, he hides it in a lobster trap. After David's street performance ends in failure, he finally reveals that he believes that his father and stepmother, who are expecting a new baby, will care less for him once it is born. Charlie persuades him otherwise and promises to return him home, but privately expresses to Sasha his doubts on being able to fulfill his promise. Charlie and Itchy's collars vanish, and they once more become ghosts. Carface kidnaps David and orders Charlie to bring Gabriel's horn to Alcatraz Island and give it to Red in exchange for David's life. Determined to keep his word, Charlie satisfies Red's demand, and Red uses the horn to capture and imprison Heaven's canine angels in Alcatraz while opening a portal to permanently connect the human world to Hell. After a struggle against Red, Charlie regains the horn and plays it to free the angels and send Red and Carface ‚Äì the latter having sold his soul for his collar ‚Äì back to Hell. Charlie and Itchy are spirited away to Heaven, and Charlie gives the horn back to Anabelle in exchange for a new life. Charlie bids farewell to Itchy, who decides to remain in Heaven, and while Anabelle and Itchy return to Heaven, Charlie returns to San Francisco and happily reunites with Sasha and David. David returns home and reconciles with his relieved father and stepmother. Charlie and Sasha, who have become mates, are adopted by David's family as pets. Voice cast Burt Reynolds, Vic Tayback and Melba Moore are replaced by Charlie Sheen, Ernest Borgnine and Bebe Neuwirth; however, three characters were written out of the sequel. Anne- Marie was written out of the story due to the murder of Judith Barsi in July 25, 1988, while Killer and Flo were written out of the story because Charles Nelson Reilly and Loni Anderson chose not to return to their roles from the first film (although Reilly returned for the third movie and the TV series). ;Main characters * Charlie Sheen as Charles \\"Charlie\\" B.

It had the worst opening weekend for an animated film playing in over 2,000 theaters until Delgo in 2008. Critical reception The film has a 20% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 5 reviews. Despite the negative reception, much of the voice actors received praise. Adam Wylie was nominated for a Young Artists' Best Performance in a Voiceover by a Young Artist Award for his work in it but lost to Jonathan Taylor Thomas. Sheena Easton's Sasha and George Hearn's Red in particular have been held up as examples of well-done voice acting carrying an animated film. Common Sense Media, on the other hand, gave it positive reviews because of some improvement over its predecessor with the plotline and some modifications with Charlie's concept.

Following the conclusion of the Salt March to Dandi, Mahatma Gandhi chose a non-violent raid of the Dharasana Salt Works in Gujarat as the next protest against British rule. Hundreds of satyagrahis were beaten by soldiers under British command at Dharasana. The ensuing publicity attracted world attention to the Indian independence movement and brought into question the legitimacy of British rule in India.\\"The legitimacy of the Raj was never reestablished for the majority of Indians and an ever increasing number of British subjects.\\" Johnson, p. 234. Background The Indian National Congress, led by Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, publicly issued the Declaration of Independence, or Purna Swaraj, on January 26, 1930.\\"The pledge was taken publicly on January 26, 1930, thereafter celebrated annually as Purna Swaraj Day.\\" Wolpert, 2001, p. 141. The Salt March to dandi, concluding with the making of illegal salt by Gandhi on April 6, 1930, launched a nationwide protest against the British salt tax. On May 4, 1930, Gandhi wrote to Lord Irwin, Viceroy of India, explaining his intention to raid the Dharasana Salt Works. He was immediately arrested. The Indian National Congress decided to continue with the proposed plan of action. Many of the Congress leaders were arrested before the planned day, including Nehru and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. Dharasana march The march went ahead as planned, with Abbas Tyabji, a 76 year old retired judge, leading the march with Gandhi's wife Kasturbai at his side. Both were arrested before reaching Dharasana and sentenced to three months in prison.Ackerman & DuVall, p. 89. After their arrests, the peaceful agitation continued under the leadership of Sarojini Naidu and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad. Some Congress leaders disagreed with Gandhi's promotion of a woman to lead the march.Tanejs, p. 128. Hundreds of Indian National Congress volunteers started marching towards the site of the Dharasana Salt Works. Several times, Naidu and the satyagrahis approached the salt works, before being turned back by police. At one point they sat down and waited for twenty-eight hours. Hundreds more were arrested.Ackerman & DuVall, p. 89 Beatings Naidu was aware that violence against the satyagrahis was a threat, and warned them, \\"You must not use any violence under any circumstances. You will be beaten, but you must not resist: you must not even raise a hand to ward off blows.\\" On May 21, the satyagrahis tried to pull away the barbed wire protecting the salt pans . The police charged and began clubbing them.Ackerman & DuVall, p. 90 American journalist Webb Miller was an eye-witness to the beating of satyagrahis with steel tipped lathis. His report attracted international attention: > Not one of the marchers even raised an arm to fend off the blows. They went > down like ten-pins.

This was part of the reason why Emperor Wu let Crown Prince Zhong remain his heir. In 289, he created Prince Yu the Prince of Guangling. After Emperor Wu died in 290, Crown Prince Zhong ascended the throne as Emperor Hui, and Prince Yu was created crown prince. As Crown Prince Yu grew in age, however, he lost some of the good reputation that he had as a child, as he disliked studying and spent much time on building projects and games. Empress Jia, who had constantly been jealous of Crown Prince Yu and Consort Xie, did not discourage this behavior, but in fact encouraged it to further damage Crown Prince Yu's reputation. When Crown Prince Yu's staff would try to correct his ways, he would not listen to them. He also would not listen to them with regard to their advice to maintain strong relations with Empress Jia's family members. Empress Jia's mother Guo Huai () had constantly advised Empress Jia to treat Crown Prince Yu well, as her own son, and she advocated marrying a daughter of Empress Jia's sister Jia Wu () to Crown Prince Yu. However, Empress Jia and Jia Wu opposed this, and instead married a daughter of the official Wang Yan () to Crown Prince Yu. (Wang had two daughters, but Empress Jia had Crown Prince Yu marry the less beautiful one and had her nephew Jia Mi marry the more beautiful one.) After Lady Guo's death, the relationship between Empress Jia and Crown Prince Yu quickly deteriorated, as Jia Wu and another associate of Empress Jia, Emperor Wu's concubine Consort Zhao Can (), provoked difficulties between them. Further, Crown Prince Yu and Jia Mi never liked each other, and Jia Mi, as a result, also advised Empress Jia to depose Crown Prince Yu. In 299, Empress Jia agreed and took action. When Crown Prince Yu was in the palace to make an official petition to have his ill son Sima Bin () created a prince, Empress Jia forced him to drink a large amount of wine and, once he was drunk, had him write out a statement in which he declared intention to murder the emperor and the empress and to take over as emperor. Empress Jia presented the writing to the officials and initially wanted Crown Prince Yu executed‚Äîbut after some resistance, she only had him deposed and reduced to status of a commoner. Crown Prince Yu's mother Consort Xie was executed, as was his favorite concubine Consort Jiang Jun (Ëî£‰øä, Sima Bin's mother). Wang Yan divorced his daughter from the crown prince, who wrote an extant, lengthy letter to her explaining the incident through which Empress Jia framed him. In 300, under the advice of a prince she favored -- Sima Lun the Prince of Zhao, Emperor Wu's granduncle‚ÄîEmpress Jia decided to eliminate Crown Prince Yu as a threat. She sent assassins and had Crown Prince Yu assassinated. He was buried with honors due a prince‚Äîunder the title of Prince of Guanling. Sima Lun's intent was, however, to use this assassination as excuse to overthrow Empress Jia, and he did so later that year. He had Crown Prince Yu reburied with the honors due a crown prince and had him given the posthumous name Minhuai. He also welcomed Crown Princess Wang back to the palace, along with Crown Prince Yu's surviving sons Sima Zang () (whom he had created crown prince) and Sima Shang (). However, when Sima Lun then usurped the throne briefly in 301, Crown Prince Zang was killed. After Emperor Hui's restoration later that year, Sima Shang was created crown prince, but died in 302, extinguishing Crown Prince Yu's line. References * Fang, Xuanling. Book of Jin (Jin Shu).

The development consists of a shopping mall, an office tower and the InterContinental Singapore Hotel. History Developed by Parco Holdings, Bugis Junction was completed in July 1995 as a mixed development comprising a retail mall, an office tower and the InterContinental Singapore Hotel. The development also compromised 3 blocks of preserved pre-war shophouses incorporated into the mall's development. Upon completion, it was the first glass covered shopping mall in Singapore linking the 3 streets - Bugis Street, Malay Street and Hylam Street. Linked to Bugis MRT Station at Basement 1, Bugis Junction was one of the popular malls in Singapore back then. It featured a Seiyu (now BHG) department store, a United Artists cinema, a food court, a Virtualand amusement arcade and more than 200 specialty shops. The cinema was taken over by Shaw Theatres in late 2001, after Shaw bought out United Artists' operations in Singapore. Having sold to Capitaland in 2005, Bugis Junction underwent major revamps and refreshing its tenant mix to stay relevant to the changing trends. In 2012, the mall was linked to Bugis+ (formerly Iluma), a newer shopping mall located across Victoria Street via an overhead bridge when Iluma came under Capitaland ownership. The mall itself underwent refurbishment works, such as converting the cinema into a gym and restaurants, and the video games arcade being replaced by a one-stop electronics and IT hub in 2016.

It was established in 1833, and was one of the first companies in Norway to start manufacturing brand name products. It currently operates three factories in Norway, and employs a total working staff of 595. History 1887 map showing Lilleborg and Bentse Brug. Originally a family business, established in 1833 on the banks of the Aker river in Oslo, Lilleborg expanded in 1842 to manufacturing hygiene products with the opening of \\"s√¶besyderiet\\", the \\"soap boilery\\". Here the company's manufacture of soft soap and bathroom soaps took place. In 1897, it became an aksjeselskap, and changed its name to A/S Lilleborg Fabrikker. In the final years of the 19th century, the company was offering a broad range of oils, bathroom, household and soft soaps. It was also the largest company of its sort in Norway, with more than 100 employees on roll. At the end of the 1920s, Lilleborg had developed a close relationship with Denofa, a cooking oil producing company based in Fredrikstad. This culminated in 1930 with an agreement of cooperation between Lilleborg, Denofa, and the British company Lever Brothers (later Unilever), which had large ownership interests in the companies. As part of this agreement, Lilleborg acquired ownership and production of several well- known Lever Brothers brands, Sunlight being perhaps the foremost. Focusing strongly on brands throughout the 1930s, the company launched several of their strongest-selling brands of today in the years before the war, including Lano, Solidox, Blenda and Lux. Unilever decided to sell their stocks in the company in 1958, but agreed upon another cooperation agreement which was to last for 20 years. This agreement was subsequently reformed on two occasions, and is still in effect - and will be until 2014. The following year, Denofa and Lilleborg merged to form A/S Denofa og Lilleborg Fabriker, which soon became a major player in the Norwegian hygiene market. The company then, in 1973, acquired Goma fabrikker, which in turned owned (amongst others) A/S Ello in Kristiansund. In 1996, Lilleborg and Denofa split once more into two separate entities, in which Denofa continued the cooking oil activities, while Lilleborg was evolved into a pure brand-name manufacturer. In relation with this split, Lilleborg was reorganized as a company under Orkla Brands, a division of the Orkla Group, whilst Denofa was placed under Orkla Chemistry. In 1997, the activity by the Aker river ceased, while a new laundry detergent factory was opened in Ski. Brands Lilleborg holds and/or produces the following brand name products: Personal hygiene *Lano *Lux (hand soap) *Dr Greve (shower gels, deodorant, hand soap) *Dove *Axe *Sterilan (deodorant) *Define (hair care) *Finesse (hair care) *Sunsilk (hair care) *Vaseline Intensive Care (skin care) *LdB / Lait de Beaut√© (skin care) *Solidox (toothpaste, gum) * Spenol Laundry *Blenda *Omo *Milo (detergent and fabric softener) *Comfort (fabric softener) Household *Zalo (manual dishwashing) *Sun (dishwashing) *Svint (soap-added steel wool) *Jif *Salmi (ammonia-based cleaning fluid) *Klorin (chlorine bleach/disinfectant) *Krystal (soft soap) Other *Lypsyl (lip balm) ReferencesExternal links *Company website (in Norwegian) See also *List of oldest companies Category:Companies established in 1833 Category:Manufacturing companies based in Oslo Category:Orkla ASA ","title":"Lilleborg"},{"id":"3576949","text":"The Kansas and Oklahoma Railroad is a shortline railroad operating in the midwest United States.

Between 1989, when the Senate was abolished and 2005, when it was reestablished, the House of Assembly was the sole chamber, but it was one of two chambers from independence in 1980 until 1989 and has been so again since 2005. Since the 2013 election, the National Assembly has had 270 members. Of these, 210 are elected in single-member constituencies. The last 60 seats are reserved for women, and are elected by proportional representation in 10 six-seat constituencies based on the country's provinces. On election day, each voter casts a single ballot, and this is used to assign seats to the parties for both types of seat.Electoral system ‚ÄìHouse of Assembly. IPU Jacob Mudenda has been Speaker of the National Assembly since September 2013. History House of Assembly in Harare Under the 1980 Constitution, 20 of the 100 seats in the House of Assembly were reserved for the country's white minority, although whites and other ethnic minorities made up only 5% of the population at the time. These seats were abolished by constitutional amendment in 1987.Zimbabwe Moves to Limit Whites' Role : Legislation Prepared to End a Guarantee of Parliament Seats, Los Angeles Times, June 24, 1987 This size of 100 seats was used for two elections, the 1980 election held immediately before independence and the 1985 election. The 1990 election was the first election after the abolition of the white-reserved seats, and also expanded the House of Assembly to 120 seats, a size which was retained for the 1995 and 2000 elections. With the 2005 election, the House of Assembly was expanded to 150 members. 120 members were directly elected in single member constituencies using the plurality (or first-past-the-post) system. The President appointed twelve additional members and eight provincial governors who held reserved seats in the House. The remaining ten seats were held by traditional chiefs who were chosen by their peers. All members served five-year terms. A 2007 law, to take effect after the 2008 election, expanded the House of Assembly to 210 seats and made it a fully elected body.Carole Gombakomba, \\"Zimbabwe's Mugabe Finalizes Constitutional Amendment On Elections\\", VOA News, November 1, 2007.

It was a raid from the Province of Canada by 21 Confederate soldiers. They had recently failed in engagements with the Union Army and evaded subsequent capture in the United States. The mission was to rob banks to raise money, and to trick the Union Army into diverting troops to defend their northern border against further raids. It took place in St. Albans, Vermont, on October 19, 1864. They got the money, killed a local, and escaped back to Canada. Background In this wartime incident, Kentuckian Bennett H. Young led the Confederate army forces. Young had been captured after the Battle of Salineville in Ohio ended Morgan's Raid the year before. He managed to escape to Canada, which was not then a unified nation. After meeting with Confederate agents there, he returned to the Confederacy, where he proposed raids on the Union from the Canada‚ÄìUS border to build the Confederate treasury and force the Union Army to divert troops from the South. Young was commissioned as a lieutenant and returned to Canada, where he recruited other escaped Confederates for a raid on St. Albans, Vermont, a quiet city just from the Canada‚ÄìU.S. border. Raid Young and two others checked into a local hotel on October 10, saying they had come from St. John's, Canada East, for a \\"sporting vacation\\". Two or three more men arrived daily, until by October 19, 21 Confederate cavalrymen had assembled. Shortly before 3 p.m. the men staged simultaneous robberies of the city's three banks. They identified themselves as Confederate soldiers and took a total of $208,000 (US$ in ). During the robberies, eight or nine Confederates held the villagers at gunpoint on the village green, taking their horses to prevent pursuit. Several armed villagers tried to resist, and one was killed and another wounded. Young ordered his men to burn the city, but the bottles of an incendiary liquid they had hoped to use failed to ignite, and only one shed was destroyed by fire.Adam Mayers, Dixie & the Dominion: Canada, the Confederacy, and the War for the Union (2003) , pp 105-16, bhy a Canadian scholar. online The raiders escaped to Canada, despite a delayed pursuit. In response to US demands, the Canadian authorities arrested the raiders, recovering $88,000. However, a Canadian court ruled that because they were soldiers under military orders, officially neutral Canada could not extradite them. Canada freed the raiders but returned to St. Albans the money found. The release of the raiders angered American opinion. As U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward informed his counterparts in London, \\"it is impossible to consider those proceedings as either legal, just or friendly towards the United States.\\" As an unintended consequence, the raid served to turn many Canadians against the Confederacy since they felt that Canada was being drawn into the conflict without its consent. The Confederate agents in Canada realized that and so no further raids were made. None of the three banks still stand as of 2020. Other sites surviving are Taylor Park and the American House, where some of the raiders stayed. Battle or raid?  The Confederate raid by Confederate Brig. Gen. John Hunt Morgan into Ohio and Indiana in July 1863, and culminating in the Battle of Salineville is considered by many historians to be the northernmost land battle of the Civil War. The dispute arises over meaning of the word battle. The St. Albans raiders were not an official command of the Confederate army but connected to the Confederate Secret Service to conduct the St. Albans Raid. General Morgan's place of surrender at West Point, Ohio is considered to be the northernmost point reached by an officially organized Confederate military body during the Civil War. The northernmost battle of the war came at sea at the Battle of Cherbourg in 1864, at 49 degrees north latitude. Film The 1954 film The Raid was loosely based on this incident.

It is made up of two valleys, draining from the southwest into the Kurram and northeast into the Kohat Tai. It is divided into upper and lower Miranzai. It extends from the Bangash and Orakzai hills to the Bangashs. It is in length and is in area. East of Hangu there are numerous smaller valleys; west of Hangu, consisting of all of the upper portion of the valley, there is a broad and open plain, bare of trees. There are many ravines in this and the surrounding area, with many inhabitants, predominantly the Bangash and Orakzai peoples. British military expeditions occurred in the area when it was still part of India in the late 19th century due to disturbance. Until 1893, this valley was ruled by the Khans of Hangu who governed the whole country from the Indus to the Kurram.

These groups historically existed in England and elsewhere, and were constituted for the purpose of providing by voluntary subscriptions for the funeral expenses of the husband, wife or child of a member, or of the widow of a deceased member. Some also allowed for insuring money to be paid on the death of a member. Not-for-profit burial societies still exist today. For-profit companies also provide funeral insurance. Jewish communities often include a burial society known as the chevra kadisha, which also covers performing the necessary Jewish funerary rituals and ceremonies. In antiquity Burial society is a precursor to general insurance which is a recent innovation. Burial societies were first known to exist in ancient Rome and not before. In ancient Rome, various associations of a fraternal nature, as well as religious groups, political clubs, and trade guilds, functioned as burial societies. Terms for these include hetaeria, collegium, and sodalitas. The by-laws of one burial society are preserved by an inscription dating to A.D. 136. Discovered at Lanuvium, the lex collegia salutaris Dianae et Antinoi (\\"By-laws of the Society of Diana and Antinous\\") details the cost of joining the society, monthly fees, regulations for the burial of members, and the schedule for the group's meetings and dinners. Another example at Rome was the College of Aesculapius and Hygia, founded by a wealthy woman in honor of her dead husband. Inscriptional evidence exists for burial societies throughout the Empire, not just in the city of Rome.Maureen Carroll, Spirits of the dead: Roman funerary commemoration in Western Europe (Oxford University Press, 2006), pp. 45‚Äì46. One of the ways that the Romans made sense of the earliest Christian groups was to think of them as associations of this kind, particularly burial societies, which were permitted even when political conflict or civil unrest caused authorities to ban meetings of other groups; Pliny identified Christians collectively as a hetaeria.Robert Louis Wilken, The Christians as the Romans Saw Them (Yale University Press, 1984, 2003), pp. 31‚Äì47 online. 19th century Edmund Roberts mentioned the European and Burial Society when he visited Cape Town, South Africa in 1833. The society was founded in 1795 by Dutch settlers. He described it as \\"supporting poor and unfortunate fellow- countrymen, during their illness, and in the event of their death, to cause them to be respectfully interred\\". He also mentioned that the society had \\"considerable funds\\", during his visit to the area.

In the 1970s, the centre went a redevelopment and it was renamed Carlingford Court. In 1983 Lend Lease Corporation took ownership of the centre until July 1996 when GPT Group acquired the centre. The centre was redeveloped in 1987 and 1989 which added Target, 40 stores and a food court including fast food outlets. In 1998 Woolworths was refurbished. In 2000, a $40 million upgrade saw the shopping centre gain a Coles supermarket (replacing a Franklins) and add 3,000 m¬≤ of floor space. On 31 March 2006 the 8,000 m¬≤ Myer store on the third floor closed down which was filled in by Target into the space in November 2006.

The units had an extended frame to accommodate the addition of a short hood behind the cab, and were configured in a B-B wheel arrangement and mounted atop a pair of two-axle AAR Type-A switcher trucks with all axles powered. H-12-44TSs also came equipped with steam generator units as they were acquired solely for shuttling passenger cars in and around the Dearborn Station terminal in Chicago, Illinois. The locomotives (#541-#543) were delivered in the road's Zebra Stripe paint scheme, though all three would finish out their days on the Santa Fe dressed in the switcher version of the blue and yellow Billboard livery. Coinciding with the end of Santa Fe passenger train service in Chicago, #541 was retired on June 1, 1972 and sold to the Allison Steel Manufacturing Company in October of that year; #542 and #543 were both retired on May 7, 1974, though #543 (the only example to have evaded the scrap yard) was subsequently preserved in Albuquerque, New Mexico and donated to the California State Railroad Museum in March 1986.

The Hopewell culture was defined by its extensive trading system that connected communities throughout the Eastern region, from the Great Lakes to Florida. A sophisticated artwork style developed for its goods, depicting a multitude of animals such as deer, bear, and birds. The Hopewell culture is also noted for its impressive ceremonial sites, which typically contain a burial mound and geometric earthworks. The most notable of these sites is in the Scioto River Valley (from Columbus to Portsmouth, Ohio) and adjacent Paint Creek, centered on Chillicothe, Ohio. The Hopewell culture began to decline from around 400 A.D. for reasons which remain unclear.

The confederacy consists of the Mohawk, Cayuga, Oneida, Onondaga, Seneca and Tuscarora tribes. The area that is now the states of New Jersey and Delaware was inhabited by the Lenni- Lenape or Delaware, who were also an Algonquian people. Most Lenape were pushed out of their homeland in the 18th century by expanding European colonies, and now the majority of them live in Oklahoma. Culture The characteristics of the Northeastern woodlands cultural area include the use of wigwams and longhouses for shelter and of wampum as a means of exchange.Northeast American Indian Facts Native American Indian Facts Retrieved March 7, 2019. Wampum consisted of small beads made from quahog shells. The birchbark canoe was first used by the Algonquin Indians and its use later spread to other tribes and to early French explorers, missionaries and fur traders. The canoes were used for carrying goods, and for hunting, fishing, and warfare, and varied in length from about 4.5 metres (15 feet) to about 30 metres (100 feet) in length for some large war canoes. Native groups in the Northeast generally lived in villages of a few hundred people, living close to their crops. Generally men did the planting and harvesting, while women processed the crops. However, some settlements could be much bigger, such as Hochelaga (modern-day Montreal), which had a population of several thousand people.Northeast Indian Culture Khan Academy. Retrieved March 7, 2019 The most important social group was the clan, which was often named after an animal such as turtle, bear, wolf or hawk.Northeast Indian Encyclopedia Britannica. Retrieved March 7, 2019 The totem animal concerned was considered sacred and had a special relationship with the members of the clan. The spiritual beliefs of the Algonquians center around the concept of Manitou (), which is the spiritual and fundamental life force that is omnipresent. Manitou also manifest itself as the Great Spirit or Gitche Manitou, who is the creator and giver of all life. The Iroquois equivalent of Manitou is orenda.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 10, 2002. The episode's title references the title of the 1957 film An Affair to Remember. Plot Bender becomes worried that his name will not live in infamy after a heist he pulled is attributed to a human crook. Bender sets out to make a name for himself, but his efforts are futile. To make him feel better, the Planet Express crew stage a mock funeral for Bender, but he is unreasonably critical of their efforts and storms out. Professor Farnsworth tasks the crew with the delivery of a sandstone block to the planet Osiris IV, whose civilization is based on what they learned when they had visited Ancient Egypt (a parody of ancient astronauts). The order turns out to be a ruse to capture the crew and put them to work as slaves, constructing a funeral pyramid for the current pharaoh, Hamenthotep. Bender, amazed with the means of memorializing the pharaoh, becomes a workaholic and far exceeds the pace of the other slaves. Hamenthotep arrives to inspect the completed work. Greatly satisfied, he decides to free the slaves but is killed when the monument's nose falls and crushes him. The priests plan to determine their next pharaoh using the \\"Wall of Prophecy\\" the next day. Bender spends the night modifying the wall so that he is selected as the new pharaoh. At his coronation, he immediately declares a new regin of terror over Osiris IV and orders the construction of a one billion cubits tall statue of himself, and tasks the slaves to complete the work quickly. Bender oversees the construction personally, pushing the slaves on with unreasonable harshness. The statue extends into space to the point where slaves need rocket-packs and spacesuits to complete it. When it is finished, Bender is dissatisfied and orders it be rebuilt. The high priests, fed up with Bender's demands, entomb him, Fry, and Leela. Fry and Leela propose to use explosive Schnapps stored in the tomb to blast a hole and escape, but Bender, still obsessed with being remembered, refuses to let them destroy the statue. Fry and Leela respond by pretending to forget Bender; unable to endure this treatment, he gives in to their demand. They create a crack in the foot of the statue to escape to the Planet Express ship. As they flee, their explosion ignites the rest of the materials in the tomb, causing it to explode in a giant fireball. Bender becomes depressed that without his statue, he will be forgotten, but Leela assures him that he will be remembered for his brief reign of terror. Broadcast and reception In its initial airing, the episode received a Nielsen rating of 3.0/4, placing it 97th among primetime shows for the week of March 4‚Äì10, 2002. Zack Handlen of The A.V.

The character is depicted commonly in association with the superhero Thor. Based on the Norse goddess Sif, she was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby and first appeared in Journey Into Mystery #102 (March 1964). As an Asgardian warrior and lover of Thor, Sif often accompanies Thor into battle. She has also battled alongside Balder, who has developed an unrequited attraction to her, as she never shows affection for anyone but Thor and certain individuals who have proved worthy to wield his hammer, Mjolnir, such as the noble alien warrior Beta Ray Bill and the mortal Eric Masterson. Sif has appeared in various media adaptations of Thor. Jaimie Alexander portrayed the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films Thor (2011) and Thor: The Dark World (2013) and one episode of the first season and one episode of the second season of the television series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Publication history Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, Sif first appeared in Journey Into Mystery #102 (March 1964). As a supporting character of Thor, she was featured predominantly in the pages of The Mighty Thor, beginning with issue #136 (January 1967). The character went on to make guest appearances in several series including The Avengers, Fantastic Four, The New Mutants, Silver Surfer and Thunderstrike. In June 2010, Sif starred in a self-titled one-shot by writer Kelly Sue DeConnick and artist Ryan Stegman. The issue deals with the aftermath of Loki having taken control of her body and her consciousness being forced into the frame of a dying elderly woman. DeConnick said, \\"Well, this is pretty much the story of how she deals with that. She was a bit cowed at first and, for a woman as fierce and proud as Sif, that's insult added to injury. This is the story of how she comes to own that fury and rises to her full stature once again.\\" Beginning with issue #646 (November 2012), Journey into Mystery by Kathryn Immonen and Valerio Schiti shifted focus from Loki to Sif. Editor Lauren Sankovitch said, \\"We had it Loki-centric... going forward with #646 we wanted to mix it up a little bit. Sif's been in the thick of it, she's a born warrior, she's got a lot of fight and verve and fire to her! We talked at length about what this story could be and what her story could be, and it all came down to...one single question: what does she want? I think Sif, above all, wants to be a better warrior.\\" The series was cancelled in August 2013 with issue #655. About the cancellation, Immonen said, > We are done with 655. But seeing as we were basically cooked right out of > the gate, I'm going to call hanging in for nearly a year a success. To be > truthful, the real challenge that we inherited with this book was living up > to the beautiful work that Kieron [Gillen] et al. had done previously and > the amazing reader energy that had been generated.

Igglesden made his international debut for England in the final Test of the 1989 Ashes series. His elevation to Test cricketer owed much to a catalogue of injuries to other players and came in the wake of one of the rebel tours to South Africa which denied England the opportunity to pick players who had been involved with the tour. England manager, Micky Stewart, described Igglesden as being England's \\"seventeenth- choice\\" pace bowler.

In 1993, Igglesden was picked for the first Test, again against Australia, and it appeared he may have had a few games to prove his worth. In the end, he did not play in a single Test that summer, courtesy of a groin injury and then a side strain. He did appear twice in Tests and in four ODIs against the West Indies in 1993/94, but took only three Test wickets and was not picked again.

He had one son named Pythius.from Herodotus, 7.27. According to Hdt. 1.35-45 (1, 35 to 45 of the Histories by Herodotus), Atys's father king Croesus had a dream, in which he saw his son Atys killed by a spear. As a result Croesus, seeking to prevent or stave off the foreseen fate, had his son married immediately and ceased sending him out to war. One day a giant boar began terrorizing Mysian Olympus, and the Mysians sent to Croesus seeking relief. Croesus initially was unwilling to allow Atys to participate, but Atys talked his father into letting him go with a team of chosen young men and hounds to drive it off, arguing that boars do not wield iron weapons. Croesus gave his consent, but he sent Adrastus with him as a body guard. During the hunt, Adrastus accidentally killed Atys when hurling a spear at the boar, thus Croesus's dream came to pass. Riddled with guilt, Adrastus slew himself over the tomb of Atys. Hipponax of Ephesus mentions a tomb of Atys, which might be that of this prince.

Painting in the Long Corridor of the Summer Palace in Beijing. Princess Iron Fan (), also known as Rakshesha (), is a character from the 16th century Chinese novel Journey to the West. She is the wife of the Bull Demon King and mother of Red Boy. She is one of the most popular Journey to the West villains, alongside her husband the Bull Demon King, her son the Red Boy, the Six Eared Macaque, and Baigujing. She also appears in the film Doraemon: The Record of Nobita's Parallel Visit to the West under the name Queen Iron Fan, as the secondary antagonist. In Journey to the West, Princess Iron Fan is not so much a goddess as in a \\"proper\\" celestial one, but rather she made the villagers living near Flaming Mountains yield to her and offer her food and stuff like a goddess. Journey to the West She is a beautiful demoness and once married to the Bull Demon King and gave birth to the Red Boy. She living in Bajia Cave awaiting her husband's return, but also angry at him for his affair with a fox-spirit woman, Princess Jade Face. She possessed the magical Banana Leaf Fan, and used it to remove the fire on the Flaming Mountains, though since she only fanned once each time, it would only able to be removed for a year, before the fire starts again. Using this advantage, she made the residents near there revere her as their goddess, and they would have to give her some food if they want her to solve their problem about the Flaming Mountains. She refused to lend Sun Wukong her fan to subdue the Flaming Mountains. The pilgrims encounter an extremely hostile range of volcanic mountains and can only pass if the volcanoes become inactive. Her fan, made from banana leaves, is extremely large and has magical properties, as it can create giant whirlwinds. Sun Wukong wants to borrow her fan, but she turns him down as the monkey has been on bad terms with her husband before. Sun Wukong, however, is crafty and has ever better tactics for subduing his enemies. He transforms into a fly and flies into her mouth, down her throat, and into her soft belly. Princess Iron Fan and Sun Wukong. Painted decotation in the Long Corridor at the Summer Palace in Beijing, China Once inside, the monkey kicks and punches Princess Iron Fan's guts until she is in so much pain that she gives him a fake fan which intensifies the flames instead of putting them out. Having barely escaped from the fire, Sun Wukong returns, pretending to be her husband through shape shifting and obtains the fan. Soon afterwards, the real husband comes home, angry at what has happened, he pretends to be Zhu Bajie also through shape shifting and offers to carry the big fan. Lost in the moment of victory, Sun Wukong carelessly believes the Bull King and hands over the fan. Later, the Jade Emperor sends his heavenly troops to help Sun Wukong defeat Bull Demon King and Princess Iron Fan for good, and she is forced to give them the real fan. Other legends Her origin are unclear but some legend depicted her as a Taoist goddess and the ancestor of the wind gods who was entrusted by the heavenly court, and all the wind gods were under her jurisdiction. She is also the mentor of Meng Po, the goddess of forgetfulness. In Yuan zaju tradition, she is the sister of Lishan Laomu (Old Mother of the Li Mountain) and was originally a friend of the Queen Mother of the West, Pilanpo and belonged to Taoism. She once had a dispute with the Queen Mother of the West because the Queen Mother of the West brought her own wine. As a result, she rose up against the scene and turned against the heaven. Adaptations * The subject of the first Chinese animated feature film is a liberally adapted version of the encounter between Sun Wukong and Princess Iron Fan entitled Princess Iron Fan. * An adaptation of this occurs in the 24th episode of the Japanese television adaptation Saiyuuki, \\"The Fires of Jealousy.\\" * In the adaptation in the 1996 Journey to the West series, the Princess and Bull King have already known Monkey since childhood (they went to the same school that taught Monkey his fighting abilities) and were willing to give him the fan. But their obnoxious son, Red Boy, refuses to let his mother give the fan, thus forcing Monkey to enter her belly to force her to give him the fan. * The Dragon Ball series Son Goku's wife Chi Chi is based on the character. When she first appeared, her mission alongside Goku was to find the Bansho fan to put out the fire in her father's castle. * In Act-Age, competing actresses Kei Yonagi and Chiyoko Momoshiro are both cast to interpret Princess Iron Fan in an original play centered around the character. *In the film Doraemon: The Record of Nobita's Parallel Visit to the West, she appeared under the name Queen Iron Fan, as the secondary antagonist.

He is considered one of the finest virtuoso classical guitarists of the twentieth century.  Biography  Yepes was born into a family of humble origin in Lorca, Region of Murcia. His father gave him his first guitar when he was four years old, and took the boy five miles on a donkey to and from lessons three days a week. Yepes took his first lessons from Jes√∫s Guevara, in Lorca. Later his family moved to Valencia when the Spanish Civil War started in 1936. When he was 13, he was accepted to study at the Conservatorio de Valencia with the pianist and composer Vicente Asencio. Here he followed courses in harmony, composition, and performance. Yepes is credited by many with developing the A-M-I technique of playing notes with the ring (Anular), middle (Medio), and index (Indice) fingers of the right hand. Guitar teachers traditionally taught their students to play by alternating the index and middle fingers, or I-M. However, since Yepes studied under teachers who were not guitarists, they pushed him to expand on the traditional technique. According to Yepes, Asencio \\"was a pianist who loathed the guitar because a guitarist couldn't play scales very fast and very legato, as on a piano or a violin. 'If you can't play like that,' he told me, 'you must take up another instrument.'\\" Through practice and improvement in his technique, Yepes could match Asencio's piano scales on the guitar. \\"'So,' he [Asencio] said, 'it's possible on the guitar. Now play that fast in thirds, then in chromatic thirds.'\\" Allan Kozinn observed that, \\"Thanks to Mr. Asencio's goading, Mr. Yepes learned \\"to play music the way I want, not the way the guitar wants.\\" Similarly, the composer, violinist, and pianist George Enescu would also push Yepes to improve his technique, which also allowed him to play with greater speed. On 16 December 1947 he made his Madrid d√©but, performing Joaqu√≠n Rodrigo's Concierto de Aranjuez with Ata√∫lfo Argenta conducting the Spanish National Orchestra. The overwhelming success of this performance brought him renown from critics and public alike. Soon afterwards, he began to tour with Argenta, visiting Switzerland, Italy, Germany, and France. During this time he was largely responsible for the growing popularity of the Concierto de Aranjuez, and made two early recordings, both with Argenta ‚Äì one in mono with the Madrid Chamber Orchestra (released between 1953 and 1955), and the second in stereo with the Orquesta Nacional de Espa√±a (recorded in 1957 and released in 1959). In 1950, after performing in Paris, he spent a year studying interpretation under the violinist George Enescu, and the pianist Walter Gieseking. He also studied informally with Nadia Boulanger. This was followed by a long period in Italy where he profited from contact with artists of every kind. On 18 May 1951, as he leant on the parapet of a bridge in Paris and watched the Seine flow by, Yepes unexpectedly heard a voice inside him ask, \\"What are you doing?\\" He had been a nonbeliever for 25 years, perfectly content that there was no God or transcendence or afterlife. But that existential question, which he understood as God's call, changed everything for him. He became a devout Catholic, which he remained for the rest of his life. In 1952 a work (\\"Romance\\"), Yepes claims to have written when he was a young boy, became the theme to the film Forbidden Games (Jeux interdits) by Ren√© Cl√©ment. Despite Yepes's claims of composing it, the piece (\\"Romance\\") has often been attributed to other authors; indeed published versions exist from before Yepes was even born , and the earliest known recording of the work dates from a cylinder from around 1900. In the credits of the film Jeux Interdits, however, \\"Romance\\" is credited as \\"Traditional: arranged ‚Äì Narciso Yepes.\\" Yepes also performed other pieces for the Forbidden Games soundtrack. His later credits as film composer include the soundtracks to La Fille aux yeux d'or (1961) and La viuda del capit√°n Estrada (1991). He also starred as a musician in the 1967 film version of El amor brujo. In Paris he met Maria Szumlakowska, a young Polish philosophy student, the daughter of Marian Szumlakowski, the Ambassador of Poland in Spain from 1935 to 1944. They married in 1958 and had two sons, Juan de la Cruz (deceased), Ignacio Yepes, an orchestral conductor and flautist, and one daughter, Ana Yepes, a dancer and choreographer. In 1964, Yepes performed the Concierto de Aranjuez with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, premi√®ring the ten-string guitar, which he invented in collaboration with the renowned guitar maker Jos√© Ram√≠rez III. Yepes' 10-string guitar tuning The instrument made it possible to transcribe works originally written for baroque lute without deleterious transposition of the bass notes. However, the main reason for the invention of this instrument was the addition of string resonators tuned to C, A#, G#, F#, which resulted in the first guitar with truly chromatic string resonance ‚Äì similar to that of the piano with its sustain/pedal mechanism. After 1964, Yepes used the ten-string guitar exclusively, touring all six inhabited continents, performing in recitals as well as with the world's leading orchestras, giving an average of 130 performances each year. He recorded the Concierto de Aranjuez for the first time with the ten-string guitar in 1969 with Od√≥n Alonso conducting the Orquesta Sinfonica R.T.V. Espa√±ola. Apart from being a consummate musician, Yepes was also a significant scholar. His research into forgotten manuscripts of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries resulted in the rediscovery of numerous works for guitar or lute. He was also the first person to record the complete lute works of Bach on period instruments (14-course baroque lute). In addition, through his patient and intensive study of his instrument, Narciso Yepes developed a revolutionary technique and previously unsuspected resources and possibilities. He was granted many official honours including the Gold Medal for Distinction in Arts, conferred by King Juan Carlos I; membership in the Academy of \\"Alfonso X el Sabio\\" and an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Murcia. In 1986 he was awarded the Premio Nacional de M√∫sica of Spain, and he was elected unanimously to the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando. In the 1980s, Yepes formed Trio Yepes with his son Ignacio Yepes on flute and recorder and his daughter Ana dancing to her own choreography. After 1993, Narciso Yepes limited his public appearances due to illness. He gave his last concert on 1 March 1996 in Santander (Spain). He died in Murcia in 1997, after a long battle with lymphoma.  Press quotes  As one writer has observed, \\"His [Yepes'] taking advantage of the instrument's flexibility has opened Yepes to some criticism,\\" citing Bach's Chaconne in D Minor as an example. Yepes responded that, \\"There are three versions of the Chaconne and I analyzed all three. The version I play is the one I think Bach would have written if he'd composed the piece for guitar or lute.\\" Guitarist and teacher Ivor Mairants noted that after a Yepes concert at Wigmore Hall in 1961, some in the audience were split about Yepes' phrasing. Mairants, who had started as a jazz guitarist but took up the classical guitar and had two lessons with Segovia, met with Yepes afterwards and questioned him about his phrasing, which was very different from Segovia's. In his memoir, Mairants wrote, \\"I exclaimed 'Do you think it necessary to play that section (of Villa Lobos' Prelude No. 1) as slowly as you do?' 'Why, yes' he (Yepes) said, 'Look at the paper (music) and you will see it written that way'. When I again mentioned that Segovia did not play it that way, he had no doubt had enough of my comparisons and answered, somewhat heatedly 'I have a great admiration for Segovia and everything he has done for the guitar and its history, but I do not have to put on a record of Segovia and play the music exactly as he does. No, I don't think so!'\\" Elsewhere, Yepes was quoted as saying, \\"Segovia is a very beautiful player, but it is not necessary to imitate him. Why should Rostropovich imitate Casals?\\"  Positive  *\\"Narciso Yepes gave a most delicate account of Rodrigo's Concierto de Aranjuez. The range of timbres he can produce, to contrast phrases and to shape them, is astonishing . . . The work is not worthy of such playing.\\" Paul Griffiths, The Times, 6 Nov 1974 p. 11) *\\"Guitar concerts in Carnegie Hall can be a frustrating affair. Narciso Yepes brought his 10-string invention there last Thursday, and suddenly it was not a problem hearing that instrument in that space. His guitar fills the hall with sound. The musician who plucks it is one of the finest in the world today. ... One left his recital stimulated and elated, with nary a thought as to the potential limitations of the instrument, dynamically or musically.\\" (1982) *\\"Mr. Yepes' playing was distinguished by its clarity of detail, particularly in the ornaments, and facility of the passage-work. He was also able to sustain contrapuntal lines by some devilish trick, and he used color, not like Segovia, for its sensual appeal, but to help underline phrases and structural details ...

The plural form was typically used, often written cycles per second, cycles/second, c.p.s., c/s, ~, or, ambiguously, just cycles (Cy./Cyc.). The term comes from the fact that sound waves have a frequency measurable in their number of oscillations, or cycles, per second. With the organization of the International System of Units in 1960, the cycle per second was officially replaced by the hertz, or reciprocal second, \\"s‚àí1\\" or \\"1/s\\". Symbolically, \\"cycle per second\\" units are \\"cycle/second\\", while hertz is \\"Hz\\" or \\"s‚àí1\\". Confusion can arise because the units of angular measure (cycle or radian) are omitted in SI. For higher frequencies, kilocycles (kc), as an abbreviation of kilocycles per second were often used on components or devices. Other higher units like megacycle (Mc) and less commonly kilomegacycle (kMc) were used before 1960 and in some later documents. These have modern equivalents such as kilohertz (kHz), megahertz (MHz), and gigahertz (GHz). Following the introduction of the SI standard, use of these terms began to fall off in favor of the new unit, with hertz becoming the dominant convention in both academic and colloquial speech by the 1970s. The rate at which aperiodic or stochastic events occur may be expressed in becquerels (as in the case of radioactive decay), not hertz, since although the two are mathematically similar, by convention hertz implies regularity where becquerels implies the requirement of a time averaging operation. Thus, one becquerel is one event per second on average, whereas one hertz is one event per second on a regular cycle. Cycle can also be a unit for measuring usage of reciprocating machines, especially presses, in which cases cycle refers to one complete revolution of the mechanism being measured (i.e. the shaft of a reciprocating engine). Derived units include cycles per day (cpd) and cycles per year (cpy).

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 6, 2002. This episode, as well as the earlier \\"Anthology of Interest I\\", serves to showcase three \\"imaginary\\" stories. Plot Professor Farnsworth hauls out his What-If Machine again, fine-tunes it, and the crew takes a look at three alternative realities. I, Meatbag Bender asks what would happen if he were human. The simulation opens with Professor Farnsworth announcing that he has invented a process of reverse fossilization, which can turn robots and machines into organic life-forms. He uses his process on Bender, who is transformed into a human. After a short period of adaptation, Bender's self- control is overwhelmed by his new senses of taste and touch, and goes on a binge of eating, smoking, partying, and drinking alcohol. A week later, at the Nobel Prize judging, the Professor presents Bender, who has become an overweight blob. The committee initially condemns Farnsworth, but Bender begs them to consider his lifestyle. This inspires the scientists to spend the night in a state of wild hedonism. The next morning, the hungover committee awards Bender the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, but discover that he died the moment the party began. The \\"woo!\\" noises that the partygoers assumed were from Bender were actually caused by air escaping the many folds of fat on his body. The Planet Express crew sadly roll away Bender's corpse. Raiders of the Lost Arcade Fry asks to see a world that is more like a video game. As the simulation starts, President of Earth Richard Nixon is preparing to sign a treaty with Ambassador Kong of planet Nintenduu 64. Ambassador Kong attacks Nixon, and a state of war erupts. Due to his extensive knowledge of video games from the 20th Century, Fry is brought to the Milatari headquarters and introduced to General Colin Pac-Man. Before Fry can impart his wisdom to the military, the Nintendians launch an attack on Washington, D.C., and they are forced into the escape tunnels, which resemble a Pac-Man board. They emerge outside the Planet Express building, where the Nintendian invaders, led by Lrrr, are blasting New New York. Fry situates himself at the controls of a rolling anti-aircraft artillery platform, and begins destroying the alien ships in a manner similar to Space Invaders. Fry is unable to destroy the final ship, which lands nearby. The invaders emerge and demand \\"a million allowances worth of quarters\\" with which to do their laundry. The Earthlings refuse. The invaders suggest they be allowed to throw their laundry in with Earth's as a compromise, and the Earthlings agree. Wizzin' Leela asks what if she found her true home. However, when the lever is pulled to start the simulation, it hits Leela on the head and knocks her unconscious, prompting her to dream a parody of The Wizard of Oz with Leela as Dorothy, Nibbler as Toto, Amy as Glinda the Good Witch, Fry as the Scarecrow, Bender as the Tin Man, Zoidberg as the Cowardly Lobster, and Professor Fansworth as the Professor of Oz. Leela and Nibbler, while riding in the Planet Express ship, are taken by tornado to Oz. The ship's landing gear lands on the Wicked Witch of the East, killing her. Leela takes the witch's magic boots from her corpse and puts them on, since it is hard to find footwear in her size. She asks Amy for help getting back home, and Amy tells her that only The Professor at the Emerald Laboratory can send her home. Leela is joined in her quest by Fry, Bender, and Zoidberg. They all are captured by Wicked Witch Mom who asks Leela to be her witch daughter. Leela happily agrees, but when Bender pops opens a celebratory bottle of champagne, the spilled liquid causes Mom to melt into nothing. They resume their journey to the Emerald Laboratory, where The Professor tells Leela to click her boot heels together and wish to be sent back home. Instead, she uses them to become a witch and turns Fry, Bender and The Professor into toads. However, a toilet overflow in the upstairs bathroom (caused by Zoidberg's use of it) leaks through the ceiling and onto Leela, causing her to melt. She wakes up to find Bender splashing water in her face and berates the crew for showing up in her wonderful dream and ruining it. Cultural references=I, Meatbag In a split-second establishing shot of New New York before the Professor's press conference, the towers of the World Trade Center are seen. This episode aired on January 6, 2002, about 4 months after the towers were destroyed. The song that Bender becomes infatuated with as a human is \\"Conga\\" by Gloria Estefan. The title of the segment is a nod to the Isaac Asimov collection of short stories I, Robot. Raiders of the Lost Arcade A parody of the game Space Invaders The \\"Raiders of the Lost Arcade\\" segment is a \\"non-stop barrage of game references\\" with jokes and allusions referencing a wide array of classic video games. The title is a reference to the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark. The segment starts off with a sequence from Asteroids. \\"Ambassador Kong\\" is a reference to the arcade game Donkey Kong, as is Italy's ambassador to the U.N. being Mario. The maze which the characters run through is an homage to both Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man. Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man both appear in the episode (Pac-Man as General Colin Pacman, and Ms. Pac-Man as his wife/widow). The Nintendians' fleet is composed of Space Invaders ships, which move in the same pattern as those in the video game (\\"Drop down, increase speed, and reverse direction!\\"). Fry plays to the accompaniment of a cassette tape of \\"Tom Sawyer\\" by Rush. The planet Nintendu 64 is a reference to the game console Nintendo 64. When the Milatari HQ is first shown, the green tank from Battlezone is driving past. When the characters walk through the HQ, they go past doors labelled Moon Patrol and Missile Command. As the video game villains (Lrrr, Donkey Kong, a Berzerk robot, a Robotron brain, BurgerTimes Mr. Egg, and Q*bert) exit the landed ship, one character says the phrase \\"All your base are belong to us\\". Wizzin' The majority of the plot is a direct parody of the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz, with Leela taking the place of Dorothy, Amy as the Good Witch of the North, Fry as the Scarecrow, Bender as the Tin Man, Zoidberg as the Cowardly Lion, Professor Farnsworth as the Wizard and Mom as the Wicked Witch of the West. When Leela first exits the spaceship, a parody of the NBC peacock logo is seen spreading its feathers. While skipping Fry says ‚ÄúI got to pull over and take The Wiz,‚Äù in reference to the The Wiz, a 1978 remake of the original film. Reception In 2006, IGN.com ranked this episode as the series' twelfth best, with \\"Anthology of Interest I\\" at number 13, in their list of the \\"Top 25 Futurama episodes\\".

On April 4, 1978, an Interstate Commerce Commission emergency service order was issued at which time the Brandon Corporation took over service. The Union Stock Yards Company of Omaha needed a separate line to run cattle to and from the Union Pacific Railroad mainline in downtown Omaha. After building the line, in 1904 the Union Stock Yards Company of Omaha was involved in a U.S. Supreme Court case against the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad entitled Union Stock Yards Company of Omaha v.

The South Omaha Railway used former CB&Q; 0-6-0 steam locomotives. During World War II the railroad applied to purchase 5 diesel locomotives from the American Locomotive Company. The basis of the request was that the steam locomotives were worn out and they needed the diesel locomotives to supply meat to the war effort. The request was approved and 5 S-1 locomotives were purchased. In later years 1 locomotive sat unused in front of the sand blasting building for Nebraska Railcar in Brandon Corporation paint. The body of this locomotive now resides in a scrapyard in Council Bluffs, Iowa. The other locomotives were sold to a railroad in Kansas where they were further dispersed. 1 locomotive is preserved at the Abilene and Smokey Valley Railroad and another is preserved at the Illinois Railway Museum as Nekoosa Paper #14.

Television channel Parliament TV and radio network AM Network are funded by the New Zealand House of Representatives to broadcast full and unedited coverage of its proceedings. The Office of the Clerk also funds a fully independent written, audio and video political reporting service of Parliamentary proceedings called Parliament Today. Sitting hours are seasonal and are generally within five weekly sessions. Normal sittings are 14:00 and 18:00 Tuesdays; 19:30 and 22:00 Tuesday nights; 14:00 and 18:00 Wednesdays; 19:30 and 22:00 Wednesday nights; and 14:00 and 18:00 Thursdays. Special circumstances can allow Parliament to sit under urgency, usually between 09:00 Tuesday morning and 24:00 Saturday evening. History Prior to the AM Network, Parliamentary broadcasts were carried on the Concert programme, with New Zealand becoming the first country in the world to broadcast Parliament regularly on 25 March 1936. Veteran press gallery journalist and political commentator Charles Wheeler introduced the broadcast of the opening of the 25th Parliament, with Speaker-elect Barnard. Wheeler told listeners on the first broadcast that \\"for the first time in the history of New Zealand broadcasting, the microphone has been introduced into Parliament itself so that even the most distant elector may gain some first- hand knowledge of the more important happenings\\". He said New Zealand was blazing the trail in allowing parliamentary broadcasts. Since the 1980s, the AM Network has used to broadcast all live Parliamentary proceedings in full. In 2007, Parliamentary coverage was expanded to television. Services=Parliament TV The popularity of a video of a Parliamentary speech by Maurice Williamson led to him being invited to appear on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Parliament TV is managed by Kordia under a long-term contract to the House of Representatives. and is made freely available to media companies. It broadcasts though media such as TVNZ and MediaWorks New Zealand, as streaming video on the Internet, and, since 9 October 2007, on Freeview channel 31 and Sky Channel 086. Programming on Parliament TV is limited to live coverage of Parliament and scheduled repeats of Question Time on Parliamentary sitting days.New Zealand Parliament - House sitting programme, 2015 It closes down outside non-sitting hours. In The House Christchurch-based Tandem Studios is contracted to the Clerk of the House to live stream Parliament TV's broadcasts, and record, re-format and re-purpose the coverage as small highlight package videos on their In The House website and YouTube account. More than 22,000 videos have been uploaded, and the company claims the videos have received more than 3 million views.About InTheHouse , 2015 Several videos from the final reading of the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Act 2013 were redistributed by The New Zealand Herald and other media. A video of one speech in favour of the Act, by National Party MP Maurice Williamson, went viral on YouTube, Huffington Post, Gawker, New York Times and Pink News. It was broadcast on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, with Williamson later declining an invitation to appear on the show. AM Network This is a map of the AM Network frequencies. The AM Network is operated by Radio New Zealand under a similar contract, and uses a nationwide set of AM broadcasting transmitters that were previously used by The Concert Programme before it switched to FM broadcasting. The broadcasts are also available online, via live-streaming and through on-demand podcasts. The AM Network's Parliamentary broadcasts do not include continuity announcers or news bulletins, unlike other Radio New Zealand networks. In total, Radio New Zealand produces an estimated 17 hours of live Parliamentary broadcasting and just over an hour of packaged extracts. The Radio New Zealand smartphone app allows listeners to follow individual Parliamentary sittings on Apple and Android mobile devices. The broadcaster claims its iPhone App has been downloaded more than 50,000 times since it was first introduced in 2011. The AM Network's closedown hours were originally used by Sports Roundup. Since 1997, Christian broadcaster Rhema Media has consistently leased this time to broadcast the low-budget easy listening Star radio network. Despite AM Network being technically owned by Radio New Zealand, Star broadcasts Newstalk ZB Affiliates Unit hourly news bulletins during the air time it leases. AM Network's North Island frequencies are Auckland 882 AM, Waikato 1494 AM, Hawke's Bay 909 AM and Wellington & Tauranga 657 AM. In the South Island, it broadcasts on Canterbury 963 AM, Dunedin 900 AM and Invercargill 1314 AM. Parliament Today The Office of the Clerk also fully funds a political reporting service, providing written, audio and video summaries from the debating chamber and committee rooms of the House of Representatives completely independently from Radio New Zealand. It is the country's only consistent source of regular reports of parliamentary proceedings, with live reports of debates and decisions in the chamber from independent press gallery journalists Tom Frewen and Rheesh Lyon. Clerk of the House David McGee established the service in 1994, hoping to replicate the success BBC Radio 4 show Today in Parliament has had since 1945. Parliament Today programmes summarise the most significant events and highlights from Question Time, debates and select committees, utilising audio from the AM Network for rebroadcast on other stations. Kiwi FM, the community access stations, the student radio stations and other stations broadcast the programmes around the country, and Radio New Zealand International broadcasts the programmes around the Pacific. Each sitting week the service produces three daily programmes on sitting days, a weekly five-minute programme, a weekly ten minute programme, weekly 15 minute programme, a weekly 28 minute programme and a weekly 5 minute Select Committee report. The service ceased in 2016.

This training system is universal among the six major R/C radio manufacturers (Spektrum, Futaba, JR, Hitec, Sanwa/Airtronics and KO Propo) which means that transmitters do not have to be the same brand in order to be joined via an umbilical cable. There are, however, two different types of DIN cable connectors used for the purpose and the two are incompatible. Therefore, both transmitters must have the same type of receptacle in order to operate together. Buddy boxing is accomplished by joining the student and master transmitters via the aforementioned cable and making sure that the servo reversing switches and trims are set identical on both. The student is given control of the aircraft via a long-handled, spring-loaded switch on the top left corner of most transmitters located on the master transmitter, normally held by the instructor. When the switch is pulled forward and held on by the instructor's left index finger, control of the aircraft is at the student's transmitter. Should the instructor judge that the student is encountering difficulty in flight, control is transferred to the master transmitter merely by releasing the switch. (On some older Futaba radios such as the popular 6XA, the trainer switch is actually a push-button located in the corner, the aforementioned corner toggle switch is reserved for channel 5 - landing gear.) The two transmitters need not be on the same frequency. The master transmitter is the one that actually flies the plane; buddy boxing turns the student transmitter into a \\"dummy\\" remote control of the master. The student transmitter is operated with power switched off as power for both is provided by the master. The student transmitter will power up via the umbilical despite being switched off.

It is part of West Potomac Park and is a focal point of the National Cherry Blossom Festival held each spring. The Jefferson Memorial, the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial, the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, and the George Mason Memorial are situated adjacent to the Tidal Basin. The basin covers an area of about and is deep. History Tidal Basin in the 1920s The concept of the Tidal Basin originated in the 1880s to serve both as a visual centerpiece and as a means for flushing the Washington Channel, a harbor separated from the Potomac River by fill lands where East Potomac Park is situated. Peter Conover Hains, an engineering officer in the U.S. Army, oversaw the design and construction. The basin was initially named Twining Lake, in honor of Major William Johnson Twining (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers), Washington DC's first Engineer Commissioner. According to testimony given to a Congressional subcommittee in 1917, it was Major Twining's idea to create a tidal reservoir and use that water to help \\"flush\\" the Washington Channel, and the design was carried out by Colonel Hains. A 1917 Army Corps of Engineers map of Washington already shows the basin with the name \\"Twining Lake\\". In August 1918 the whites-only Congressionally-funded Tidal Basin Bathing Beach was opened in front of the site of the present-day Jefferson Memorial. The beach was popular, and by one estimate attracted up to 20,000 people on a July day in 1920. Congress had planned to open a separate beach for African-Americans nearby, but the plan was blocked by southern senators. Rather than integrate the beach, Congress ordered the dismantling of the beach in 1925. The Tidal Basin which exists today was not laid out until after World War II. It was built in 1949 by the construction firm of Alexander and Repass, which was unusual at that time because Alexander was of African descent and Repass was of European descent. Redesign of the Tidal Basin is under consideration in 2020, as sea level rise and land subsidence causes portions of the paths next to the water to flood twice daily at high tide. Design The Tidal Basin with cherry blossoms Orphans playing in the Tidal Basin circa 1924 The basin is designed to release of water captured at high tide twice a day. The inlet gates, located on the Potomac side of the basin, allow water to enter the basin during high tide. During this time, the outlet gates, on the Washington Channel side, close to store incoming water and block the flow of water and sediment into the channel. As the tide begins to ebb, the general outflow of water from the basin forces the inlet gates to close. This same force is applied to the outlet gates, which open into the channel. Silt build up is swept away by the extra force of water running from the Tidal Basin through the channel. The gates are maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which has restored the functioning of the gates. The northern lobe of the basin is crossed by the Kutz Memorial Bridge, named in honor of Brigadier General Charles W. Kutz the Commissioner of Engineering for the District of Columbia during the first half of the 20th century, carrying eastbound Independence Avenue traffic in three lanes. The bridge was designed by Paul Cret, begun in 1941, completed 1943 and altered with dedication in 1954. It is of concrete and steel on pilings, all granite faced. As part of the restoration and redesign of the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool, completed in 2012, water is pumped from the Tidal Basin to fill the pool. Incidents The Tidal Basin was the scene of an incident involving the Chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Ways and Means, Democratic Congressman Wilbur Mills. On October 7, 1974, Mills' car, with an Argentine stripper known as Fanne Foxe in the back with Mills and driven by a former Nixon staffer, was stopped by US Park police late at night because the driver had not turned on the headlights. Mills was intoxicated and his face was cut from a fight with Foxe. When police approached the car, Foxe leapt from the car and jumped into the nearby Tidal Basin. Despite the scandal, Mills was re-elected to Congress in November 1974 with 60% of the vote, but in December he drunkenly staggered onstage at a Boston strip club where Ms. Foxe was performing. Soon after this second embarrassment Mills was forced to step down from his chairmanship of the Ways and Means Committee. Mills eventually acknowledged his alcoholism, sought treatment at the West Palm Beach Institute, and joined Alcoholics Anonymous. He did not seek re- election in 1976.

She was a backing vocalist for American and British rock and pop acts of the 1960s and 1970s, including Ike & Tina Turner, Pink Floyd, Humble Pie, Barbra Streisand, Elkie Brooks, Neil Diamond, Steely Dan, and the Rolling Stones. Having emigrated to Australia in 1982 she took dual Australian-American citizenship. She recorded or toured as a backing singer for Australian artists, Richard Clapton, Australian Crawl, Cold Chisel, Jimmy Barnes, James Morrison and John Farnham. Life and career= Early life  Fields was born in Buffalo, New York in 1941, into a religious family. Her early musical training was from regular gospel performances at church. Her inspiration was Aretha Franklin. Fields singing career began with the Templaires, a group she formed with members of her church, followed by the Corinthian Gospel Singers.  Early career  In late 1961, the Ike & Tina Turner Revue were playing in Buffalo. Fields successfully auditioned as a new member of Ike & Tina Turner's backing vocalists, joining the Ikettes. The revue toured the Chitlin' Circuit and performed at prominent theaters in major cities across the United States. In between gigs Ike Turner produced artists in the revue. Field's released her debut single \\"You're Still My Baby\\"/ \\"I'm Leaving You\\" on Turner's Sony Records label in 1963. Fields was given a solo to perform during shows, such as \\"The Love of My Man\\" on the album Ike & Tina Turner Revue Live (1964), \\"I Know (You Don't Love Me No More),\\" and \\"Good Time Tonight\\" on Live! The Ike & Tina Turner Show (1965). In 1965, the Ikettes released the Top 40 hit \\"Peaches 'N' Cream\\" (Pop #36, R&B; #28) and \\"I'm So Thankful\\" (Pop #74, R&B; #12) on Modern Records. By late 1965, Fields left the revue along with fellow Ikettes Jessie Smith and Robbie Montgomery. Fields later recalled \\"I was an Ikette for five years. It was a rough job, but it was a very good experience. It's just like a school. You go from grade 1 to 2, not from 1 to 8. And when you graduate you have to leave. There is such a thing as staying too long; when you start getting stagnant and stifled by what you're doing. We almost stayed too long.\\" In 1966, the trio signed to Mirwood Records and became the Mirettes. They left Mirwood and released their highest charting single \\"In the Midnight Hour\\" (Pop #45, R&B; #18) on Revue Records in 1968. By 1970, Fields had left the group and was replaced by former Ikette Pat Powdrill.  Session vocalist  Fields worked as a session vocalist from about 1969, often with Clydie King and Sherlie Matthews, for Quincy Jones, Paul Butterfield, Tim Buckley, Steely Dan, Joe Walsh, Joe Cocker, Elkie Brooks, Neil Diamond, Leonard Cohen, Bob Seger, Burt Bacharach and Burton Cummings. Others: Diana Ross, Bette Midler, Bob Dylan, the Supremes, and for Aretha Franklin ‚Äì her mentor and inspiration. Notable performances during this time included Wish You Were Here (September 1975) with Pink Floyd, and recording the Rolling Stones' album Exile on Main St. (May 1972). Fields later reflected on her sessions for the latter album, they were at midnight but she wanted money for clothing, \\"I was more interested in the coat than I was in the Rolling Stones\\". With King, she sang on four tracks, \\"Tumbling Dice\\", \\"I Just Want to See His Face\\", \\"Let It Loose\\" and \\"Shine a Light\\", which she felt \\"were wonderful songs and they were just right for us... We knew gospel. That's what most people wanted from us, a gospel sound.\\" Around 1971, Fields, King, and Matthews formed the Blackberries, with Matthews as producer and songwriter as well as vocalist. When backing Ray Charles, the trio worked as the Raelettes. In 1972 Steve Marriott asked them to record and tour with his band, Humble Pie, and produced an unreleased Blackberries LP with Humble Pie as the backing band ‚Äì they parted company in 1973. Michael Little of Vinyl District reviewed Eat It (April 1973), which showed Humble Pie \\"at its most eclectic. Each of its four sides emphasized a different aspect of the band, and the concept works.\\" He described the track, \\"Get Down to It\\", which \\"makes maximum use of the band‚Äôs backing singers\\" including \\"the immortal\\" Fields. Fields and King acted as Barbra Streisand's backing singers (The Oreos) in the 1976 musical film, A Star Is Born (December 1976), and sang on its associated film soundtrack (November 1976). Fields had previously sung on two of Streisand's albums from 1971. Career in Australia As a member of Boz Scaggs backing band, Fields toured Australia in 1978 and 1980. While in the country in the latter year she contributed backing vocals to Marc Hunter's (ex-Dragon) solo album, Big City Talk. Note: Fields is incorrectly given as Vanetta. Back in the US she provided backing vocals for So Lucky (December 1981), by Ren√©e Geyer ‚Äì the Australian artist was then working in California. Fields decided to relocate permanently to Australia in 1982, \\"I had all that experience and a good reputation but I felt like I was stuck in a stereotyped box... I needed to do something else and I had to get away to somewhere where I could start again.\\" Fields continued to work with US artists when they toured her adopted country until 2000, including George Benson, Dionne Warwick, Streisand, Thelma Houston, and Randy Crawford. She also recorded or toured as a backing singer with Australian artists, Richard Clapton (1983‚Äì84), Jimmy Barnes, Australian Crawl, Cold Chisel, James Morrison, Mark Gillespie (Australian singer), and as a long-term touring and session harmony vocalist for John Farnham (1986‚Äì95).Venetta Fields entries at Australian Rock Database: * John Farnham Band (1986‚Äì95): * Chong Lim: * Joe Creighton: * Black Sorrows: * Richard Clapton Band (1983‚Äì84): Neil Lade of The Canberra Times reviewed Clapton's album, Solidarity (September 1984), and described its final track, \\"New World\\", as \\"slow and softly lulling. A song of peace and hope... and Clapton's voice is at its tuneful best. And the backing vocals of Vanetta [sic] Fields add a powerful and echoing dimension to what may be just the album's finest song.\\" In the mid-1980s in Melbourne, Fields formed a new group, Venetta's Taxi, with a line-up including vocalist Sherlie Matthews, guitarist Michael den Elzen, and Chong Lim on keyboards, while also performing regularly as a backing vocalist for local and touring artists. During this period Fields coached singing, including Karen Knowles and Colette Mann, at Tony Bartuccio's Dance Academy in Prahran. She took vocal workshops at the Victorian College of the Arts. Fields and Farnham were both guest vocalists with The Incredible Penguins in late 1985, for a cover of \\"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\\", a charity project for research on little penguins, which peaked at No. 10 on the Australian Kent Music Report in December. NOTE: Used for Australian Singles and Albums charting from 1974 until ARIA created their own charts in mid-1988. In 1992, Kent back calculated chart positions for 1970‚Äì1974.

Fields starting work for Farnham on his Jack's Back Tour in support of his album, Whispering Jack (October 1986). Debbie Kruger of Variety magazine caught the show at the State Theater in March 1987, \\"Midway through the show, Farnham left the stage, and backing Singer Venetta Fields sang three songs which kept the audience warm but eager for more of their hero.\\" Musical theatre In January 1989 Fields made her musical theater debut as Alice in the Australian production of Big River: The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn at Her Majesty's Theatre, Sydney. She followed with other stage appearances including two plays for the Melbourne Theatre Company ‚Äì Racing Demon (April 1991) and The Crucible (May 1991) ‚Äì Blues in the Night (August, October 1992), Chess (concert version), and as Ruby in the Buddy Holly show Buddy the Musical. In 1986 she formed and toured her own show, Gospel Jubilee; the line-up of the band of the same name was Joanne Campbell, Joe Creighton, Chong Lim, Sherlie Mathews and Fellon Williams. Later years Fields has lived on the Gold Coast since 2000 and no longer tours or records with visiting artists. She released her solo album At Last in 2005. Fields is active as a vocal coach with several students including 2005 Australian Idol winner Kate DeAraugo, singer-songwriter Cody Simpson, and 2011 Australia's Got Talent, finalist Bree De Rome. Accolades In 2002, Fields received the Australian Gospel Singer of the Year award. In recognition of her achievements, Fields was inducted into the Buffalo Music Hall of Fame on September 29, 2005.

It was written for the stage show Wait a Minim!, and has been described as the musical's \\"showpiece\\". On the surface a children's song, it became broadly popular. Content The song was penned in \\"South African creole English\\", the vernacular of young, English-speaking South Africans, with liberal sprinklings of Afrikaans words and phrases. The language was that of Taylor's students, to whom he taught Latin in the southern suburbs of Johannesburg. The lyrics are full of references to places, brands and entertainment popular among working-class white South Africans. In the first four verses, a boy pesters his father to take him and his numerous friends to the drive-in theatre, the funfair, a wrestling match (between the Canadian Ski Hi Lee and the South African Willie Liebenberg), and finally to a distant beach in Durban, with a chorus chanting: \\"Popcorn, chewing gum, peanuts and bubblegum\\". The father remains silent until the abortive fifth verse, when he retorts \\"Voetsek!\\" (\\"Clear off!\\"). When the song resumes, the boy complains that, since his father won't take him out for amusements, he will have to entertain himself by beating up the boys (moer all the outjies) next door. Reception The single, described as \\"insightful\\", and a \\"fond classic\\", became a cause c√©l√®bre in South Africa, Rhodesia, Kenya, and Mozambique. It sold more copies in South Africa than any single by Elvis Presley, as well as outselling any previous domestic single. The success of the song led to the popularity and acceptability of political satire in South Africa during later decades. The song aroused significant controversy, with many Afrikaners unhappy about the mixing of Afrikaans and English in the lyrics, and its \\"far- from-flattering\\" representation of working-class whites, although some praised it for its \\"gutsiness\\". It was banned from airplay by the South African Broadcasting Corporation, who considered that it violated the principles of apartheid. As Taylor later commented, \\"The whole concept of separateness applied also to the concept of keeping English and Afrikaans apart, and they wanted the English to be pure English and the Afrikaans to be pure Afrikaans. Then Ag Pleez Deddy comes along, like a mongrel, a bloody street cur. They couldn't stand it.\\" Post-apartheid, the song was described as \\"vulgar and base, revealing the raw side of South Africans in all their humour\\", and \\"a liberating anthem for hitherto doomed anglophone youth\\". Gillian Slovo wrote that the song is very familiar with white South Africans who grew up during the apartheid era, saying \\"We loved the song's words, the demands of insatiable childhood for zoos and aquariums\\". In the longer term, another controversial element of the song proved to be its mention, in the list of consumer products coveted by the youths ‚Äì alongside \\"liquorice, Pepsi-Cola, ginger beer and Canada Dry\\" ‚Äì of \\"Nigger balls\\", a type of gobstopper. Outside this context, the word \\"nigger\\" was not widely used in South Africa at that time, or considered unduly offensive; but it was growing increasingly controversial in the United States, and in subsequent years became effectively taboo in all Anglophone countries. When A New Book of South African Verse in English was published by Oxford University Press in 1979, edited by Guy Butler and Chris Main, the lyrics of \\"Ag Pleez Deddy\\" were included but the offending words were altered to \\"acid-drops\\", without Taylor's authority and to his great annoyance. However, Taylor himself, when later singing the song in the United States, substituted the term \\"sugar balls\\".

Introduced in the 2001 installment Silent Hill 2, they are a type of monster that serve as main antagonists as they stalk James Sunderland, the primary player character, who comes to the town of Silent Hill after receiving a letter from his deceased wife, Mary. The Silent Hill series, particularly the second installment, frequently utilizes psychology and symbolism: Pyramid Head represents James' wish to be punished for Mary's death. Masahiro Ito, the designer of Silent Hill 2s monsters, created the character because he wanted \\"a monster with a hidden face\\". Known for its large triangular helmet that conceals his head, Pyramid Head lacks a voice, a visible face, and their appearance stems from the town's past as a place of execution. It has since appeared in the 2006 film Silent Hill as \\"Red Pyramid\\", in the 2007 first-person shooter Silent Hill: The Arcade as a boss (a computer-controlled opponent), and in the fifth installment of the series, Silent Hill: Homecoming, as the \\"Bogeyman\\". He has also made an appearance outside of the Silent Hill series as a selectable character in the 2008 Nintendo DS title New International Track & Field, Super Bomberman R, and was added as a playable character in 2020, in the video game Dead by Daylight. Positively received in Silent Hill 2 for his role as an element of James' psyche, he has been cited by reviewers as an iconic villain of the series and part of Silent Hill 2s appeal. Concept and design A monster with a concealed face was the concept behind Pyramid Head's design; Ito rejected his initial sketch (left), which resembled a masked human, and gave the creature a pyramid-shaped helmet (right). Ito wanted to create \\"a monster with a hidden face\\", but became unhappy with his designs, which resembled humans wearing masks. He then drew a monster with a pyramid-shaped helmet. According to Ito, the triangle's sharp right and acute angles suggest the possibility of pain.Konami Corporation. The Making of Silent Hill 2 DVD. Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo, Inc, 2002. Of the creatures that appear in Silent Hill 2, only Pyramid Head features an \\"overtly masculine\\" appearance. He resembles a pale, muscular man covered with a white, blood-soaked robe reminiscent of a butcher's smock. He does not speak, but grunts and moans painfully. His most outstanding feature is his large red, triangular helmet. His weapons consist of the deadly and heavy Great Knife, which the player can find and use for the rest of the game, and later a spear. As a German World War II tank enthusiast, Ito was inspired by the lower hull of the King Tiger heavy tank when designing the edges of the character's helmet; other military vehicles from that region and era informed design elements as well. According to Konami's Lost Memories, his appearance was a variation of the outfits of the executioners from the fictional history of the town. They wore red hoods and ceremonial robes to make themselves similar to Valtiel, a monster who appears in Silent Hill 3. Like Valtiel, Pyramid Head dresses in gloves and stitched cloth and pursues the game's main protagonist. According to Silent Hill 2s character designer Takayoshi Sato, he appears as a \\"distorted memory of the executioners\\" and of the town's past as a place of execution. Christophe Gans, the director of the film adaptation of Silent Hill, suggested that Pyramid Head \\"was one of the executioners in the original history of the town\\" and \\"there is not one particular or exclusive manifestation of him as an entity.\\" Appearances=In video games In Silent Hill 2, after receiving a letter from his deceased wife, Mary, and arriving in the foggy town of Silent Hill to search for her, the game's protagonist and primary player character, James Sunderland, encounters Pyramid Head several times over the course of the game. He first appears from behind a gate, making no attempt to attack James. Later, in an apartment, James walks in on Pyramid Head killing two Mannequins‚Äîcreatures made of two sets of feminine hips and legs. Terrified, James hides in a closet and watches while Pyramid Head stands directly outside of it before leaving. When James asks another character, Eddie, about the monster, Eddie denies knowing about Pyramid Head. Later, near a flooded stairway, James witnesses Pyramid Head choking out another monster, and Pyramid Head attempts to kill him, causing a boss fight. After a few minutes, sirens sound in the distance and Pyramid Head descends the stairway and disappears. James does not meet him again until in Brookhaven Hospital, where Pyramid Head knocks him through a safety railing and he falls, sustaining injuries. Pyramid Head does not pursue him or continue the attack. Later, he stalks James' companion Maria, who closely resembles his wife Mary, through a lengthy corridor. As James flees into an elevator, the doors shut before she can join him. He struggles to open the doors to save her, but Pyramid Head kills her. However, in the labyrinth beneath Toluca Prison, James finds her alive and unharmed in a locked cell. Before trying to seduce him, she reminisces about a trip that only he and Mary took to a hotel in Silent Hill. He leaves, promising to find a way to free her, and discovers that Pyramid Head walks a corridor nearby, now carrying a spear. Afterwards, James reaches Maria's side of the cell, but finds her dead. Pyramid Head makes his final appearance just before the final boss, where two Pyramid Heads take part in the encounter. They kill Maria yet again and, after pursuing James around the room for a while, both commit suicide. Pyramid Head, under the new moniker \\"Bogeyman\\", makes a significant appearance in 2008 installment Silent Hill Homecoming, but his role is limited to non-interactive scenes, appearing only twice to the game's main protagonist Alex Shepherd (once in the Grand Hotel in Silent Hill and, much later, in a church, where he executes Alex's father by splitting him in half). His last appearance is in a possible ending to the game: Alex wakes up in a wheelchair as two Pyramid Heads appear, each with part of a helmet, which they use to turn Alex into one of them. After this ending is played, the player obtains the Bogeyman's costume for Alex to wear. Mindful of Pyramid Head's role in Silent Hill 2, the developers chose to include him as \\"the embodiment of a myth [that] parents started to keep the children out of trouble\\" and \\"the accretion of the activities going on in the town of Shepherd‚Äôs Glen.\\" Pyramid Head appears as a boss in the 2007 first- person shooter Silent Hill: The Arcade, as well as Silent Hill: The Escape, but with a composite design with the Butcher, and as a super-deformed selectable character in the 2008 Nintendo DS title New International Track & Field, an installment of the Track & Field series, another spin-off Krazy Kart Racing alongside Robbie the Rabbit, and in 2017's Super Bomberman R. The 2007 game Silent Hill Origins also included a similar monster named \\"The Butcher\\", whom the protagonist occasionally encounters killing other monsters (unlike other versions of Pyramid Head, the Butcher can and must be fought and killed in combat) and a painting of Pyramid Head is seen in the burning house of Alessa. Pyramid Head appears in 2012 installment Silent Hill: Downpour, playing more prominent role in main story and in \\"Surprise!\\" ending, along with various characters from the franchise. Pyramid Head's most recent appearance was in 2012's Silent Hill: Book of Memories, where he is a monster that can spawn randomly to fight the player. Pyramid Head also appeared as a costume for the Playstation Home. On a Super Bomberman R update released on June 29, 2017, Pyramid Head appears as a cameo as Pyramid Bomber, alongside Simon Belmont from the Castlevania series, and Gradius's Vic Viper. On May 26th, 2020, Pyramid Head was announced as the newest killer for the survival horror game Dead by Daylight. His title is \\"The Executioner\\", a nod to his past as the executioner of Silent Hill. In other media Pyramid Head makes an appearance in the 2006 film adaptation of Silent Hill as \\"Red Pyramid\\", and is portrayed by Roberto Campanella. In the film, the psyches of the female characters shaped the character's physical appearance. Gans claimed that replicating the character's head exactly and having the actor move while wearing it proved to be impractical; he noted that, despite the name, Pyramid Head actually wore \\"a basin\\" instead of a triangle-shaped helmet. Red Pyramid's sword and helmet were constructed out of lightweight material painted to appear heavy. For the role, Campanella wore a \\"five-part prosthetic\\"; it took two-and-a-half to three hours to get him into costume and make-up. His boots had a hidden sole which made him just under tall. Patrick Tatopoulos, who worked on the make-up effects and monsters, enjoyed the project of designing the character. According to him, Red Pyramid serves as a symbol of the town's darkness and harbinger of its changed character. Gans considered the monsters of the film \\"a mockery of human beings\\", and commented: \\"The real monsters are the people, the cultists who tortured Alessa. When I approached the film, I knew that it was impossible to represent the monsters as simply beasts that jump on you.\\" In the 2012 film Silent Hill: Revelation, the Pyramid Head, once more portrayed by Roberto Campanella, is both a monster and a guardian. More than once, it saves Sharon from the forces of Silent Hill. This is explained by its loyalty to Alessa: since Heather is the good half of Alessa's soul, it sees them as the same being and is thus bound to protect both from harm. Pyramid Head is also seen controlling the carousel where Heather and Alessa face off against each other, then it kills the cult leader Claudia Wolf after the amulet shows her inner, monstrous nature. He also makes a cameo appearance in the 2008 Silent Hill comic book Sinner's Reward, published by IDW Publishing. The writer, Tom Waltz, later said he regretted the cameo, which only functioned as fan service. To him, Pyramid Head is a psychological construct created for James; however, he stated that: \\"At the same time, I don't think that ruined the comic. Some people really liked it. To some people, Pyramid Head should be in all the stories because they do like him.\\" Additionally, the character was portrayed from October 2 to 31, 2009, in the haunted attraction Sinister Pointe, based on Silent Hill, in Orange County, California, United States. Analysis The Silent Hill series uses symbolism and psychology; the town of Silent Hill draws upon the psyche of its visitors, ultimately creating an \\"otherworld,\\" a twisting of reality that manifests delusions and elements of their subconscious minds, varying from character to character. Specifically, in the case of Silent Hill 2's primary player character James Sunderland, the version of the town he explores is influenced by him. Many of the monsters that roam the town symbolize his guilt, wish for punishment, for his wife's three-year- long illness, and cease to exist after James comes to terms with the fact that he killed his wife Mary, partially to end her suffering and partially out of resentment and frustration. James knew she had a terminal illness, which has been speculated to be cancer, and he often read medical textbooks, searching for something to help her. During her last days alive, she became physically repulsive as a result of the illness and treated James abusively, ordering him to leave one moment and begging him to comfort her the next. The knowledge of her terminal illness caused her to become angry and to hurt her loved ones, particularly James, and it pained him to visit her in the hospital. Pyramid Head functions as an executioner of Maria, a delusion of James' who strongly resembles Mary. Through Maria's repeated deaths, Pyramid Head reminds James of Mary's death and causes him to experience guilt and suffering. His appearance as an executioner stems from a picture that James saw while visiting the town three years ago with Mary. Reviewers have suggested various interpretations. According to Christina Gonz√°lez of The Escapist, Pyramid Head acts as \\"judgement personified, a dark butcher,\\" and \\"James' masochistic delusion\\" which punishes him for Mary's death. Ken Gagne of Computerworld suggested that the monster \\"represents James' anger and guilt.\\" A critic for IGN, Jesse Schedeen, considered Pyramid Head's role throughout the Silent Hill series to be \\"a manifestation of a person's guilt\\", commenting: \\"Pyramid Head is just there to help you serve your penance in the most painful and grotesque way possible.\\" Reception Critical reaction to Pyramid Head has been favorable because of his distinctive appearance and role as an element of James' psyche. Critics cite him as an iconic villain of the Silent Hill series, a favorite among fans, and part of the appeal of Silent Hill 2. GameSpot compared Pyramid Head's appearance to Leatherface, the main antagonist of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre series of slasher films, and found him the most terrifying monster in Silent Hill 2. Computerworld named Pyramid Head as one of the most terrifying villains in computer and video games. GamesRadar felt that the scene in which he rapes the two other monsters was unsettling, since the subject of rape is not often tackled in video games, and disliked the final battle with him because of how anti-climactic it was, in comparison with his role throughout the rest of the game. GameDaily ranked Pyramid Head first on their 2008 list of the scariest video game monsters. GamesRadar listed him as one of the 25 best new characters of the decade and ranked him second on its 2009 list of the scariest video game villains, calling him the \\"most horrifying character ever to have a cult following\\". In a 2009 retrospective on the survival horror genre, IGN noted that Silent Hill 2 incorporated \\"a 'stalker' element similar to Clock Tower and Resident Evil 3,\\" and wrote: \\"To this day, Pyramid Head is remembered as one of gaming's most frightening villains.\\" PlayStation Universe ranked him as the first on their 2009 list of the scariest monster \\"to infest a Sony platform\\", also noting his \\"prolific reputation as one of video game‚Äôs most fearsome monsters.\\" In 2010, Pyramid Head as named as the scariest character in video game history by Joystick Division, who added that \\"being chased by him in Silent Hill 2 ranks with all of the scariest moments in video gaming history.\\"James Hawkins, Top Ten Scariest Characters in Video Game History, Joystick Division, April 1, 2010 UGO.com ranked him as number one on their 2011 list of the scariest characters in video games, commenting he is \\"too mainstream to be all that scary, except he's still really super scary.\\"Marissa Meli, Pee Your Pants At The Scariest Characters In Video Games , UGO, June 21, 2011 In 2012, PlayStation Official Magazine included him on their lists of the biggest freaks and scariest characters in the PlayStation games, commenting: \\"Ol‚Äô Metal Top is easily the best thing about Silent Hill ‚Äì and maybe even survival horror in general ‚Äì completely encapsulating that intoxicating dread of knowing that it‚Äôs not if you‚Äôll fight him, but when.\\" That same year, FHM included him on their list of ten scariest game characters ever;Gelo Gonzales, 10 Scariest Game Characters Ever, fhm.com.ph, November 2, 2012 on the list of the \\"coolest\\" video game villains by Complex, Pyramid Head placed as 15th. GamesRadar too praised Pyramid Head's role as an antagonist, putting him in their 2013 list of the best villains in video game history at number 18. His appearances outside Silent Hill 2 have received mixed critical reaction. Critics generally agreed that Pyramid Head's appearance in Homecoming struck them as fan service, though Chris Hudak of Game Revolution called it \\"damned effectively-employed.\\" Masahiro Ito commented that Pyramid Head was designed specifically for James' story in Silent Hill 2, and that, if he were to make another Silent Hill game, he would either not use Pyramid Head again or kill him off entirely in the opening scene. Film critics commented on his role in the film adaption, with several finding him disturbing. DVD Reviews praised Campanella's portrayal of Pyramid Head and another monster, writing: \\"These are without a doubt some of the most striking bogeymen that I have seen on screen in a long time.\\" His appearance in New International Track & Field received mixed critical reaction. GameDaily disliked it, finding it awkward that a character like Pyramid Head was competing in sporting events with characters like Frogger and Sparkster, while The Escapist called it enjoyable and \\"hilarious\\".
