Background Due to a shortage of land to build on around Hamilton, developers were now subdividing land that had previously been deemed unsuitable for building on. This included the subdivision on peat that Paramount Builders were building a house on a section purchased by the MacKays. The Mackay's had purchased the section from the developer on the condition that they lay a sand base for the building foundations. The MacKay's then arranged Paramount to build a house on top of this foundation. During construction though, the local building inspector recognized that a sand base would not be strong enough and ordered Paramount to cease construction. Paramount then redesigned a new concrete foundation, and restarted construction. As construction was near completion, the MacKay's complained to the builders that there was a sag in the building, but they were told it was just an \\"optical illusion\\". The Mackay's however did not believe this, and on sold the house to the hapless Bowen's as soon as they could. The Bowen's eventually discovered their house had subsided due to inadequate foundations. They sued the builders for negligence. Held The court awarded the buyers of the house damages.

As Curtis could not pay up front for the boat, Williams loaned him the money, with the boat being used as security for the loan.

This mostly threatens the parasite and pathogen species that are highly host-specific to critically endangered hosts. When the last individuals of a host species are captured for the purpose of captive breeding and reintroduction programs, they typically undergo anti- parasitic treatments to increase survival and reproductive success. This practice may unintentionally result in the extinction of the species antagonistic to the target species, such as certain parasites. It has been proposed that the parasites should be reintroduced to the endangered population. A few cases of conservation-induced extinction have occurred in parasitic lice.

The Neorion is located in the eastern part of the city, on the southern shore of the Golden Horn, near its mouth into the Bosphorus The Neorion Harbour () was a harbour in the city of Constantinople, active from the foundation of the city in the 4th century until the late Ottoman period. It was the first port to be built in Constantinople after its re-foundation by Constantine the Great, and the second in the area after the Prosphorion, which was the port of ancient Byzantium.Janin (1964), p. 235 M√ºller-Wiener (1977), p. 57 Location The harbour lay on the southern shore of the Golden Horn, east of today's Galata Bridge, in the sixth region of Constantinople. In the Ottoman Istanbul this area corresponded to the Bah√ßekapƒ± (\\"Gate of the garden\\") neighborhood, located between the customs warehouses and the Abd√ºlhamit Medrese: today the site belongs to the Mahalle of Bahcekapi in Emin√∂n√º, which is part of the Fatih district (the walled city) of Istanbul. The inlet where the basin once lay is now silted up, and is presently occupied by the ferry terminals to the Bosphorus, Kadik√∂y and √úsk√ºdar. History Braun and Hogenberg, 1572 The Neorion was the first harbour to be erected in Constantinople after its foundation, and the second in the area after the Prosphorion harbour, which existed already under the city's previous incarnation as Byzantium, and lay in the next inlet to the east, right under the northwest slope of the first hill of the city, in the quarter named \\"ta Eugeniou\\" (). Being placed on the southern shore of the Golden Horn, the Neorion was not subjected to the heavy storms provoked by the Lodos, the south-west wind blowing from the Marmara Sea; in addition, harbour silting was not such a big problem as for the harbours on the city's southern shore. In fact, entrance of sail ships into the Golden Horn was possible with all winds; the only wind which could create some problems and a light silting being the North wind.Janin (1964), p. 236 The harbour had the double function of commercial port and shipyard, and hosted also a factory producing oars (). Since the main activity of the harbour was trade, the area was surrounded by many storehouses.M√ºller-Wiener (1977), p. 58 This fact is underlined by the many fires which ravaged the port quarter: in 433 all the storehouses burned; in 465 a fire started here engulfed eight regions of the city; and in 559 the warehouses burned again. According to a late tradition, St. Andrew the Apostle settled here and made the quarter the centre of his preaching when he landed in Byzantium. In 697 Emperor Leontios (r. 695-98) had the harbour cleaned from the mud, since the area was suspected to be a plague breeding ground. The Neorion remained an important harbour for the city through the centuries, and when the Latin commercial colonies (and possibly also the Jews) settled there, acquiring the right to establish their port of call on the Golden Horn, the importance of the port grew. First of all, Venetians and Amalfitans settled to the west; then came the Pisans, who at the end of the 11th century established themselves in the densely inhabited area west of the port; finally, in 1155 came the Genoese, who founded their colony in an area lying south and east of the Neorion. In the 17th century, long after the transfer of the Genoese to Galata, on the opposite shore of the Golden Horn, part of the Jewish community settled in the quarter, living there until the middle of the 20th century, when the whole area was demolished to enlarge the coast road and create the square in front of the Yeni Mosque. Due to the Jewish presence in the area, in the Ottoman period the Byzantine Porta Neoriou of the sea walls changed its name to √áifutkapƒ± (\\"Gate of the Jew\\"). At the time of their maximum expansion, the Latin staging areas extended quite a way west of Neorion, reaching the Gate of Bigla/Vigla (also named Drungarios gate, later the Ottoman Odun Kapƒ±, \\"Gate of the firewood\\"). With the rise of Genoese power during the Palaiologan period, the overseas commerce migrated from Neorion to Galata, but after the fall of the city in 1453 and the subsequent decline of Genoa's trade hegemony, the harbour would regain and keep one part of the city's overseas trade until the late Ottoman era. Description Along Neorion's waterfront lay a portico, named Keratembolin (). The name derives from a statue erected on a bronze vault, which represented a man bearing four horns on his head.Janin (1964), p. 90 According to a legend, in the port area was also on display a statue of an ox which bellowed once per year, frightening the inhabitants of the neighborhood. Because of that, Emperor Maurice (r. 582-602) ordered it thrown in the sea. One part of the harbour was known as \\"the old equipment\\" (), and hosted a shipyard: in this neighborhood lay the church of Saint Euphemia.

The church was built by the Dutch in 1706 and is a smaller version of the church in Galle fort. It is one of the oldest Protestant churches still in use in the country. History The church was consecrated on 6 October 1706, according to an inscription over the doorway. During subsequent repairs and improvements this date has been obliterated and another date, that of 1767 was etched above the entrance. This date however refers to the reconstruction of the church by the Dutch following the Matara Rebellion. The Dessave (Dutch: opperkoopman) at that time was Daniel Burnat. The church may have existed prior to 1706. There is evidence of greater antiquity in the gravestones, which pave the floor of the church. The oldest of the gravestones is of Barbara Jongeling, the wife of Lambert Lambertijn, the medical officer of the station in 1686. Other gravestones include, Dessaves Frans Willem Falck, father of Governor Iman Willem Falck, and Johannes Fernandinus Crijtsman, in 1737 and 1758, respectively. The Church was primarily for the Dutch but the first Sinhala sermon was held when a Church service was organised for the housemaids of the Dutch community who brought them to the Church and stayed on the verandah until the service was over. Architecture The church's fa√ßade and the interior are very simple and plain, in keeping with the church's Calvinist heritage. The building has round headed windows on each side, a pillared verandah on the south side, with the entrance in the middle. It is an elegant but unpretentious building sufficient to hold 200 seats. The door and window panels are made of heavy wood while the walls now show signs of crumbling as the proper mixture to rebuild them could not be found within Sri Lanka. Interior of the church Current use The Matara Church, protected by the sturdy walls of the fort, was slightly damaged by the tsunami caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. The building did not suffer structural damage but the majority of the antique furniture was destroyed. The Evangelist of the Church, with the assistance of the Dutch Reformed Church (DRC), turned the building into a food distribution centre for the suffering population. Church services were subsequently resumed despite the damage. The church has been restored by the Wolvendaal Foundation in cooperation with the Archaeological Department of Sri Lanka. In January 2005 the Dutch Reformed Church established the Wolvendaal Foundation. Its ultimate aim is to further cordial relations between the various races and religions on the island. In October 2006 the Wolvendaal Foundation, with the financial assistance (Rs. 6.5M) from the Dutch Government appointed Poly-Chem Lanka (Pvt) Ltd, Colombo to undertake the restoration of the church. The renovation works were completed within 2 years, the works included restoring the roof, repairing and painting the walls, equalising the floor and re-installing the historic Dutch tombstones into their original position. The antique pulpit and pews were also renovated. The Archaeological Department of Sri Lanka has subsequently made further improvements to the roof.

It has extended its branches at Bharatpur, Biratnagar, Pokhara, Tri-Chandra College and recently at ASCOL.http://www.cdctu.edu.np/ History Tribhuvan University was established by promulgating the Tribhuvan University Act in 1959. TU has commenced teaching, research, and other academic activities from July 14, 1959. The teaching of Chemistry in Nepal, however, had already commenced in 1921 in Tri-Chandra College, with the introduction of the Intermediate of Science (I.Sc.) program. It was then upgraded to Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) level in 1947. Master's Degree in Chemistry was started only from November 28, 1965, initially at Tri-Chandra College with the introduction of a program in Organic Chemistry. The program was conducted under the lecturer-in-Charge-ship of Late Professor Prasanna Man Singh Pradhan, the then Head of the Chemistry Department of Tri-Chandra College. This historical step also pioneered the introduction of research initiatives in Chemistry in Nepal. The present Chemistry building within the University Campus was constructed on August 17, 1966 and inaugurated on July 16, 1967. The Central Department of Chemistry then started to function in its own building at the University complex. Master's degree programs in Inorganic Chemistry and Physical Chemistry were introduced in 1966 and 1967, respectively. Late Professor Dr. Dhruba Man Singh Amatya was formally appointed as the first Head of the Department in 1966 and he remained to that post up to 1984. After him, Prof. Dr. S.P. Dhoubadel (1984/10/28 - 1984/11/25), Prof. Dr. C.L. Gajurel (1984/11/26 - 1985/08/31 and 1987/04/11 - 1987/11/05), Prof. J.K.

Pathak (2007/12/13 - 2009/08/31) were appointed as Head of the Central Department of Chemistry during the period in between 1984-2009, Prof. Dr. Kedar Nath Ghimire, Prof. Dr. Megh Raj Pokhrel, and Prof. Dr. Ram Chandra Basnyat(Biochemist and vegan) have been leading the Department as the Head since 2018. Since the establishment, the department has extended its courses on various subjects with amendments each year. The latest being Biochemistry, Natural Product Chemistry, Electrochemistry, Nanotechnology, Polymer science, etc. Since 2013, the department has adopted a semester system that previously succeeded by year basis as major campuses here in Nepal do such. The total quota of students for each year was 90 and after being converted to the semester system, the quota has been limited to 45 per semester effectively maintaining the identical seats over the year.

Simantics System Dynamics is used for modelling and simulating large hierarchical models with multidimensional variables. The models are created in a traditional way with stock and flow diagrams and causal loop diagrams. Simulation results and the model structure can be analyzed with different visual tools. Simantics System Dynamics is developed on the Simantics Platform and is released under Eclipse Public License and provided as open-source software. History The development was initiated by a group of active system dynamics modellers who had needs and ideas for an open toolset. The new needs for features like hierarchical modules, module libraries, collaborative model development and efficient model communication in system dynamics together with the development of open source modelling framework Simantics and simulation environment OpenModelica drove the developers to start developing an open source modelling and simulation software for system dynamics. Features Simantics System Dynamics has several key features ; Spreadsheets : An easy way for importing and managing parameter values are spreadsheets. They can also be used for storing and maintaining values in familiar format. ;Experiments : Experiments are the way to simulate the model in Simantics System Dynamics. Experiments can exist with different configurations meaning e.g. different initial values for some parameters. ;Modules : Modules enable structural modeling. They are defined just like the basic model configuration but the module component hides the actual configuration. ;Functions : Simantics System Dynamics contains built-in functions and also user-definable functions. Functions can be exchanged via exporting and importing. ;Charts : Charts are user-defined displays of simulation result data. Charts can be used in various places. There are four types of custom charts *Line chart *Sensitivity chart *Bar chart *Pie chart Interface and usability Workbench of Simantics System Dynamics showing basic components such as views and editors Simantics System Dynamics (as any other Simantics based product) is built on top of Eclipse and therefore the User interface logic follows closely the one introduced in Eclipse. Simantics System Dynamics workbench window contains one or more perspective and perspectives contain different views and editors. Views are used to represent data in different ways. Editors are used for the actual modeling. Simantics Platform Simantics is an open source software platform especially for modelling and numerical simulation. It is a grounding to build a modelling and simulation software or to integrate different software tools. Simantics platform utilizes heavily semantic data driven technique. All the data in the Simantics platform database is described using semantic data models and ontologies. In addition to the database, Simantics platform contains many features and user interface elements that are common to most simulation and modelling tools like diagram editor, symbol library and different kind of experiment and state management.

Inhibitory mechanism on CaMK II KN-62 blocks the combination of CaM and CaMK II by binding directly to the calmodulin binding site of the enzyme, disenables CaMK II's autophosphorylation, consequently leading inactivation.

The spacecraft was launched aboard a Chang Zheng 4B rocket in August 2014. Heweliusz is an optical astronomy spacecraft built by the Space Research Centre of the Polish Academy of Sciences and operated by Centrum Astronomiczne im. Miko≈Çaja Kopernika PAN; it is one of two Polish contributions to the BRITE constellation along with the Lem satellite. It is named after Johannes Hevelius. Features Heweliusz is the third Polish satellite (after PW-Sat and Lem) ever launched. Along with Lem, TUGSAT-1, UniBRITE-1 and BRITE- Toronto, it is one from a constellation of six nanosatellites of the BRIght- star Target Explorer project, operated by a consortium of universities from Canada, Austria and Poland. Heweliusz was developed and manufactured by the Space Research Centre of the Polish Academy of Sciences between 2010 and 2012, based around the Generic Nanosatellite Bus, and had a mass at launch of . The satellite is used, along with four other operating spacecraft,, to conduct photometric observations of stars with an apparent magnitude of greater than 4.0 as seen from Earth. Heweliusz was one of two Polish BRITE satellites launched, along with the Lem spacecraft. Four more satellites‚Äîtwo Austrian and two Canadian‚Äîwere launched at different dates. Heweliusz observes the stars in the red color range whereas Lem does it in blue. Due to the multicolour option, geometrical and thermal effects in the analysis of the observed phenomena are separated. None of the much larger satellites, such as MOST and CoRoT, has this colour option; this is crucial in the diagnosis of the internal structure of stars. Heweliusz photometrically measures low-level oscillations and temperature variations in stars brighter than visual magnitude (4.0), with unprecedented precision and temporal coverage not achievable through terrestrial based methods. Launch The Heweliusz satellite was launched as a secondary payload on a Long March 4B rocket, whose primary payload was the Chinese Gaofen 2 earth-observation satellite. The launch was subcontracted to the China Great Wall Industry Corporation and China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC). The launch took place at 03:15 UTC on 19 August 2014 from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center, and the rocket deployed all of its payloads successfully. Although the other satellites in the BRITE constellation used the Canadian XPOD nanosatellite deployer, Heweliusz uses an indigenous Polish system. The DRAGON nanosatellite deployer was designed specifically for this mission by the Space Research Centre, in collaboration with the SRC spinoff company Astronika. Development, manufacturing, testing, and integration of the system took only two months.

The first series was hosted by Mariella Frostrup. The series was produced by independent production company Clearstory and broadcast on Channel 4. The show's premise centres upon the idea that couples will be more open to sexually themed discussions after having performed the act itself. The show's hosts have the couple retire to a private \\"sex box\\" on stage, where they are to have sexual intercourse with one another. Sex Box was released as part of Channel 4's \\"Campaign for Real Sex\\", which the channel described as \\"a series of programmes which aim to reclaim sex from porn\\". The programme provoked controversy and debate in both the British and international press. Some reviews of the programme were positive, praising the sincerity of the programme's aims. However, many critics and viewers panned the show, and ratings for the first episode showed that while 1.1 million viewers tuned into the show, this number dropped by 200,000 after the first 15 minutes. Series 2 began broadcasting on 4 April 2016. It is presented by Goedele Liekens and Steve Jones. Synopsis The show features couples that have agreed to come on to the show and have sex in the titular \\"sex box\\". During this time the hosts will discuss their relationship. After a certain amount of time the couple will emerge from the box and talk about sex and their relationship. The show's theory is that couples will be more likely to be closer after having sex and be more likely to be honest and open when answering questions about their own sex life and sex in general.

From concept to execution, it was a combination of gimmick, prurience, exploitation and dullness.\\" Metro also commented on the show, noting that the show \\"left viewers in a state of awkwardness and confusion tonight, with many pondering over a series of unanswered sex questions following its debut.\\" The Mirror poked fun at the show for having \\"a weird box with flashing multicoloured lights that looked like an Ikea-bought version of Doctor Who's TARDIS\\". They also criticized the show for spending more time on its heterosexual couples than on the disabled and homosexual pairings, a criticism shared by Gawker. By contrast, Time Out praised \\"A surprisingly earnest, likeable and good-hearted affair\\", and a reviewer for Complex praised the show for its diversity and stated that they \\"actually learned a thing or two\\", which surprised them. According to The Times: \\"If you put aside your preconceptions, ignore the surrounding brouhaha and watch this programme with an open mind, it becomes difficult to criticise and impossible to condemn\\". In other countries Sex Box is distributed internationally by DRG TV. It currently broadcasts in Australia on SBS Two. In March 2014 WE tv announced that they were in the process of developing a North American version of the show and had ordered an hour-long pilot episode. The show first aired on WE tv in February 2015 and was hosted by relationship therapist Fran Walfish, sex therapist Dr. Chris Donaghue, Florida pastor Dr. Yvonne Capehart, and comedian Danielle Stewart. Nine episodes of the series were ordered but only five aired, as the show was cancelled in April 2015 due to poor reception.

V. D. Hodge and Georges de Rham) is an alternative term sometimes used to describe the Fr√∂licher spectral sequence (named after Alfred Fr√∂licher, who actually discovered it). This spectral sequence describes the precise relationship between the Dolbeault cohomology and the de Rham cohomology of a general complex manifold. On a compact K√§hler manifold, the sequence degenerates, thereby leading to the Hodge decomposition of the de Rham cohomology. Description of the spectral sequence The spectral sequence is as follows: :H^q(X, \\\\Omega^p) \\\\Rightarrow H^{p+q}(X, \\\\mathbf C) where X is a complex manifold, H^{p+q}(X, \\\\mathbf C) is its cohomology with complex coefficients and the left hand term, which is the E_1-page of the spectral sequence, is the cohomology with values in the sheaf of holomorphic differential forms. The existence of the spectral sequence as stated above follows from the Poincar√© lemma, which gives a quasi-isomorphism of complexes of sheaves :\\\\mathbf C \\\\rightarrow \\\\Omega^* := [\\\\Omega^0 \\\\stackrel d \\\\to \\\\Omega^1 \\\\stackrel d \\\\to \\\\cdots \\\\to \\\\Omega^{\\\\dim X}], together with the usual spectral sequence resulting from a filtered object, in this case the Hodge filtration : F^p \\\\Omega^* := [\\\\cdots \\\\to 0 \\\\to \\\\Omega^p \\\\to \\\\Omega^{p+1} \\\\to \\\\cdots ] of \\\\Omega^*. Degeneration The central theorem related to this spectral sequence is that for a compact K√§hler manifold X, for example a projective variety, the above spectral sequence degenerates at the E_1-page. In particular, it gives an isomorphism referred to as the Hodge decomposition :\\\\bigoplus_{p+q=n} H^p(X, \\\\Omega^q) = H^{n}(X, \\\\mathbf C). The degeneration of the spectral sequence can be shown using Hodge theory.See for example Griffiths, Harris Principles of algebraic geometry An extension of this degeneration in a relative situation, for a proper smooth map f: X \\\\to S, was also shown by Deligne. Purely algebraic proof For smooth proper varieties over a field of characteristic 0, the spectral sequence can also be written as :H^p(X, \\\\Omega^q) \\\\Rightarrow H^{p+q}(X, \\\\Omega^*), where \\\\Omega^q denotes the sheaf of algebraic differential forms (also known as K√§hler differentials) on X, \\\\Omega^* is the (algebraic) de Rham complex, consisting of the \\\\Omega^q with the differential being the exterior derivative. In this guise, all terms in the spectral sequence are of purely algebraic (as opposed to analytic) nature. In particular, the question of the degeneration of this spectral sequence makes sense for varieties over a field of characteristic p>0. showed that for X over a perfect field of positive characteristic, the spectral sequence degenerates, provided that X admits a lift to a (smooth proper) scheme over the ring of Witt vectors W2(k) of length two (for example, for k=Fp, this ring would be Z/p2). Their proof uses the Cartier operator, which only exists in positive characteristic. This degeneration result in characteristic p>0 can then be used to also prove the degeneration for the spectral sequence for X over a field of characteristic 0. Non-commutative version The de Rham complex and also the de Rham cohomology of a variety admit generalizations to non-commutative geometry. This more general setup studies dg categories. To a dg category, one can associate its Hochschild homology, and also its periodic cyclic homology. When applied to the category of perfect complexes on a smooth proper variety X, these invariants give back differential forms, respectively, de Rham cohomology of X. Kontsevich and Soibelman conjectured in 2009 that for any smooth and proper dg category C over a field of characteristic 0, the Hodge-de Rham spectral sequence starting with Hochschild homology and abutting to periodic cyclic homology, degenerates: :HH_*(C / k)[u^{\\\\pm 1}] \\\\Rightarrow HP_*(C / k). This conjecture was proved by and by adapting the above idea of Deligne and Illusie to the generality of smooth and proper dg-categories. has given a proof of this degeneration using topological Hochschild homology.

The Diet Fix His first book, The Diet Fix: Why Diets Fail and How to Make Yours Work, was published by Random House Crown Harmony in March 2014. A National Post review of the book said that Freedhoff uses \\"real research, not pseudoscience, along with a healthy dose of common sense gleaned from practical experience.\\" A review by Newsday described the book's concept of \\"post-traumatic dieting disorder\\", which includes feelings like guilt and depression that may occur after failed dieting attempts. A Scientific American review said that \\"this is not your average diet book\\" and noted that Freedhoff begins with a prescription for some chocolate. The review said that Freedhoff touches on the \\"toxic, obesogenic environment\\" of the modern world, but it lamented the fact that Freedhoff does not go into more detail on that aspect of the dieting problem. Other work Freedhoff writes an award-winning blog, Weighty Matters. It has been ranked the world's top health blog by the blog ranking service Technorati.

It started in 1949 as Immaculate Conception College- Piapi School. History In 1949, the Immaculate Conception College, Davao City, opened a free school in the slums of Piapi in this city through the initiative of the ICC Directress, Mother Maria Alberta Alviar, RVM. The old San Guillermo chapel served as classroom both for the kindergarten and grade one pupils with Mrs. Candida Josue and Miss Pancito as the first teachers. The following year an annex room was put up to accommodate the grade two and grade three classes with Mrs. Leonida Salas as additional teacher. In 1952, a complete primary course was offered. With the increasing enrollment, the need for a bigger space and rooms was seen into by Rev. Father Gaudiose Gagno, PME, the parish priest of Fatima Parish. He acquired a bigger place for both the Church and the School at the corner of Fatima and Aurora Streets. Due to limited space, some classes were held at the Church and nearby houses of a benefactor. Teachers and school needs were provided then by the Immaculate Conception College until such time when OLFA could stand on its own. With the help of ICC, OLFA parents and teachers worked for the improvement of the school. In 1954, the ICC- Piapi School was formally Changed to Our Lady of Fatima Academy. Four years later the grade school was granted the government recognition. A new building was constructed in 1960 to accommodate the increase in enrollment. The complete secondary course was recognized in 1962. Enrollment continued to increase and so a new building was constructed in 1987; blessed and occupied in 1989. The wooden dilapidated building was knocked down for another construction of a concrete grade school building, blessed and made ready in 1994. In 1998, OLFA has produced one Most Outstanding Graduate in Davao City besting fifty- one other Valedictorians in the city and suburbs. On December 20, 1998, the school joined the start of a year -long Golden Jubilee of the Year of God the Father celebration and on January 1999, OLFA also commemorated its Golden Jubilee of Foundation. Enrollment continued to increase so on March 27, 2002, the laying of the cornerstone of a four-storey building took place. The actual construction started on April 2 of the same year. The improvement continued with the renovation of offices. The year also marked the participation of OLFA in the Educational Service Contracting (ESC)scheme of the government. In 2005, the RVM community headed by S. Ma. Lydia C. Daga, RVM, initiated the purchase of a 234 square meter lot fronting Fatima Church for the construction of a four-storey building to accommodate the continuing increase of enrollees every year. The groundbreaking was done on March 20, 2006. The building was blessed on December 30, 2006 and became the second home of the kindergarten and the intermediate classes since 2007. To continue the improvement of the school facilities needed to provide quality instruction, the administration had the faculty and audio-visual rooms renovated in the summer of 2007. As the buildings became concrete, the need to improve instruction and facilities were priorities hand-in-hand with the building preparations. Improvement of facilities goes on to upgrade services to the school community. Computer lessons were incorporated into the curriculum. And therefore construction of computer laboratories, Speech laboratory and upgraded science laboratory, Home Economics and Industrial Arts rooms were also seen into. In addition to that, right during S. Ma. Bernadette G. Suico, RVM's last reigning for Principal and Directress in 2013, all rooms are fully air-conditioned for improving enough ventilation. OLFA is up into the upgrading of the whole school. It has applied for accreditation with the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU). Currently, July 24-25 the PAASCU Accreditors will be visiting the school Model Venerable Ignacia del Esp√≠ritu Santo, also known as Mother Ignacia (1 February 1663 ‚Äì 10 September 1748) was a Filipino Religious Sister of the Roman Catholic Church.RVM Online Known for her acts of piety and religious poverty, founded the Congregation of the Sisters of the Religious of the Virgin Mary, the first native Filipino female congregation with approved pontifical status in what is now the Republic of the Philippines. Mother Ignacia del Espiritu Santo was declared Venerable by Pope Benedict XVI in 2007.Ignacia del Esp√≠ritu Santo School Seal The school seal is derived from the seal of Religious of the Virgin Mary. Encircled by rays which represent the far-reaching zeal and charity, the central device is the A and M monogram representing the words Auspice Maria (\\"under the guidance of Mary\\"; commonly called the \\"Ave Maria\\"). Surrounding the Auspice Maria are twelve stars which stand for the twelve God-given prerogatives of Mary, the Mother of God and Mother of the Church through which people receive of her special and maternal blessings. Rays emanate from the starry monogram in seven groups, representing the light and wisdom from God through Jesus Christ, the light of the World, and through Mary and reflect the Congregation's motto, \\"To Jesus through Mary\\". Under the monogram is an open book bearing the Latin inscription, Initium sapientiae Timor Domini, which is beginning of Proverbs 9:10: \\"The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom\\".Religious of the Virgin Mary It expresses the filial fear, a disposition of profound reverence, awe and love for God, the Source of all wisdom, grace and life. The sampaguita beneath the book symbolizes the purity of heart of Mary and Mother Ignacia and the Filipino origin of the school. The school name is written on the upper part of the seal and written below is Davao City, the locale of the school and 1949, the year the school was established. This logo is literally the same as every RVM Schools UIC, St. Mary's it just changes the school name and the location of course. School Publication The Vision is the official publication of the school. It has a two-fold objective. First, it is primarily to develop the literary and artistic talents of pupils and students by giving them the opportunity to express their opinions, visions and reflections through the written form. Second, it aims to create wholesome school spirit by keeping the pupils and students informed of past, present, and future activities.OLFA Student's Handbook The recent School Publication named the Vision is currently practicing in creating articles especially intramurals is fast approaching and now the Vision is trying to train new students to replace the current senior editors that has a higher chance of leaving the school especially they consist of grade 10 students of OLFA (2018) Gallery Our Lady of Fatima Academy, Davao City, Grade school Building.jpgGrade school Building Our Lady of Fatima Academy, Davao City, Highschool Building.jpgHighschool Building References Category:Schools in Davao City Category:Catholic elementary schools in the Philippines Category:Catholic secondary schools in the Philippines Category:Religious of the Virgin Mary ","title":"Our Lady of Fatima Academy, Davao City"},{"id":"43662475","text":"Samuel Amirtham (19 August 1932 ‚Äì 26 September 2017)Mangalore Today, Kerala CSI Bishop Amirtham passes away, 28 September 2017. was an Indian Bishop and Old Testament Scholar who taught in Spiritual formation centres affiliated to Senate of Serampore College (University), India's firstSankar Ray in Business Line, 11 April 2008 Almost a century later, the charter was endorsed officially under the Bengal Govt Act IV of 1918.

In the 1980s, Amirtham was Director on the Programme for Theological Education of the World Council of Churches, Geneva where he substantially contributed to Ecumenism and returned to India in the 1990s when he became Bishop - in - South Kerala until he stepped down from the bishopric in 1997 on attaining superannuation. Studies After general studies leading to B. Sc. specializing in Physics from the Madras Christian College, Tambaram, Amirtham took up teaching at the Scott Christian College, Nagercoil until he evinced interest in Spirituality to take up the profession of Priesthood enrolling as a ministerial candidate under the Diocese of South Kerala, then under the bishopric of A. H. Legg who became his Spiritual Confessor, eventually leading to his enrollment at the Protestant Regional Theologiate in Bangalore. =Spiritual studies= In 1953, Amirtham joined the United Theological College, Bangalore, then under the Principalships of the College's first Old Testament Teacher, Max Hunter Harrison, ABCFM, and followed by the notable Systematic Theologian, Joshua Russell Chandran, CSI, studying for a three-year period ending in 1957 and was awarded the graduate degree of B.

Amirtham became the second student from India to have specialized in Old Testament in the University of Hamburg after C. D. Jathanna, CSI. Ecclesiastical Ministry =Servanthood= In 1957, after ordination by South Kerala Diocese led by A. H. Legg, Amirtham began serving parishes within its ecclesiastical jurisdiction until 1963 when he was reassigned to take up the role of Spiritual formator. Bishopric In 1990, when Isaiah Jesudason retired from the bishopric on attaining superannuation, Amirtham who had by that time returned to India contested the vacant bishopric and was elected as the fourth successor of A. H. Legg as Bishop - in - South Kerala and principally consecrated on 20 May 1990 at the Church of South India-Mateer Memorial Church, Trivandrum by Old Testament Scholar and Moderator of the Church of South India Synod, P.

Marathakavalli David, Church of South India, the first ordained Woman priest of the South Kerala Diocese was already ordained a year before Amirtham assumed the bishopric and Gender equality, to the extent possible, continued to be maintained by Amirtham together with his ministerial companions in the Church of South India Synod. In 1997, Amirtham vacated the bishopric on attaining superannuation resulting in Sede vacante that was filled up with the appointment of J. W. Gladstone as the successor of Amirtham. =Teaching= Spiritual formator In 1963, Amirtham became a Faculty Member at the United Theological College, Bangalore headed by Joshua Russell Chandran, CSI teaching along with notable faculty that included Stanley Jedidiah Samartha, CSI, V. C. Samuel, MOSC and others and also availed study leave for doctoral studies returning in 1969. Meanwhile, Ecumenism brought together two seminaries in Tamil Nadu leading to the formation of the Tamil Nadu Theological Seminary, Madurai in 1969 where Amirtham moved to and became the first Principal and continued to teach Old Testament and Biblical Hebrew. Old Testament scholarship and teaching reached a pinnacle in the 1970s with acknowledged Scholars at the helm in Spiritual formation centres all over the country with Gnana Robinson, CSI and Samuel Amirtham at the Tamil Nadu Theological Seminary, Madurai, C.

During the Second World War he worked as a cartographer for the Allies and was briefly employed as \\"General Eisenhower's personal map-maker\\". In 1983 he retired to the Isle of Wight, where he painted large watercolour landscapes of the island and continued to pursue his interest in photography. Biography =Early life= A true Cockney, born within the sound of Bow Bells in London, Weaver won a scholarship to the Hammersmith School of Art as a teenager but was unable to complete the course because the grant did not cover his living expenses. He began work in the cabinet-making department of Heal's, a furniture shop on Tottenham Court Road, but moved after two years to become a manuscript writer and calligrapher in another department. During this period, he was attending evening classes in art and was able to win a scholarship to the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London, where he became a teacher after he completed his course shortly before the Second World War. =Second World War= When the war began he joined the Ordnance Survey and was automatically enlisted in the Royal Engineers. In 1942, he became a cartographer for UNRRA (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) and worked on the Rhine Barrage project. He was seconded in 1944 to the American army as a \\"cartographer for the operations room at HQ in France\\". In September 1944 he moved to Versailles and worked for the Operational Analysis Team of G.5 SHAFF (Supreme Headquarters Allied Forces in France). It was during this part of his war-service that he was employed as General Eisenhower's map-maker. =Post-war= When the war ended, Weaver returned to UNRRA as a photo-reporter, covering \\"repatriation from concentration camps, welfare [and] tracing bureaux\\" and contributing public- relations stories to publications like Life, Time and Ebony. He was invalided out with nerve damage to his hands. After successful treatment, he began work with the designer Beverley Pick on industrial design, model-making and mural painting, creating exhibitions for companies like Ideal Home. In 1951 he and Pick worked on the \\"Iron and Steel Pavilion\\" at the Festival of Britain and created a giant three-dimensional mural \\"illustrating all the known methods of making steel\\". =Advertising, Wildlife Illustration and Publishing= In 1952 Weaver joined the advertising firm Artist Partners Limited as a still life artist. He created art for companies like Wilkinson Sword (the iconic crossed swords), Guinness, Danish Bacon, Heinz, Cadbury's Dairy Milk (a \\"glass-and-a- half of milk in every bar\\"), Rowntree's, Polo, and Fox's Mints. He created many memorable covers for books by authors like Alistair MacLean and Desmond Bagley, including the hanged Dutch doll for MacLean's Puppet on a Chain and a surreal juxtaposition of an aircraft and a Venus flytrap for Bagley's The Freedom Trap. He began to specialize in wildlife illustration and particularly fish, \\"producing all 300 illustrations\\" for The Fresh and Saltwater Fishes of the World (1976). He also illustrated wildlife stamps issued by the Falkland Islands and Trinidad and Tobago and produced a \\"British Fish\\" series for the Royal Mail.

All characters were introduced by the show's executive producer Dominic Treadwell- Collins. January saw the arrival of the year's first baby, Matthew Mitchell Cotton, son of Ronnie Mitchell and Charlie Cotton. The following month saw the show celebrate its 30th anniversary with a live week, which oversaw the live arrivals of Vincent Hubbard, and the second baby born in 2015, Pearl Fox- Hubbard, Vincent's daughter with Kim Fox-Hubbard. In March, Claudette Hubbard arrived as Donna Yates' foster mother and an acquaintance of Les Coker followed by Stan Carter's friend Cyril Bishop and Sharon Mitchell's aunt Margaret Midhurst, whilst Denise van Outen joined in April as Karin Smart. May saw the arrivals of June Whitfield as Sister Ruth, Mick and Linda Carter's son Ollie Carter, the year's third baby, Mo Harris' business associate Fat Elvis and Kush Kazemi's mother, Carmel. Paul Coker, the grandson of Les and Pam Coker, was introduced in June, as was Jade Green, the long-lost daughter of Shabnam Masood and Dean Wicks. After Kathy Sullivan's surprise return during the 30th anniversary in February, her husband Gavin Sullivan made his debut in August. September saw the arrivals of Max Branning's prosecution lawyer Hazel Warren and Louie Beale, the baby son of Lauren Branning and Peter Beale. In October, Elaine Peacock's toyboy lover Jason Adams was introduced, as well as first transgender character to be played by a transgender actor, Kyle Slater. December saw the birth of the year's fifth baby, Kush and Stacey Slater's son, Arthur Fowler. Matthew Mitchell Cotton Matthew Mitchell Cotton, portrayed by Zack Karbritz, is the son of Charlie Cotton (Declan Bennett) and Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack). He is born during the episode broadcast on 1 January 2015 on his parents' wedding day. Matthew is born after Ronnie is involved in a car accident. She is later placed in a coma, due to her injuries. Her sister, Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) and her boyfriend Aleks Shirovs (Kristian Kiehling) look after Matthew when Charlie refuses to see him, due to Ronnie's absence. Charlie's father, Nick Cotton (John Altman), takes Matthew from Roxy, attempting to force Charlie to see his son but Charlie refuses and gives him back to Roxy. Aleks suggests naming him Matthew after Nick's mother Dot Branning (June Brown) quotes from the Gospel of Matthew. Aleks's daughter Ineta Shirovs (Gledisa Arthur) becomes fed up with Aleks looking after Matthew and takes him to the bus stop, so they can go to the hospital. Charlie finds them and takes Matthew home. He and Roxy then share residency until Ronnie is discharged from hospital. When Matthew is nine months old, he stays with Ronnie when she and Charlie separate, although Charlie vows to fight for custody. When Charlie tells Roxy he wants to take Matthew to France, she tells Ronnie. Roxy goes with Charlie but he soon realises that Ronnie and Roxy are working together when he sees Roxy constantly looking at her phone and Fatboy tells him that Vincent has told Ronnie, so he decides to leave with Matthew alone. However, Ronnie arrives before Charlie can board his train, and convinces him not to make the same mistakes as Nick did. Charlie leaves Matthew with Ronnie. Four days later, Charlie returns to Walford, having been persuaded by Dot to fight for custody, but Ronnie turns nasty when Charlie threatens to tell the police that she murdered Carl White (Daniel Coonan) and says that she will never see Matthew again. She and former boyfriend, Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood), confront Charlie, who, in fear of his life, disappears. Matthew lives with Ronnie and her ex-husband, Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), when they reunite in March 2016 and Jack and Roxy's daughter, Amy Mitchell (Abbie Knowles) later moves in. Matthew is nearly hit by a car when Hannah Reynolds (Mia Jenkins) steps into the road whilst holding him, but is saved by Andy Flynn (Jack Derges), who pushes them out of the way of the approaching car. On the night that Ronnie and Jack remarry on New Year's Day 2017, Ronnie and Roxy die, leaving Matthew in Jack and Glenda Mitchell's (Glynis Barber) care when she moves in to help bring up the children. Glenda, Amy, Matthew and Jack's son Ricky Mitchell (Henri Charles) grow close but eventually she realises she is not what Jack, Amy, Ricky and Matthew need to get through Ronnie and Roxy's deaths so decides to leave Walford, while promising to remain a part of Amy and Matthew's lives. After taking Matthew to the garden centre in February 2017, Dot has an accident in her car due to her eye sight. She and Matthew are unharmed and taken home by the police. When Matthew goes missing, Jack's brother, Max Branning (Jake Wood), tells Jack that Matthew is at Dot's and when Jack goes to get him, Charlie answers the door, telling Jack they need to talk about Matthew. Jack reluctantly lets Charlie spend time with and look after Charlie. Charlie tells Dot that he has seen a solicitor about Matthew, who he plans to take back to Ireland with him. Dot tells Jack that Charlie is going to take Matthew back to Ireland and Charlie and Jack argue about it, with Jack later telling Charlie that he swore on Ronnie's grave to never leave Amy, Ricky and Matthew. When Charlie provokes Jack by saying Ronnie deserved to die, Jack punches him and Max tells Jack he may have lost his chances of keeping Matthew. Max learns that Jack still may get to keep Matthew despite the fight with Jack, so Max visits Charlie and beats him up to make it look like Jack did it. In April 2017, Jack is arrested and charged with assault. Dot attempts to mediate between Charlie and Jack, but they fail to come up with any solution and Jack plans to go on the run with Amy, Ricky and Matthew, but Dot tells Max and they talk him out of it. Charlie watches Honey Mitchell (Emma Barton) in the park with Amy, Ricky, Matthew and her children, Janet (Grace) and Will Mitchell (Freddie Phillips). Honey tells Charlie what a good father Jack is and Charlie informs Jack he has notified social services about applying for residency. Stacey Fowler (Lacey Turner) tells Jack he has to work things out with Charlie. Charlie's wife, Liz Cotton (Michelle Connolly) arrives in Albert Square in place of Charlie and tells Jack about her job and family, trying to assure him that Matthew would have a good life and that Amy and Ricky would be welcome to visit. Jack phones Liz to arrange a visit and agree rules for Matthew, letting Charlie have residency. Jack and Dot are heartbroken when Matthew leaves with Charlie and Liz. Charlie and Matthew return in December 2017 and Charlie explains to Jack the reason for their return is that Matthew refers to Jack as \\"dad\\". Charlie also tells Jack that he just wanted contact and that having Matthew full-time was not part of the \\"plan\\", so Jack demands to know what the plan was. Charlie tells Jack that Max set him up. After initially denying it, Max admits that he was responsible for Matthew being taken away as payback and Jack throws Max out. Reporters for the Daily Mirror called Matthew an \\"unfortunate boy\\". Vincent Hubbard Vincent Hubbard, played by Richard Blackwood, made his first screen appearance on 17 February 2015. The character and casting was announced on 17 January 2015. Blackwood praised bosses for the character of Vincent, stating he knew that his portrayal would surprise viewers given his comedy background. He is described on the BBC website as: 'a smooth operator, whose easy charm and quick wittedness covers a steely, ruthless streak and a reputation as a bit of a bad boy.' The BBC then go on to also state that Vincent 'believes himself to be the \\"main man\\" in the room, and knows how to play people to his advantage.' Pearl Fox-Hubbard Pearl Fox-Hubbard, played by Arayah, is the daughter of Kim Fox-Hubbard (Tameka Empson) and Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood). She was born during the live episode broadcast on 19 February 2015 during the show's 30th anniversary celebrations. Pearl is born in the ladies' toilets of The Queen Victoria pub after Kim goes into labour two months early. She is placed in intensive care following her birth and Kim is told that she has an infection. A week later, Kim has Pearl christened with the middle names Denise and Patrice, named after her sister Denise Fox (Diane Parish), and Denise's surrogate father Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker) respectively, and is told that she has recovered from her infection. In March 2015, Kim is able to bring Pearl home to Albert Square. Eventually, Kim and Vincent reunite and Vincent moves in so he can become a proper father to Pearl. Kim and Vincent enter her in a baby contest, which she wins after Vincent pays the competition manager. As Vincent's feud with Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) escalates in December 2015, Phil kidnaps Pearl while she is being looked after by Vincent's foster sister Donna Yates (Lisa Hammond), but is safely being looked after by Honey Mitchell (Emma Barton). Gary Gillatt from Inside Soap observed that Pearl's name was his favourite \\"subtle touch\\" for the show's birthday celebrations, as Pearl is the gift traditionally given on a 30th anniversary. While Heat's Kay Ribeiro was disappointed that Kim did not name her after Queen Victoria, considering where she was born. Ribeiro also thought that Kim would have chosen \\"something suitably flashy and fabulous but chose the surprisingly demure name, Pearl. Oh well, each to their own.\\" Katy Brent from the Daily Mirror commented \\"You'd think that being born in Albert Square, in the Vic, on the 30th anniversary of the show, would be a good omen for any baby. Sadly, that doesn't seem to be the case for baby Pearl, whose little life is hanging in the balance.\\" Brent hoped Pearl would come through her illness, so there would be a happy outcome for a change. Claudette Hubbard Ellen Thomas appeared in three separate roles before being cast as Claudette in 2015. Claudette Hubbard, played by Ellen Thomas, made her first screen appearance on 12 March 2015. Thomas' casting was announced on 1 March 2015. The role of Claudette marks Thomas' fourth time on EastEnders, she previously appeared as Pearl Chadwick (1990), Estella Hulton in 2002 and Grace Olubunmi (2010‚Äì2011). Of Thomas and her character, executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins commented \\"Ellen Thomas belongs on EastEnders. Albert Square now has a new steely matriarch ‚Äì with a few twisted secrets hidden behind her beaming smile.\\" David Brown from the Radio Times added that Claudette had links to established regular characters and would be \\"a tough-talking resident of Albert Square\\". Thomas revealed that Claudette's family would be introduced to the square, saying: \\"Claudette is a foster mother, she's fostered children for the last 30 years. She's fostered the kind of children nobody else wants ‚Äì tough cookies.\\" She stated that it was a \\"brilliant opportunity to bring new characters in\\". Laura-Jane Tyler from Inside Soap admitted to being a little scared by \\"steely\\" Claudette and said she made Vincent \\"look like a pussycat.\\" Tyler also hoped that Claudette would turn out to be a big crime boss. On 13 September 2016, it was confirmed that Ellen Thomas would depart as Claudette and would leave the show in the coming weeks after being axed by the new executive producer, Sean O'Connor. =Storylines= Claudette is shown to be having what looks like an affair with Les Coker (Roger Sloman) when he visits her at a caf√© and gives her a necklace. Later that night, while he and his wife, Pam Coker (Lin Blakley), are celebrating their wedding anniversary, Les gets a text from Claudette, thanking him for her necklace. Claudette and Les meet again a week later at the park, with Claudette later arriving for her foster daughter Donna Yates' (Lisa Hammond) birthday celebrations as arranged by Pam. It's revealed that she knows Les and Pam from when the latter worked as a social worker and placed Donna in Claudette's care. Weeks later, it's revealed that both Claudette and Les are in Gran Canaria on business. Donna ironically suggests that the two should meet up. Claudette reappears when her son Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood) introduces her to her new granddaughter Pearl, and his wife Kim Fox-Hubbard (Tameka Empson). Claudette is angry that she had to wait so long to meet Pearl. She is hostile towards Kim, her sister Denise Fox (Diane Parish) and their family friend Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker), as she believes that they have stolen Vincent from her. When Les' grandson, Paul Coker (Jonny Labey), arrives in Walford, he reveals that he knows Les and Claudette are having an affair. Les decides to stop meeting Claudette but she is not willing to conclude it and states that she will make it difficult for him to exit. When Paul tells Vincent that Claudette and Les are having an affair, Vincent confronts her about it after finding identical postcards from Gran Canaria in both her and Les's houses, but agrees not to say anything to Pam. Les attempts to dissuade Claudette from coming to the Coker and Sons centenary party but she goes anyway and tells Les that Vincent is aware of their meetings. Meanwhile, at home, Paul tells Pam about the affair. Claudette later realises that Pam knows while seeing her freak out at her face with her and Les in the newspaper photo. She makes plans to have dinner with Les, declining Pam's invitation to dinner on the way there. When Pam notes how Claudette used exactly the same words as Les did, Claudette sends Les home. He accidentally leaves his tie at her house. Claudette, who knows the Mitchells, finds Vincent has been beaten by Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) and vows revenge on Phil. When Pam visits Claudette, she finds Les's tie, but after he and Claudette give conflicting explanations on this, Pam leaves to stay with her sister. Les becomes very distraught at her departure, and Claudette urges him to tell Pam the truth, just as Pam returns and walks in on them together. Shortly after Claudette leaves the house, Pam urges Les to end the affair or their marriage is over. Two months later, Les visits Claudette for comfort after Pam refuses to speak to him on their deceased son's birthday. Two days later, he calls Claudette, telling her he cannot stop thinking about her, and later makes an excuse to Pam to go and be with Claudette again. He is then caught at Claudette's house in his underwear by Donna, who concludes they are having an affair, though Claudette tries to explain it is not what she thinks. Donna tells Pam, who goes to Claudette's house and sets about destroying gifts from Les until Claudette says the presents are not hers, and Pam should ask Les about Christine. When Pam asks Les, he reveals that Christine is his secret feminine alter ego, and he likes wearing women's clothes, and that Claudette has been supporting this secret. Claudette later tells Pam that Les persuaded her not to reveal his secret and encourages Pam to speak to Les about it. The next day, she helps Pam and Les prepare for their \\"meeting\\" with Christine, and tells Pam that \\"seeing\\" Christine for the first time will be easier than she thinks. Claudette is later annoyed when Vincent has sex with a married Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack), whom he had dated before, and advises them to work on their own marriages. She moves in with Vincent, Kim and Pearl when he buys a large house on Albert Square. Claudette starts working in The Albert and meets Phil's aunt, Sal (Anna Karen), who is visiting the Mitchells. Sal reveals that Claudette used to work at a bar nearby and has known the Mitchell family for decades. Sal threatens to reveal secrets about Claudette, so she asks Vincent to speed up with his plan to take down the Mitchells. It is revealed that Claudette's husband, Henry, was an associate of Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), Ted Hills (Brian Croucher), Gavin Sullivan (Paul Nicholas) and Eric Mitchell, Phil's father. Vincent was told by Claudette that Henry was killed by Eric 34 years previously on Christmas Eve after a confrontation when Vincent was a child. A drunken Phil kidnaps Pearl which leads to an altercation between Vincent and Phil. Vincent says that Eric killed his father but Phil says Henry just left Walford. The feud between the Mitchells and Hubbards leads to the death of innocent Fatboy (Ricky Norwood), so Vincent tells Claudette that their feud killed him and they should end it, but this infuriates Claudette who then compares him to his father and accidentally lets slip that Henry did not die when she said he did. When Ronnie's mother Glenda Mitchell (Glynis Barber) makes a brief visit, she recognises Claudette and Vincent, and later tells Ronnie that Eric did not kill Henry because he was drunk that night and did not leave the house. Ronnie then blackmails Claudette with the information, so Claudette tells Vincent to end the feud as it cannot bring back Henry or Fatboy. Claudette and Patrick flirt with each other and eventually begin dating; however it is hampered by Denise's disapproval. Claudette and Kim's rivalry intensifies at Pearl's first birthday party, and when Claudette's foster son Linford Short (Leon Lopez) announces that he and Vincent have entered Claudette into the Pride of Walford Awards and she is a finalist, a jealous Kim jumps on Pearl's bouncy castle in an attempt to take attention from Claudette, which Claudette punctures in retaliation. Later that day, Gavin meets Claudette and blackmails her, saying he wants money to stop him revealing a secret from her past. She fails to get money from Les or Vincent, so she meets Gavin at her home and tries to pay him off with sex. However, he says that it is worthless as she used to be promiscuous, and asks how she killed Henry, so Claudette strikes him over the head with a candelabra. Vincent then arrives, and she lies about the circumstances, but when Gavin escapes, her lies are revealed and Vincent works out he was blackmailing her and she killed Henry. When she insults Henry, Vincent chokes Claudette, as Patrick arrives and stops him. Vincent reveals to Patrick that Claudette killed Henry, and as Patrick tries to call the police, Claudette tries to snatch the phone off him, but falls down the basement stairs, hitting her head on a brick. Patrick leaves to get help but when he returns, Vincent has buried Claudette underneath the basement and tells Patrick to forget it happened or they will both be arrested for murder. However, unknown to Vincent and Patrick, it is revealed Claudette is alive when she arrives in hospital brought in by paramedics after she was found by the side of a road. Patrick later sees Claudette. Realising that she is alive, he tells Vincent, who soon realises the truth up. When Vincent goes to Donna's home, Donna reveals Claudette is with her and has told her what Vincent did to her. Donna refuses to believe that Claudette killed Henry, so Vincent reveals that Claudette killed Fatboy. Donna is distraught at being lied to and asks Vincent and Claudette to leave, but Patrick arrives and confirms that Claudette killed Henry. Claudette insists Henry's death was an accident and threatens to show the police her neck bruises if Patrick calls the police on her, but Donna sees past this, saying that Claudette's fostering her was just an attempt to lessen Claudette's guilt. Vincent tells Claudette to leave Walford for good or he will tell Gavin where she is. Claudette visits Pearl privately and says goodbye to her, promising that she will come back soon. At the Pride of Walford Awards a few months later, Donna accepts an award on her mums behalf saying how she wasn't alone when Claudette took her in but now she's alone again. However, Claudette was seen secretly watching behind the door but decided not to come in. Claudette tries to visit Donna in Bridge Street Market but notices her former enemy Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor) who scowls at her, so Claudette walks away. Claudette supports Les and Pam when their grandson, Paul, dies following a homophobic attack and she learns that Babe Smith (Annette Badland) has been blackmailing them over Les' cross-dressing. Claudette threatens Babe, and their argument is witnessed by Babe's relative Linda Carter (Kellie Bright). When Babe is locked in The Queen Victoria's freezer store, Linda accuses Claudette, but Patrick states she was with him, revealing their relationship to Vincent and Donna. However, when Patrick states that Claudette left the house at about the time Babe was attacked, she ends their relationship, saying he does not trust her. Claudette also exposes Babe's blackmail to Linda and her husband Mick Carter (Danny Dyer). It transpires that the real culprit is Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald). She later briefly reconciles with Patrick but her jealousy over his closeness with Dot Branning (June Brown) causes him to publicly break up with her. Humiliated and enraged, she asks Vincent to \\"take care\\" of Patrick for hurting her but he and Donna make her see the error of her ways and encourage her to stay with Linford to clear her head. On her way out of Walford, she meets Patrick and tells him he was never good enough for her but Patrick says that Claudette doesn't think she's good enough for anyone. Cyril Bishop Cyril Bishop, played by Andrew Sachs, appears on 18 and 19 March 2015. He is a cancer patient who Stan Carter (Timothy West) befriends when he is admitted to hospital. Cyril is in a bed on the same ward as Stan. He is visited by his family, which Stan witnesses, having told his own family not to come and see him. He talks to Stan about his love of Carry On films and they share their thoughts on their situations. Their relationship turns sour when Stan realises that his family do not care for him like Cyril's family do. Later in the day, Cyril dies during an argument between Babe Smith (Annette Badland) and Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell). Sachs' role as Stan's hospital roommate was revealed on 10 March 2015, when it was said he would be part of Stan's exit storyline. Duncan Lindsay from the Metro said, \\"Stan becomes infuriated by Cyril's presence but something tells us that before the inevitable heartbreaking finale of the tale, the pair could become good friends a la Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson in The Bucket List\\", and said that Sachs' appearance in the show is \\"a treat for viewers\\". Margaret Midhurst Margaret Midhurst, played by Jan Harvey, appears in nine episodes between 24 March 2015 and 8 July 2016. Margaret is the solicitor who handled Sharon Mitchell's (Letitia Dean) adoption. Sharon visits Margaret in a bid to find her biological father. Margaret tells Sharon that all the paperwork in connection with her case had been destroyed. She later visits Sharon at home after Sharon calls her, and asks Margaret if her adoptive father, Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), was her biological father, fearing that her son Dennis Rickman (Harry Hickles/Blue Landau) could be a product of incest.

Whilst moving in, Masood returns unexpectedly, forcing them to share the house as she has already signed the contract. When Belinda Peacock (Carli Norris) begins a relationship with Masood, she doubts her motives and accuses her of only being with Masood for financial purposes, to save her debt ridden salon, \\"Elysium\\".

After cooking a final meal for his family, Kyle leaves. =Development and reception= It was announced in March 2015 that the show was planning to cast a transgender actor to play a transgender character. Following this announcement, a number of transgender actors put themselves forward for the role, and EastEnders producers undertook workshops and worked alongside groups within the transgender community. The character and casting was confirmed on 8 October 2015. Of his casting, Millington said, \\"I am extremely excited to be joining EastEnders. I can honestly say that I have now fulfilled my two biggest dreams‚Äîto be living my life as a man and to be an actor. I cannot wait to really get stuck in with filming and I look forward to seeing what is in store for my character.\\" Executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins confirmed it had been his intention to cast a trans actor in a trans role, saying, \\"we have been so careful to ensure that we cast the right actor for the part\\", and said, \\"In Riley, we have found not just a talented actor but also an inspirational young man whose warmth immediately comes through the screen. And this isn't about tokenism. Alex Lamb and his story team have worked with Riley to create an EastEnders character who is fresh and relatable‚Äîbut also comes with his own stock of secrets and is going to be thrown right into one of our biggest stories for the end of the year. I hope that the audience will take Riley and his character to their hearts as quickly as everyone here at EastEnders has done.\\" This was reported as the first time a transgender actor has played the role of a transgender character in a British soap opera, though Annie Wallace was cast at around the same time in Hollyoaks as Sally St. Claire, while transgender actress Rebecca Root had a minor role in Hollyoaks earlier in 2015. In September 2016, Millington was announced as one of several cast members that had been axed by new executive producer, Sean O'Connor. Of his departure, Millington stated: \\"When I landed a 6 month contract at EastEnders, it was a dream come true. For that to be extended to a year was something that I never expected. However, as the time comes for Kyle to depart Walford I am looking forward to taking on new roles and who knows, Kyle may find his way back to Walford one day.\\" Kyle's arrival in the show was nominated for the \\"media moment\\" award at the 2016 British LGBT Awards. Arthur Slater Arthur Brian Slater (previously Fowler) is the son of Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) and Kush Kazemi (Davood Ghadami). His first appearance is in the episode broadcast on 24 December 2015, in which his birth is depicted. It was revealed in a behind the scenes documentary, Stacey Branning ‚Äì On the Edge, that 16 babies were licensed to play Arthur for filming of Stacey's illness storyline, due to legal boundaries. From 2016, Arthur is played by Hunter Bell. Arthur is the result of a one-night stand between Stacey and Kush, before she starts dating Martin Fowler (James Bye), and while Kush is on a break from his relationship with Shabnam Masood (Rakhee Thakrar). When Stacey finds out that she is pregnant, she tells Martin that he is the father but hides her baby scans from him. She later admits to her best friend, Shabnam, that Martin is not the father. On Shabnam and Kush's wedding day, Kush confronts Stacey and she tells him that she believes he could be the father. Arthur is born at Stacey's daughter, Lily Branning's (Aine Garvey) nativity play. Martin names the baby after his father, Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher), and Stacey's father, Brian Slater. After noticing how Kush is with Arthur, Shabnam asks Stacey if he is the father, but Stacey denies this. Stacey starts to fear for Arthur's safety, believing him to be the son of God, and climbs onto the roof of The Queen Victoria pub with Arthur, where she believes they are closer to God. Martin talks her down and she is hospitalised and diagnosed with postpartum psychosis. Arthur is left in Martin's care, though he regularly takes him to visit her. Due to stress of looking after Arthur and Lily and trying to find Stacey a place at a mother and baby unit, Martin crashes his van with Arthur in the vehicle. Arthur is unharmed. Martin finds a mother and baby unit, so Arthur moves in there to be with Stacey. Martin discovers that Kush is Arthur's father from a letter Stacey wrote, so leaves for America. When he returns, he publicly reveals that Kush is Arthur's father. During a home visit, Stacey tells Kush he can be involved in Arthur's life, but Kush realises he is a bad role model and decides that Arthur is better off without him. Stacey and Martin decide to keep their distance from the Kazemis following Arthur's step-sister, Bex Fowler (Jasmine Armfield), being bullied. Arthur's grandmother, Carmel Kazemi (Bonnie Langford), is hurt with being excluded from Arthur's life and Stacey and Carmel fight when Carmel makes remarks about Stacey's mental health. However, Max Branning (Jake Wood), Stacey's former father-in-law, persuades Stacey to let Carmel be involved with Arthur. Stacey allows Kush to look after Arthur, and Martin and Kush make up with each other. Kush is delighted when Martin tells him that he can look after Arthur for a night each week. When Kush suffers a cardiac arrest, he is diagnosed with Brugada Syndrome, which is hereditary. Stacey worries that Arthur could die and tells Bex about the possibility of Arthur having the syndrome. A doctor assures Stacey that the chance of Arthur displaying symptoms at a young age is small. Arthur undergoes an ECG and Stacey, Kush and Martin are told by the specialist that Arthur is at high risk at having the condition, but cannot have an operation or tests like Kush due to his age. Stacey is anxious that Arthur having a cardiac arrest is a sign of the condition and his parents are told about equipment that is not available on the NHS. Stacey is angry with Martin that he asked Kush for money to buy the equipment. Stacey and Martin panic when Arthur will not wake up, and when they receive Arthur's medical records at the hospital, Stacey and Martin are told that Arthur has swallowed Stacey's bipolar medication. Carmel is horrified when she finds bruises on Arthur's arms, and expresses her concerns to Kush that Stacey is unwell, while Stacey tells Michelle Fowler (Jenna Russell) that he gained the bruises in hospital. However, Lily tells Carmel that Stacey was responsible, so Carmel reports it to social services, but tries to retract what she said after realising it was a mistake. Social services visit Stacey and Martin and tell them they received a report about Arthur. Arthur and Lily are placed in Carmel's care until social services have investigated. Arthur is looked over by a doctor, who has no concerns and Stacey and Martin can have Arthur and Lily back. Social worker Fiona Payne (Sandra James-Young) tells Stacey and Martin she will be conducting further home visits. After Stacey cheats on Martin with Max, Stacey leaves Walford with Arthur, Lily and his half-sister, Hope Fowler. Stacey returns a few weeks later and when Stacey is out, Martin accuses her of being with Max, so Stacey decides Martin should leave; he is hurt Stacey does not regard Arthur and Lily as his children, but he angrily throws her out and exposes her affair. Martin keeps the children inside, away from Stacey, though the pair support each other briefly when Lily holds Hope by the upstairs window, asking for Stacey. Martin rejects Stacey when she says the children need her and he decides he will not let Stacey near the children. Martin decides to go for custody and when Kush and Carmel find out, Carmel wants Kush to get custody of Arthur, but Kush attempts to get them to resolve their problems. Martin sees Stacey, offering her contact, but Stacey contacts Lily's father, Ryan Malloy (Neil McDermott), to help her and a locksmith changes the locks, devastating Martin. An unknown relative of Arthur's, Hayley Slater (Katie Jarvis), distracts Martin when he is looking after Hope and after finding out who she is, Stacey contacts Hayley again and when Martin is looking after Hope and Arthur, Hayley encourages Martin to take the children to a stay and play, buy them some tea and eat ice cream, disobeying Stacey's instructions. Hayley pretends to defend Martin in front of Stacey when she collects Arthur and Hope with police presence due to Martin not returning them.

His works were confined to Northwest England. Owen is best known for his collaboration with William Lever in the creation of the soap-making factory and associated model village at Port Sunlight in the Wirral Peninsula (then in Cheshire, now in Merseyside). Here he designed the factory, many of the workers' houses, public buildings and the church. Later Owen was joined by his son, Segar, as a partner. On his own, or in partnership, Owen designed houses, churches, banks, public houses, an infirmary, a school, and a concert hall. Biography and career William Owen was born in Latchford, Warrington. He trained as an architect under John Lowe in Manchester, becoming his assistant, and later was assistant to James Radford. He then travelled in Europe before establishing a practice in Warrington in 1869. He was joined in partnership by his eldest son, Segar, in 1898. The partnership also had an office in Manchester. Owen's work was confined to Northwest England. His more notable designs include churches in Altrincham, Greater Manchester, and Warrington, buildings for Parr's Bank in Southport, Merseyside, and Wigan, Greater Manchester, and the Parr Hall, a concert hall in Warrington. The partnership were architects to the Greenall Whitley Brewery Company, and built public houses for them in Warrington, and Stockton Heath, Cheshire. Port Sunlight In 1886 William Lever established a soap factory in Warrington. The site proved to be too small for his plans and the rent was too high. Lever and Owen together travelled around the area looking for a larger and more suitable site. They settled on a marshy area near Bromborough Pool in the Wirral Peninsula. Here they planned to build a larger factory and the model village that was to become Port Sunlight. Building the factory began in 1888, followed by the first houses in the next year, the first 28 of which were designed by Owen. Owen then went on to design more houses and other buildings in the village, initially on his own, and later with Segar. In the village, on his own or with his son, Owen also designed public buildings. These include Gladstone Hall (1891), originally a men's dining and recreation room and later the Gladstone Theatre, Hulme Hall (1901), a women's dining hall, and Christ Church (1902‚Äì04), a Congregational church.

The show is a remake of the British series by the same name and was hosted by Fran Walfish, a relationship therapist, and also starred sex therapist Dr. Chris Donaghue, Florida pastor Dr. Yvonne Capehart, and comedian Danielle Stewart, who provided backstage commentary. WE tv cancelled the series in April 2015 due to poor ratings and only five of the first season's nine episodes were aired. WE tv has expressed interest in bringing the show back in a reformatted version. Synopsis Several couples are brought into the studio, some of whom are experiencing relationship problems. The couple will enter a sound-proofed box on the stage, where they will have sexual intercourse. During this time the show's hosts will comment on sex, the couple, and the chances that the couple's relationship will survive. After a certain amount of time the couple exits the box and rejoins the hosts on stage, where they answer questions about themselves and their sex life, based on the theory that the couple will be more likely to be more open and honest in their answers after having intercourse. Production WE tv first announced plans to create a pilot episode for a North American version of Sex Box in March 2014 and in August of the same year, stated that they had ordered a nine episode season for the series. WE tv‚Äôs President Mark Juris commented on the show's concept, which he found \\"one of the most unique and compelling show concepts we‚Äôve ever seen\\".

Listening to a sex therapist, a relationship psychotherapist, and a pastor do their best American Idol impressions, break down the myriad problems couples are having during the act, will only make people more apprehensive when it comes to having sex. And what business does a pastor have lecturing people about his or her sexual performance? Religion is one of the driving forces behind this country‚Äôs prudishness to begin with.\\" Reception The Washington Post reviewed an early episode of the show, writing \\"This show is therapeutic in so many ways. First, because the experts encourage the couple to talk to each other about their sexual problems, and that can‚Äôt be bad, right? And second, because the revelation that a 7.9 (the equivalent of a C-plus) is an acceptable sex grade is great news for sexual underachievers everywhere!\\" References External links Category:2010s American reality television series Category:2015 American television series debuts Category:2015 American television series endings Category:English-language television shows Category:American television series based on British television series ","title":"Sex Box (American TV series)"},{"id":"43662661","text":"Gani is both a given name and a surname.

Its altar is topped with a small dais, surrounded by two scenes: on the left, a haloed lamb, symbolizing the Jesus Christ, lies on a promontory from which a spring sours and where two deers - the faithful - are drinking; right, two doves drinking from the same cup, symbolizing sweetness and Christian virtues. frameless In front of the altar, the pavement is decorated with neo-Romanesque pattern, and bears the inscription \\"Pavete Sanctuarium meum ad\\", i.e. : \\"Be fearful at the approach of my sanctuary\\" Just above, a winged dragon twists inside three circles. The initials of the couple at the origin of the chapel, Fortun√© and Thomasine Broquier are drawn on each side of the altar. Fortun√© Broquier, a lawyer in Marseille, close to senior officials of the Crown, acquired the property in 1857. He is also shown at the bottom of a pillar in the back of the chapel. Thomasine and Fortun√© Broquier Dedication to saint Catherine of Sienna Saint Joseph stained glass window The location being 30 minutes away from the main town church Fortun√© Broquier proposed to Church authorities to build a chapel so that he and his guests can benefit from the celebration of masses. Pope Pius IX himself gave his blessing to the Broquier couple, revealing the influence of the family. The pope sent them three letters between 1874 and 1877: they detail the organization of masses, indicate what furniture to adopt and mention the possibility of hosting Dominicans. Fortun√© Broquier was closely tied to this monastic order - which also guide the dedication of the chapel to Saint Catherine of Siena, as recalled on a plaster cast Masses held at La Royante experienced a real success with the locals, so much so that religious authorities worried and pope Pius IX had to reiterate his support for the Broquier family in a third and last letter. These three letters were used to date the building of the chapel in the early 1870s. The dating is confirmed by the striking stylistic kinship between certain elements of the chapel and the church of Saint-Barth√©lemy in Marseille, built in 1872 by Gaullier on a design by up by Verdier and Condamin. The two buildings share very similar altar iconography, similar single nave, apse and ribbed vault, and finally a colored cement pavement.

It is situated in Nashik District in the Indian state of Maharashtra. Trimbakeshwar Shiva Temple is located near this place. The origin of the sacred Godavari river is near Trimbak. It flows for , first eastwards across the Deccan Plateau then turns southeast, entering the West Godavari district and East Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh, until it splits into two watercourses that widen into a large river delta and flow into the Bay of Bengal. Location Brahmagiri, the hill (giri) of Lord Brahma, appear in many mythological and legendary documents. Legend says that the saint Gautam and his wife Ahalya resided on this hill. Saint Gautam worshiped Lord Shiva to bring Ganga in this hill. This river is known as River Gautami in the Brahmagiri hills. The undulated terrains of Brahmagiri are challenging spots for adventurous travels like nature walk and trekking. There are many trekking trails nestled among the woody trees. The ranges are rich with natural attractions and scenic spots. Brahmagiri hill is considered as a huge form of Lord Shiva and hence the mountain climbing was considered as a sin at that time. In the year 1908, Seth Lalchand Jashodanand Bhambhani of Karachi and Seth Ganeshdas built 500 steps of stone at a cost of Rs. 40,000. This has facilitated easy access to Brahmagiri. The water flows in three directions on the mountain. The one flowing towards east becomes Godavari river, one flowing towards the south is Vaitarna river and the one flowing towards the west is called the west-flowing Ganga and meets Godavari near Chakra Tirth. River Ahilya meets Godavari in front of the Trimbakeshwar temple. Childless families worship at the Ahilya sangam and it is believed that they do get a child. The first peak of Sahyadri is called Brahmadri. The story associated with this is that Shankar was pleased with Brahmadev and said \\"I shall be known by your name\\". Hence it is called as Brahmagiri. The mountain is 1800 feet high. Its height from sea level is 4248 feet. Five peaks of this mountain are called Sadyo-Jata, Vamdev, Aghora, Ishana and Tat-Purusha and are considered as five mouths of the Lord Shiva and they are worshipped.Brahmagiri mountain at Shri Trimbakeshwar Temple, Nasik, Maharashtra Brahmagiri hill Brahmagiri (1298 meters) is to the west of trimbakeshwar and this fort offers a commanding view of the Jawhar Mokhada region of Thane district. Trimbakeshwar itself is a place of worship because it is one of the 12 Jyotirlingas of Lord Shiva. From Trimbakeshwar, through regular steps, Ganga dwar is reached and the Gorakshanath cave which is end of Trimbakeshwar. Now again while climbing down, there is a road going towards Brahmagiri towards right. Following this route one reaches the carved steps in the rocks. The steps are very good even in the recent times. They were blown off by Britishers in 1818 but later on, they were rebuilt somewhere before India gained independence. From the base village, Brahmagiri is around 450 to 500 meters elevated From base village, it takes 45 minutes to see Ganga dwar, the Gorakshanath caves and 108 Swayambhu Mahadev caves and in the halfway while descending, the road towards Brahmagiri takes you till the top in around 45 minutes and almost 2 hours to see the fort completely. There are 2 temples on this fort the place which is believed to be the origin point of Godavari river. From here, the river flows till Ganga dwar and then towards Kushavart teerth in Trimbakeshwar village. One can reach this place by an ascent of about 750 steps made on concrete. There is a shrine dedicated to Goddess Ganga. The river appears here as coming out from the mouth of Nandi. Kolambika Devi temple and a group of 108 shivalings are seen nearby.

It was created in 1983. The access to the park is from boulevard de la Bastille. The nearest metro station is Bastille. History The Arsenal was established by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1806, between the Place de la Bastille and the Seine. The Canal Saint-Martin was not finished until 1825. It was 4,5 kilometers long, and linked the Seine with the basin of La Vilette.Jarrass√©, Dominque, Grammaire des jardins Parisiens, p. 193-195. In the 1970s a proposal was put forward by the Paris municipal council to cover the canal completely with a four-lane highway. The project was rejected after public protests.Dictionnaire Historique de Paris p. 109-110. The section of canal between Place de la Bastille and the Seine became instead a harbor for private yachts and excursion boats. In 1983 the city decided to develop the edge of the canal into a garden a promenade. The designers of the park were architect Philippe Mathieux and landscape architect Serge Eyzat. Jarrass√©, Dominique, Grammaire des jardins Parisiens, p. 229. Features of the park The park is 544 meters long, and occupies 1.4 hectares along the east bank of the canal between the river and the Place de la Bastille. The main features of the park are an alley sheltered by maple and willow trees, and a pergola covered with roses and other plants. The park also has several works of sculpture from the period of the 1920s and 1930s taken from the city's reserves, including a bronze statue of the Diane by Henry Arnold (1879-1945). The park also has a restaurant whose architecture is inspired by garden greenhouses.Jarrass√©, Dominique, Grammaire des jardins Parisiens, p. 229.

Description It is situated approximately north east of Lyndhurst and south west of Innamincka. The MacDonnell River traverses the property and flows into Lake Blanche. A large waterhole on Mount Hopeless Creek is also situated to the east and once operated as an outstation. The Strzelecki Creek also flows through the property all the way to the northern Flinders Ranges are found to the south of the station. The first European to visit to the area was Benjamin Babbage in 1856 who named the area after Governor McDonnell's wife. George Goyder then surveyed the area in 1857 and John Baker then took up a lease and stocked the property with cattle in 1858. Augustus Charles Gregory and his party arrived at Blanchewater in 1858 trekking in from the north east from what was believed to be trackless desert and impassable salt lakes. The group had followed the Strzelecki Creek proving it to be the best way to travel through the interior from the Pacific to the Southern Ocean. Harry Redford and his accomplices George Dewdney and William Rooke stole between 600 and 1,000 cattle from Bowen Downs Station in Queensland. The men then overlanded the stock approximately down Cooper Creek to outback South Australia. The trek took over three months and the men sold the stock for ¬£5000 to Blanchewater Station. Station employees tracked the herd and Redford was eventually arrested for the crime. Baker died in 1872 and the executors of the estate sold the property stocked with 1,000 horses and 2,5000 cattle to E. M. Bagot. Blanchewater and the other five properties of Bakers including Wirrabunna, Peninsula and Lake Albert sold for a total of ¬£130,000, The property was owned by Thomas Elder in 1874.

It is known also by the synonyms Akido (\\"two-bunched sprout\\"), Achido, Didd Mtevana, Didmtevana, and Didtevano. There are no written sources regarding the origin of Mtevandidi. Botanical and agricultural features suggest that this variety is indigenous to Georgia. History Mtevandidi is a productive grapevine variety mostly used for making wine in Guria, particularly in its eastern part; wherein vines were cultivated as high-formations, which even if neglected can maintain growth, development, and quality. Since the second half of the 19th century, high vineyards of Mtevandidi were massively destroyed due to the spread of fungal diseases and phylloxera, . By the initiative of local residents, concerned with viticulture issues, in Chokhatauri and Makharadze (the villages Kalagoni, Dablatsikhe, and Baghdati) in 1905 and 1906 grafts of Mtevandidi were cultivated as low vineyards, some of them still in existence even today, and characterized with high productivity and normal development of vines. The modern area of Mtevandidi cultivation is limited, even though it is characterized with high quality production.  Description For the young shoot, the cone of growth is white in the young slightly reddish on one side and covered with thick felt-like white coating. The opened first leaf is covered with white-reddish down, on the underside is covered with a thick-felt like coating, the petiole is also covered with a reddish white coating; the following second and third leaves are lightly coated on the topside, which is grayish and downy. On the underside is a thick felt-like coating; the petiole of the third and fourth leaves is bright-green; violet on one side and slightly covered with hairy down. The young shoot is bright green on one side, while on another ‚Äì violet, and lightly covered with a grayish hairy coating that becomes more extensive to the tip of a shoot. The mature one year sprout is middle sized, bright reddish-brown with dark lines; the axils are darker in color and are distanced by 10‚Äì18 cm. The well-developed leaf is bright green, slightly yellowish, middle-sized or large; is roundish or slightly oval, unnoticeably lobed, about 17.9‚Äì21.5 cm long and 18.6‚Äì19.6 cm wide. The incision of the petiole is lyre-like, consisting of three veins, having rounded or sharp basis. Elliptical incisions can also be found. The upper incision of a leaf is open and slightly cut, with sharp or rounded basis. The lower incision is opened and cut insignificantly The leaf is three-lobed; without secondary margins. The margin of a tip to the blade creates an obtuse angle. The teeth of tips are triangular, slightly convex-sided and it is possible to find roundish triangular or saw-like teeth. The secondary teeth are similar to the major teeth. The leaf takes a similar curved shape to a funnel. The surface of a leaf is smooth or wrinkled like a net. The underside is covered with a short-downy coating. The major veins are lightly coated and are bright green. The proportion of the pedicel to the major vein is 0.9‚Äì1.0, and is bare and bright green. The flower is hermaphroditic with normally- developed pistil and stamens. There are about five or rarely four stamens in a flower, which are as long as the pistil. The number of flowers in an inflorescence is 300‚Äì500. The pedicel of a bunch equals 8‚Äì12 cm; the bunch is about 15‚Äì17 cm long and 11‚Äì14 cm wide. There are about 100‚Äì130 berries on a bunch; the size of an average bunch is 12‚Äì14 cm long and 9‚Äì12 cm wide, consisting of 80‚Äì90 berries. The bunch is thin, unstructured, wide cone-shaped or branched, or quite dense; the pedicel of a bunch is woody nearly up to the middle and bright red-brownish, while its remaining part, including scion, is grass-like and bright green. The pedicel of a berry, including the receptacle, equals 5‚Äì9 mm, and is green. The receptacle is slightly yellowish, with abright green tone, is wrinkled and narrow cone-shaped, rarely wide ‚Äì cone- shaped and the berry is firmly attached to it. The berry is a bluish-black and middle-sized ‚Äì about 15.3 mm long and 13.4 mm wide. Large berries are 17 mm long and 15.8 mm wide, while small berries ‚Äì 9 mm long and 8 mm wide. The berry is oval, wider in the middle part, with a rounded end and; this is thick-skinned and symmetrical, quite fleshy and juicy. The skin is covered with thick waxy spots. The ripening of berries on a bunch occurs unequally- a characteristic feature of Mtevandidi. There are 1‚Äì4 seeds (usually one) in a berry. The seed is 7‚Äì8 mm long and 3‚Äì4.5 mm wide, is brown, while to the inside bright yellow. The basis is placed nearly in the middle of the rear, is oval, rarely triangular; its backside is triangular. The beak is rusty- colored, and about 2 mm long . Cultivation The vegetation period from budding to full ripening lasts 208‚Äì216 days, and until leaf-fall 236 ‚Äì 240 days. The vegetation period of high vineyards is 10 ‚Äì 15 days less than that of low vineyards due to the impact of fungal diseases and early fall of leaves, whereas, in low vines, if cultivated properly, the leaf-fall lasts even through to December. The break of buds begins from beginning of April, the blossom period from the end of June according to the observation held in Chokhataruri district, Dablatsikhe-Sakvavisti zone. The ripening of the grape occurs at the end of August (26-28) or the beginning of September, while the full ripening ‚Äì from 20‚Äì25 October. Flower-fall takes place from mid-November to the first half of December. In Chokhatauri and Makharadze districts, the sediment (1280-1540mm) and abundance of sun (sum of 4000¬∫) can result in the prolonging of Mtevandidi's vegetation period, but the vine manages its full ripening during the above-mentioned period. In Baghdati and Dablatsikhe zones, the growth-development is so much influenced by ecological conditions that the length of shoot can reach 2.25m. The harvest of one vine when loaded with 8-12 buds totals 2.5 - 4.0 kg, meaning 120 centners per hectare. The coefficient of harvest is 1.5. The shoots generated from substitute buds are characterized by average growth, giving a 1.1 coefficient of harvest. Shoots generated from dormant buds can grow but are more productive. Such productivity in Bagdati zone is caused by soil conditions and secondly during the irrigation during full harvest. Durability In the warm and wet climate of Guria, Mtevandidi is susceptible to disease. High-growing vines get infected most commonly, due to the difficulties of cultivation and aftercare. Lower area vines are treated with pesticide on time and, if all guidelines are followed, the vine is protected from diseases. Observation shows that its durability against pests and diseases is strong (Chkhaveri, and Nakashidzis Jani). Its durability against oidium, when cultivated, is low and if necessary actions are not taken- such as treatments with sulphur to protect the vine from oidium diseases ‚Äìthe entire harvest can be lost. Data of the testing station in Telavi (Telavi zone) shows that Mtevandidi is resistant to diseases, which can be explained by dry ecological conditions. In the Imereti mountains the durability of Mtevandidi against pests and diseases is strong, and that is why it is not spread widely and it provides a low yield. If well treated, Mtevandidi, engrafted on a rootstock is characterized by strong growth- development and regular productivity. Mtevandidi's durability against phylloxera has been less studied. From rootstock vine types, the best results for Mtevandidi can be brought from hybrids of RipariaXRupestri-3309. Mtevandidi engrafted on this rootstock is characterized by high growth- development.. Mtevandidi is not much bothered by soil condition. It develops successfully in a wide range of elevations.

Right rear: the Pleisenspitze The Scharnitz Pass ( or Scharnitzer Klause) is a narrow section of the upper Isar valley in the Northern Limestone Alps. It lies at a height of about on the Austro-German border between the states of Bavaria and Tyrol. Its name derives from the village of Scharnitz immediately to the south.  Location  The Scharnitz Pass lies east of the Wetterstein Mountains and west of the Karwendel. It is located in the upper valley of the River Isar between Mittenwald (923 m; Bavaria) in the north and Scharnitz (964 m; Tyrol) in the south. The Isar valley floor narrows from about 900 metres to under 300 metres as a result of the eastern flank of the Arntalk√∂pfle (1,529 m), a subpeak of the Arnspitze Group.

History  Under the Roman emperor, Septimius Severus (193‚Äì211), the old mule track from the Inn valley over the Seefeld Saddle to Mittenwald was consolidated into a Roman road that, as the Via Raetia ran through Partenkirchen, Oberau and Murnau to Augsburg. In the Roman road map Tabula Peutingeriana, Scarbia (Scharnitz) and Partanum (Partenkirchen) are shown as rest places and guard stations. From the Middle Ages the road has been an important trade route between Venice and Augsburg/Nuremberg (Via Imperii). The Scharnitz Pass belonged then to the County of Werdenfels, the border between the County of Tyrol then being located at Schlossberg Castle north of Seefeld.Grafschaft Werdenfels - Umfang und Grenzen der Grafschaft: Die tirolische Grenze p. 15, in: Altbayern Reihe I Heft 9: Grafschaft Werdenfels, Komm. f√ºr Bayerische Landesgeschichte, Munich, 1955. The long-term aim of Tyrol was to push the state border north to the strategically important Scharnitz Pass. The Tyrolese achieved a partial success when, on 20 October 1500, Emperor Maximilian I and Prince-Bishop Philip of Freising ratified a treaty agreed the year before that moved the border of Tyrol to within a kilometre south of Scharnitz.Daniel-Erasmus Khan: Die deutschen Staatsgrenzen - rechtshistorische Grundlagen und offene Rechtsfragen.

Preview at Google Books In 1633 Tyrol was granted the right to build a castle, Porta Claudia, at the Scharnitz Pass on Werdenfels territory in order to protect themselves from the advancing Swedish Army in the Thirty Years' War. By a treaty of 29 October 1656, Scharnitz and the region around the Porta Claudia were swapped for a strip of land around the Kienleithenkopf including the Karolingerhof and rights of way into the Hinterautal valley. With another treaty on 28 May 1766, Tyrol's possession of Scharnitz and the Porta Claudia was confirmed as was a strip of territory \\"at a musket shot's distance at all existing fortification works in the direction of Mittenwald‚Äú.Grafschaft Werdenfels - Umfang und Grenzen der Grafschaft: Die tirolische Grenze p. 16, in: Altbayern Reihe I Heft 9: Grafschaft Werdenfels, Komm. f√ºr Bayerische Landesgeschichte, Munich, 1955.

The LGL association is one of the most stable and mature organizations within the civic sector in the country, as it was founded on 3 December 1993. The main principle, characterizing the activities of the association, is the principle of independence from any political or financial interests with the view of attaining effective social inclusion and integration of the local LGBT* community in Lithuania. Based on its expertise in the fields of advocacy, awareness raising and community building, accumulated during twenty years of organizational existence, LGL strives for the consistent progress in the field of human rights for LGBT* people. At the moment, the LGL‚Äôs team constitutes of 5 board members, 7 staff members, 2 international volunteers (participating in the activities of the organization within the framework of the European Voluntary Service) and more than 20 local and international volunteers. LGL's team is vibrant, dynamic, energetic and always open for new members, ideas and projects. It has to be emphasized that not only LGBT* community members participates within activities of the organization. The office of the association LGL is located in Vilnius, Pylimo str. 21. This is the space where the LGL‚Äôs team is implementing various projects, organizing meetings and constantly inviting the members of the local LGBT* community and their supporters to attend various events. The LGL‚Äôs office is also home for the sole LGBT* Center in the country. The LGBT* Center hosts a library in relation to the organization‚Äôs activities, the free internet access is provided and people are always welcome to come by for a cup of coffee or tea. The LGBT* Center is open for all well-meaning visitors, who are willing to know more about the organization‚Äôs activities and about the situation of the LGBT* human rights in Lithuania. The association LGL is a member organization of the National Equality and Diversity Forum (NEDF, www.nlif.lt) and the Human Rights Coalition (HRC). LGL also takes part in international cooperation within the framework of international umbrella organizations, such as ILGA (the International Lesbian and Gay Association), IGLYO, EPOA (the European Pride Organizers Association) and TGEU (the European Transgender Network). LGL's strategic objectives can be achieved only through positioning the LGBT* rights issue within the broader discourse of human rights, therefore LGL actively supports various initiatives both on national and international levels.  Activities  The key activities of the organization are (1) to supervise the implementation of the voluntarily accepted international human rights obligations regarding LGBT* individuals by the Republic of Lithuania, (2) to stop homo-, bi- and transphobic legislative initiatives and to promote the adoption of LGBT* inclusive laws and policies and (3) to eradicate institutional discrimination against LGBT* individuals. However, formal legal equality does not automatically translate into an improvement of quality of life. Openness, a sense of communal belonging and identification of concrete goals represent the key to success in the pursuit of the empowerment of LGBT* individuals in Lithuania. LGL actively works in multiple fields affecting various aspects of LGBT* lives in Lithuania. The right to freedom of expression is being protected through the challenging application of the Lithuanian ‚Äòhomosexual propaganda‚Äô law through various legal avenues, developing awareness raising campaigns and supplementing public discourse with LGBT*-related positive information. The right to freedom of peaceful assembly is being exercised through organizing large scale public awareness raising events, such as the annual Rainbow Days and the Baltic Pride festival (taking place once every three years). The community engagement is being ensured through the development of the volunteerism segment within the activities of the organization and through organizing various conferences, seminars, workshops and other cultural events for the local community members. The preventive strategies against homophobic and transphobic hate crimes are implemented through monitoring and documenting hate motivated incidents, training law enforcement officials and raising awareness among the community members encouraging to report witnessed or experienced hate crimes. Finally, advocacy on an international level is being implemented through submitting shadow reports to the international human rights protection mechanisms, issuing the organization‚Äôs newsletter (more than 6,000 international subscribers) and participating in the activities of the regional LGBT* networks.  History  Shortly its independence was restored, Lithuania decriminalized consensual sexual relations between men. Before the amendment of the criminal code in 1993, such relations were punishable by multi-year prison sentences. However, despite this progress, ‚ÄúLithuanian homosexuals were still living ‚Äòunderground,‚Äô unable to be themselves, stigmatized by the media as HIV/AIDS spreaders,‚Äù as leaders of the national LGBT rights movement Vladimir Simonko and Eduardas Platovas recall. To combat such discrimination, V. Simonko and E. Platovas opened the ‚ÄòAmsterdam‚Äô club in Vilnius in 1993 and published the newspaper ‚ÄòAmsterdam‚Äô in 1994. In April 1994, the two organized the first International Lesbian and Gay Association (ILGA) East Europe conference, which took place in the Lithuanian town of Palanga. This event was especially significant because it was the first conference of that nature to be hosted in a post-Soviet state. Simonko and Platovas officially founded the Lithuanian Gay League in 1995, and the organization has since served as the only organization in the country exclusively fighting for the promotion of LGBT rights.

In 1574, Akbar started an Maktab Khana or a house of translation works in his new capital of Fatehpur Sikri. He assigned the work to a few officials to translate the Sanskrit books Rajatarangini, Ramayana and Mahabharata into the Persian language, the literary language of the Mughal court. Akbar's court translations were made in several steps: the meaning was explained by Hindu scholars and a first draft was made by the Muslim theologian Naqib Khan into Persian and this was then improved upon by Faizi into elegant prose or verse. In Persian, ‚ÄúRazm‚Äù means ‚Äúwar‚Äù and \\"nama\\" means \\"tale\\", \\"history\\", or \\"epic\\"; the name Razmnamah, therefore, means a tale of war. Four illustrated Mughal manuscripts are known, one complete, made between 1584 and 1586, and now in Jaipur, with 176 paintings of which 147 were reproduced in 1884 by Thomas Holbein Hendley.

For some nights His Majesty personally > (had it) explained to Naqib Khan, who wrote out the resultant text in > Persian. On the third night His Majesty summoned me and ordered me to > translate it in collaboration with Naqib Khan. In three or four months out > of the eighteen chapters (fan) of that stock of useless fables... I wrote > out two chapters. ... Thereafter Mulla Shiri and Naqib Khan completed that > section, and one section Sultan Haji Thanesari  ªMunfarid º brought to > completion. Shaikh Faizi was then appointed to write it in verse and prose, > but he too did not complete more than two Chapters (fan). Again, the said > Haji wrote out two sections and rectified the errors which were committed in > the first round, and fitting one part with another, compiled a hundred > fasciculi. The direction was to establish exactitude in a minute manner so > that nothing of the original should be lost. In the end upon some fault, His > Majesty ordered him (Haji Thanesari) to be dismissed and sent away to > Bhakkar, his native city, where he still is.

They are based on Sperner's lemma. The merits of these protocols is that they put few restrictions on the preferences of the partners, and ask the partners only simple queries such as \\"which piece do you prefer?\\". Protocols were developed for solving several related problems:  Cake cutting  In the envy-free cake-cutting problem, a \\"cake\\" (a heterogeneous divisible resource) has to be divided among n partners with different preferences over parts of the cake. The cake has to be divided to n pieces such that: (a) each partner receives a single connected piece, and (b) each partner believes that his piece is (weakly) better than all other pieces. A protocol for solving this problem was developed by Forest Simmons in 1980, in a correspondence with Michael Starbird. It was first publicized by Francis Su in 1999. Given a cut-set (i.e. a certain partition of the cake to n pieces), we say that a partner prefers a given piece if he believes that this piece is weakly better than all other pieces. \\"Weakly\\" means that the partner may be indifferent between the piece and one or more other pieces, so he may (in case of ties) \\"prefer\\" more than one piece. The protocol makes the following assumptions on the preferences of the partners: # Independence on other partners: The preference depends on the partner and the entire cut-set, but not on choices made by the other partners. # Hungry partners: Partners never prefer an empty piece. # Topologically closed preference sets: Any piece that is preferred for a convergent sequence of cut-sets, is preferred at the limiting cut-set. So for example, if a partner prefers the first piece in all cut-sets where the first cut is done at x > 0.2 and prefers the second piece in all cut-sets where the first cut is at x < 0.2, then at the cut-set where the first cut is at x = 0.2 that partner prefers both pieces equally. The closedness condition rules out the existence of single points of cake with positive desirability. These assumptions are very mild: in contrast to other protocols for fair cake-cutting, the utility functions are not required to be additive or monotonic. The protocol considers 1-dimensional cut-sets. For example, the cake may be the 1-dimensional interval [0,1] and each piece is an interval; or, the cake may be a rectangle cut along its longer side so that each piece is a rectangle. Every cut-set can be represented by n numbers xi, i = 1, ..., n, where xi is the length of the ith piece. We assume that the total length of the cake is 1, so x1 + ... + xn = 1\\\\. The space of possible partitions is thus an (n ‚àí 1)-dimensional simplex with n vertices in Rn. The protocol works on this simplex in the following way: # Triangulate the simplex-of-partitions to smaller simplices of any desired size. # Assign each vertex of the triangulation to one partner, such that each sub-simplex has n different labels. # For each vertex of the triangulation, ask its owner: ‚ÄúWhich piece would you choose if the cake were cut with the cut-set represented by this point?‚Äù. Label that vertex by the number of the piece that is desired. The generated labeling satisfies the requirements of Sperner's lemma coloring: * Each vertex of the original simplex corresponds to a cut-set in which one piece contains the entire cake and all other pieces are empty. By the \\"hungry partners\\" assumption, the owner of that vertex must prefer that piece. Hence the labels of the vertices of the large simplex are all different. * Each side/face of the original simplex corresponds to the cut-sets in which some pieces are empty, and the non-empty pieces correspond to the vertices of that side. By the \\"hungry partners\\" assumption, the owners must prefer only non-empty pieces, so the triangulation vertices on these sides can have only one of the labels that appear in the corresponding vertices. Hence, by Sperner's lemma there must be at least one sub-simplex in which the labels are all different. In step #2 we assigned each vertex of this sub-simplex to a different partner. Hence we have found n very similar cut-sets in which different partners prefer different pieces of cake. We can now triangulate the sub-simplex to a finer mesh of sub-sub-simplices and repeat the process. We get a sequence of smaller and smaller simplices which converge to a single point. This point corresponds to a single cut-set. By the \\"Preference sets are closed\\" assumption, in this cut-set each partner prefers a different piece. This is an envy-free partition! The existence of an envy-free partition has been proved before, but Simmons' proof also yields a constructive approximation algorithm. For example, assume that a certain land- estate has to be divided, and the partners agree that a difference of plus or minus 1 centimeter is irrelevant to them. Then the original simplex can be triangulated to simplices with side length less than 1 cm. Then every point in the sub-simplex in which all labels are different corresponds to an (approximate) envy-free partition. In contrast to other envy-free protocols, which may assign each partner a large number of crumbs, Simmons' protocol gives each partner a single connected piece. Moreover, if the original cake is rectangular then each piece is a rectangle. Several years after this algorithm has been published, it was proved that envy-free partitions with connected pieces cannot be found by finite protocols. Hence, an approximation algorithm is the best that we can hope for in finite time. Currently, Simmons' algorithm is the only approximation algorithm for envy-free cake-cutting with connected pieces. Simmons' algorithm is one of the few fair division algorithms which have been implemented and put online.An implementation by Francis Su, Elisha Peterson and Patrick Winograd is available at: https://www.math.hmc.edu/~su/fairdivision/ One nice thing about the algorithm is that the queries it asks the partners are very simple: they just have to decide, in each partition, which piece they prefer. This is in contrast to other algorithm, which ask numerical queries such as \\"cut a piece with a value of 1/3\\" etc. = Run-time complexity = While an envy-free division with connected pieces can be approximated to any precision using the above protocol, the approximation might take a long time. In particular: * When the utility functions are accessible only through oracles, the number of queries for achieving an envy of less than œµ is \\\\Theta(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon^n}). * When the utility functions are given explicitly by polynomial-time algorithms, the envy-free cake-cutting problem has the same complexity as finding a Brouwer fixed-point, i.e. PPAD-complete.  Rental Harmony  In this problem, n housemates have decided to rent an n-bedroom house for rent fixed by the homeowner. Each housemate may have different preferences ‚Äî one may prefer a large room, another may prefer a room with a view, etc. The following two problems should be solved simultaneously: (a) Assign a room to each partner, (b) Determine the rent that each partner should pay, such that the sum of payments equals to the total rent. The assignment should be envy-free in that every partner weakly prefers his parcel of room+rent over the other parcels, i.e. no partner would like to take another room at the rent assigned to that room. A protocol for solving this problem was developed by Francis Su in 1999. The idea is as follows. Normalize the total rent to 1. Then each pricing scheme is a point in an (n-1)-dimensional simplex with n vertices in \\\\mathbb{R}^n. Su's protocol operates on a dualized version of this simplex in a similar way to the Simmons‚ÄìSu protocols for cake-cutting: for every vertex of a triangulation of the dual simplex, which corresponds to a certain price scheme, it asks the owning partner \\"which room do you prefer in that pricing scheme?\\". This results in a Sperner coloring of the dual simplex, and thus there exists a small sub-simplex which corresponds an approximate envy-free assignment of rooms and rents. and provide popularized explanations of the Rental Harmony protocol.https://www.math.hmc.edu/~su/fairdivision/ and https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/science/rent-division-calculator.html provide on-line implementations. See Rental harmony for more solutions to this problem.  Chore division  In this problem, there is a chore that has to be divided among n partners, e.g., lawn-mowing in a large area. The Rental Harmony protocol can be used to achieve approximate envy-free assignment of chores by simply thinking of the rent payments as chores and ignoring the rooms. Divisibility of chores can be achieved by dividing the time spent on them.  Multi-cake cutting  In this problem, two or more cakes have to be divided simultaneously among two or more partners, giving each partner a single piece from each cake. Of course, if the preferences are independent (i.e. the utility from an allocation is the sum of utilities from the allocated piece in each cake), then the problem can be solved by one-cake division methods ‚Äì simply do an envy-free partition on each cake separately. The question becomes interesting when the partners have linked preferences over the cakes, in which the portion of one cake that partner prefers is influenced by the portion of another cake allocated to him. For example, if the \\"cakes\\" are the times of work-shifts in two consecutive days, a typical employee may prefer to have the same shift every day (e.g. morning-morning or evening-evening) then to have different shifts. A solution to this problem for the case of 2 partners and 2 or 3 cakes was published in 2009. If the number of cakes is m, and each cake is divided to k pieces, then the space of partitions can be represented by an n-vertex d-dimensional polytope, where d=m(k ‚àí 1) and n = km. A generalization of Sperner's lemma to polytopes guarantees that, if this polytope is triangulated and labeled in an appropriate manner, there are at least n ‚àí d sub-simplices with a full labeling; each of these simplices corresponds to an (approximate) envy-free allocation in which each partner receives a different combination of pieces. However, the combinations might overlap: one partner might get the \\"morning\\" and \\"evening\\" shifts while another partner might get \\"evening\\" and \\"evening\\". Although these are different selections, they are incompatible. section 4 of proves that an envy-free division to two partners with disjoint pieces might be impossible if m = k = 2, but is always possible if m = 2 and k = 3 (i.e. at least one cake is divided to three pieces, each partner receives a single piece from each cake, and at least one piece is discarded). Similar results are proved for three cakes.

Early life and education Lucy Lyttelton Cameron was born in Stanford-on- Teme, taking her name from her godmother Lady Lucy Fortescue Lyttelton. Her mother was born Martha Sherwood and her father George Butt was the vicar in Stanford at her birth and a minor poet. Her father was well connected and he became George III's Chaplain-in-Ordinary in 1783.Rev. George Butt, spenserians.cath.vt.edu, retrieved 26 August 2014 Her father took positions at several different churches, although he died in 1795, having returned to Stanford. In childhood she studied French, Italian and Greek. Between 1792 and 1797 she attended Reading Abbey Girls' School, depicted in the novel Emma by another former pupil, Jane Austen. She and her sister Mary (later Mary Martha Sherwood) had a strict upbringing and if it was not for her supposed delicacy then she would have been required to wear a backboard and an iron ring, like her sister, to improve her posture. Through her family's connection to Gerrard Andrewes, who by 1802 was vicar of St James's Church, Piccadilly, Lucy was introduced to London cultural figures such as the Bluestocking Elizabeth Carter and Humphry Davy, the inventor. In Bristol she met writers Hannah More and Mary Anne Schimmelpenninck.(1886). \\"Cameron, Lucy Lyttelton (DNB00)\\". In Stephen, Leslie. Dictionary of National Biography 08. London: Smith, Elder & Co The year after leaving school she wrote The History of Margaret Whyte, , or, The life and death of a good child, joining her sister, who was already published. By this time she was living with her mother in Bridgnorth. Both of the daughters taught at Sunday School, which is where their writings were targeted. Marriage and family St Michael's church at Lilleshall. Butt married in 1806, taking the name of the evangelical Reverend Charles Richard Cameron. Together they moved to Snedshill where he was the first curate at St Michaels Church at Donington Wood at Lilleshall in Shropshire'Lilleshall: Churches', A History of the County of Shropshire: Volume 11: Telford (1985), pp. 166‚Äì172. where they had twelve children. The Camerons also adopted a niece when her sister followed her husband to India. The Camerons stayed in Shropshire for twenty five years before they took \\"the living of\\" Swaby in Lincolnshire, but they still lived at Snedshill. The Cameron family grew further in 1818 when her only brother's wife died. Her brother was unable to cope so her sister adopted his four sons and Cameron took his three daughters into her household. The extra expense was offset by a ¬£50 a year allowance given to her by the industrialist, Isaac Hawkins Browne, when he died that same year. Writing career The Nosegay of Honeysuckles, 1825 edition Throughout her life Cameron wrote as did her brother and sister. Her brother was not so productive, but her elder sister was and she enjoyed more popularity. She also published under her married name of Mary Martha Sherwood. Cameron's best known work might be The Raven and the Dove, The Nosegay of Honeysuckles, Martin and his Two Sunday Scholars or The Pink Tippet. During her life she wrote about 400 works of varying sizes which like her sister were published by a Shropshire company. This was in addition to serving as the editor of Nursery and Infants' Schools Magazine, a role she performed from 1831 to 1852. She was published in America too. Both sisters do seem to have been controlled by their publishers. Some of their work was written around existing illustrations rather than the other way round. She and her sister are credited with creating a different focus in children's literature. Previously fiction would concentrate on moral and religious themes whose purpose was to teach conformity that would benefit society. Cameron and her sister's stories gave more emphasis to the individual and their objectives. This led to their fiction being popular not only in Sunday schools but as childhood fiction in general. They both received wide recognition. However around 1870 the fashion again moved on and their books were generally only found in Sunday schools.Joanne Potier, 'Cameron , Lucy Lyttelton (1781‚Äì1858)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 26 Aug 2014 Cameron died in 1858 and was buried in Swaby.

It is located in Jog Falls Sagara, Shimoga District Karnataka state India.  History  Jog Falls the Tourist Centre of world fame, attracted visitors from all over the world, for its majestic beauty and natural scenery. As could be seen from the Visitors Books preserved in the Travellers Bungalow, both at Mysore and Siddapur side, Jog Falls was considered a place of Tourist importance from over one and half century. During the last century Europeans used to visit the Falls via Gersoppa, a small coastal village at the mouth of the Sharavathy River, about twelve miles from Honnavar Bunder, and they named the falls, as Gersoppa Falls, since there was no other village near by, which could be easily accessible. As such the name Jog Falls was only a local name, and the falls were known outside Mysore State by the name Gersoppa Falls. Jog Falls is by the river Sharavathy, which takes its source at Ambuthirtha in Thirthahalli Taluk, in Shimoga District, is situated in the heart of the jungles, on the Western Ghats it is 66 miles from Shimoga the District headquarters and 21 miles from Sagar the Taluk headquarters. It is 237 miles North-west of Bangalore, and almost the same distance north of Mysore. The nearest Railway station is at Talaguppa, twelve miles from Jog. The History of Jog PARISH can be traced as far back as the year 1937, when the works for the Jog Hydro Electric Project was taken up. Prior to this, the area was almost a thick jungle, infested by pythons, tigers and other wild animals, and it was also considered as a Hunters' Resort. There was only one building, the existing Inspection Bungalow, which was under Forest Department, (and this building was supposed to have been built somewhere in the middle of the nineteenth century), and no human habitation could be found within a radius of about two miles. The nearest village from the falls was Marathakeri, a small hamlet which existed near where the present Eswara Temple stands. Another small village was Kargal at a distance of three miles from Jog Falls. These villages were entirely shut up from the outer world, and once or twice a year these villagers used to go to Sagar for their necessities. The only approach to the falls from Sagar was via ferry, which is one and half mile from the falls. The distance to Sagar from Jog Falls via ferry is only 18 miles, even at the Travellers Bungalow there was no life, except during Tourist Season. i.e. from October to end of January. The Travellers Bungalow was in charge of onc Sri P.A. D'Souza. maity. who was living near the Ferry, and only when Visitors came he used to come to the T.B. to render them help and service. Near the Ferry there were eight Konkani Catholic families, who were living by agriculture and by ferry boating. The Ecclesiastical jurisdiction beyond ferry was then under Goa Diocese, until the Diocese of Karwar was created, and the jurisdiction came under the newly created Diocese. When the survey work was taken up for the Jog Hydro Electric Project, little by little people from outside began to come and settle in Jog. Among the early settlers, mention may be made of Sri S.C.Fernandes, Forest Guard, Sri P A. D‚ÄôSouza Maity, Mathews Gabral, Bejmi Mascarenhas and Joseph, a Malayali Catholic from Travancore. Sri S.C.Fernandes, was living near the ferry and cultivating some lands in the Sirur valley, on the site of the existing Sirur Reservoir. He came and settled near his lands somewhere in the year 1938. Sriyuths P.A. D‚ÄôSouza and Mathews Gabral, who were employed at the T.B. and living near the ferry, also came and settled near the Falls when the survey work was taken up. Sri Bejmi Mascarenhas was living with his family near the ferry cultivating lands. He along with some of the Catholic residents of the ferry, was the first to help the Officers who came to Jog for the survey works. Sri Bejmi came and settled in Jog with his family when the regular Project work commenced, and later on he was employed in the works. Sri Joseph came with his family and settled near the lands of Guard Fernandes, somewhere, here in the year 1940 and was running a small tea shop. The survey work was completed during the year 1938, and the Inaugural Stone for the new project was laid by the late Highness, Sri Krishnarajendra Wadeyar, on 6 January 1939. From thence the regular Project works commenced, and formation of roads, construction of temporary and permanent buildings were taken up the Public Works Department. Labour was invited from all over the country and people of all nationalities began to pour into Jog in thousands. As there was much scope for masonry and other skilled labour, many Konkani Catholic families from North Kanara District, began to come and settle in Jog. By the year 1944 there were about 100 Catholic families, among whom about five or six were Tamilians and the rest were Konkani. The Parochial visits to Jog to cater to the spiritual needs of the Catholic workers, actually commenced from the year 1953, during the time of Rev. Father Raynaurd de Prigney, Parish Priest of Sagar. Father Prigney used to visit Jog once a month, visit the faithful in labour sheds, say mass in the T.B. or some vacant building. There were instances when he was refused any roofing accommodation, and he had to say Mass under the shelter of a tree. Among a few leading Catholics of the time, who were holding responsible jobs in the project, mention may be made of Sri J.P.David, Inspector of Mines and Explosives, Sri A. Rayappa and Sri V.A.D'Souza, Accountants in the P.W.D., and Robert Fernandes Compounder These were the only few who assisted the Priest during his parochial visits. The year 1944 saw the dawn of Catholic atmosphere in Jog, when Sri John L.D'Sa came to Jog with his family during September 1944, as the Hydrauli Engineer and Penstock Erector. Mr & Mrs DSa took up the Catholic Action into their hands, and began to work for the formation of a Parish at Jog. In the year 1945, His Lordship, Rt. Rev Dr Rene Fuega, Bishop of Mysore, paid a visit to Jog, when he was given a grand civic reception. His Lordship was much impressed by the piety of the congregation, which by that time was about five hundred, and the enthusiasm evinced by the Catholic Leaders, and especially by D'Sa family, and gave his approval for the formation of a committee to look after the Church affairs, under the Presidency of Mr. D'Sa and guidance of the Parish Priest of Sagar. Rev. Fr. F. Lopes was then the Parish Priest, who used to visit jog once a month, and stay with Mr.DSa, and say Mass in his Bungalow. His Lordship also empowered the Committee to collect funds from the Catholic Members, for the Religious expenses. and maintain accounts, Mr. D‚ÄôSa was made the custodian of the Church money. A monthly subscription from four annas to eight annas was fixed for every earning member As approved by His Lordship. The collected money remained with the Committee. and the Committee had to pay Rs. 5/- to the Priest for every trip, plus his mess charges. Efforts started from the year 1945 to raise funds for the construction of a suitable Church, for the spiritual benefits of the congregation. A small shed belonging to a contractor, was purchased for four hundred rupees. This shed was made of mud walls, and bamboo thatties and stood where the present Church stands. All we could get out of the shed, when it was dismantled after three years. were tiles only. Immediately the shed was purchased, the inner walls were removed, converting the whole into a hall, and an Altar was put up. This shed was blessed and opened by our beloved Bishop during the year 1946, and was dedicated to Christ the King, as the Patron of the Parish. A new Statue of Christ the King, donated by one Sri Shabi Furtado, was installed on the Main Altar and the whole congregation was consecrated to Christ the King.

Father Saldhana was in charge of this parish, as Assistant to Parish Priest, from 1952 to July 1955, until he was transferred to Gadanalli. The Church was originally provided with only one verandah on the western side, on which a room was built, which served as the presbytery for the visiting priests. The eastern side of the Church was exposed to winds and rain, and it was felt quite urgent to provide a verandah on that side, which would serve both as additional accommodation as well as a support to walls. The proposal was placed before the Church Committee, and it was unanimously resolved on 30-9-1956, to put up a verandah on the eastern side of the Church, and to provide a room, similar to the one existing on the western side. A special contribution was raised among the Catholics, and about Rs. 100/- was collected for the purpose. The work was taken up and finished during the months of February and March 1967, at a total cost of about Rs 400/- All these years (i.e. from 1949 to 1 957 end), the Priest who used to pay fortnightly visits to Jog, was halting in the room provided on the western verandah of the Church. Efforts for building a decent presbytery for the Priest started from the year 1955, and through a resolution of the General Body of the Catholics, the Department of Electricity was requested for the grant of a site by the side of the Church, for constructing a Presbytery. After continuous correspondence, a site measuring 5OX 50 for the purpose was sanctioned by Government, vide their G.O.N0., PWD-6-HCW: 57, dated Bangalore, 17 July 1957, on a LEASE BASIS, for a period of thirty years from the date of Order, on an annual ground rent of R.s.5/-. The Lease Bond with site plan etc. was Registered on 10 February 1961. As per the above Lease Bond, period begins from July 1957 and ends in July 1987, after which the Mission will either have to dismantle the building or further extend the lease period. by renewing the Lease Bond. An estimate amounting to Rs. 5764/- along with the plan for the proposed Presbytery, was submitted to his lordship. the Bishop. through the Parish Priest. during January 1956. Also an appeal was made to His Lordship for funds. The estimate with the plan was received back with the approval of the Bishop, with assurance of help. Accordingly, the foundation stone for the building was blessed and laid by Rev. Fr A.F DSouza on 26 February 1957. and immediately thereafter the work was taken up. When the construction of the building reached roof level, the Committee ran almost out of funds. and appeal for funds was renewed with His Lordship, through the P.P., on 30 March 1957. For a grant of Rs.2500/- His Lordship during his visit to Jog in the month of February 1958, was pleased to observe the progress made in the construction of the Presbytery, and was convinced that the work was held up for want of funds. As such and in response to our appeal, a sum of Rs. 1300/- was donated by His Lordship. through the Parish Priest. which reached the Committee at a most critical moment, when the Committee had completely run out of funds, and was anxious to complete the roofing and other works. before the starting of monsoon. At last the entire work was completed by the end of December 1958, at a total cost of about Rs.4000/-. excluding free labour by the parishioners. The Presbytery was furnished with a new set of furniture. got done at Mysore, consisting of Rose wood chairs. one Ratan chair. and also two tables and two cots. and one easy chair. donated by Sri. W.P. Douglas W.P. Douglas, who was put in charge of church affairs after transfer of Sri in direct supervision of the construction of the presbytery. and the entire credit for speedy and economic construction of the building will have to go to him. Mr Douglas retired from service and hence had to leave Jog during January 1959 In appreciation for the valuable service rendered by Sri Douglas to the Church and Catholic Community. A gold ring worth one sovereign was presented to him through father D'Souza After the departure of Sri Douglas, the charge of the Church affairs was vested on Sri Jos. F.C. Sequeira, the Secretary of the association. until the posting of the permanent Priest. Father James Rao, who took charge of the Parish on 13 June 1959. The next important work undertaken was, the starting of the Legion of Mary in the Parish. Absence of a good and organised association was felt as an immediate need for the Parish, to assist the Parish Priest in his day to day parish work, and to carry on the Lay Apostolate in the Parish. As such thirteen enthusiastic men were chosen to start the Legion, and the first meeting was held on 30 August 1960. Election of office Bearers was conducted. during the meeting, and Br.Jos.F.C. Secuueira was elected as the president, Br.S.C. Fernandes as the Vice President, Br. Thomas D'Costa as the Secretary, and Br. Hilorin Dias as the Treasurer, for the year 1960-61.

Father James Rao, Parish Priest. Since then regular weekly meetings are being conducted, and the legion has become a great source of help to the Parish. On the arrival of the permanent Parish Priest to Jog, the Church Committee was abolished, and the entire charge of the Church affairs was handed over to him, through Father A.F Dsouza. thus after fourteen years of management of the Church affairs, which was an extraordinary privilege enjoyed by the laity of Jog. the Church Committee on handing over charge to the Parish Priest, thanked their Patron Christ the King. for all the graces and help bestowed upon them during their term of stewardship. Just a month prior to coming of the Permanent Parish Priest, His Lordship was pleased to pay a visit to Jog, with His Auxiliary Bishop Abert D'Souza, when the Catholics of Jog, presented to them an address and had renewed their prayer for sending a permanent priest to Jog.

Father Antonio de la Llave was assigned as the first parish priest of Caboan. In 1602, the small village was converted into a town and renamed San Miguel de Caboan under the patronage of Saint Michael, the Archangel. Father Geronimo Vasquez built the stone church on the exact spot where the image of the Virgin Mary was found by a Caboan couple according to legend in 1613. Since then, the town was named Santa Mar√≠a de Caboan or simply Sta. Maria. The church was destroyed by the 1639 Chinese uprising and was rebuilt in 1669 by Father Jos√© de Jesus Mar√≠a, as well as the rectory. Like the other churches in Laguna, the church of Santa Maria was heavily damaged in the 1880 Luzon earthquakes.\\"American Journal of Science - Art.V.

In a racing career which lasted from May 1974 until April 1975 she won five of her seven races. After finishing second on her racecourse debut she won her next five races including the Lowther Stakes and the Cheveley Park Stakes (against a very strong field) and was rated the best two-year-old filly of her generation in Britain by a wide margin. She failed to reproduce her best form on her only start in 1975 and was retired to stud, where she had some success as a broodmare. Background Cry of Truth was a \\"most attractive, shapely\\" grey mare (a very dark grey during her racing career) bred in Suffolk by her owners Pearl Lawson Johnston's Langham Hall Stud. She was from the second crop of foals sired by Town Crier, a grey horse who recorded his biggest win in the Queen Anne Stakes. Cry of Truth's dam, False Evidence, was of no use as a racehorse, failing to win in fifteen starts on the flat and four over hurdles but was a successful broodmare, having previously produced the winning sprinter Melchbourne (horse). Miss Lawson Johnston, a Master of Foxhounds and Justice of the peace, sent her filly into training with Bruce Hobbs at the Palace House stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career =1974: two- year-old season= On her racecourse debut, Cry of Truth ran in a qualifier for the Wills Embassy Stakes over five furlongs at York Racecourse in May. She started poorly and showed signs of inexperience but finished strongly and finished second, beaten half a length by the more experienced colt Hunting Prince. On her next appearance, the filly recorded her first success as she won by four lengths from modest opposition in a maiden race over five furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse. In the final of the Wills Embassy Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse in August Cry of Truth face a rematch against Hunting Prince, the colt who had beaten her at York. She led for most of the way and accelerate clear in the closing stages to beat Hunting Prince by five lengths. Shortly afterwards, the filly was moved up in class to contest the Group Two Lowther Stakes over five furlongs at York. Ridden by John Gorton, she started the 8/13 favourite and \\"completely outclassed\\" the opposition, winning by five lengths from Tzaritsa. Cry of Truth made a third appearance in August when she was moved up in distance for the Champion Trophy over six furlongs at Ripon Racecourse. She led for most of the way and won in a juvenile course record time but was less impressive than at York, having to be driven out by Gorton to win by a length from the Norfolk Stakes runner-up Touch of Gold. Hobbs later explained that the filly was somewhat \\"off-colour\\" and had coughed on her return from the races. Cry of Truth ended her season with a run in the Cheveley Park Stakes over six furlongs at Newmarket in October, which was then the only British Group One race confined to two-year-old fillies. Ridden as usual by Gorton, she started at odds of 4/1 in a field of fifteen with the American-bred, Irish-trained Highest Trump, the unbeaten winner of the Queen Mary Stakes going off favourite. The other runners included Delmora, a French filly who had defeated colts to win the Prix de la Salamandre and the Moyglare Stud Stakes winner Tender Camilla from Ireland. The other British contenders included Roussalka, winner of the Cherry Hinton Stakes and Princess Margaret Stakes, and the promising but inexperienced Rose Bowl. Despite concerns that the soft ground would expose her supposed stamina deficiencies, Cry of Truth led from the start and stayed on very strongly in the closing stages to win by two lengths and one length from Delmora and Rose Bowl. =1975: three-year-old season= Cry of Truth began her three-year-old season as the 4/1 ante-post favourite for the Classic 1000 Guineas. She prepped for the race with a run in the Nell Gwyn Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket in April, in which, as a Group One winner, she was required to concede weight to her rivals. After disputing the lead for half a mile she weakened badly in the closing stages and finished ninth of the ten runners behind Rose Bowl. She did not race again and her retirement from racing was reported in August. Assessment There was no International Classification of European two-year-olds in 1974: the official handicappers of Britain, Ireland and France compiled separate rankings for horses which competed in those countries. In the British Free Handicap, Cry of Truth was allotted a weight of 131 pounds, two pounds behind the leading colt Grundy and eleven clear of the next-best filly Highest Trump. The independent Timeform organisation gave her rating of 129, five pounds below Grundy and named her as their best two-year-old filly, despite the fact that they had awarded a rating of 131 to the French-trained filly Broadway Dancer. In their annual Racehorses of 1974 Timeform quoted John Gorton as having described Cry of Truth as \\"certainly the best filly I have ridden\\", despite previously having ridden both Jacinth and the leading sprinter Stilvi. She was unrated by Timeform in 1975, although they did describe her a \\"genuine and consistent\\", presumably on the basis of her performances in the previous year. In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Cry of Truth the fourteenth-best two-year-old filly trained in Britain or Ireland in the 20th century. Breeding record Cry of Truth was retired from racing and became broodmare at her owner's stud. She produced at least seven foals between 1977 and 1990. *Truth Will Out (bay filly, foaled in 1977, sired by Blakeney), won two races and produced several minor winners *Integrity (grey filly, 1978, by Reform), won three races and finished third in the Cork and Orrery Stakes and produced several winners including the Solario Stakes winner Radwell. *On Oath (colt, 1981, by Monsanto), won one race *Woodleys (filly, 1982, by Tyrnavos), unraced, produced the minor winner Dance to the Beat *Face the Truth (colt, 1986, by Neltino), failed to win in five races *Albona (filly, 1988, by Neltino), won five minor races *Innocent Man (gelding, 1990, by Neltino), failed to win in 10 races Pedigree *Cry of Truth was inbred 3 x 4 to the Champion Stakes winner Umidwar, meaning that this stallion appears in both the third and fourth generations of her pedigree.

A railway worker, he played an important part in the Grivi»õa Strike of 1933. Subsequently, imprisoned, he escaped and ended up in Moscow. He then joined the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War. After spending much of World War II in the Soviet Union, he returned to Romania, where he helped establish a Communist regime. Doncea held a series of posts under the new order, but in 1958 he was removed from the party after clashing with its leader Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej. In his later years, he was rehabilitated by the latter's successor, Nicolae Ceau»ôescu. Biography =Beginnings, strike action and Spain= Doncea was born in Cocu, Arge»ô County and was a lathe operator by profession. He practiced this work at the Pite»ôti CƒÉile Ferate Rom√¢ne (CFR) state railway deposit and at the Grivi»õa CFR yards in Bucharest. He joined the banned Romanian Communist Party (PCR) in 1931, was a member of the party cell at Grivi»õa and head of the Bucharest rail workers' trade union committee. He belonged to the strike committee during the Grivi»õa Strike of 1933, and in this capacity drew attention for the energy with which he led and instigated the workers. They, his judges and the press all perceived him as the strike leader, while the Comintern created a \\"Doncea myth\\" that made him into the most recognizable figure of the Romanian proletariat. Arrested and imprisoned at Jilava and Craiova, he was initially sentenced to hard labor for life by the authorities of the Kingdom of Romania, but his penalty was later commuted to twenty years' hard labor. On January 3, 1935, together with fellow Grivi»õa strikers Dumitru Petrescu and Gheorghe Vasilichi, he made a daring escape from prison that created a press sensation.Burcea, passim After spending time in various safe houses, the trio managed to leave Romania through Halmeu, passing into Czechoslovakia before ending up in Moscow.Burcea, p.103 There, they enrolled in classes at the Moscow State V. I. Lenin Pedagogical Institute, but the Romanian-language section was disbanded before they could graduate. Soviet intelligence subjected them to lengthy interrogations, suspecting a possible infiltration by the Siguran»õa secret police.Burcea, p.104 In 1938, he went to France, where he soon enrolled as a volunteer in the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War,Dobre, p.224 functioning both as a soldier and as a political secretary at the company, battalion and brigade level at the Battle of the Ebro and during the Catalonia Offensive. After fleeing Spain in February 1939 as the war neared its conclusion, he was interned in a camp at Saint-Cyprien in the south of France, where he was secretary of the Romanian volunteers' party organization and of the Dimitrov Battalion.Dobre, p.224 Several months later, he left for the Soviet Union, where he remained during World War II until after the King Michael Coup, when the Soviets parachuted him into Romania. =In office and downfall= Upon the August 1944 legalization of the PCR (PMR from 1948, shortly after the establishment of a communist regime), he held a number of posts over the next two decades. He was infantry lieutenant colonel in the Romanian Land Forces (from August 1945); member of the Bucharest regional party committee; secretary of the Ilfov County party committee; adviser to the monetary stabilization committee (August-November 1947). As deputy Mayor of Bucharest (November 1947 - February 1948), he supervised the demolition of Bucharest statues anathema to the regime, including those of Pache Protopopescu, Carol I, Ferdinand, Marie and Ion C. BrƒÉtianu. Dan C. MihƒÉilescu, \\"Nenoroc la statui\\" , Dilema Veche, 402/October 27, 2011 He became an alternate member of the PMR's central committee (February 1948 - June 1958), with the following assignments: deputy Constructions Minister (February 1948 - March 1950); major-general (1950); head of the air-defense command (March 1950 - May 1952); control committee of the central committee following his retirement from active military service (May 1952); Harvest Minister (March 1956 - February 1957) and president of the state committee for pricing agricultural products (February 1957 - June 1958). Doncea's downfall occurred at a June 1958 central committee plenary session. That year marked the 25th anniversary of the Grivi»õa strike, and his problems stemmed from a speech he delivered before the Mihai Roller-led party history institute, during sessions the latter organized there in 1955-1956. Biografiile nomenklaturii , at the Institute for the Investigation of Communist Crimes and the Memory of the Romanian Exile site There, he appeared to minimize the PCR's role during the strike, although he later tried to correct the slip. At the eventual party session, a list of accusations against him was read by Nicolae Ceau»ôescu, the main charges being that he had not given enough credit to the party and had undervalued the contribution of Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, by then party leader. At the same time, he was criticized for excessive self-promotion, one of his sharpest accusers being his former jail mate Vasilichi, who was seeking to save his own position. Following the session, Doncea was removed from the central committee and from the party itself. Cristina Diac, \\"Doncea, exclus din partid\\" , Jurnalul Na»õional, April 13, 2005 This formed part of a broader purge directed at party veterans, including Vasile B√¢gu and Grigore RƒÉceanu. In turn, that event formed part of a series of purges--earlier ones had taken place in the summers of 1956 and 1957--which took place as a result of Nikita Khrushchev's Secret Speech, which alerted Gheorghiu-Dej to the possibility of losing his grip on power and led him to treat any challenge as evidence of \\"factionalism\\". In the Doncea group's case, he feared they might make inconvenient revelations about his past within the party.Neagoe-Ple»ôa, pp.160-61 =Later years= After his exclusion from the party, Doncea became head of a Ialomi»õa County collective farm, working from 1958 to March 1964. A retiree from the beginning of 1964, he was again president of the agricultural products pricing committee from February 1966 to April 1968, and an adviser to the prime minister's office, with ministerial rank, from April 1968 until his death.Dobre, pp.224-25 He was rehabilitated after Ceau»ôescu succeeded Gheorghiu-Dej in 1965.Stoica, p.182 Doncea was elected to the Assembly of Deputies for Arge»ô County in 1946 and obtained a Bucharest seat in the Great National Assembly (MAN) in 1948, holding it until 1952. Later, he sat for Vedea in the Pite»ôti Region from 1957 to 1961. He was the MAN's President from May to September 1950.Alexandrescu, p.72 His awards included the Order of the Star of Romania, officer rank (1947); the Order of the Star of the Romanian Socialist Republic, second class (1948); and the 50th anniversary of the PCR medal (1971).Dobre, p.225 Notes References *Ion Alexandrescu, Enciclopedia de istorie a Rom√¢niei, vol. 2.

The storyline focuses on the unnamed summoner and players have to complete every stage to access a new area. Players are allowed to bring up to 5 units in each stage with a \\"friend\\" unit in quest mode. Players make friends through friend request. Attacking units in a battle rewards the player with Brave Burst Crystals, and Heart Crystals. After an enemy is defeated, the player proceeds the next stage until the boss, which is required to go complete a level. After completing, players are rewarded with Zel, Karma and items, as well as acquiring units from each mission. When players complete the entire area, they'll be rewarded with one gem. However, if players fail a quest, they use one gem to continue. Units have the ability to execute special attacks, known as Brave Bursts. When activated the unit uses a powerful attack. Brave Bursts can also provide a boost in health points or increase the overall stats to gain an advantage against enemies. Super Brave Bursts can also be executed but only if a unit has a 6 Star Rank and maxed out their Brave Burst gauge. Another version, called Ultimate Brave Bursts can be used by 7-Star and Omni Evolution Units after filling the Overdrive gauge. The Omni Evolution units are able to customize their abilities, as well as additions to the effects given from their Brave Burst, Super Brave Burst, and Ultimate Brave Bursts through Enhancements from fusing other units to the Omni Evolution Units. Omni Evolution Units can also do Resonances which requires two of the same element of Omni Evolution units to spark with each other. Aside from quests, the player can also fuse units with the ones obtained in each mission in order to level them up. Once a unit is now in its max level, is it now capable of evolving. The requirements to evolve eligible units are different. Each unit has their own ranking as well, with the Omni Evolution being the highest. Players can obtain more units through Honor Summons and Rare Summons, they require players to use gems and Honor Points in order to summon units. Players can sell units for zel or equip them Spheres and by Gems through micro transactions. Items can also be synthesized into useful items, such as potions, tonics, and revives. Spheres are also made in the same fashion, to increase a unit's overall stats. The town provides a lot of items used for these, some items must be obtained through dungeons cleared by the player. Another thing is the town can provide more important items if the player upgrade each establishments using karma. Brave Frontier has event quests available inside the Vortex Gate, allowing players to obtain evolutionary units, Zel or promotional rare units not found in Rare Summons. Certain dungeons, such as Metal Parades, Jewel Parades, and Imp Parades require keys to unlock for a limited time. In-Game Events are in the Vortex Gate, and players will be rewarded with a free unit if completed. Players can challenge each other in the arena and win prizes for attaining a certain rank. The game also features Frontier Hunter trials, allowing players to raise their Hunter Ranks, Raid Battles, a Slot Machine Feature, Mini games, Daily Missions and Grand Quest.

But I am convinced that if we can somehow represent the fact that players are walking around cities and dungeons, talking to people and fighting monsters, all on a mobile device, they will really get into the RPG world.\\" =Promotional units= Following the game's release, several promotional in-game units were released exclusively in both Japanese and global versions of the game, including crossover units from magazines such as Famitsu and other smartphone games such as Emperors SaGa, Deemo, Puzzle Trooper, Rise of Mana, Secret of Mana, Tales of Link, Rune Story, The King of Fighters, Phantom of the Kill, Shin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse,https://app.famitsu.com/20160215_654510/ Final Fantasy Brave Exvius, Blazing Odyesseyhttp://gamebiz.jp/?p=173070 and Crystal of Reunion.

Some were born there while others settled in the area or painted there. While the term includes painters from the 19th century such as Johan Thomas Lundbye, Vilhelm Kyhn and Vilhelm Melbye, it is applied more specifically to the painters who created landscapes from 1930 to 1970 and who formed an artists' colony. They include Karl Bovin, Kaj Ejstrup, Viggo R√∏rup, Ellen Krause, Lauritz Hartz, Povl Christensen, Victor Brockdorff and Sigurd Swane. The group of Odsherred Painters which emerged in the 1930s was the most recent of Denmark's artists' colonies, the others being the Skagen Painters, the Funen Painters and the Bornholm school of painters. Artists' colony The artists' colony grew up in the 1930s as a number of painters settled in the dramatic landscape in south-western Odsherred in the hilly countryside known as Vejrh√∏jbuen between Sejer√∏ Bay and the now reclaimed Lammefjord. With Karl Bovin and Kaj Ejstrup as central figures, the artists rediscovered Naturalism and Figurativism at a time when Modernism was prevalent. Most of them knew each other from the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. They settled in the same small area developing friendships based on common artistic ambitions. Initially they rented accommodation in old farms and cottages, often just for the summer, but later several of them purchased their own homes in the area. The group were successful in reviving Naturalism in the 1930s, partly by arranging the Corner series of exhibitions in Copenhagen. The colony which started in the 1930s was led by Karl Bovin (1907-85) and Kaj Ejstrup (1902-56). Members included Lauritz Hartz (1903-87), Viggo R√∏rup (1903-71) and his wife Ellen Krause (1905-1990), Victor Brockdorff (19121-92), Ernst Syberg (1906-81), Povl Christensen (1909-77), Alfred Simonsen (1906-35), Ole Kielberg (1911-85), S√∏ren Hjorth Nielsen (1901-83) and Birthe Bovin (1906-80). Bovin, Hartz and R√∏rup spent their entire lives in Odsherred while the others returned for shorter or longer periods each summer. They were attracted by the dramatic landscape with its steep slopes and burial mounds as well as by the rather frugal look of the countryside. It coincided with their wish as naturalists to have a constant source of inspiration for their work. The open skies, extensive fields, rolling hills and coastal flats of Odsherred became the favourite subjects of their landscapes. Initially they were known as M√∏rkemalerne (The Dark Painters) as a result of their sombre palette but later they used brighter, more Impressionistic tones. In Karl Bovin's words: \\"It's all a matter of mapping out an area, and we can also include the seasonal climate we have here in Denmark; that, the climate, has become a constant motif as it is so changeable‚Äîand so it has actually become a kind of Danish Naturalistic painting.\\" Other visiting artists Johan Thomas Lundbye: Zealand Landscape. View from Bjerres√∏ Mark towards Vejrh√∏j and Dragsholm Manor (1840) The first painting of the Odsherred landscape was completed by Johan Thomas Lundbye in 1840. Typical of Denmark's Golden Age, it presents a scene north of Bjergs√∏ with the Vejrh√∏j Hill and Dragsholm Manor. The Odsherred landscape has also been depicted in the works of Vilhelm Kyhn (1819-1903), who painted R√∏rvig, and Theodor Philipsen (1840-1920), who painted the road near F√•revejle and Vejrh√∏j. The hills in the west of Odsherred were painted by Carla Colsmann Mohr (1887-1974), Asta Ring Schultz (1895-1978), Ingrid Wichmann ( 1903-2006 ) and, last but not least, Ejnar Nielsen (1872-1956), who had taught several of the Odsherred Painters at the Academy and was encouraged to join them around 1940. There were also a number of artists who had connections with Vallekilde H√∏jskole in southwest Odsherred. The school was founded by Ernst Trier in 1885, producing several generations of artists. They included Troels Trier (1879-1962) and his sons Holmer (1916-1999) and Ernst (1920-1979). Paul Nyhuus (1910-1970) also had connections with the school. Others included Aksel M√∏ller (1909-1994) who moved to Odsherred in 1944, Helge Ernst (1916-1990), who spent many summers in Odsherred, and the sculptors Johannes Hansen (1903-1995) and Knud Nellemose (1906-1997) who returned to the area every summer. The artists Poul S. Nielsen (1920-1998), Julius Wederkinch (1919-1992) and Johannes Carstensen (1924-2010) lived in the west of Odsherred in the hills, painting the local landscape. Anders Gudmundsen-Holmgreen (1892-1967) painted scenes of summer life and bathing girls in Odsherred. From 1960, Lars Sylvest Jakobsen (1909-2005) lived and painted in Nyk√∏bing while J√∏rgen Brynjolf (1931-1993) and Ole Finding (born 1937) discovered new motifs in Odsherred.

The Porta Claudia ‚Äì or more precisely the Scharnitz Pass ‚Äì is the start of the present federal highways, the B 2 (Germany) and the B 177 (Austria).  History  In the Middle Ages the Scharnitz Pass belonged to the County of Werdenfels, the border between the County of Tyrol then being located at Schlossberg Castle north of Seefeld.Grafschaft Werdenfels - Umfang und Grenzen der Grafschaft: Die tirolische Grenze p. 15, in: Altbayern Reihe I Heft 9: Grafschaft Werdenfels, Komm. f√ºr Bayerische Landesgeschichte, Munich, 1955. The long-term aim of Tyrol was to push the state border north to the strategically important Scharnitz Pass. The Tyrolese achieved a partial success when, on 20 October 1500, Emperor Maximilian I and Prince-Bishop Philip of Freising ratified a treaty agreed the year before that moved the border of Tyrol to within a kilometre south of Scharnitz.Daniel-Erasmus Khan: Die deutschen Staatsgrenzen - rechtshistorische Grundlagen und offene Rechtsfragen. Mohr Siebeck, 2004, pp. 211 f. In 1633, Tyrol was granted the right to build border fortification of Porta Claudia at the Scharnitz Pass on Werdenfels territory in order to protect themselves from the advancing Swedish Army in the Thirty Years' War. The construction of the castle guarding the valley was ordered by Claudia de' Medici, Archduchess of Austria and Princess of Tyrol, to fortify the important crossing from Bavaria to Tyrol. The castle was named after the princess. In a treaty made on 29 October 1656, Scharnitz and the region around the Porta Claudia were swapped for a strip of land around the Kienleitenkopf including the Karolingerhof and rights of way into the Hinterautal valley. In 1670, the fortress was expanded and, in 1703, during the Bavarian Rummel occupied in a raid. The destruction that the blowing up of the powder magazine by the Bavarian garrison had ordered, were soon repaired. In another treaty on 28 May 1766, Tyrol's possession of Scharnitz and the Porta Claudia was confirmed as was a strip of territory \\"at a musket shot's distance at all existing fortification works in the direction of Mittenwald\\".Grafschaft Werdenfels - Umfang und Grenzen der Grafschaft: Die tirolische Grenze p. 16, in: Altbayern Reihe I Heft 9: Grafschaft Werdenfels, Komm. f√ºr Bayerische Landesgeschichte, Munich, 1955. Goethe described the border in 1786 in his report on his trip to Italy as \\"enclosed by a rampart that sealed the valley and was joined to the mountains.\\"Johann Wolfgang von Goethe: Italienische Reise, chapter 3 at Projekt Gutenberg-DE = 1805 siege = During Napoleon's campaign against Austria in 1805, the War of the Third Coalition, French troops under Marshal Ney besieged the passes of Scharnitz and Leutasch on their northern, Bavarian side. At that time the Porta Claudia did not just include the fortifications near Scharnitz, but similar defences a few kilometres west at the entrance to the Leutasch valley, known as the Leutascher Schanz. The ruins of the latter may still be seen.Ruine des Sperrwerkes Leutascher Schanz The VI French Army Corps, with 8,000 to 9,000 men, faced 2,200 Tyrolese. Led by local guides from Mittenwald (Bavaria was on the side of Napol√©on Bonaparte), the French were able to deploy to a flank along a mountain track that ran from the Lautersee and Ferchensee past the Gr√ºnkopf (1,587 m) and attack the Austrians stationed at the Leutascher Schanz fortifications unexpectedly from the rear on 4 November 1805. They were thus able to conquer the Leutascher Schanz and then move via Seefeld to seize the Scharnitz Pass as well and so invade the Inn valley and threaten Innsbruck. The track running past the Gr√ºnkopf was named Franzosensteig (\\"French Path\\") as a result and is still shown as such in modern hiking maps. Allegedly in the ambush on Leutasch only one shell was fired from the cannons. The shell hit the inn, Gasthaus zur M√ºhle, where it is still in the possession of the innkeeper today. Following her defeat in the Austerlitz, in the Peace of Pressburg on 26 December 1805 between Austria and France, Austria had to cede the County of Tyrol and Vorarlberg to Bavaria and Emperor Francis II had to recognise Napoleon as Emperor.  Present condition  Today only a wall, up to high, remains of the Porta Claudia. The remains of the little sconce in the Leutasch may be seen at the old customs post in Unterleutasch-Schanz.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 17, 2014. Setting The mound sits at the southeast edge of Pompano Beach on the western shore of a long narrow Atlantic coast barrier island. The surrounding area is a heavily developed, densely populated mixed use residential neighborhood. In prehistoric times the site was a tropical hardwood hammock opposite Lake Santa Barbara at the mouth of Cypress Creek. The eastern side would have been protected from the Atlantic Ocean by sand dunes and the associated vegetation. At the base of the mound is a layer of \\"black dirt and shell with refuse\\", a likely indication that it was built atop a seasonal camp or village that had been inhabited before the mound was built. History The Tequesta, valuing their dead, placed them in a special place to decompose, then cleaned and prepared the bones for interment in a burial mound. A 1938 excavation unearthed a wooden figure dating to 700 CE; this figure was called the \\"Keeper of the Mound\\" by amateur archeologists and the local press. The mound, dating to as early as 500 CE, has been a park since 1926, and a Pompano Beach city park since the late 1950s. One of 20 to 50 burial mounds erected by the Tequesta in central to southern Florida, it is the only surviving Indian burial mound in urban Broward County. Artifacts discovered near the mound suggest the associated village may have been in existence as late as 1763 CE. Ceramics from the site date from across the three periods of the Glades culture. Modern times Around 1895 the area near the mound was farmed by James W. Pearce, who had settled there. Its designation as a park in 1926 marks it as an early example of historic preservation in Florida. Known as the \\"Pompano Beach Indian Mound\\", it has been studied extensively by amateur and professional archeologists since 1929. Artifacts from the site are curated at the Smithsonian Institution and the Florida Museum of Natural History. The first excavation of the mound by a formally trained archeologist was conducted in 1937 by John Mann Goggin. Goggin's work at the mound contributed to his development of a timeline of the cultures of Florida and was important in establishing his career as an archeologist. In 1938 a study of the mound, supervised by William C. Orchard, was financed by the Heye Foundation Museum of the American Indian. Orchard excavated and removed most of a small check stamped bowl, a shell cup and bead, part of a shell celt, part of a stone celt, most of an iron knife and some pottery sherds. Orchard also removed the human burials remains of one individual. Orchard's permission to excavate was withdrawn by the city following objections from the local community. The remains were reported by the National Park Service in 2010 and will be repatriated to the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida in accordance with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. Human burial remains were also unearthed in 1940 by a permitted excavation and by looting. Between 1946 and 1954 Orin Fogle excavated and removed a Busycon pick, a Strombus celt, a bone awl, a fragment of fossilized bone and a collection of pottery sherds. Fogle also removed bones from at least seven individual human burials. He sold his collection from the mound to the Florida Museum of Natural History. As a part of the 50th anniversary celebration of the City of Pompano Beach in 1958, the site was rededicated as a park for historical preservation and two historical markers were placed. At that time it was also designated a rare bird sanctuary. Archeologist Robert S. Carr surveyed the site in 1974, noting a second smaller mound nearby. When Carr returned for another survey in 1993 he noted the smaller mound had been destroyed by residential construction. In 2003 Christopher Eck surveyed the site and conducted limited excavations near the mound to evaluate the impact of community plans to replant some native coastal hammock plants and trees. The first published mention of the site was possibly in an 1887 book, The East Coast of Florida: A Descriptive Narrative, written by J.M. Hawks about a journey made by the author in 1869. The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2014.

Writer of hundreds of articles and stories for publications such as New York Evening World, New York Evening Sun, Harper's Weekly and Good Housekeeping in the early part of the 20th century, Currie went on to become the editor of Country Gentlemen, Ladies Home Journal, and World's Work. He also authored several books. Currie acquired an important collection of material related to Joseph Conrad when that author was out of favour in the 1920s. Early life and education Currie was born in New York City. He graduated from Harvard University in 1899. Writing career Cover of Officer 666, illustrated by James Montgomery Flagg Cover of The Tractor and Its Influence Upon the Agricultural Implement Industry, 1916 Currie began his writing career in about 1905 at Joseph Pulitzer's New York Evening World, where he worked under Charles Chapin, the \\"Rose Man of Sing Sing\\" who shot and killed his wife. According to James Morris, \\"At the heart of Chapin's news- gathering operation remained his prize rewrite team. Barton Currie was his star\\". Albert Payson Terhune said, \\"He could take a bare handful of semi- statistical notes and turn them, on demand, either into a tensely dramatic or roaringly funny column story\\".Quoted in McGrath, 2003, p. 192. One of his most memorable assignments for the New York Evening World was a report on the landing of Admiral Robert Peary in Labrador upon his historic return from the North Pole in 1909. Currie was a staff reporter for the New York Evening Sun and The New York Times, and also wrote for Harper's Weekly and Good Housekeeping (1909-1911). In all, he wrote hundreds of articles and stories. From 1912 to 1917 he was the associate editor of Country Gentlemen, and worked as editor of that publication from 1917 to 1920. From 1920 to 1928 he was the editor of Ladies Home Journal. At both journals, he solicited Zane Grey to write articles and serialized novels, but their eight-year relationship soured when Currie began to criticize the quality of Grey's work. In 1928 Currie joined Doubleday Doran as editor of World's Work. An example of Currie's versatility is Officer 666, a comic novel written with Augustin MacHugh (1912). Officer 666 was adapted as a stage play on Broadway, produced by George M. Cohan and Sam Harris, which toured the United States in 1912. It was made into the silent film Officer 666 in Australia in 1916, and was also filmed in 1914 and 1920. Currie also wrote The Tractor and Its Influence Upon the Agricultural Implement Industry (1916), reprinting his articles on tractors from his stint on Country Gentlemen. Collecting Currie wrote from personal experience of the effect of bibliomania on the collector in his memoir Fishers of Books (1931): > The first symptom of bibliomania ... manifests itself by producing a form of > somnambulism. You come out of a bookshop carrying a first edition of > something or other. You cannot explain how or why you got it, or what you > paid for it. But you have it; and when you arrive home with it you creep off > to some secluded room and examine it. Then occurs the first little burning > exaltation. Just a little glow to begin with, then by infinite gradations a > consuming fire.Currie, Barton. (1931) Fishers of Books. Boston: Little, > Brown, and Company, p. 22. Other topics in the book included the pros and cons of different methods of collecting, the techniques of various dealers, fellow collectors, highlights from his collection and the effect of the Wall Street Crash on the values of collectible books. In 1935 he defined an antiquarian book-seller as someone \\"who can charge $1,000 for a ten-dollar item and make you feel that he has done you a favor\\". Currie assembled an important collection of material relating to the novelist Joseph Conrad, including a number of manuscripts that he acquired from Dr. Rosenbach, who had obtained them at the John Quinn sale of 1924. After Currie's death in 1962, much of the Conrad material was sold at auction at the Parke-Bernet Galleries on 7 and 8 May 1963. Sometime around 1931, Currie acquired, via Gabriel Wells, the original manuscript for Richard Brinsley Sheridan's The School for Scandal. It was purchased for less than the $75,000 reported in the press at the time.Randall, David A. (1969) Dukedom Large Enough. New York: Random House, p. 77. It was then acquired by Robert H.

The town, granted in 1748 and incorporated in 1777, is the mother town of Franklin and Tilton, and was one of the first to be established by the Masonian proprietors. Unlike towns settled earlier, no specific plan was made for a town center, with the result that Sanbornton Square arose organically as the principal site of civic and religious life in the town. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. The historic district is centered on a stretch of New Hampshire Route 132, between Tower Hill Road and Gulf Road, and radiates for a short distance along a number of secondary roads that meet there. Its western bound is roughly Gulf Brook. The oldest surviving element of the original town is the old cemetery, which lies at the northern end of the district. The present church and town hall both date to c. 1834. These two buildings, along with the 1825 Woodman-Sanborn Academy building, are the major civic structures in the district. The rest of the district is residential, with a number of houses dating to the late 18th century, and most of the remaining buildings dating to the first half of the 19th century.

It is a single-story Cape style house built of brick, with a wood-frame ell to the rear. It is five bays wide and four deep, with a central entrance flanked by sidelight windows and topped by a granite lintel. Four slender chimneys pierce the brick roof. A wood-frame ell extends to the north, and a hip-roof porch with bracketed posts is on the street side. The interior retains original 19th-century woodwork and hardware, including fireplace surrounds, doors, and door latches. The house was probably built in the 1830s, and remains one of the town's best-preserved 19th-century Cape style houses. It underwent a number of alterations, particularly in the early 20th century when the property was in active use as a dairy farm, but these were removed when the building underwent a comprehensive restoration to its original 19th-century appearance in the 1990s. The town purchased the farm in 1970, and briefly housed town offices in the house during the 1980s. It now houses a local history museum.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history The former Morrill Store building is located in the center of Gilford village, at the northwest corner of Belknap Mountain Road and Potter Hill Road. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame clapboarded structure with a gable roof. It is predominantly Greek Revival in style, with pilastered corner boards, and with entablatures and friezes above. A shed-roof porch extends across the main facade, supported by simple brackets. The first floor of the facade has two entrances: a nearly central double-leaf entry flanked by display windows, and a single-leaf entry at the left side, which provides access to the upper floors. A two-story frame addition extends to the left of the main block, with a 1-1/2 story addition extending further from that. The structure was built as a general store in the late 1850s by John Morrill, but the business only lasted a few years. For this use, the ground floor served as the shop, and the upper floor was a storeroom. It served for many years as the local post office, and was purchased by the local Grange organization in 1909. That organization made a series of interior alterations to facilitate its use, converting the retail space into a kitchen and dining hall. In later years it added modernizations, including a modern heating plant. In the 1950s the end wing was adapted for use by the Junior Grange.

The church is designated as the Diocesan Shrine of Saint Th√©r√®se of the Child Jesus of the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Pablo on October 1, 2016.  Church history  The devotion to St. Th√©r√®se of the Child Jesus started in the mid-1920s due to students and professors of the university. Upon petitioning church authorities to build a chapel outside the university's perimeter fence, a chapel was built in honor of St. Th√©r√®se in 1927 with a seating capacity of 120 people. Since then, it became the unofficial university chapel. The parish was officially established under the Archdiocese of Lipa in 1958. It serves the spiritual needs of the former parishioners of the Immaculate Conception Parish living around the University of the Philippines College of Agriculture and College of Forestry. The first parish priest was Father John Hurley. Due to lack of priests, the parish was administered by priests from the Society of the Divine Word (SVD) for 33 years. The present church with a seating capacity of 1,500 was built and blessed in 1971. In 2000, the secular priests took charge of the parish with Monsignor Bernardino Cortez and Father Gabriel Ma. Delfino as parish priest and assistant parish priest respectively. When Monsignor Cortez was appointed as Auxiliary Bishop of Manila, Monsignor James Contreras succeeded as parish priest. From 2008 to 2013, the church was administered by Father Jose Thor R. Villacarlos. Currently, the parish is under the pastoral care of Father Luis A. Tolentino. In 2013, the relics of St. Th√©r√®se visited the UPLB community as part of its world pilgrimage.

Plot summary The world is exposed to a highly contagious virus. Most who get sick experience nothing worse than flu-like symptoms. For 1%, the virus causes the victims to be fully awake, but unable to move or respond to stimulus. This is known as \\"Lock In\\", and resembles the real condition known as locked-in syndrome. The illness comes to be known as \\"Haden's Syndrome\\" with its victims called \\"Hadens\\". Humanoid robotic personal transport units controlled by a Haden's brain (nicknamed \\"Threeps\\" after C-3PO from Star Wars) are developed as the primary way for a Haden to interact with the outside world. 25 years after the initial virus exposure, FBI agents Chris Shane (who is a Haden) and Leslie Vann are assigned to a Haden-related murder, with a suspect who is an \\"Integrator\\" ‚Äì someone who can let a Haden use their bodies. If the Integrator was carrying a Haden, then finding the suspect for the murder is complicated. Further Integrator-Haden related murders occur, making the case larger than expected, and as Shane and Vann dig deeper, they uncover a plot to completely shake up the Haden economy. Companion novella Lock In is accompanied by a novella, Unlocked: An Oral History of Haden's Syndrome, which provides background details about the origins of the epidemic.John Scalzi: Unlocked: An Oral History of Haden's Syndrome: New York: Tor: 2014 TV adaptation Legendary Television acquired the rights to Lock In to adapt it into a TV pilot in 2014.

He became a naturalised British citizen in 1711, before exploiting family connections to rise to prominence as a leading merchant in Russia; his links with the Russian Company allowed for him to become a major exporter of Russian goods to Britain in the 1730s. As favour at the imperial court changed from 1740, he moved over to London, where he ran his affairs from offices on Broad Street until his death.  Early life and origins  Estimates place Shiffner's birth and around 1690. Although speculation and rumours by later genealogists made him a son of \\"an Archbishop of Riga\\", Shiffner's origins are obscure, though he likely hailed from a Baltic German background.Price, \\"Shiffner, Matthew\\", O.D.N.B., 2011 He became a naturalised English Citizen in 1711 under the Foreign Protestants Naturalization Act 1708.Namier, \\"Shiffner, Henry\\", History of Parliament, 1964 Shortly afterwards, he joined the Russian Company, which had, until 1698, a monopoly on trade between England and Russia and continued to operate successfully for over two centuries afterwards. He returned to Russia and is recorded as a 'Postdirektor' of Riga in 1720; he married into a locally prominent Baltic German family when he took as his wife Hedwig Agnata Bruiningk, daughter of Heintrich Bruiningk, a university-educated pastor and Generalsuperintendant of the Lutheran Church in Livonia. In 1723 he moved to St Petersburg and traded hemp in partnership with Jacob Wolff and John Edwards; his trading is recorded in the accounts of Samuel Holden and Thomas Wale.  Career  When Duchess Anna of Courland became Tsarina (Empress) of Russia in 1730, German Baltic merchants were able to use their pre-existing connections with the Ducal family to further their trade interests. Shiffner's wife was said to have been a governess to the Duchess, and her younger sister, Anna Lucia, was a maid of honour. Shiffner and his partner, Wolff, exploited these connections to become one of the largest trading houses in the city. In 1730, the firm contracted for 1,500 barrels of potash, for instance, while also trading rhubarb, hemp and other commodities. It went on to ship 3,600 tons of Iron from Siberia during the early 1730s. Further contracts followed in 1734 and 1735, the latter making them the largest traders of rhubarb in Russia. Samuel Holden dealt with the British arrangements, receiving up to a half of the contract from Wolff and Shiffner.Cross, By the Banks of the Neva, p. 56 The Tsarina's death in 1740 ended the prominence of the firm and Shiffner moved back to London, where he established offices on Broad Street and later in Bishopsgate Without.London Land Tax Records, MS 11316, vols. 213, MS 11316/126, 129, 132, 138, 141, 144, 147, 150, 153, 156, 159, 165, 168, 171 and MS 11313, vol. 135.

It is the oldest, continually-operating gay bar in the state of Wisconsin. The bar is located in a building constructed in 1915 on the corner of Jefferson and Wells streets. The space the bar occupies has been used as a bar and tavern since 1936, previously known as \\"The Establishment\\", and before that \\"Vern's Tap\\". History May 1973 advertisement, GPU News This Is It! is a gay bar established in 1968 by Catherine \\"June\\" Brehm and business partner Michael Latona. June took control of the bar, known previously as \\"The Establishment\\", in 1968. Extensive remodels were done in 1969, and the bar has kept the same style since. While records do not indicate the exact date June and her business partner Michael split, it is clear that she assumed full control on June 18, 1970. Joseph Brehm became a part-owner of This Is It! after his mother, June, suffered a stroke in 1981, and he operated the bar concurrently with June until her death in 2010. After managing the bar at This Is It!, George Schneider became a part-owner in 2012. The location in Milwaukee, WI has remained the same since the bar's inception. The bar has never \\"shut down\\" or \\"closed its doors\\" for any period of time outside of normal maintenance and repairs. It is the oldest, continually operating gay bar in the State of Wisconsin. Joseph Brehm died on April 3, 2016 from complications associated with ALS leaving full control of the establishment to his business partner, George Schneider. Schneider continues to operate the bar in the tradition of Joe and June, saying \\"Joe and June had this bar for the first 50 years, or almost 50. I'm the custodian of a huge amount of history and their legacy. I will make sure it keeps on going for another 50.\\" In October 2016 Michael Fisher, a long-time bartender at This is It, was named as a partner in the business. The adjacent restaurant to the bar, Louise's, closed its doors in August 2018. Schneider and Fisher were able to acquire and additional 1200 sq. ft. of space previously used as a private dining room for Louise's, and began construction on an expansion project in September 2018. The project not only doubled the venue's overall size and capacity, it also added a new \\"show bar\\", dance floor, and performance space with a removable, modular stage. The addition opened to the publice for the first time the evening of January 11, 2019 with a grand opening hosted on January 17, 2019. After remodeling and adding the new performance space, Schneider and Fisher were able to obtain a Center for Visual and Performing Arts license from the City of Milwaukee, allowing the bar to host 18+ patrons on select nights. The license allowed the bar to host a safe place for 18+ patrons and is the only LGBT+ bar in Milwaukee to host 18+ nights and events. In order to obtain this license, the bar worked in conjunction with The Wisconsin LGBTQ History Project to install historical panels highlighting the history of the gay bar scene in Milwaukee. This installation not only satisfied the qualifications to obtain the license, but also created an opportunity for patrons of all ages to learn the history of the LGBT+ bar scene in their city. Recognition Letter from Senator Tammy Baldwin This Is it! has been voted 'BEST Gay and Lesbian Bar' since 2012 via the A-List on WISN.com (A-list not compiled in 2015). The Bar was featured in the book \\"Bottoms Up: A Toast to Wisconsin's Historic Bars & Breweries\\" by Jim Draeger & Mark Speltz, published by the Wisconsin Historical Society Press. The bar was also included in the 2019 publication \\"111 Places to Visit in Milwaukee That You Must Not Miss\\" by Michelle Madden. The Madden publication is the first to highlight the bar's expansion of 2018-2019. In March 2016, Joseph and June Brehm, as well as the bar itself, were recognized for their contributions to the LGBT community by Senator Tammy Baldwin. A copy of this letter is embedded in this article. Just prior to his Joseph Brehm's death, Milwaukee's mayor, Tom Barrett, proclaimed Thursday, March 31, 2016 \\"Joe Brehm Day\\", recognizing not only June Brehm's and Joseph Brehm's LGBT community involvement, but also the bar's significance as \\"a place that welcomes members of the LGBT community into a place of acceptance and safety\\" since 1968. 50th Anniversary Accolade On May 9, 2018, the Milwaukee County Historical Society recognized This is It! at its Annual Awards Dinner. An Anniversary Accolade for 50 years of business was presented to the bar, citing the bar's \\"welcoming environment as the oldest continually opering gay bar in Milwaukee and Wisconsin\\". Logo Redesign Contest In preparation for its 50th anniversary in 2018, This is It! hosted a logo redesign contest. Voting was conducted via the bar's website to narrow down to the top 4 submissions, and the 4 finalists were voted on in-person in the bar on 4/11/17. The winning design was created by James \\"Thommy\\" Harless. Community involvement Front view of bar, 2012 This Is It! sponsors and supports LGBT+ and LGBT+ friendly organizations, and attempts to foster community involvement with its patrons. The bar started hosting a monthly \\"Pink Hat Party\\" fundraising event in January, 2012. Beneficiaries of the monthly \\"Pink Hat Party\\" have included the Milwaukee LGBT Community Center, Aids Resource Center of Wisconsin, Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra, Cream City Foundation, and the G/L Community Fund. Early in 2018, the bar discontinued the Pink Hat Parties. According to ownership, the bar will be continuing the tradition of fundraising under different formats. This Is it! has repeatedly sponsored the Milwaukee LGBT Community Center's Loft Lounge at PrideFest Milwaukee. Owner George Schneider also volunteered as PrideFest Milwaukee's Operations Director for many years as well as briefly serving as a board member during his last year with the organization. He resigned from PrideFest, Inc., now Milwaukee Pride, Inc., after the 2012 festival season, but he and bar co-owner Michael Fisher continue to support the organization and annual festival. At their annual meeting on April 6, 2018, Milwaukee LGBT Community Center members elected owner Schneider to their Board of Directors. On a visit to Vancouver, British Columbia in October 2018, Schneider was impressed by that city's rainbow crosswalk installations. He shared an image on the bar's social media, and proposed the ides that Milwaukee should have similar crosswalk installations. The post was well received and Schneider began working with the City of Milwaukee to make the crosswalks a reality. It took nearly 2 years of work and cooperating with the City of Milwaukee to lay the foundations to install the crosswalks - the initial proposal being rejected. Finally, after seeking the aide of Milwaukee Pride, Inc., the East Town Association, and other community partners, the City of Milwaukee approved the installation officially on October 29, 2018. The crosswalks were painted on the morning of November 3, 2018 and a dedication ceremony hosted by Mayor Tom Barrett and Alderman Robert Bauman officially opened the crosswalks to the public.

It is a study of family life centered on a Norwegian immigrant family in San Francisco early in the 20th century. The play premiered on Broadway on October 19, 1944 at the Music Box Theatre in New York City, where it ran for 713 performances; it was produced by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II. The cast included Mady Christians, Oscar Homolka, and Joan Tetzel. Marlon Brando played a minor role, making his Broadway debut as Nels. Synopsis The play revolves around the life of a loving Norwegian immigrant family, the Hansons, living on Steiner Street\\"Remembering I Remember Mama\\", New York Magazine; May 14, 1979 in San Francisco soon after the turn of the 20th century. Told through the nostalgic eye of Katrin, one of three daughters, it is the story of a working-class family trying to live the American dream. Papa Hanson is a blue-collar worker; he and Mama attempt to raise their four children so that they understand the difference between right and wrong, between selfishness and selflessness. They are assisted by Mama's uncle, Uncle Chris, whose gruff exterior hides his inner charm and generosity. Mama and Papa (Marta and Lars) believe in hard work and a good education. They struggle to put their son, Nels, through high school, as each member of the family sacrifices in order to accomplish this. They are warm and affectionate to each other, but very frugal in their use of funds. The three aunts, Jenny, Sigrid and Trina, offer a counterpoint, as the first two are usually selfish and petty, while Aunt Trina is mostly kind. Through their hard work, wise financial decisions, and creative common sense, Mama and Papa manage to raise and educate their children. Productions =Original= The play opened at the Music Box Theatre in New York City on October 19, 1944, starring Mady Christians, Richard Biship, Joan Tetzel and Oscar Homolka.

It would be Rogers' last work prior to his death in December of that year. The play was produced at the Majestic Theatre, where it previewed on April 26, 1979, and officially opened on May 31. The production ran for 108 performances, closing on September 2, and starred Liv Ullmann, George Hearn, and George S. Irving.

His third week was the big one, as a starter in the scoreless tie with the Michigan Wolverines at the dedication of Dudley Field, Reese made 105 yards on punt returns, including one return of 24 yards.

Both Reese and Wolverine halfback Harry Kipke were \\"marked men\\"; and Vanderbilt's offense never crossed the 35-yard line. Reese and Doc Kuhn were said to raise fans to their feet with the showcase of speed, but the Wolverines kept it confined to sideways runs of little gain.cf. The game versus the Tennessee Volunteers saw Vanderbilt gain 455 yards of total offense, winning 51 to 7. Reese rushed for 214 yards, as well as 95 yards on punt returns. He scored five times, with touchdown runs of 70 yards, 45 yards, and 29 yards respectively. With the win Vanderbilt was still a contender for the Southern title. Reese again stuffed the stat sheet against the Georgia Bulldogs the next week, scoring four touchdowns. Two came on punt returns, and another two on the ground. Fred Russell would say this was when \\"the Gold and Black hit the season's peak.\\" Morgan Blake, sportswriter in the Atlanta Journal, wrote \\"No southern team has given the Georgia Bulldogs such a licking in a decade.\\" Reese foreshadowed what was to come with a 23-yard run. The first touchdown came on a 5-yard run from Reese behind guard Tuck Kelly. Just a bit later, Reese returned a punt for 63 yards and the touchdown. Reese started the return by running wide to the right; seven Georgia players were in hot pursuit. Reese stopped in his tracks, causing two Georgia defenders to go past him. Running down the sideline and weaving through the rest of the defenders' missed tackles, eventually Reese was beyond them all and ran in for the score. Morgan Blake says this score was what broke the Bulldogs' will. He further lamented,\\"when you say that Mr. Reese is a combination of a greyhound, rabbit, antelope, and greased pig you only mildly do this young gentleman justice.\\" The first half ended with Vanderbilt up 14 to 0. The Bulldogs had not yet managed a single first down. Later in the third quarter, Reese ran for 30 yards on a sneak play. It \\"not only fooled the Bulldogs but everyone in the stands.\\" It seemed there was a moment of not knowing where the ball was, until Reese shot out the other side of the line. Punishing runs off tackle then led the Commodores to another touchdown. In the fourth quarter, Reese ran for an 81-yard touchdown. He did it running up the middle of the field, and \\"behind great interference furnished by the entire Vanderbilt team, and especially Bomar and Kuhn.\\" Former Vanderbilt coach Wallace Wade, who was at the game scouting Georgia, said the Commodores that day were \\"the smartest I ever saw.\\" Reese ran for over 200 yards for the second week in a row, with 232 yards on his five largest plays and over 300 total yards. The final game of the year versus Sewanee was marred by the rain. On a fourth down Doc Kuhn hit Reese on a pass, and Reese scampered across the goal line. Vanderbilt won 7 to 0. Reese in uniform on the sidelines. Reese was selected to be All-Southern. In the polling done by the Atlanta Journal, Reese received the second most votes of any All-Southern player with 25. Reese was the leading scorer on the Vanderbilt offense of 1923, responsible for at least 60 of the team's 137 points, on ten touchdowns. He was selected as a Third Team All-American by David J. Walsh of the International News Service.\\"Walsh Picks Three Teams of All-Americans In 1923 Seasonal Postmortem\\". The Coshocton Tribune. December 6, 1923. 1924 In the second week of play in 1924, Reese scored four touchdowns as Vanderbilt smothered the Birmingham‚ÄìSouthern Panthers 61-0. The score was not so expected, for the Panthers had held Auburn to merely a 7-0 victory the week before.Vanderbilt Yearbook, The Commodore, 1925 Ralph McGill described Reese's day: \\"He stars. A man dashes at him and goes sprawling on the ground. There is another. A twist of the body and a step to the side and he is gone, left to lie on the sod and meditate on the fate that is his. Three or four men rush at him. There is a swirl of action, flying feet and diving bodies, and out of it‚ÄîReese running with the grace of a deer. Reese's action is never desperate. He never seems harassed or hurried. His spectacular runs are things of athletic beauty, There is no lost motion. It is perfect.\\" The next week the Commodores tied the Quantico Marines 13 to 13. The Commodores' second touchdown came on a 59-yard drive with a flurry of forward passes; as well as runs from Tom Ryan through the line and Gil Reese around it. Reese eventually ran into the end zone. Two weeks later against Georgia, 1923 consensus All-American Lynn Bomar suffered an injury which would tragically end his career with Vanderbilt football. A kick to the chin from a cleat gave him a severe brain hemorrhage, leaving him with half of his body paralyzed for two days. It was figured he would never play football again. \\"Not a player on the team could talk of Bomar's injury without tears coming to his eyes.\\" Gil Reese once recollected: \\"He would never let them jump on me. Whenever anyone would threaten me, Bomar was always right there to say; \\"Keep your hands off that boy.\\" They always did, too. Bomar always looked after me, and he always called back to me when we started on end runs. No one could run interference like Bomar.\\"Traughber, William L. Vanderbilt Football: Tales of Commodore Gridiron History. Charleston, South Carolina: History, 2011. pp. 89 Bomar would defy the odds and return to play football the very next year with the New York Giants in their inaugural season, leaving after 1926 from a different injury. During the first quarter of the game against the Mississippi A & M Aggies, Reese caught a punt from the Aggies' halfback Patty and ran 54 yards for a touchdown behind excellent blocking. The next game saw the Commodores avenge the 44 to 0 drubbing of 1920 with a 3 to 0 victory in 1924. The Commodores were followed by the largest crowd ever to accompany Vanderbilt on a trip, with five special sections. The lone score of the game could largely be credited to Reese. Vanderbilt elected to start the game with the wind at its back, hoping for an edge in punts which would lead to good field position early. Reese caught one of these punts in these exchanges on the fly and, noticing both of Tech's ends blocked to the ground, raced to within striking distance of the end zone. From here, Hek Wakefield made a drop kick. Reese's day on the ground was not so spectacular, having a total of - 15 yards rushing. Gil Reese being tackled during the Minnesota game. The next week against the Minnesota Golden Gophers at Memorial Stadium saw the first victory for Vanderbilt over a Northern school. The Commodores made not one substitution. \\"It was the most glorious victory in the annals of Vanderbilt and Southern football\\" said the Vanderbilt yearbook. The first touchdown drive ended when Tom Ryan broke through a hole created by Bob Rives, finishing a 63-yard drive. A pass from Ox McKibbon to Reese, and off tackle runs by Ryan, Reese, and Neil Cargile put the Commodores in the position to score. Vanderbilt did not get a single first down in the second quarter. Later, in the third quarter, McKibbon threw a pass which gained 18 yards, and then threw another one of 10 yards, to Reese, who ran in the score. Reese made the All- Southern squad at year's end. He was also selected as a Third-Team All- American by Norman E. Brown.Norman E. Brown (December 8, 1924). \\"Brown Picks All-American Team for the Journal\\". Hamilton Evening Journal. Gil was elected to captain the team the next year. 1925 In the 1925 game against the Tennessee Volunteers, Reese had the longest run of the college football season up to that point, of 95 yards. Describing the most spectacular play he ever saw, Georgia Tech coach William Alexander cites one from the 1925 game against Vanderbilt. Star back Doug Wycoff was hurt, such that he had to use his substitute Dick Wright. On a muddy field, Wright ran off tackle and dodged Vanderbilt's safety Gil Reese, \\"usually a sure tackler\\", to get the touchdown to give Tech a 7 to 0 victory. His final game was a 19-7 win over Sewanee. Fred Russell's Fifty Years of Vanderbilt Football stated, \\"Gil Reese played one of his greatest games but sobbed as he pulled off his No. 11 jersey in the locker room. He was through.\\" Reese then played in the first East‚ÄìWest Shrine Game in San Francisco. =Basketball= 1923‚Äì24 The 1923‚Äì24 team coached by Josh Cody went 7-15\\\\.

Along with Bomar, All-Southern forward Alvin Bell was also a teammate. The team lost the next game to the eventual tournament champion, Jack Cobb and Cartwright Carmichael led North Carolina, 37-20. When Bomar was injured in 1924 and could no longer play basketball, Reese was made the team's captain. =Baseball= Reese also played baseball at Vanderbilt, at a different position each year.

Macfarlane Gray, was a Scottish engineer who invented a portable steam riveting machine and a steam steering mechanism for Isambard Kingdom Brunel's famous SS Great Eastern. Early years John Macfarlane Gray was born on 7 April 1831 in Kincardine, Scotland. His father was a draper. McFarlane Gray had no interest in following his father's trade. He left home and moved to Edinburgh where he worked as an apprentice while studying the Hebrew and Greek languages, mathematics and mechanics. He then moved to Paisley where he worked for Mr. Blackwood, later a partner in Blackwood and Gordon. He next obtained a position with McNab's marine engineering works in Greenock. Here he worked as an engineer, and was rapidly promoted. Gray returned to Blackwood and Gordon's, which had now moved to Port Glasgow. His employers recommended him for a position as chief draftsman and manager at the George Forrester and Company engineering works in Liverpool. About 1855 McFarlane Gray saw a large gyroscope being exhibited by Sir William Armstrong at the Newcastle Philosophical Institution, and spent some time working out exactly how it worked. He later explained the engineering principles to the officers of the Board of Trade. According to The Nautical Magazine, \\"so far as we are aware, the first example of direct calculation of gyroscopic effect as an engineering quality is due to Mr. McFarlane Gray, and made in relation to strains resulting from rolling and pitching on the shafts of fly-wheels attached to marine engines. Later career McFarlane Gray's steam steering engine from the Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers 1868 Gray designed marine engines and various types of machinery at George Forrester's. In 1866 he patented a steam steering engine that incorporated feedback. It was first used in the SS Great Eastern, the largest and most advanced ship of the day. This brought him acclaim in the engineering world. At that time as many as a hundred men might be needed to work the steering gear in an armoured cruiser moving at full speed. Gray was asked to look into using steam power for the steering gears. The invention was first tried in March 1867. The trial was successful and the steam steering gear was generally adopted. Gray said of the steering device much later, In Gray's invention the angle of the rudder is transmitted to a differential screw, which in turn controls a steam valve that supplies power to a motor that turns the rudder. As the rudder approaches the desired angle indicated by the helm the steam valve is adjusted to reduce power. If it moves away from that angle the valve opens to increase power and return the rudder to its position. Gray had invented a servomechanism, a name coined by the French engineer Joseph Farcot. Farcot must be given equal credit for the concept, which he had developed independently. Gray became a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1865. He also became a member of the Royal Institution of Naval Architects. He was a Vice-President of the Institute of Marine Engineers from its foundation in 1889. McFarlane Gray wanted engineers to act according to the importance of their position. He said, \\"If engineers will aim at so conducting themselves that they are never spoken of otherwise as being 'quite equal if not superior to the deck officers in their language and behaviour', and if that pertains to their highly intellectual calling that makes themselves masters both of theory and the practice, the time would not be very distant when their importance in steamers would be fully recognized.\\" Gray was employed by the Board of Trade in Liverpool, then in Cork and finally in London, where he was appointed chief examiner of marine engineers. In this position his influence was limited since Board of Trade policy did not allow publication of the individual opinions of their engineering officers, but he was able to present some theoretical papers at meetings of engineers. Macfarlane Gray was instrumental in introducing the use of entropy-temperature diagrams, described by Professor Josiah Willard Gibbs, for solving steam engine problems. He retired in 1906 and settled in Edinburgh. He died 14 January 1908 aged 76. Publications Around 1885 McFarlane Gray wrote a report about the second law of thermo-dynamics that caused some controversy. The Council of the Royal Society declined to allow him to read the report before the Society. The society first asked for more information about his investigations. However, he read papers on the subject before the Physical Society and the Institution of Naval Architects, and planned to publish a book giving the results of his researches into thermodynamics. Gray presented papers on theoretical subjects related to steam power that included: *1885 The Theoretical Duty of Heat in the Steam-Engine Results of an investigation on the Theta-Phi diagram, read before the Institution of Naval Architects *1889 The Ether-Pressure Theory of Thermodynamics applied to Steam, also read before the Institution of Naval Architects *1889 The Rationalization of Regnault's Experiments on Steam, Paris.

They were South Cushitic speaking pastoralists, who tended to bury their dead in cairns whilst their toolkit was characterized by stone bowls, pestles, grindstones and earthenware pots. Through archaeology, historical linguistics and archaeogenetics, they conventionally have been identified with the area's first Afroasiatic-speaking settlers. Archaeological dating of livestock bones and burial cairns has also established the cultural complex as the earliest center of pastoralism and stone construction in the region. Overview The makers of the Savanna Pastoral Neolithic culture are believed to have arrived in the Rift Valley sometime during the Pastoral Neolithic period (c. 3,000 BCE-700 CE). Through a series of migrations from Horn of Africa, these early Cushitic-speaking pastoralists brought cattle and caprines southward from the Sudan and/or Ethiopia into northern Kenya, probably using donkeys for transportation. According to archaeological dating of associated artifacts and skeletal material, they first settled in the lowlands of Kenya between 5,200 and 3,300 ybp, a phase referred to as the Lowland Savanna Pastoral Neolithic. They subsequently spread to the highlands of Kenya and Tanzania around 3,300 ybp, which is consequently known as the Highland Savanna Pastoral Neolithic phase. Excavations in the area indicate that the Savanna Pastoral Neolithic peoples were primarily cattle pastoralists. They milked this livestock, and also possessed goats, sheep, and donkeys. They typically buried their deceased in cairns. Their toolkit was characterized by a blade and bladelet-based lithic industry, earthenware pots, stone bowls and pestles, and occasional grindstones. The Savanna Pastoral Neolithic peoples sometimes hunted medium and large game on the plains, and during the culture's lowland phase, they likewise fished in Lake Turkana. Sonia Mary Cole (1954) indicates that certain pestles and grindstones that she excavated from ochreous levels were stained with ochre, while others from the carbonized layers were not. She consequently suggests that the latter were instead used for grinding grain. Other scholars have argued that there is no direct archaeological evidence that SPN peoples cultivated grains or other plant domesticates. Although detailed information on this segment of African prehistory is not abundant, data so far available reveal a succession of cultural transformations within the Savanna Pastoral Neolithic. The transformations seem to have been fostered by both environmental change and population movements. Among these changes was the apparent abandonment of the stone bowls at around 1,300 years before present. Ancient DNA analysis of a Savanna Pastoral Neolithic bone excavated at the Luxmanda site in Tanzania found that the specimen carried a large proportion of ancestry related to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic culture of the Levant, similar to that borne by modern Afroasiatic-speaking populations inhabiting the Horn of Africa. This suggests that the Savanna Pastoral Neolithic culture bearers may have been Cushitic speakers. Language The SPN peoples are believed to have spoken languages from the South Cushitic branch of the Afroasiatic. According to Christopher Ehret, linguistic research suggests that these Savanna Pastoral Neolithic populations were the first Afroasiatic speakers to settle in the Central Rift Valley and surrounding areas. The region was at the time of their arrival inhabited by Khoisan hunter-gatherers who spoke Khoisan languages and practiced an Eburran blade industry. Recent genetic analysis of ancient remains has proven that the population of the Savanna Pastoral Neolithic were also responsible for the pastoralist Elmenteitan culture that lived in the Rift Valley during the same period. The linguistic chronology of the historic population movements into the Central Rift Valley as well as the present and past distribution of Afro-Asiatic speakers further suggests that SPN peoples likely spoke South Cushitic languages. Ehret (1998) proposes that among these idioms were the now extinct Tale and Bisha languages, which were identified on the basis of loanwords. These early Cushitic speakers in the region largely disappeared following the Bantu Expansion. Distribution The Savanna Pastoral Neolithic culture was initially distributed at elevations below 1100 m in lowland northern Kenya (Lowland Savanna Pastoral Neolithic). Its range later extended to the highlands between central Kenya and northern Tanzania, at elevations above 1,500 m (Highland Savanna Pastoral Neolithic). The preferred settlement location for SPN sites was open wooded grassland on well- drained, gentle slopes of between 1,500 m to 2,050 m. Material culture The Savanna Pastoral Neolithic makers' characteristic stone bowls have been recovered from both their occupation sites and burial cairns. Their material culture was typified by several pottery styles, up to three of which may be found at a single site. Nderit pottery (previously known as Gumban A) was produced by early SPN herders in the Turkana Basin. The most diagnostic SPN pottery farther south is Narosura pottery, and some scholars group Akira (TIP), Maringishu (trellis motif), and herringbone-motif wares in with the SPN as well. In terms of funerary tradition, the Savanna Pastoral Neolithic peoples erected stone cairns in open spaces, rock shelters, crevices or against walls. The deceased were buried with a number of items, including stone bowls, pestle rubbers and ochre palettes. Large obsidian blades and other tools were also occasionally among the mortuary objects. Incisor removal was not a common feature of this population.

It delivers Canada's participation in multinational efforts to control driftnetting and other forms of illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing in the North Pacific Ocean. Operation DRIFTNET is conducted under a Memorandum of Understanding between DFO and the Department of National Defence. History The first patrols of Operation DRIFTNET were flown in 1993. Fishing in the international waters of the Pacific Ocean was not regulated until 1952, when the International Convention for the High-Seas Fisheries of the North Pacific came into force under the aegis of the United Nations. By 1989, driftnet fishing was so common that up to 2 million square miles of nets were set each year. Between 1989 and 1991, the U.N. General Assembly made three increasingly stringent resolutions on driftnet fishing. The last of the series, Resolution 46/215 of 20 December 1991, called on all members of the international community to implement a global moratorium on large-scale pelagic driftnet fishing in international waters by 31 December 1992. In 1992, the Convention for the Conservation of Anadromous Stocks in the North Pacific Ocean replaced the International Convention for the High Seas Fisheries of the North Pacific and established the North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission (NPAFC). Canada, Japan, the Russian Federation and the United States are charter members of the NPAFC; the Republic of Korea joined as a full member in 2003, and the People's Republic of China became a non-member supporter in 2006. Member nations of the NPAFC work to detect and apprehend vessels involved in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in the North Pacific. The Task Force The task force deployed on Operation DRIFTNET is made up from the long-range patrol squadrons of the Royal Canadian Air Force and their CP-140 Aurora maritime patrol aircraft, under operational command and control of the Joint Force Air Component Commander in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Flying with CP-140 Aurora crews from the municipal airport in Hakodate, on Japan's northern island of Hokkaido, DFO Fishery Officers conduct surveillance patrols over the high- threat zone in the international waters of the North Pacific Ocean. Using the Aurora's enhanced electronic sensor suite, the Fishery Officers and the Aurora sensor operators look for signs of illegal fishing and activity, and gather imagery for use as evidence in enforcement action. Operation DRIFTNET is supported by the Canadian Armed Forces Polar Epsilon project, which provides RADARSAT-2 satellite imagery. Mission Operation DRIFTNET is an important component of Canada's contribution to the NPAFC. More than four million square kilometres of the North Pacific Ocean are monitored every year, with patrols taking place throughout spring, summer and fall. When illegal activity by a vessel is confirmed by a patrol, the ship's flag is identified and the vessel's nation is responsible for prosecuting the violator. Operation DRIFTNET patrols also deter potential illegal fishing activity, due to their presence.

Upon reaching maturity, parasites can remain attached by a posterior opisthaptor with its 8 associated clamps (4 in 2 rows). Adults may reach a few millimetres in length. D. sagittata feeds on the blood of the gills via an anterior mouth part. Adults are hermaphrodite, and produce 3‚Äì14 eggs per day at 13 ¬∞C, a process which is temperature dependent. Once produced, eggs drop to the riverbed surface and at 13 ¬∞C take 28 days to develop to hatching larval forms.

Background From 1964 to 1966 Varchenko studied at the Moscow Kolmogorov boarding school No. 18 for gifted high school students, where Andrey Kolmogorov and Ya. A. Smorodinsky were lecturing mathematics and physics. Varchenko graduated from Moscow State University in 1971. He was a student of Vladimir Arnold. Varchenko defended his Ph.D. thesis Theorems on Topological Equisingularity of Families of Algebraic Sets and Maps in 1974 and Doctor of Science thesis Asymptotics of Integrals and Algebro-Geometric Invariants of Critical Points of Functions in 1982. From 1974 to 1984 he was a research scientist at the Moscow State University, in 1985‚Äì1990 a professor at the Gubkin Institute of Gas and Oil, and since 1991 he has been the Ernest Eliel Professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Varchenko was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1974 in Vancouver (section of algebraic geometry) and in 1990 in Kyoto (a plenary address). In 1973 he received the Moscow Mathematical Society Award. Research In 1971, Varchenko proved that a family of complex quasi- projective algebraic sets with an irreducible base form a topologically locally trivial bundle over a Zariski open subset of the base. This statement, conjectured by Oscar Zariski, had filled up a gap in the proof of Zariski's theorem on the fundamental group of the complement to a complex algebraic hypersurface published in 1937. In 1973, Varchenko proved Ren√© Thom's conjecture that a germ of a generic smooth map is topologically equivalent to a germ of a polynomial map and has a finite dimensional polynomial topological versal deformation, while the non-generic maps form a subset of infinite codimension in the space of all germs. Varchenko was among creators of the theory of Newton polygons in singularity theory, in particular, he gave a formula, relating Newton polygons and asymptotics of the oscillatory integrals associated with a critical point of a function. Using the formula, Varchenko constructed a counterexample to V. I. Arnold's semicontinuity conjecture that the brightness of light at a point on a caustic is not less than the brightness at the neighboring points. Varchenko formulated a conjecture on the semicontinuity of the spectrum of a critical point under deformations of the critical point and proved it for deformations of low weight of quasi- homogeneous singularities. Using the semicontinuity, Varchenko gave an estimate from above for the number of singular points of a projective hypersurface of given degree and dimension. Varchenko introduced the asymptotic mixed Hodge structure on the cohomology, vanishing at a critical point of a function, by studying asymptotics of integrals of holomorphic differential forms over families of vanishing cycles. Such an integral depends on the parameter ‚Äì the value of the function. The integral has two properties: how fast it tends to zero, when the parameter tends to the critical value, and how the integral changes, when the parameter goes around the critical value. The first property was used to define the Hodge filtration of the asymptotic mixed Hodge structure and the second property was used to define the weight filtration. The second part of the 16th Hilbert problem is to decide if there exists an upper bound for the number of limit cycles in polynomial vector fields of given degree. The infinitesimal 16th Hilbert problem, formulated by V. I. Arnold, is to decide if there exists an upper bound for the number of zeros of an integral of a polynomial differential form over a family of level curves of a polynomial Hamiltonian in terms of the degrees of the coefficients of the differential form and the degree of the Hamiltonian. Varchenko proved the existence of the bound in the infinitesimal 16th Hilbert problem. Vadim Schechtman and Varchenko identified in the Knizhnik‚ÄìZamolodchikov equations (or, KZ equations) with a suitable Gauss‚ÄìManin connection and constructed multidimensional hypergeometric solutions of the KZ equations. In that construction the solutions were labeled by elements of a suitable homology group. Then the homology group was identified with a multiplicity space of the tensor product of representations of a suitable quantum group and the monodromy representation of the KZ equations was identified with the associated R-matrix representation. This construction gave a geometric proof of the Kohno-Drinfeld theorem on the monodromy of the KZ equations. A similar picture was developed for the quantum KZ equations (or, qKZ-type difference equations) in joint works with Giovanni Felder and Vitaly Tarasov. In the second half of 90s Felder, Pavel Etingof, and Varchenko developed the theory of dynamical quantum groups. Dynamical equations, compatible with the KZ type equations, were introduced in joint papers with G. Felder, Y. Markov, V. Tarasov. In applications, the dynamical equations appear as the quantum differential equations of the cotangent bundles of partial flag varieties. In, Evgeny Mukhin, Tarasov, and Varchenko proved the conjecture of Boris Shapiro and Michael Shapiro in real algebraic geometry: if the Wronski determinant of a complex finite-dimensional vector space of polynomials in one variable has real roots only, then the vector space has a basis of polynomials with real coefficients. It is classically known that the intersection index of the Schubert varieties in the Grassmannian of N-dimensional planes coincides with the dimension of the space of invariants in a suitable tensor product of representations of the general linear group \\\\operatorname{GL}_N. In, Mukhin, Tarasov, and Varchenko categorified this fact and showed that the Bethe algebra of the Gaudin model on such a space of invariants is isomorphic to the algebra of functions on the intersection of the corresponding Schubert varieties. As an application, they showed that if the Schubert varieties are defined with respect to distinct real osculating flags, then the varieties intersect transversally and all intersection points are real. This property is called the reality of Schubert calculus. Books * Arnol πd, V. I.; Guseƒ≠n- Zade, S. M.; Varchenko, A. N. Singularities of differentiable maps. Vol. I.

The biosphere reserve was designated in 2002, and is one of 16 biosphere reserves in Canada. The Frontenac Arch Biosphere operates primarily within a 2,700 km2. region from Brockville to Kingston, extending north to Verona and Perth. The Frontenac Arch Biosphere is located in the Thousand Islands - Frontenac Arch area, in one of the great crossroads of Eastern Canada. An ancient granite bridge, called the Frontenac Arch, runs from the northern Canadian Shield in Algonquin Park to the Adirondack Mountains in the United States. The granite arch intersects with the St. Lawrence River in the southernmost part of the Frontenac Arch Biosphere boundary, as the St. Lawrence River runs southwest to northeast from Kingston to Brockville. The Biosphere Reserve operates as a not-for-profit network, called the Frontenac Arch Biosphere Network, with over 100 regional partners, and a suite of programs aimed at encouraging the community to become a global model for sustainable development. The Frontenac Arch Biosphere‚Äôs activities are guided by three core functions as set by UNESCO and the Man and the Biosphere Programme: #Conservation: To contribute to the protection of cultural diversity and biodiversity through sharing of knowledge and best practices concerning the conservation of ecosystems, species and the natural biodiversity of the region. #Sustainable Development: To foster and promote human development that is socially, culturally, economically and ecologically sustainable for all time. #Capacity Building: To facilitate dialogue and information-sharing between communities, resource sectors, governments and researchers, for the purpose of education, training, research and/or monitoring projects. Area The reserve's surface area (terrestrial and marine) is . The core area is , surrounded by buffer zone(s) of and transition area(s) of . Ecological characteristics The topography of the biosphere reserve is rugged, consisting of steep, rocky slopes and ridges, typical of the Precambrian Shield. These alternate with moist forest or wetland valleys inland, and rocky promontories in the Saint Lawrence River known as the Thousand Islands. First Nations call the Frontenac Arch the \\"backbone of the mother\\"‚Äì Mother Nature‚Äôs spinal column. Five separate forest regions meet at the crossroads of the Frontenac Arch and the Saint Lawrence River, creating a rich ecosystem of plant, insect and animal species, renowned as the most biodiverse region in Canada. It has a long and rich cultural heritage and serves as the gateway through which the Saint Lawrence River flows into Canada. Characteristic species of the area include the pitch pine (Pinus rigada), the black rat snake (Elaphe obsoleta obsolete) ‚Äì Canada‚Äôs largest reptile and a threatened species, the least bittern (Ixobrychus exilis) ‚Äì the smallest member of the heron family and listed as a species of special concern, the great blue heron (Ardea Herodias), the osprey (Pandion haliaetus), the common loon (Gavia immer), the bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and the pine warbler (Dendroica pinus). Socio-economic characteristics The main traditional industry in the inland part of the biosphere reserve is agriculture. Other main economic activities include fishing, forestry and mining. Water-oriented recreation and tourism are major economic sectors in shoreline communities along the Saint Lawrence River, the Rideau Canal and Charleston Lake. The Thousand Islands, the Frontenac Arch region and the Saint Lawrence River have a long history of human habitation. Archaeological sites found in the Thousand Islands indicate that people visited the area as early as 7,000 years ago, and that Laurentian and Point Peninsula cultures used the area as hunting and fishing grounds.

The game, divided in 8 chapters, combined two different genres: In five levels, the player controls a pterodactyl-like creature in a pseudo-3D rail shooter environment. Three levels belong to the side-scrolling platform game genre where the player controls a barbarian fighting monsters and solving puzzles. Ports for MS-DOS and Atari ST were released in 1991. Story The backstory, as well as an extensive mythology of the fictional world (also called \\"Unreal\\") is given in the game manual. A creator being called Sleeper, sent his servant Fragor to Unreal to create life with some life-giving eggs. Fragor was hit by a comet and fell on Unreal releasing chaotic forces on the planet. While the elements were separated or mixed in uncontrollable ways, the eggs formed life on the planet. Forces of evil dominated the elements while the evil Polymorphe, who has the form of a floating flaming head, became absolute master. Unknown to him the civilization of the Barbares was created out of a single egg which fell in a secluded valley. Two Barbares, Artaban and Isolde, befriend a dragon named Dracus who came from the sky. When Dracus did not show up for some time, Isolde was caught by Polymorphe's servants while calling for him. Imprisoned in a dungeon, she was ordered to marry him, or Polymorphe would kill all life in the valley. Dracus and Artaban prepare to go to her rescue, and a mysterious wizard equips Artaban with an ancient sword forged from Fragor's comet. The objective of the game is to guide Artaban (either on foot or riding Dracus on his back) to the Burning Sea where Polymorphe's Flying Castle is found. Gameplay The game combined two different gameplay genres. Both Galaxy Force and Rastan Saga were inspirations for the game. In five of the chapters, the player (as Artaban) guides Dracus as they fly over a natural landscape (forests, river canyons, glaciers or seas of lava). The gameplay of those levels are of a 3d scrolling shooters, the view being from behind Dracus. The player must avoid obstacles (like trees or spires of rock) and adversaries that come from the distance. Dracus fires fireballs that can destroy some of the monsters or parts of the scenery. Dracus can fire more and stronger fireballs, when the player collects power-ups that appear on the ground. The player can attain 12 levels of firepower, but whenever the player crashes on the scenery, Dracus loses a level. Other bonuses include restoration of health and some limited invincibility. The other parts of the game are of the platform arcade-adventure genre. The player guides Artaban on foot traversing forests, swamps and castles. He encounters adversaries which can be killed with the sword. The sword gives some limited interaction with the environment: and can be \\"charged\\" by touching fire found at some points of the levels; there are also some kinds of spells that give Artaban the power to hurl water or fireballs with the sword. The sword also is used for some puzzles. The player has 100 health points. In the beginning of each level, the player is awarded 50 lost health points. There is also the option to save the game in 3 available slots.

He was the last in the male line of the Luttrell family, which had owned Dunster Castle since 1376. Early life and family Alexander Luttrell was born on 10 May 1705, the eldest son of Colonel Alexander Luttrell, of Dunster Castle, by his wife Dorothy Yard, daughter of Edward Yarde of Churston Ferrers, Devon. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford in 1722, where he was sent with his younger brother Francis.Matthews (1970)Maxwell Lyte (1909), p. 222Foster (1887), p. 883 In 1726 he married Margaret Trevelyan, daughter of Sir John Trevelyan, 2nd Baronet of Nettlecombe, Somerset, by whom he had a daughter and sole heiress Margaret Luttrell.  Career and later life  The Luttrell family's ownership of the manor and castle of Dunster gave them a \\"natural interest\\" over the seat of Minehead, thus a Pocket Borough, and he was returned as a Tory Member of Parliament for that borough shortly after coming of age. In the House of Commons he generally voted against the Government. He held the seat until his death on 4 June 1737.Matthews (1970) He was buried on 16 June 1737.Maxwell Lyte (1909), p. 224 Following his death his estate was in a poor financial condition and was put into Chancery.Matthews (1970) His widow remarried in 1741 to Edward Dyke of Tetton, and cared for her young daughter as well as Luttrell's niece, Anne Luttrell (daughter of Alexander Luttrell's brother Francis), and Dyke's niece and heiress Elizabeth Dyke. Mrs Dyke died in 1764.Maxwell Lyte (1909), p. 224 Margaret Luttrell was Luttrell's heiress and, when she married Henry Fownes, he inherited her estates and adopted the surname and arms of Luttrell as required by his father-in-law's will. Fownes served as Member of Parliament for the Luttrell family's pocket borough of Minehead.Maxwell Lyte (1909), pp. 225-227 Portraits Several portraits of Alexander Luttrell are listed by Maxwell Lyte (1909), but there is some difficulty in identifying him due to his similar appearance to his brother Francis. Maxwell Lyte lists a 1729 portrait of him by John Vanderbank at Dunster Castle, and others existed at one time at Nettlecombe Court and Bathealton Court. Portraits of his wife also existed at Dunster in 1909, and two portraits of her second husband Edward Dyke existed at Pixton at that time also.Maxwell-Lyte (1909), p. 224 ; see the following page for a copy of the Vanderbank portrait.

Widen served four years in the Illinois House of Representatives and four years in the Illinois Senate. Biography Raphael Widen's birth date and place are unknown. Little is known of his early life. His family moved from Sweden to France when he was eight so that he could study to be a Catholic priest. He immigrated to the United States at an unknown date. He was the first Swede known to have lived in Illinois. While living in Cahokia, Illinois Territory, Widen was appointed justice of the peace of St. Clair County on January 12, 1814. In December 1818, he moved to Kaskaskia, where he became a justice in Randolph County. He held the role there until at least 1831. In 1820, he was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives. He served until 1824, when he was elected to the Illinois Senate. He served as President of the Illinois Senate during one of its sessions in January 1826. In the Illinois legislature, Widen was an opponent of slavery. It is thought that Widen met Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette in Kaskaskia; Lafayette refers to an \\"Edward Widen\\", though this is thought to actually be Raphael. Raphael Widen married Frances Lalemier in Cahokia, Illinois in 1818. He died from cholera in Kaskaskia in 1833, after a cholera epidemic came through the area carried by Winfield Scott's troops during the Black Hawk War. His widow afterwards married Capt. E. Walker.

The convoy managed to arrive at the destination however the battle between ATO and separatist forces continued. The ATO forces used civilian buildings for their defense of the town which provoked separatist shelling of their positions. The photos show weapons burned by the separatist bombardment. On August 19, The coordinator of the Information Resistance group, Dmytro Tymchuk, wrote that \\"The ATO [anti-terrorist operation] forces (airmobile and mechanized units) continue defensive fighting near the settlements of Novosvitlivka and Khriashchuvate.

Description This sculpture represents a male figure, thought to be John the Baptist, in the Cubist tradition. The figure is positioned in a powerful stance with his right arm raised and mouth open, as if he is delivering a message or a sermon, and he carries a staff in the proper left hand. The Prophet is made of metal planes, structured around a central axis formed by the head, spine and legs. The feet of the figure are flatly planted on the rectangular base. The artist's signature is inscribed on the top of the base, in between the figure's feet, and reads, \\"P.

The BMA's version is the fourth of seven casts. =Location history= Between 1955 and 1973, Alan and Janet Wurtzburger purchased examples of modern sculpture with the intention of donating to the BMA. Until the opening of The Alan and Janet Wurtzburger Sculpture Garden in 1980, the purchased sculptures were installed at Timberlane, their estate in Stevenson, Maryland. The Prophet has been on view in the sculpture garden since its installation in 1980. =Acquisition= The sculpture was accessioned by the BMA in 1966 as a gift from the Wurtzburgers, along with thirty-five other works of art. However, it was not moved to the museum until the opening of the sculpture garden in 1980. Artist Condition The sculpture is monitored, cleaned, and treated regularly by the BMA art conservation staff. Each summer, the sculpture undergoes maintenance which includes washing, the removal of the previously applied protective wax coating, and the application of a fresh coat of hard wax. In 1987, the figure's staff was slightly bent just below the hand. Again, in 1990, the staff was bent, resulting in a severe S-shaped curve just below the figure's hand when coupled with the vandalism from 1987. Conservators removed and repaired the staff, and it was re-installed in the fall of 1990.

Life Born in Camberwell, London on 9 April 1832, he was son of Henry Collingwood Aumonier, a jeweller, by his wife, Nancy Frances, daughter of George Stacy; a younger brother worked as an engraver, and a nephew Stacy Aumonier became a landscape painter and decorative designer. He was brought up at Highgate and High Barnet, and at 14 was placed in a business. He attended the evening classes, first at the Birkbeck Institution, then known as the Mechanics' Institute, and subsequently at South Kensington, where he found employment as a designer of calicoes in a London firm. In 1891 Aumonier visited Venice and the Venetian Alps. He became associate of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water-colours in 1876, and was one of the original members of the Institute of Oil Painters. In 1889 he was awarded a gold medal for water-colour in Paris, and a bronze medal for oil painting at Adelaide. He also received a silver medal at the Brussels exhibition in 1897. An exhibition of his water-colour drawings was held at the Leicester Galleries in 1908, and another of his work in oils as well at the Goupil Gallery in March 1912. Aumonier died in London on 4 October 1911, and his remains were cremated at Woking. Works Aumonier exhibited for the first time at the Royal Academy in 1871, but continued his work on calico until after 1873, when Sir Newton Mappin purchased a picture shown by him at the Royal Academy, An English Cottage; Home. He concentrated himself on peaceful English countrysides, specially with autumn tints or in the late afternoon. His pictures included When the Tide is Out, The Silver Lining of the Cloud (both in the Royal Academy of 1895), In the Fen Country, The Old Sussex Farmstead, and Sunday Evening. Sheep Washing was in the Chantrey bequest collection at the Tate Gallery, which also owned his Black Mountains.

The polyopic images occur monocular bilaterally (one eye open on both sides) and binocularly (both eyes open), differentiating it from ocular diplopia or polyopia. The number of duplicated images can range from one to hundreds. Some patients report difficulty in distinguishing the replicated images from the real images, while others report that the false images differ in size, intensity, or color. Cerebral polyopia is sometimes confused with palinopsia (visual trailing), in which multiple images appear while watching an object. However, in cerebral polyopia, the duplicated images are of a stationary object which are perceived even after the object is removed from the visual field. Movement of the original object causes all of the duplicated images to move, or the polyopic images disappear during motion. In palinoptic polyopia, movement causes each polyopic image to leave an image in its wake, creating hundreds of persistent images (entomopia). Infarctions, tumors, multiple sclerosis, trauma, encephalitis, migraines, and seizures have been reported to cause cerebral polyopia. Cerebral polyopia has been reported in extrastriate visual cortex lesions, which is important for detecting motion, orientation, and direction. Cerebral polyopia often occurs in homonymous field deficits, suggesting deafferentation hyperexcitability could be a possible mechanism, similar to visual release hallucinations (Charles Bonnet syndrome).  Presentation  Cerebral polyopia is most often associated with occipital or temporal lobe lesions, as well as occipital lobe epilepsy. This condition is relatively uncommon, thus further research regarding its causes and mechanism has not been performed. Polyopia can be experienced as partial second or multiple images to either side (or in any eccentricity) of an object at fixation. Polyopia occurs when both eyes are open, or when one eye is open, during fixation on a stimulus. Known cases of polyopia provide evidence that, in relation to the stimulus at fixation, multiple images can appear at a constant distance in any direction; gaps in portions of an object at fixation can exist; multiple images can be overlaid vertically, horizontally, or diagonally on top of the stimulus; and the multiple images can appear different sizes, alignments, and complexities. The complexity of the stimulus does not appear to affect the clarity of the multiple images. The physical distance of the stimulus from the patient (near or far) also does not seem to affect the presence of multiple images.[7] However, if the stimulus is swung or moved, multiple images of that object can either be extinguished or transformed into different objects, depending on the severity of the condition. The onset of polyopia is not immediate upon perception of visual stimuli; rather, it occurs within milliseconds to seconds of fixation upon a stimulus. Polyopia has been described by patients as images ‚Äúsuddenly multiplying.‚Äù These multiple images can drift, fade, and disappear, depending on the severity of the condition. These episodes of polyopia can last from seconds to hours. In one specific case, a patient described difficulties reading due to letters ‚Äúrun[ning] together‚Äù and momentarily disappearing. Most cases of polyopia are accompanied by another neurological condition. Polyopia is often accompanied by visual field defects (such as the presence of a scotoma) or transient visual hallucinations. Polyopic images often form in the direction and position of such visual field defects. Current research shows that when stimuli are close to the patient‚Äôs scotoma, the latency of polyopic images is much shorter than if the stimuli was far from the scotoma, and there is a higher probability that polyopic images will result.  Causes  Though there is no clear cause of cerebral polyopia, many cases show associations with occipital or temporal lobe lesions. Most cases of polyopia occur when there are bilateral lesions to occipital or temporal cortex, however some cases are present with unilateral lesions. Thus, polyopia can result from any kind of infarction to the occipital or temporal lobes, though the exact mechanism remains unclear. Some cases have shown that polyopia is experienced when the infarctions were seen to be at the tips and outer surfaces of the occipital lobes. By contrast, some patients experience cerebral polyopia associated with headaches and migraines in the frontotemporal lobe. The mechanism of infarction differs by patient, but polyopia is experienced most commonly in patients that suffer from epilepsy in the occipital cortex, or in patients who suffer from cerebral strokes. In cases of epilepsy, polyopia is often experienced alongside palinopsia as these two conditions share an epileptic mechanism.  Theories of Cerebral polyopia  The preliminary theory of cerebral polyopia proposed by Bender postulated that polyopia occurs as a result of instability of fixation due to occipital lobe disease. Under this explanation, small, involuntary eye movements that accompanied normal fixation were the cause of polyopic images. These involuntary eye movements lead to the development of new retinal and corresponding cortical regions that code for central vision called false maculae. Thus, polyopic images resulted from the stimulation of both the original and acquired maculae. However, Bender‚Äôs theory does not account for recent studies in which fixation did not change and no eye movements were produced while polyopia was experienced, therefore polyopic images were not a result of involuntary eye movements. Instead, Cornblath offers a possible pathophysiological mechanism in which polyopia results from the recoding of visual receptive fields in primary visual cortex (Area V1). The report of polyopic images of complex objects at fixation suggests that the disorder is not limited to lower-order visual areas in occipital cortex (in which simple features such as borders and angles are encoded), but rather it involves the interaction between lower-order visual areas in the occipital lobe and higher-order visual areas in the temporal lobe that is postulated to code whole objects. Another possible pathophysiological mechanism for this disorder is the reorganization of receptive fields of neurons close to the damaged area of visual cortex. This theory is supported by findings that parafoveal retinal lesions deprive a region of striate cortex of visual input, and as a result, the receptive fields of neurons near the boundary of the deprived cortical region enlarge and expand into nearby regions of the visual field. Thus, polyopia results from altered coding of contour information by neurons near the lesioned area. This mechanism offers that after a focal lesion of neurons in striate cortex, or following a retinal lesion depriving these neurons of visual input, the receptive fields of nearby healthy neurons converge to code information about contours of objects normally coded by the damaged neurons while still coding the same information about retinal location prior to the injury. This mechanism may explain why polyopia extending into a patient‚Äôs scotoma occurs following damage to primary visual cortex.  Treatment  Since this condition is usually coupled with other neurological disorders or deficits, there is no known cure for cerebral polyopia. However, measures can be taken to reduce the effects of associated disorders, which have proven to reduce the effects of polyopia. In a case of occipital lobe epilepsy, the patient experienced polyopia. Following administration of valproate sodium to reduce headaches, the patient‚Äôs polyopia was reduced to palinopsia. Further, after administering the anticonvulsant drug Gabapentin in addition to valproate sodium, the effects of palinopsia were decreased, as visual perseveration is suppressed by this anticonvulsant drug. Thus, in cases of epilepsy, anticonvulsant drugs may prove to reduce the effects of polyopia and palinopsia, a topic of which should be further studied. In other cases of polyopia, it is necessary to determine all other present visual disturbances before attempting treatment. Neurological imaging can be performed to determine if there are present occipital or temporal lobe infarctions that may be causing the polyopia. CT scans are relatively insensitive to the presence of cerebral lesions, so other neurological imaging such as PET and MRI may be performed. The presence of seizures and epilepsy may also be assessed through EEG. In addition, motor visual function should be assessed through examination of pupillary reactions, ocular motility, optokinetic nystagmus, slit-lamp examination, visual field examination, visual acuity, stereo vision, bimicroscopic examination, and funduscopic examination. Once the performance of such functions have been assessed, a plan for treatment can follow accordingly. Further research should be conducted to determine if the treatment of associated neurological disturbances can reduce the effects of polyopia.

Archaeologists believe that it was likely erected during the Bronze Age. The Kingston Russell ring is part of a tradition of stone circle construction that spread throughout much of Britain, Ireland, and Brittany during the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age, over a period between 3,300 and 900 BCE. The purpose of such monuments is unknown, although archaeologists speculate that they were likely religious sites, with the stones perhaps having supernatural associations for those who built the circles. A number of these circles were built in the area around modern Dorset, typically being constructed from sarsen stone and being smaller than those found elsewhere. The Kingston Russell ring is the largest of those in Dorset, measuring 24 by 27 metres (79 feet by 89 feet) in diameter and containing eighteen sarsen stones arranged in an oval shape. The site has not been excavated or been subject to in-depth archaeological investigation. Location Positioned at the national grid reference 35770878, Kingston Russell Stone Circle is located on a chalk ridge that is west of Portesham, overlooking Abbotsbury and the sea.History and Research: Kingston Russell Stone Circle, English Heritage, 26 August 2014 The site is located on open downland at a height of 189 metres (620 feet) above sea level. The historic house of Kingston Russell is about 1.6 kilometres to the north. The ruined burial chamber known as The Grey Mare and her Colts is a short distance to the southeast. The site is also known as the Gorwell Circle, a name adopted from Gorwell Farm to the south. It can be approached via a footpath from near to Gorwell Farm. It is most visible when the grass around it is cut short, for the stones are obscured when the grass grows longer. The site is a scheduled monument, and thus accorded legal protection under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. Context The circle While the transition from the Early Neolithic to the Late Neolithic‚Äîwhich took place with the transition from the fourth to the third millennium BCE‚Äîwitnessed much economic and technological continuity, it also saw a considerable change in the style of monuments erected, particularly in southern and eastern England. By 3000 BCE, the long barrows, causewayed enclosures, and cursuses which had predominated in the Early Neolithic had ceased being built, and were instead replaced by circular monuments of various kinds. These include earthen henges, timber circles, and stone circles. These latter circles are found in most areas of Britain where stone is available, with the exception of the island's south-eastern corner. They are most densely concentrated in south-western Britain and on the north-eastern horn of Scotland, near Aberdeen. The tradition of their construction may have lasted for 2,400 years, from 3300 to 900 BCE, with the major phase of building taking place between 3000 and 1,300 BCE. One of the recumbent stones These stone circles typically show very little evidence of human visitation during the period immediately following their creation. This suggests that they were not sites used for rituals that left archaeologically visible evidence, and may have been deliberately left as \\"silent and empty monuments\\". The archaeologist Mike Parker Pearson suggested that in Neolithic Britain, stone was associated with the dead and wood with the living. Other archaeologists have suggested that the stone might not represent ancestors, but rather other supernatural entities, such as deities. The area of modern Dorset has only a \\"thin scatter\\" of stone circles, with nine possible examples known within its boundaries. The archaeologist John Gale described these as \\"a small but significant group\\" of such monuments, and all are located within five miles (eight kilometres) of the sea. All but one‚ÄîRempstone Stone Circle on the Isle of Purbeck‚Äîare located on the chalk hills west of Dorchester. The Dorset circles have a simplistic typology, being of comparatively small size, and that at Kingston Russell is the largest. All are oval in shape, although perhaps have been altered from their original form. With the exception of the Rempstone circle, all consist of sarsen stone. Much of this may have been obtained from the Valley of Stones, a location at the foot of Crow Hill near to Littlebredy, which is located within the vicinity of many of these circles. With the exception of the circle at Litton Cheney, none display evidence of any outlying stones or earthworks around the stone circle. The archaeologists Stuart and Cecily Piggott believed that the circles of Dorset were probably of Bronze Age origin, a view endorsed by the archaeologist Aubrey Burl, who noted that their distribution did not match that of any known Neolithic sites. It is possible that they were not all constructed around the same date, and the Piggotts suggested that while they may well be Early Bronze Age in date, it is also possible that \\"their use and possibly their construction may last into the Middle and even into the Late Bronze Age\\". Their nearest analogies are the circles found on Dartmoor and Exmoor to the west, and the Stanton Drew stone circles to the north. It is also possible that the stone circles were linked to a number of earthen henges erected in Dorset around the same period. Description The circle in its landscape context Kingston Russell is the largest surviving stone circle in Dorset. The stones are arranged in an oval with a diameter measuring from 24 by 27 metres (79 by 89 feet). The ring consists of eighteen stones, the longest of which are located at the north of the circle. As of 1939, all the stones were lying on the ground, although there is a record that in 1815 one stone on the southern side was still standing upright. The Piggotts suggested that while the circle retained its full number of original megaliths, some of them might have been moved from their original positions. It is possible that the ring was graded in height, with the tallest stones being located on the north. The stones are made of sarsen or conglomerate. Some of the stones are broken, and it is impossible to tell which fragments are bases and which were originally upper parts. The stones vary in size from 2 metres by 0.5 metres (7 feet by 1.6 feet) to 1 metre by 0.3 metres (3 feet by 1 foot). In 1980, it was stated that a stone was \\"supposed\\" to have been added to the circle \\"in recent years\\". The antiquarian John Hutchins mentioned the circle in his 1774 work The History and Antiquities of Dorset. Influenced by the ideas of fellow antiquarian William Stukeley, Hutchins described the Kingston Russell ring as a \\"druidical circle\\", thereby attributing its creation to the Iron Age druids. As of 2003, the site had not been excavated by archaeologists or extensively studied. The site is on privately owned land although is accessible to the public.

The piece was both written for and dedicated to renowned klezmer clarinetist David Krakauer. The three- movement composition is marked by traditional klezmer sonorities and the use of extended techniques in the clarinet part. The Klezmer Concerto premiered in Michelstadt, Germany on July 15, 2006 as part of the Michelstadt Musiknacht 2006. Composition The piece was composed in 2006. Amots states that the concerto was directly inspired by Krakauer's distinct playing style for klezmer clarinet; Amots and Krakuaer worked together throughout the composition process, with Krakauer's techniques influencing the composition from its earliest sketches. Movements =I. Pastoral Donya= The concerto opens with a slow movement titled Pastoral Donya. A Donya is a type of melancholic melody likely of Eastern-European origin. The strings open with a passage meant to imitate the sounds of nature. The clarinet appears over the accompaniment with shout and cry-like melodies. =II. Nigun of the Seven Circles= This dance-like movement is based on the Jewish wedding tradition of a bride circling her bridegroom seven times before the marriage ceremony can actually begin. Towards the end there is a free cadenza for the clarinet to improvise and expand upon previously stated motives. =III. Halleluya= The third movement was inspired by a passage describing a raucous musical scene in the 150th Psalm of the first testament. This movement also features a cadenza for the clarinet in a perpetual motion style. The movement concludes with the orchestra joining in the winding fashion, suggesting the praise of a Halleluya.

He is credited as being the inventor of Cycle polo, the rules of which he drew up in 1891. Life Mecredy was born in Ballinasloe, County Galway, the son of Rev. James Mecredy, the Church of Ireland rector of Inveran, Spiddal, County Galway. He was educated at Portora Royal School, Enniskillen. He graduated from Trinity College Dublin (where he had been an Irish champion tricycle racer) in 1884 and after a short spell as a teacher was apprenticed as a solicitor with his uncle, Thomas Tighe Mecredy, of Dublin. However, his interest in cycling and his growing reputation as a cycle racer led to his becoming Dublin correspondent of the Tralee publisher J. G. Hodgins's Irish Cyclist and Athlete in September 1885. Hodgins appointed him editor in November the same year. Mecredy bought the paper from Hodgins with his brother Alexander in 1886 and moved its office to Dublin.Obituary, The Irish Times, 3 May 1924 In the 1886 Irish National Cycling Championships in Track Racing he won the 1 mile, 2-mile and 4-mile events. In the 1880s and 1890s he won a total of nine Irish championships. He had his greatest success at the National Cyclists' Union meeting in London in 1890. He had already given up competitive cycling when Dunlop introduced the pneumatic tyre in 1888, and he saw the benefit that this would bring to cycling, so he agreed to accompany the Irish team of the brothers du Cros, F. F. McCabe and P. Piggott to London. It was a daring decision for him to compete, but it was justified by his winning all four championships and finishing the season with an unbeaten record. Mecredy was a founder member of the Irish Roads Improvement Association and was responsible for the dissemination of a body of literature on road improvement, maps and guides. His Art and Pastime of Cycling became a standard guide for the cyclist. As the editor of the Dublin Motor News, Mecredy was involved in helping to organise the 1903 Gordon Bennett Cup, the first international motor race to be held in Ireland (an honorific to Selwyn Edge who had won the 1902 event in the Paris-Vienna race driving a Napier). The Automobile Club of Great Britain and Ireland wanted the race to be hosted in the British Isles, and their secretary, Claude Johnson, suggested Ireland as the venue because racing was illegal on British public roads. Mecredy suggested an area in County Kildare, and letters were sent to 102 Irish MPs, 90 Irish peers, 300 newspapers, 34 chairmen of county and local councils, 34 County secretaries, 26 mayors, 41 railway companies, 460 hoteliers, 13 PPs, plus the Bishop of Kildare and Leighlin, Patrick Foley, who pronounced himself in favour. Local laws had to be adjusted, ergo the 'Light Locomotives (Ireland) Bill' was passed on 27 March 1903, and Kildare was chosen. The 328 miles (528 km) race was won by the famous Belgian Camille Jenatzy.Forix 8W ‚Äì Britain's first international motor race by Brendan Lynch, based on his Triumph of the Red Devil, the 1903 Irish Gordon Bennett Cup Race.

Leif Snellman, Summer 2001 In early October 1912 Carl Stearns Clancy, along with his biking partner, Walter Rendell Storey, arrived in Dublin to commence his circumnavigation of the world by motor-cycle. Mecredy gave them road maps and helped them plot their route in Ireland. Clancy continued his circumnavigation of the globe until August 1913, during which he rode 18,000 miles in Europe, Africa, Asia and North America. Mecredy was a vegetarian and authored a book Health's Highway. He died while in Dumfries, Scotland, after a long illness - he suffered from tuberculosis. Family He married Catherine Anne Hopkins, from Oldcastle, County Meath, in 1887. They had six children: Raymond, Ralph, Eric, Myrtle, Ivy and May. His son, Dr. Ralph Mecredy, was also a cyclist and competed in the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm. He survived the sinking of the RMS Lusitania in 1915.

Traditionally, strip lights had been used solely in accent lighting, backlighting, task lighting, and decorative lighting applications. Increased luminous efficacy and higher-power SMDs have allowed LED strip lights to be used in applications such as high brightness task lighting, fluorescent and halogen lighting fixture replacements, indirect lighting applications, Ultra Violet inspection during manufacturing processes, set and costume design, and even growing plants.  Design  Variables in strip lighting consist of water resistance, color, adhesives, choice of SMD, driving voltage, control type, and whether it is constant current or constant voltage layout. Uncoated LED tape is not considered to have any resistance to water ingress, but may be rated as IP20 for some physical ingress resistance. Such tapes are generally low voltage and safe for skin to touch but can be shorted by fine metal objects. Water resistant strip lighting is covered in a heat conducting epoxy or silicone to protect the circuitry from direct contact with water, and can be rated IP65, IP67, or with suitable sealed connections IP68. Both coated and uncoated LED tapes have a two sided adhesive backing to stick to walls, desks, doors, etc. The most common design differences are in how individual LEDs are controlled, specifically differences in color and whether or not each LED is addressable.Castle, Alex How To Get Started with Programmable RGB LED Strip Lighting, TESTED *Single Color, non-addressable: Every LED on the strand is a single white colour, typically ranging from 2200K to 6500K in Correlated color temperatures of white lightcolor temperature, or any of several monochrome colors covering the range of the visible spectrum (generally from 400-700 nanometers in wavelength). *Dynamic Tunable White (often described with CCT), non-addressable: Allows the user to adjust the color temperature output from a single strip light. They are manufactured with alternating LEDs of different color temperatures, so half of the LEDs are a lower temperature and half are a higher color temperature, allowing the strip to produce any specific color temperature between the two color temperatures of the LEDs. *Multicolor, non- addressable: Each LED is capable of displaying red, green, blue, or all three (white), driven by three input power rails. All the LEDs display the same colour at any one time, but the colour can be manipulated by varying the voltage applied to each of the three power inputs. *RGB, addressable: Multiple colours and addresses. Each LED has its own chip meaning they can be individually triggered for chasing, strobing, and colour changing.Schiller, Brad The Automated Lighting Programmer's Handbook *RGBW, non-addressable: The combination of Single Color and Multicolor (4 LED-Chips) in a single module *RGBCCT or RGBWW: The combination of Dynamic Tunable White and Multicolor (5 LED-Chips) in a single module LED strip designs are available populated with many different types of SMD, not only in different colors and addressable or non-addressable, by different shapes, sizes, and power levels. The most common types of SMD are: 3528, single colour, non-addressable, very low power; 5050, containing three LEDs allowing for RGB and addressable strips as well as higher power levels; 2835, a newer single-color SMD having the same surface dimensions as the 3528 but a larger emitter area and a thinner design with an integrated heatsink allowing for higher power levels; 5630/5730, a newer replacement for single-color 5050 SMDs which can operate at slightly higher power levels and have high efficacy. Less common designs may have 3014, 4014, 7020, 8020, or other SMDs. In addition to the LED SMD type, the quantity of LEDs per foot (or meter) is also an important factor in determining the overall power and brightness. LED strip lights most commonly operate on 12 or 24 volts of direct current from a power supply, sometimes referred to as a driver. USB strip lights operate on the standard 5-volt direct current used by USB devices. Mains voltage LED strips are also available. These have the advantages of being usable in much longer single runs without a brightness drop along the length, but are less flexible and heavier due to higher voltage and current ratings and thick coatings for shock safety and high IP ratings in their intended outdoor positions, with limited cut points. No separate power supply is needed, although there must be a rectifier between the mains supply and the end of the LED strip. The most common PCB designs use multiple parallel circuits consisting of passive dropper resistors in series with a certain number of LED SMDs, to operate at a certain current and power level with the expected input voltage. This design is referred to as constant- voltage and is rather sensitive to small variations in input voltage and to the voltage drop that occurs along long lengths of strip when driven from a single power input. Alternative design is the \\"constant current\\" design where each parallel circuit of several SMDs includes a small integrated circuit to provide a fixed current to that group of LEDs, within a wide range of applied voltages. This allows the strip to operate at the same power level and brightness along its entire length, or with some variation in the driver voltage. Any customizations require an LED controller to adjust brightness, color, or individual LED activity. This can be done with an included controller or customized with a microcontroller. 'Neon' or 'flex' LED tape refers to LED tape constructed in such a way to emulate neon lights. The LED tape is embedded on the side of a silicone filled, plastic C-channel; the silicone both diffuses the light from the LED tape and directs it out to one side, 90 degrees to the direction the SMD LEDs face. This design allows the lights to be bent in what appears to be the opposite direction to how regular LED tape can be bent, allowing one to spell words and create pictures with it much like neon signs. Beam angle Typical SMD LEDs are rated as having a 120¬∞ beam angle, directed \\"up\\", i.e. perpendicular to the mounting surface. 'Side View' or 'Edge Emitter' SMDs are designed such that light is emitted parallel to the adhering surface (i.e., 90 degree difference to typical tape design). These allow the construction of LED strips which wash surfaces within less space or accent edge profiles such as signage. Dimming LEDs can be dimmed efficiently using pulse-width modulation (PWM). This strategy rapidly switches the LEDs on and off, typically 500 times per second, by changing the voltage from zero to the designed value in an \\"on-off\\" fashion. The LED sees its drive as a square wave. The relative width of the on and off portions of the square wave can be varied so that the LEDs are on or off for relatively more or less time to change brightness. Addressable LEDs do this dimming internally given a data signal which specifies which colour LEDs to turn on, while non-addressable LEDs require an external PWM controller.  Applications  Strip lights are designed for both indoor and outdoor use depending on whether they are water resistant. Since the strip is flexible and can be divided at any point between LEDs, it is extremely versatile and can be used in a number of installations. Outside of traditional lighting, strip lighting is extensively used in DIY projects or lighted clothing. The ability to power strip lights off of a USB device or battery pack makes them extremely portable. Examples include computer lighting, costume lights, toys, workspace lighting, monitor and display ambient lighting, and alcove lighting. LED strips are also increasingly used as a smart solution. With a smart strip light you can adjust the color of the LEDs and determine the brightness of the strip with an app on your smartphone or smart accessory.

The poet and translator Jerome Rothenberg writes of Granary Books: \\"In the true history of American poetry...Granary Books, as a press & resource, is exemplary of how poets & related artists in the post-World War Two era were able to establish shadow institutions that operated, nearly successfully, outside the frame of any & all self-proclaimed poetic mainstreams.\\" Kyle Schlesinger writes, \\"It is difficult to imagine that any syllabus (or practitioner‚Äôs bookshelf for that matter) about the artists‚Äô book could be complete without at least one title from Granary\\" Granary Books' works have been the subject of over 10 exhibitions, including most recently Participating Witness: The Poetics of Granary Books at Poets House, New York City, in 2020. History Granary Books began in 1985 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, as Origin Books‚Äîthe name under which Clay published his first project, Noah Webster to Wee Lorine Niedecker by Jonathan Williams. A series of other small poem-cards and broadsides followed during the 1980s, as well as books by Jane Wodening, Jonathan Williams, R. B. Kitaj, and Paul Metcalf. By 1988, Granary Books moved to Manhattan on 636 Broadway, where Steve Clay and David Abel ran a gallery and bookstore on the tenth floor. Clay says that publishing \\"became more self- conscious as a project\\" and \\"serious in its ambition\\" in 1991 with the publication of Nods, with text by John Cage and drawings by Barbara Farhner. In this spirit, Many of Granary Books' limited-edition publications continue to be collaborations or pairings between poets/writers and visual artists. Many also contain unique elements, such as handpainting; Susan Bee describes this creative process for her book, Talespin (Granary Books, 1995). These limited-edition publications are held in special collections and archives internationally, and explore the relationship between \\"image and the word and tactile comprehension,\\" in collaboration with artists, poets, bookbinders, printers, and designers. Publishing The author, book artist, visual theorist, and cultural critic Johanna Drucker described Granary Books' publishing aesthetic as \\"late twentieth-century fine press meets literary experiment and innovative arts.\\" Steve Clay says that he began publishing as a result of his interest in \\"the ways in which writing was distributed on the margins, the kind of sociology of book distribution among small presses, and the poets who were producing work that was primarily published in small presses,\\" along with his interest in booksellers such as Phoenix Book Shop, the Eighth Street Book Shop, Asphodel, Serendipity, Sand Dollar, Gotham and City Lights.> Starting in the mid-nineties Granary Books began publishing books that contextualize scholarship in the history of small press publishing, poetry, and artists' books. The first Granary Books trade edition was Johanna Drucker's The Century of Artists' Books, followed by Jerome Rothenberg and David M. Guss's The Book, Spiritual Instrument. Other trade books include Jerome Rothenberg and Steve Clay's A Book of the Book: Some Works & Projections About the Book & Writing, Betty Bright's No Longer Innocent: Book Art in America 1960‚Äì1980, and Stefan Klima's Artists Books: A Critical Survey of the Literature. Steve Clay and Rodney Phillips's A Secret Location on the Lower East Side resulted from an exhibition at The New York Public Library by the same name, and is considered \\"not only significant in its refusal to lose the evidence of the period it covers (1960-80), but for showing that entering the evidence into the public record is a means of shaping the discourse about the critical context of the period.\\" Granary Books also published out-of-print works for wider distribution, such as Joe Brainard's I Remember, originally published by Angel Hair Books, as well as trade poetry books by poets including Alice Notley, Ed Sanders, Larry Fagin, and numerous others. As of August 2020, Granary Books has a checklist with over 177 publications that includes limited editions and trade editions of poetry, artists' books, and books about books. =Limited Editions (selected)= *John Ashbery and Trevor Winkfield.

During World War I, it was the only coastal defence unit to engage the enemy, and it also trained siege gunners for service on the Western Front. Artillery Volunteers (1859‚Äì1908) An invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Volunteer units composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need. Four Artillery Volunteer Corps (AVCs) were raised in County Durham, with their officers' commissions being issued on 14 March 1860:Beckett, Appendix VIII. * 1st Durham AVC (Sunderland) * 2nd (Seaham) Durham Artillery Volunteer Corps (Seaham) * 3rd Durham AVC (South Shields) * 4th Durham AVC (Hartlepool) The 2nd (Seaham) Corps was initially the largest, and the other three were attached to it for administrative purposes. In 1880 and 1881 the 2nd Durham won the Queen's Prize at the annual National Artillery Association competition held at Shoeburyness.Litchfield, N and Westlake, R, 1982. The Volunteer Artillery, Sherwood Press, p189 By the end of the 19th Century, however, all four were independent units, attached to the Western Division of the Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA) and ranked as 51 to 54 in order of seniority among Volunteer Artillery units. In 1902, the divisional structure was abolished, and the units were renamed 1st‚Äì4th Durham RGA (Volunteers).Army Lists The first Captain Commandant of the 1st Corps at Sunderland was the local politician Sir Hedworth Williamson, Bt (1827‚Äì1900). He commanded it for 28 years and was appointed Honorary Colonel of the 1st Durham Volunteer Artillery in 1888 after command of the unit passed to Lt-Col Edwin Vaux. The Vaux connection Edwin Vaux (1844‚Äì1908) was a member of the prominent Vaux brewing family of Sunderland, and the family name frequently appears among the lists of Durham Volunteer Artillery officers. Among them was Major Ernest Vaux, who volunteered for the Imperial Yeomanry during the 2nd Boer War and commanded the Maxim gun detachment of the 5th Imperial Yeomanry, winning a Distinguished Service Order (DSO). The family brewery introduced Double Maxim brown ale in 1901 to celebrate the detachment's return and the beer is still brewed in Sunderland. Ernest Vaux later commanded a Territorial battalion of the Durham Light Infantry throughout World War I.Times Obituary of Ernest Vaux Territorial Force Under the Haldane Reforms, the Volunteer Force was subsumed into the new Territorial Force. In the original 1908 plans for the TF, the 1st Durham RGA was to combine with the Tynemouth Volunteer Artillery to form a Northumberland and Durham RGA (and spin off a battery and ammunition column for the local Royal Field Artillery (RFA) brigade), while the 4th Durham RGA in West Hartlepool was to combine with the 1st East Riding of Yorkshire RGA to form a Durham and Yorkshire RGA, the two new units covering the whole NE coast of England. These plans were radically changed, so that by 1910 the Tynemouth and East Riding elements had formed their own units, while the 1st and 4th Durham merged to form a new Durham RGA as a defended ports unit (the 4th had also spun off a battery and ammunition column to the III Northumbrian Brigade RFA).London Gazette, 20 March 1908London Gazette 14 October 1910 The organisation of the Durham RGA was as follows:Litchfield, pp. 58‚Äì60.RGA at Regimental Warpath * HQ at The Armoury, West Hartlepool * No 1 Heavy Battery at Sunderland * No 2 Company at West Hartlepool * No 3 Company at West Hartlepool * No 4 Company at West Hartlepool * No 5 Company at Hartlepool The commanding officer was Lt-Col Lancelot Robson, a doctor and former mayor of Hartlepool, who had first been commissioned into the 4th Durham RGA in 1893. World War I =Raid on Hartlepool= Portrait photograph of Lieutenant Colonel Lancelot Robson V.D.D.L., Commanding Durham R.G.A. (Royal Garrison Artillery), Fire Commander, Hartlepool Batteries, Dec. 16th 1914. The bombardment of the (5633824453) On the morning of 16 December 1914, a German naval force under Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper approached the coast of North East England to mount a Raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby. The battle cruisers SMS Seydlitz and SMS Moltke, with the armoured cruiser SMS Bl√ºcher, concentrated on Hartlepool, which was a base for light Royal Navy warships. The port was defended by two batteries. On the day in question, 11 officers and 155 other ranks of the Durham RGA were manning Heugh Battery (two 6-inch guns manned by No 4 Company) and Lighthouse Battery (one 6-inch gun).Litchfield, Appendix 1.Kelly's Directory of Durham and Northumberland 1921. As was normal practice, the gunners 'stood to' at 06.30 and so were ready for action when the German warships approached. The Germans planned to bombard the batteries for 15 minutes to suppress them before turning the attention to the town. The Seydlitz opened fire at 08.10 and Lt- Col Robson rushed from his home to take up his post as Fire Commander and Battery Medical Officer at Heugh Battery. The first shell cut the Fire Commander's telephone lines, so the whole action was fought by the Battery Commanders on their own under standing orders. At ranges of 4000 to 5000 yards the German shells fell round the batteries without scoring a direct hit. Heugh Battery engaged first the Seydlitz and then the Moltke until they passed out of its arc of fire, and then concentrated on the stationary Blucher which was firing at Lighthouse Battery. Lighthouse Battery scored a direct hit on Blucher's forebridge, disabling two guns of the secondary armament, but suffered a number of misfires due to an electrical fault.Robson photo in Flikr The action ended at 08.52 when the batteries fired their last rounds at 9200 yards' range at the withdrawing warships. The Germans had fired 1150 shells, killing 112 and wounding over 200 civilians and doing extensive damage to the town and docks. The Durham RGA suffered two killed, and in firing a total of 123 rounds had inflicted at least seven direct hits, killing 8 German seamen and wounding four. The bombardment of civilian targets caused great outrage among the British public at the time. The commanding officer and three gun captains of the Durham RGA were later decorated, Lt-Col Robson receiving a Distinguished Service Order, Sgt T. Douthwaite a Distinguished Conduct Medal for extracting a live cartridge from the breech of the Lighthouse Battery gun after a misfire, and Acting Bombardier J.J. Hope and Bombardier F.W. Mallin each received the Military Medal. These were the first two MMs to be gazetted after the institution of the award in April 1916. Hope's medal was the first MM minted, and the first to be presented.London Gazette 7 April 1916 In 1920, all members of the Durham RGA in action that day were made eligible for the British War Medal, normally only awarded to those who saw active service overseas. =94 Siege Battery= Although the unit never went overseas, the Durham RGA did supply trained gunners for RGA batteries and other units on active fronts (by 1916, for example, Sgt Douthwaite was with a siege battery and Bdr Mallin was a sergeant with an infantry battalion). On 16 December 1915, the Durham RGA provided 60 per cent of the manpower for 94 Siege Battery RGA being formed for overseas service (the remainder coming from Regulars and New Army volunteers of the Tynemouth RGA garrison).Lowe, p. 15. The Nominal Rolls of the battery show large numbers of men with home addresses in Hartlepool and the surrounding area.Lowe, Ch XI. Commanded by Major Daniel Sandford, 94 Siege Battery went to France in May 1916, equipped with four BL 9.2-inch howitzers Mark I (increased to six guns in January 1918). It first went into action in the preliminary bombardment for the Battle of the Somme and thereafter took part in most of the main actions on the Western Front: Battle of Arras, Battle of Messines, the Flanders Coast operations (1917), the March Retreat (1918), Battle of Amiens (1918) and the Hundred Days Offensive (1918).Lowe. During the advance in late August 1918, the battery's forward observation officer, Capt R.A.E. Somerville, found two abandoned German 7.7 cm field guns near Marincourt. With the assistance of his telephonists, he turned one gun round and fired over 100 rounds at the retreating enemy, for which he was awarded a Military Cross. The two guns were sent home as trophies, one to the Durham RGA and one to the town of Sunderland.Lowe, pp. 71‚Äì2. After the Armistice with Germany, the TF was demobilised and the Durham RGA placed in suspended animation in 1919. Interwar The TF began to reform (as the Territorial Army (TA)) in 1920. The Durham RGA was first designated the Durham Coast Brigade, RGA, but this was soon changed to Durham Heavy Brigade, RGA.Heavy Rgts at RA 39‚Äì45 The HQ was still at The Armoury in West Hartlepool, which was shared with the 3rd (Durham) Battery, RFA, and the 5th Battalion Durham Light Infantry. The commanding officer was Major Leonard Ropner (1895‚Äì1977), who was a director of a local shipping firm and had won a MC commanding a battery in France during the war. His younger brother, William Guy Ropner, was also a major in the Durham Heavy Brigade. Leonard Ropner later became an MP and was created a baronet.Burke's In the 1920s, the RGA was subsumed into the Royal Artillery (RA). The Durham Heavy Brigade consisted of 186th and 187th Heavy Batteries at West Hartlepool and Hartlepool respectively, and fell within the 50th (Northumbrian) Divisional Area.Titles and Designations 1927 In 1932, the HQ moved to the Drill Hall in Ward Street, Hartlepool and 186 Battery was converted to a Medium Battery and transferred to the 54th (Durham and West Riding) Medium Brigade RA. When the TA doubled in size in response to the 1938 Munich Crisis, the unit raised a new battery numbered 174. At the outbreak of war in September 1939, the Durham Heavy Regiment (as it was now termed) was under the orders of Northern Command.Northern Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files World War II In July 1940, the Durham Heavy Regiment was split into two units: 511 (Durham) and 526 (Durham) Coast Regiments.511 Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45 526 Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45 In the autumn of 1940, 511 Coast Regiment was guarding Hartlepool, which was equipped with one 9.2-inch gun and four 6-inch Breech Loading (BL) guns.Col K W Maurice-Jones, 1959. The History of Coast Artillery in the British Army, Royal Artillery Institution, London, p220 526 Coast Regiment had been moved to guard Paisley on the River Clyde.Coast Defence at RA 39‚Äì45 As the threat from German naval forces declined, 511 Coast Regiment was placed in suspended animation in 1943. 526 followed in June 1945 after the end of the war in Europe. Postwar Both regiments were reformed in the TA in 1947, 511 becoming 426 (Durham) Coast Regiment and 526 becoming 427 (Durham) Coast Regiment, both still based at West Hartlepool.414‚Äì443 Rgts at British Army 1945 on Both regiments were subordinated to 103 Coast Brigade, based at Darlington.Coast Brigades at British Army 1945 on However, on 1 September 1948, 427 Regiment was converted into an air defence unit as 427 (Durham) (Mixed) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment ('mixed') indicating that members of the Women's Royal Army Corps were integrated into the unit). In 1954, this unit merged into 485 (Tees) HAA Regiment at Middlesbrough.474‚Äì519 Rgts at British Army 1945 on Then, on 31 October 1956, 426 Regiment was converted to Royal Engineers (RE) as 336 (Durham Coast) Field Squadron, RE as part of 132 Field Engineer Regiment (formerly part of the Tyne Electrical Engineers). Shortly afterwards, it was redesignated 336 (Durham Coast) Crane Operating Squadron. 132 Regiment was disbanded in 1961; 336 Sqn transferred to the Royal Corps of Transport in 1965.301‚Äì336 Sqns at British Army 1945 onWatson & Rinaldi, pp. 297, 304.

Life His father was the painter . During the Siege of Hamburg, his family sought refuge at the estate of a local banker. The lithographer was living there at the time and his collection inspired Erwin's first interest in art. His father provided some of his first painting lessons, along with the local artist Friedrich Carl Gr√∂ger, while he attended a famous private school operated by Leonhard W√§chter. In 1823 (with the support of Carl Friedrich von Rumohr) he, his brother and Carl Julius Milde, another aspiring painter, travelled through Northern Germany, studying the ancient monuments, but he was also influenced by seeing the works of Friedrich Overbeck in L√ºbeck. Two years later, he studied in Munich with Peter von Cornelius and assisted him with his decorations for the loggia at the Alte Pinakothek. This reinforced his artistic inclinations which, upon his return home, were further subjected to the influence of a meeting with Philipp Otto Runge, and manifested themselves in paintings he did for a local estate in Hamm. This was followed by a four- year stay in Italy (mostly Rome), where he devoted himself largely to religious paintings, although he produced many drawings as well. Once again returning to Hamburg in 1834, he began putting his new ideas to work, designing frescoes for the Mayor's official residence. During this work, his asthma (which had plagued him for years) grew worse and the attacks became more frequent. He died soon after, before the work could be completed. His Briefe eines deutschen K√ºnstlers aus Italien (Letters from Italy by a German Painter) were published posthumously by his brother-in-law, the Professor . (2 Volumes, Leipzig 1846). His brother also became a well-known painter.

It specializes in platforms for VoIP networks. Founded in 2001, the company is known as the largest hosted unified applications and communications company as well as being listed as an Inc. 5000 company. iCore agreed to be purchased by Vonage for $92 million in August 2015. History iCore Networks was founded in 2001 by Stephen Canton, a business executive who worked for Excel Communications prior to founding iCore Networks. He launched the company in 2003 with a $7 million personal investment and the company signed its first customer in 2004. The company's services included managing VoPI networks, similar to VoIP networks. As opposed to using private point to point circuits like VoIP, iCore Networks uses a managed and hosted end-to-end system to eliminate poor call quality. The company raised an additional $6.4 million in capital in 2006 that the company used to upgrade its network facilities. It also partnered with Global Telecom & Technology in 2008 in order to strengthen its infrastructure. By 2009 the company reported revenues of approximate $25 million per year.

Tauris, pp. 33-34, 335‚Äì336, Since then, the Hijab issue has become controversial in Iranian politics. One of the enduring legacies of Reza Shah has been turning dress into an integral problem of Iranian politics.  Impact  In 1936 Reza Shah banned the veil and encouraged Iranians to adopt European dress in an effort to promote nation-building in a country with many tribal, regional, religious, and class-based variations in clothing. It was the policy of the Shah to increase women's participation in society as a method of the modernization of the country, in accordance with the example of Turkey.Lois Beck, Guity Nashat, Women in Iran from 1800 to the Islamic Republic The Queen and the other women of the royal family assisted in this when they started to perform public representational duties as role models for women participating in public society, and they also played an active part as role models in the Kashf-e hijab. The unveiling of women had a huge symbolic importance to achieve women's participation in society, and the shah introduced the reform gradually so as not to cause unrest. While women teachers where encouraged to unveil in 1933 and schoolgirls and women students in 1935, the official declaration of unveiling were made on 8 January 1936, and the queen and her daughters where given an important role in this event. That day, Reza Shah attended the graduation ceremony of the Tehran Teacher's College with the queen and their two daughters unveiled and dressed in modern clothes, without veils. The queen handed out diplomas, while the shah spoke about half the population being disregarded, and told women that the future was now in their hands. This was the first time an Iranian queen showed herself in public. Afterwards, the Shah had pictures of his unveiled wife and daughters published, and unveiling enforced throughout Iran. Enforcement To enforce this decree, the police were ordered to physically remove the veil from any woman who wore it in public. Women were beaten, their headscarves and chadors torn off, and their homes forcibly searched.Fatemi, Nasrallah Saifpour (1989). Reza Shah wa koudeta-ye 1299 (Persian), Rahavard ‚Äì A Persian Journal of Iranian Studies, Vol. 7, n. 23, pp. 160-180, Los Angeles: Society of the Friends of the Persian Culture, Beeman, William Orman (2008). The Great Satan vs. the Mad Mullahs: How the United States and Iran Demonize Each Other, 2nd ed, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, pp. 108, 152, Until Reza Shah's abdication in 1941, many women simply chose not leave their houses in order to avoid confrontations, and a few even committed suicide to avoid removing their hijabs due to the decree. A far larger escalation of violence occurred in the summer of 1935, when Reza Shah ordered all men to wear European-style bowler hats. This provoked massive non-violent demonstrations in July in the city of Mashhad, which were brutally suppressed by the Imperial Iranian army, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 100 to 500 people (including women and children).  Criticism  Some Western historians has stated that this would have been a progressive step if women had indeed chosen to do it themselves, but that this ban humiliated and alienated many Iranian women,El Guindi, Fadwa (1999). Veil: Modesty, Privacy and Resistance, Oxford; New York: Berg Publishers; Bloomsbury Academic, pp. 3, 13‚Äì16, 130, 174‚Äì176, Chehabi, Houchang Esfandiar (2003): \\"11.

The Veil: Women Writers on Its History, Lore, and Politics, Berkeley; Los Angeles: University of California Press, pp. 66, 252‚Äì253, 256, 260, since its effect was, because of the effect of traditional beliefs, comparable to a hypothetical situation in which European women were suddenly ordered to go out topless into the street. Some historians have pointed out that Reza Shah's ban on veiling and his policies were unseen in Atat√ºrk's Turkey. The decree by Reza Shah was criticized by British consul in Tehran:Abrahamian, Ervand (2008). A History of Modern Iran, Cambridge, UK; New York: Cambridge University Press, pp. 84, 94‚Äì95, According to Iran's current Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, the policy was aimed at \\"eradicating the tremendous power of faith\\" in Muslim societies that was enabled by what he termed the \\"decency of women\\", as hijab in his view prevented Muslim women from suffering from the \\"malicious abuse\\" that he regarded women in the West to be victims of, and what in his view made people preoccupied with sexual desires.  Aftermath  One of the enduring legacies of Reza Shah has been turning dress into an integral problem of Iranian politics. Under next ruler Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, official measures relaxed slightly, and wearing of the veil or chador was no longer an offence, but under his regime, the chador became a significant hindrance to climbing the social ladder, as it was considered a badge of backwardness and an indicator of being a member of the lower class. Discrimination against the women wearing the headscarf or chador was still widespread with public institutions actively discouraging their use, with even some restaurants refusing to admit women who wore them.Ramezani, Reza (2008). Hijab dar Iran, dar doure-ye Pahlavi-ye dovvom [Hijab in Iran, the second Pahlavi era] (Persian), Faslnamah-e Takhassusi-ye Banuvan-e Shi'ah [Quarterly Journal of Shiite Women], Qom: Muassasah-e Shi'ah Shinasi, This period is characterized by the dichotomy between a minority who considered wearing the veil as a sign of backwardness and the majority who did not. Despite all legal pressures and obstacles, the largest proportion of Iranian women continued to wear veils or chadors, contrary to widespread opposing claims. Earlier in the mid-1930s, only four thousand out of 6.5 million Iranian women ventured into public places without veils, almost all in Tehran and consisting mainly of Western-educated daughters of the upper class, foreign wives of recent returnees from Europe, and middle-class women from the minorities. = Revolutionary backlash = During the 1970s, hijab was considered by some as a sign of \\"virtue\\", and was considered by Pahlavis as a rejection of their rule, with many middle-class working women starting to use it voluntarily. It came to be some oppositional women's way of expressing the revolutionary \\"demand for respect and dignity\\", rather than a sign of backwardness. Unveiled women came to be seen by some of the opposition as victims of Westoxication, \\"a super-consumer\\" of products of Imperialism, a propagator of \\"corrupt Western culture\\", undermining the \\"morals of society\\". The revolutionary advocacy for the poor and the tradition brought chador back to popularity among the opposition, and women from different classes wore hijab for different reasons, including to protest treatment of women as sex objects. It was no longer considered a hindrance, but empowerment enabling access to public spheres without facing sexual harassment. Unlike in the past, thousands of veiled women participated in religious processions alongside men when they also expressed their anti-Shah protests.Paidar, Parvin (1995): Women and the Political Process in Twentieth-Century Iran, Cambridge Middle East studies, Vol. 1, Cambridge, UK; New York: Cambridge University Press, pp. 213‚Äì215,  See also  * Goharshad Mosque rebellion * Human rights in the Imperial State of Iran * Pahlavi dynasty * The Culture of Nakedness and the Nakedness of Culture * Hujum References External links * Pictures about Kashf-e hijab Category:Pahlavi dynasty Category:Women in Iran Category:Violence against women in Asia Category:Secularism in Iran Category:Islamic female clothing ","title":"Kashf-e hijab"},{"id":"43667038","text":"Par Sanda (born June 22, 1965) is a Swedish entrepreneur, developer and stock trader.

The Evangelical Church in Baden is a united Protestant church. Its headquarter, the Evangelical Superior Church Council (, EOK) is located in Karlsruhe. The church is not confused with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Baden, based in Freiburg im Breisgau. History In 1821 the Evangelical Church in Baden was founded by uniting Lutheran and Reformed churches in the Grand Duchy of Baden, thus its then name United Evangelical Protestant Church of the Grand Duchy of Baden. The church body comprises only congregations of united Protestant confession. After the grand duchy had become the Republic of Baden in 1918 and after the separation of religion and state by the Weimar Constitution in 1919 the church adopted a new constitution in December 1919 accounting for these changes, renaming as the United Evangelical Protestant Regional Church of Baden (Vereinigte Evangelisch-protestantische Landeskirche Badens). In 1922 the church counted 821,000 parishioners.Sebastian M√ºller-Rolli in collaboration with Reiner Anselm, Evangelische Schulpolitik in Deutschland 1918‚Äì1958: Dokumente und Darstellung, G√∂ttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1999, (=Eine Ver√∂ffentlichung des Comenius-Instituts M√ºnster), p. 30. . Nazi-aligned Protestant activists, emerging from the 1931-founded Nazi Federation of pastors of Baden (NS- Pfarrbund, Gau Baden), candidated for the nominating group called the German Christians and some won already in the ordinary election for synodals and presbyters in late 1932.Bernd Martin, ‚ÄûProfessoren und Bekennende Kirche.

They still formed a minority in the legislating assembly of the church, the Landessynode. After the Nazi takeover the synodals standing for the nominating group of the Ecclesiastical Liberal Union (Kirchlich- Liberale Vereinigung, KLV) jumped ship and joined the German Christians' faction. On 1 June 1933, together with the votes of further other sympathisers of the Nazi takeover among the synodals a new majority led by the German Christians voted in a new episcopal church constitution, doing away with most of the say of the Landessynode for the future. Instead the new office of the Landesbischof (i.e. regional bishop) was formed bundling the spiritual, legislative and executive church leadership (before the first was with the prelate, the second with the Landessynode, and the third with the EOK) in the hands of one single man, as typical for the concept of the F√ºhrerprinzip, in harsh contradiction to the Protestant tradition of synodal legislation and collegiality in the consistorial executive. The Evangelical Superior Church Council (EOK) in Karlsruhe. This adulteration of Protestant church governance started the Kirchenkampf (1933‚Äì1945; i.e. struggle of the churches) in Baden. On 24 June 1933 the Landessynode elected the incumbent Prelate Julius K√ºhlewein the new powerful Landesbischof regnant, being ex officio the head of the EOK, downsized in members.Bernd Martin, ‚ÄûProfessoren und Bekennende Kirche.

On 23 July 1933, the day of the unconstitutional premature reelection of synodals and presbyters imposed by Hitler, the Nazi-submissive German Christians then gained a majority of 32 seats against the only remaining opposition of 25 members of the conservative Ecclesiastical Positive Association (Kirchlich-Positive Vereinigung, KPV, another nominating group not to be confused with the proponents of the so-called Positive Christianity) in the widely self- disenfranchised Landessynode.Hermann Erbacher, Die Evangelische Landeskirche in Baden in der Weimarer Zeit und im Dritten Reich 1919‚Äì1945.

On 5 April 1934 the various opposing church groups merged in the Badischer Bekennerbund (i.e. Baden Covenant of Confessors), the Confessing Church branch in Baden,Bernd Martin, ‚ÄûProfessoren und Bekennende Kirche.

Representatives of the Baden Covenant of Confessors participated in the first Reich's Synod of Confession (Reichsbekenntnissynode) and voted in, with others, the Barmen Declaration. On 19 June 1934 the Baden Covenant of Confessors and more intra-church opponents formed the Regional Brethren Council (Landesbruderrat), considered the new parallel church leadership in opposition to the official church led by K√ºhlewein.Bernd Martin, ‚ÄûProfessoren und Bekennende Kirche.

After polling the pastors of the Church of Baden, resulting in a majority of supporters for a merger of the church into the new Protestant Reich Church (478 yeas, against 92 nays, with 18 abstentions and 32 pastors not having answered), on 13 July K√ºhlewein declared the merger of his church into the new streamlined Reich church.Bernd Martin, ‚ÄûProfessoren und Bekennende Kirche.

The Baden Confessors protested that self-aggrandising act of K√ºhlewein. By the end of 1934 K√ºhlewein changed his mind, and reversed the merger,Bernd Martin, ‚ÄûProfessoren und Bekennende Kirche.

This again split K√ºhlewein's previous supporters in two, those following his new course, and those who did not. When the Reich bishop, claiming leadership over Baden as part of the Reich church, in April 1935 visited his supporters in Baden, he was mostly welcomed by local Nazi party leaders and local German Christians, but completely ignored by any representative of the official Baden church under K√ºhlewein.Bernd Martin, ‚ÄûProfessoren und Bekennende Kirche. Zur Formierung Freiburger Widerstandskreise √ºber den evangelischen Kirchenkampf‚Äú in: Wirtschaft, Politik, Freiheit: Freiburger Wirtschaftswissenschaftler und der Widerstand, Nils Goldschmidt (ed.), T√ºbingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2005. pp. 27‚Äì55, here p. 45. . In May 1936 K√ºhlewein in a meeting with the Nazi Gauleiter for Baden, explained that the members of his church clung by 50% to the Confessing Church, 25% were undecided and maximally 25% followed the German Christians. His task would be to protect church members, also when attacked as subversive Confessing Christians by the Nazi government.Bernd Martin, ‚ÄûProfessoren und Bekennende Kirche. Zur Formierung Freiburger Widerstandskreise √ºber den evangelischen Kirchenkampf‚Äú in: Wirtschaft, Politik, Freiheit: Freiburger Wirtschaftswissenschaftler und der Widerstand, Nils Goldschmidt (ed.), T√ºbingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2005. pp. 27‚Äì55, here p. 47. . This shift of behaviour and opinion opened the way for reconciliation of many Baden Confessors with the official church leader. In 1937 K√ºhlewein joined with the Baden church the moderately Nazi-opposing block of the so-called intact regional Lutheran churches, to wit Bavaria, Hanover, and neighbouring W√ºrttemberg.Gerhard Besier, Die Kirchen und das Dritte Reich: Spaltungen und Abwehrk√§mpfe 1934‚Äì1937, Berlin and Munich: Propyl√§en, 2001, (=Die Kirchen und das Dritte Reich; vol. 3), pp. 406‚Äì412. . In order to suppress the Confessing Church in Baden, now obviously not fought anymore by K√ºhlewein, the Nazi Reich government decided to block the Baden Confessors by draining their access to any finances. To this end, on 25 May 1938 the decree with the euphemising title Law on the Wealth Formation within the Regional Protestant Churches, passed on 11 March 1935 and then already applied to Regional churches within Prussia, was also implemented in Baden.Bernd Martin, ‚ÄûProfessoren und Bekennende Kirche.

So any offertory, to-be-collected, all budgets, remittances and payments by any entity of the church, were subject to approval by government-appointed comptrollers. This caused an outrage of pastors, rallying for public demonstrations, and a sharp protest by K√ºhlewein, backing the demonstrators, but in vain. After the government waged war on Poland and thus started the Second World War, male members of the Confessing Church were preferently drafted for the army.Barbara Kr√ºger and Peter Noss, ‚ÄûDie Strukturen in der Evangelischen Kirche 1933‚Äì1945‚Äú, in: Kirchenkampf in Berlin 1932‚Äì1945: 42 Stadtgeschichten, Olaf K√ºhl-Freudenstein, Peter Noss, and Claus Wagener (eds.), Berlin: Institut Kirche und Judentum, 1999, (=Studien zu Kirche und Judentum; vol. 18), pp. 149‚Äì171, here p. 167. . Hanns Kerrl demanded to calm down the struggle of the churches, since the Wehrmacht wanted no activities against pastors of the Confessing Church during the war. So the Gestapo concentrated on pastors of the Confessing Church, who were not drafted. In January 1940, urged by the Wehrmacht, Hitler repeated that no wide-ranging actions against the Confessing Church are to be taken, so that the Gestapo returned to selective forms of repression. After K√ºhlewein had resigned after the war, in November 1945, on the first Landessynode convened after the World War II, Julius Bender, a proponent of the Confessing Church, was elected the new Landesbischof. After the war a movement developed within a number of regional Protestant churches promoting constitutional changes drawing lessons from the vulnerability of their churches and its staff for giving way to state pressure. Synodalism was strengthened and the separation of religion and state was reinforced in a number of church renamings from the church of a certain nation, to the church of a certain denomination within a certain nation. So on 1 July 1957 the present name, \\"Evangelical Regional Church in Baden\\" replaced the former naming \\"United Evangelical Protestant Regional Church of Baden\\".Uwe Kai Jacobs, ‚ÄûDer Evangelische Kirchenvertrag Baden-W√ºrttemberg vom 17.

Having had his secondary education, he went abroad to study first at Waseda University, Tokyo, and then the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States. His research was carried out at the University of London, England with the focus on political science.Liu Shaotang (1975 - <>). Minguo renwu xiaozhuan, v.10. p. 192-201.

The Japanese invasion of China interrupted his research work, and brought him back from London to participate in the war of resistance against Japan.Liu Shaotang (1975 - <>). Minguo renwu xiaozhuan, v.10. p. 192-201. Taipei: Zhuan ji wen xue chu ban she. Via Siberia, he first reached Harbin, in north east China, which had not yet been occupied by Japan. In order to arouse the patriotic feelings of people he started publishing an evening paper - Sheng Kwang Evening Post, and he made himself Editor in Chief. This was the first paper ever published in Manchuria that openly supported the war of resistance against Japan and thus won the sympathy of the people. It was so popular that their printing press failed to turn out enough to meet the daily demand.Liu Shaotang (1975 - <>). Minguo renwu xiaozhuan, v.10. p. 192-201. Taipei: Zhuan ji wen xue chu ban she. Before the Japanese troops took over Harbin, the editorial opinion was so fiery that the Japanese military authorities forced Zhang Jinghui, Governor of the Special Area to ban its publication. Zhang Jinghui later became the Prime Minister of the Manchukuo in 1935. Chow was forewarned and escaped. On the eve of the loss of Harbin, he disguised himself and slipped out of Harbin and reached Tientsin and Beijing where the Generals and leaders such as Zhang Xueliang and Zhang Zuoxiang gathered. He was actually the nephew of Zhang Zuoxiang, a top commander under Zhang Zuolin.McCormack, Gavan (1977). Chang Tso-lin in Northeast China 1911-1928. Stanford University Press. p.71 In 1933 when the Japanese troops marched into Jehol province, the Northeast Army decided to take a stand. In conformity with the instructions of the Nanking Government, the Northeast army and local militia were re-organized into two armies.

Chow Ching-wen joined the second army as Chief of Military Judicial department responsible for political training of the troops and mobilization of the masses.Liu Shaotang (1975 - <>).

Then the Nanjing government wanted to seek compromise with the Japanese. General Zhang Xueliang was compelled to resign and to go abroad. Without any formal organization, Chow gathered some comrades to form the Northeast People's Self-Salvation Association with a weekly publication called Self Salvation in order to mobilize the masses against Japan. This was not in line with the Nanjing foreign policy. In less than half a year, some comrades were arrested and the paper was banned from circulation.Liu Shaotang (1975 - <>).

Biography Cogan was born in Cork, where he was a choirboy and vicar choral at St Fin Barre's Cathedral. In 1772, he was appointed a stipendiary at Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin, but left the post a few months later due to ill health.Barra Boydell: Music at Christ Church before 1800: Documents and Selected Anthems (Dublin: Four Courts Press, 1999), pp. 119‚Äì20. From 1780 to 1806 he was organist at St Patrick's Cathedral. He also conducted the orchestras of the Smock Alley and Crow Street theatres \\"to the detriment of his church duties\\".Ita Beausang: \\"Cogan, Philip\\", in: The Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland, ed. H. White & B. Boydell (Dublin: UCD Press, 2013), pp. 212‚Äì3. In fact, Cogan's compositions for the stage outnumber those for the church by far. He not only wrote operas himself (The Rape of Proserpine, 1776; The Ruling Passion, 1778; etc.), but also collaborated with other Dublin composers, as in The Contract (1782, with John Andrew Stevenson, Tommaso Giordani, and one Laurent). In 1787, Cogan was a co-founder of the Irish Musical Fund Society. He was an active participant in Dublin's musical life for many years including performances in the annual \\"Commemoration of Handel\\" festivals at the Rotunda and at various charity concerts in both Catholic and Protestant churches. Cogan was a much sought-after teacher and counted among his pupils a number of noteworthy names in Irish musical history such as Michael Kelly, Thomas Moore, P.K. Moran, William Michael Rooke and, most likely, Thomas Augustine Geary. In 1817 he conducted a concert, which also marked the first public appearance of the young Michael William Balfe. He was often called \\"Doctor Cogan\\", but there is no evidence that he ever studied at Dublin's Trinity College. Cogan enjoyed a long and prosperous life; he died at the home of his son-in-law, Patrick Clinton, at 14 Dominick Street, Dublin, and is buried in Glasnevin cemetery. Today, Cogan's reputation rests on his keyboard music, which compares well with that of most of his better-known contemporaries. His music falls into the period of the development from the harpsichord to the piano, and, in time, his compositions fully exploit the sonic and technical possibilities of the grand piano. His best music can be found among his piano sonatas and the piano concerto op. 5 (1790).

His works include his grandmother's kitchen, the family's living room at Christmas, an herb shop, Chinese laundry, shoeshine stand, and life in a single room occupancy hotel common in Chinatown.  Early life and career  Frank Wong was born in Los Angeles, California on September 22, 1934. His family moved to Chinatown in San Francisco shortly after his birth. After high school, Wong enlisted in the U.S. Navy. Following a 4-year stint, he settled in Honolulu, Hawaii and found work making props for a costume store and magicians. Eventually, he became a prop master for film and television productions including Magnum, P.I.. In the late 1980s, Wong became homesick for San Francisco and he moved back to the city. However, the city of Wong's youth had changed and his family had moved on. During a visit to the Chinese Historical Society of America (CHSA) in San Francisco, Wong learned that few images of old Chinatown existed, and he began creating memories of his youth in miniature dioramas. Wong conducted research at the San Francisco Public Library's Chinatown branch and referenced old Sears catalogs for product label accuracy. In 2004, Wong donated seven miniatures of scenes of Chinatown, titled ‚ÄúThe Chinatown Miniatures Collection,‚Äù to CHSA.

It was recorded in mono with only voice and guitar. Reception Music critic Thom Jurek praised the release in his Allmusic review, writing \\"...it's the originals, all rooted in country and blues gospel, that embrace with unflinching honesty a return to Phelps' evangelical roots, but he's older, wiser, repentant. His bottleneck slide playing and fingerpicking finesse are deft and fluid as ever. His writing is tight, full of solid melodies, beautiful couplets, biblical poetry, and lithe passages where lyrics and guitars blur and intertwine seamlessly... No matter your spiritual beliefs, it's difficult to fault Phelps for such a warm, inviting, and brave recording.

Glenview manages capital for investors through a series of private investment funds. The firm was founded by Larry Robbins, the firm's CEO and portfolio manager, and is based in New York. History Robbins left Omega Advisors in 2000 to form Glenview Capital Management, named after the suburban Chicago area where he started playing hockey at age five. Investment products and strategies Glenview's investing style is most commonly tied to the category of Growth at a Reasonable Price or ‚ÄúGARP‚Äù and focuses on companies in industries that are stable, predictable and steady, with recurring revenue streams or entrenched market positions. Glenview's flagship funds which launched in 2001 employ a long/short strategy focused on investments in equity and fixed income securities. In 2007, Glenview launched the Glenview Opportunity or ‚ÄúGO‚Äù funds which employ a purely opportunistic investment approach. Across these two strategies Glenview manages the following investment funds: Glenview Capital Partners, L.P., Glenview Institutional Partners, L.P., Glenview Capital Partners (Cayman), Ltd., Glenview Capital Opportunity Fund, L.P. and Glenview Offshore Opportunity Fund, Ltd. In 2013, the firm placed number one on the Bloomberg Markets annual ranking of best performing large hedge funds due to the performance of the Glenview Capital Opportunity Fund, which saw an 84% gain through October 31 2013. Investment history Glenview holds investments in a broad range of industries including healthcare, industrials, consumer services and technology companies. In 2013, Health Management Associates (HMA) and Community Health Systems announced that they had agreed to a $3.9 billion merger. Owning a 14.6% stake in HMA, Glenview objected to the terms of the deal and submitted consents from a majority of the shareholders of HMA to remove and replace the entire Board of Directors. The merger was completed in January 2014. In 2016, Glenview became the largest shareholder in hospital chain Tenet Healthcare with a 17.8% stake in the company. In 2017, after Dow Chemical engaged in merger discussions with DuPont, Glenview and other shareholders pushed for changes to the plan of how the combined company, DowDuPont, would be broken up.

In 2019-2020 it will celebrate its 35th season. History The orchestra was founded by musicologist David Urness and originally named \\"Musicians of the Cloister\\" after the cloister garden at Trinity Episcopal Church in Indianapolis. Urness modeled ICO after the Academy of St Martin in the Fields. The orchestra was incorporated in 1985 and adopted its current name in 1987. In 2004 the orchestra merged with Indianapolis Youth Wind Ensemble as part of an ongoing outreach program. The 1985 concert season featured performances at Indiana Repertory Theatre. During the 1986-87 season, the orchestra performed at the Indianapolis Museum of Art. Then in 1988, the orchestra moved to Clowes Memorial Hall at Butler University. Currently the orchestra performs at Howard L. Schrott Center for the Arts. Music director Kirk Trevor joined the ICO in 1988 and retired at the end of the 2014-15 season. In July 2015, Matthew Kraemer was named as Music Director and Principal Conductor.  About the Indianapolis Chamber Orchestra  The Indianapolis Chamber Orchestra (ICO) reaches more than 30,000 people annually through its seven-concert series, arts partner services, education/outreach programs, and radio broadcast. In addition to Music Director and Principal Conductor Matthew Kraemer, James Aikman serves as Composer-in-Residence. The ICO is professional Orchestra-in- Residence at the Howard L. Schrott Center for the Arts, Butler Arts Center, a perfect venue for the ICO in terms of size, acoustics, location and aesthetic ambiance, and the production capabilities to open up new possibilities for artistic programming. Composed of 34 professional musicians, the Indianapolis Chamber Orchestra advances and promotes music composed for the small orchestra through professional concert performances and education and outreach programs. Each year the ICO presents a concert series that features internationally recognized guest artists, superior local talent, and aspiring young soloists, and showcases the talents of living composers. The ICO's artistic programming uses innovative program formats and intimate concert venues. The ICO takes an active role in perpetuating the art form by commissioning and presenting works of living composers, as well as presenting venerable masterworks. The ICO has the distinction of performing several world and American premieres. The orchestra also accompanies the Indianapolis Opera, the International Violin Competition of Indianapolis, the American Pianists Association, and the Indianapolis Symphonic Choir. A weekly ICO radio broadcast on WFYI, 90.1 FM expands the concert experience by featuring selections from ICO concerts and interviews with the Maestro and guest artists. In 2017 the ICO was featured on the PBS concert ‚ÄúA Festival of Carols with Sylvia McNair.‚Äù Peacemakers, premiered in 2016, became the subject of an Emmy Award-winning PBS documentary in 2017. In May 2015, the ICO released its first commercial CD, Momentum 21. While Momentum 21 is a milestone in the ICO's growth and development, it also speaks of the forward momentum and direction of contemporary music composed for chamber orchestra, and of the dynamic talent that is adding to the body of music literature in the 21st century. In 2018-2019 the ICO served its twelfth year as Orchestra-in-Residence for the Indiana State Contemporary Music Festival. Through its affiliation with this three-day immersive educational event, the ICO sponsors a nation-wide competition for the composition of new works for chamber orchestra. In 2016 the ICO collaborated nationally with the American Composers Orchestra ‚ÄúEarShot‚Äù program to be the first chamber orchestra to present new orchestral works by five emerging American composers. The ICO offers a full range of education and outreach programs for all ages. ICO FUNtastic Classics and Residency programs take ICO musicians into area schools for live programs or classroom coaching. ICO Concert Connections brings area youth to ICO concerts. Each summer the ICO partners with Indy Parks to present a free, family-friendly parks concert. The ICO‚Äôs administrative offices are located at Butler University. Operating support comes from private and government granting agencies, and corporate and individual contributors who appreciate the ICO‚Äôs place in Indianapolis‚Äô multi- dimensional cultural climate. The ICO is governed by a Board of Directors drawn from the professional and business communities. The ICO has professionally managed endowed funds valued at $2 million (as of December 31, 2017).

The band formed during Zambia's post-independence golden days, but by the late-1970s, economic collapse and increasing government authoritarianism, saw WITCH, like most Zamrock bands, playing daytime shows to avoid curfews, fading away.

During this time, the band moved away from rock, and towards disco music. After the departure of Patrick Chisembele and Christine Jackson, WITCH's sound again shifted, now to further incorporate elements of Zambian music. This later iteration, led by Chris Mbewe, largely played kalindula music, exemplified in tracks from this era such as \\"Janet\\" and \\"Nazingwa\\". After the mid-1980s, the band faded into obscurity and stopped playing live until 2012, when Chanda was invited to the US to revive the band.

It is named after Paul Peter Ewald and Carl Wilhelm Oseen, who proved the theorem in crystalline and isotropic media, respectively, in 1916 and 1915. Originally, the theorem applied to scattering by an isotropic dielectric objects in free space. The scope of the theorem was greatly extended to encompass a wide variety of bianisotropic media.  Overview  An important part of optical physics theory is starting with microscopic physics‚Äîthe behavior of atoms and electrons‚Äîand using it to derive the familiar, macroscopic, laws of optics. In particular, there is a derivation of how the refractive index works and where it comes from, starting from microscopic physics. The Ewald‚ÄìOseen extinction theorem is one part of that derivation (as is the Lorentz‚ÄìLorenz equation etc.). When light traveling in vacuum enters a transparent medium like glass, the light slows down, as described by the index of refraction. Although this fact is famous and familiar, it is actually quite strange and surprising when you think about it microscopically. After all, according to the superposition principle, the light in the glass is a superposition of: * The original light wave, and * The light waves emitted by oscillating electrons in the glass. (Light is an oscillating electromagnetic field that pushes electrons back and forth, emitting dipole radiation.) Individually, each of these waves travels at the speed of light in vacuum, not at the (slower) speed of light in glass. Yet when the waves are added up, they surprisingly create only a wave that travels at the slower speed. The Ewald‚ÄìOseen extinction theorem says that the light emitted by the atoms has a component traveling at the speed of light in vacuum, which exactly cancels out (\\"extinguishes\\") the original light wave. Additionally, the light emitted by the atoms has a component which looks like a wave traveling at the slower speed of light in glass. Altogether, the only wave in the glass is the slow wave, consistent with what we expect from basic optics. A more complete description can be found in Classical Optics and its Applications, by Masud Mansuripur. A proof of the classical theorem can be found in Principles of Optics, by Born and Wolf., and that of its extension has been presented by Akhlesh Lakhtakia.  Derivation from Maxwell's equations  = Introduction = When an electromagnetic wave enters a dielectric medium, it excites (resonates) the material‚Äôs electrons whether they are free or bound, setting them into a vibratory state with the same frequency as the wave. These electrons will in turn radiate their own electromagnetic fields as a result of their oscillation (EM fields of oscillating charges). Due to the linearity of Maxwell equations, one expects the total field at any point in space to be the sum of the original field and the field produced by oscillating electrons. This result is, however, counterintuitive to the practical wave one observes in the dielectric moving at a speed of c/n, where n is the medium index of refraction. The Ewald-Oseen extinction theorem seek to address the disconnect by demonstrating how the superposition of these two waves reproduces the familiar result of a wave that moves at a speed of c/n. = Derivation = Let‚Äôs consider a simplified situation in which a monochromatic electromagnetic wave is normally incident on a medium filling half the space in the region z>0 as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1: The half-space z>0 is a dielectric material with susceptibility œá. The half-space z<0 is vacuum. The electric Ô¨Åeld at a point in space is the sum of the electric fields due to all the various sources. In our case, we separate the fields in two categories based on their generating sources. We denote the incident field \\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{vac}} and the sum of the fields generated by the oscillating electrons in the medium \\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{rad}}(z, t). The total field at any point z in space is then given by the superposition of the two contributions, \\\\mathbf{E}(z, t)=\\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{vac}}(z, t)+\\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{rad}}(z, t). To match what we already observe, \\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{vac}} has this form. However, we already know that inside the medium, z>0, we will only observe what we call the transmitted E-field \\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{t}}which travels through the material at speed c/n. Therefore in this formalism, \\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{rad}}(z, t)=-\\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{vac}}(z, t)+\\\\mathbf{E}_{T}(z, t) This to say that the radiated field cancels out the incident field and creates a transmitted field traveling within the medium at speed c/n. Using the same logic, outside the medium the radiated field produces the effect of a reflected field \\\\mathbf{E}_{R} traveling at speed c in the opposite direction to the incident field. \\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{rad}}(z, t)=-\\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{vac}}(z, t)-\\\\mathbf{E}_{R}(z, t) assume that the wavelength is much larger than the average separation of atoms so that the medium can be considered continuous. We use the usual macroscopic E and B fields and take the medium to be nonmagnetic and neutral so that Maxwell‚Äôs equations read \\\\begin{array}{l}{ abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{E}=0} \\\\\\\\\\\\ { abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{B}=0} \\\\\\\\\\\\ { abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{E}=-\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{B} / \\\\partial t} \\\\\\\\\\\\ { abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{B}=\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu}_{0} \\\\mathbf{J}+\\\\epsilon_{0} \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu}_{0} \\\\partial \\\\mathbf{E} / \\\\partial t}\\\\end{array} both the total electric and magnetic fields \\\\mathbf{E}=\\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{vac}}+\\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{rad}}, \\\\quad \\\\mathbf{B}=\\\\mathbf{B}_{\\\\mathrm{vac}}+\\\\mathbf{B}_{\\\\mathrm{rad}} the set of Maxwell equations inside the dielectric \\\\begin{array}{l}{ abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{rad}}=0} \\\\\\\\\\\\ { abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{B}_{\\\\mathrm{rad}}=0} \\\\\\\\\\\\ { abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{rad}}=-\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{B}_{\\\\mathrm{rad}} / \\\\partial t} \\\\\\\\\\\\ { abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{B}_{\\\\mathrm{rad}}=\\\\mu_{0} \\\\mathbf{J}+\\\\epsilon_{0} \\\\mu_{0} \\\\partial \\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{rad}} / \\\\partial t}\\\\end{array} where \\\\mathbf{J} includes the true and polarization current induced in the material by the outside electric field. We assume a linear relationship between the current and the electric field, hence \\\\mathbf{J}={\\\\sigma} \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{vac}} + \\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{rad}}\\\\right) The set of Maxwell equations outside the dielectric has no current density term \\\\begin{array}{l}{ abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{vac}}=0} \\\\\\\\\\\\ { abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{B}_{\\\\mathrm{vac}}=0} \\\\\\\\\\\\ { abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{vac}}=-\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{B}_{\\\\mathrm{vac}} / \\\\partial t} \\\\\\\\\\\\ { abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{B}_{\\\\mathrm{vac}}=\\\\epsilon_{0} \\\\mu_{0} \\\\partial \\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{vac}} / \\\\partial t}\\\\end{array} The two sets of Maxwell equations are coupled since the vacuum electric field appears in the current density term. For a monochromatic wave at normal incidence, the vacuum electric field has the form \\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{vac}}(z, t)=\\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{vac}} \\\\exp [i(k z-\\\\omega t)] , with k=\\\\omega /{c}. Now to solve for \\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{rad}}, we take the curl of the third equation in the first set of Maxwell equation and combine it with the fourth. \\\\begin{array}{l}{ abla\\\\times abla\\\\times \\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{rad}}=-\\\\partial( abla\\\\times\\\\mathbf{B}_{\\\\mathrm{rad}}) / \\\\partial t} \\\\\\\\\\\\ { abla\\\\times abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{rad}}=-\\\\partial(\\\\mu_{0} \\\\mathbf{J}+\\\\epsilon_{0} \\\\mu_{0} \\\\partial \\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{rad}} / \\\\partial t)/\\\\partial t}\\\\end{array} We simplify the double curl in a couple of steps using Einstein summation. \\\\begin{align}( abla\\\\times abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{E})_{i} &= \\\\epsilon_{i j k}\\\\epsilon_{k l m}\\\\partial_{j} \\\\partial_{l} E_{m} \\\\\\\\\\\\&=(\\\\delta_{i l} \\\\delta_{j \\\\mathrm{m}}-\\\\delta_{i \\\\mathrm{m}} \\\\delta_{j l})\\\\partial_{j} \\\\partial_{l} E_{m} \\\\\\\\\\\\&=\\\\partial_{i}(\\\\partial_{j}E_{j})-\\\\partial_{j}\\\\partial_{j}E_{i} \\\\end{align} Hence we obtain, abla\\\\times abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{E}_{rad}= abla( abla\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{E}_{rad})- abla^2\\\\mathbf{E}_{rad} Then substituting \\\\mathbf{J} by {\\\\sigma} \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{vac}} + \\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{rad}}\\\\right) , using the fact that abla\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{rad}}=0 we obtain, abla^2\\\\mathbf{E}_{rad}=\\\\partial(\\\\mu_{0}{\\\\sigma}\\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{vac}}+\\\\mu_0 {\\\\sigma} \\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{rad}}+\\\\epsilon_{0} \\\\mu_{0} \\\\partial \\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{rad}} / \\\\partial t)/\\\\partial t Realizing that all the fields have the same time dependence \\\\exp [-i \\\\omega t] , the time derivatives are straightforward and we obtain the following inhomogeneous wave equation abla^{2} \\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{rad}}+\\\\mu_{0} \\\\omega^{2}\\\\left(\\\\epsilon_{0}+i \\\\sigma / \\\\omega\\\\right) \\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{rad}}=-i \\\\mu_{0} \\\\omega \\\\sigma \\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{vac}}(z) with particular solution \\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{rad}}^{P}=-\\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{vac}}(z) For the complete solution, we add to the particular solution the general solution of the homogeneous equation which is a superposition of plane waves traveling in arbitrary directions[13] \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{rad}}^{c}\\\\right)_{i}=\\\\int g_{i}(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta}, \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\phi}) \\\\exp \\\\left(i \\\\mathbf{k}^{\\\\prime} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{r}\\\\right) d \\\\Omega Where k^{\\\\prime} is found from the homogeneous equation to be k^{\\\\prime 2}=\\\\mu_{0} \\\\epsilon_{0} \\\\omega^{2}\\\\left(1+i \\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{\\\\epsilon_{0} \\\\omega}\\\\right) Note that we have taken the solution as a coherent superposition of plane waves. Because of symmetry, we expect the fields to be the same in a plane perpendicular to the z axis. Hence \\\\mathbf{k}^{\\\\prime} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{a}=0, where \\\\mathbf a is a displacement perpendicular to z. Since there are no boundaries in the region z>0, we expect a wave traveling to the right. The solution to the homogeneous equation becomes, \\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{rad}}^{c}=\\\\mathbf{E}_{T} \\\\exp \\\\left(i k^{\\\\prime} z\\\\right) Adding this to the particular solution, we get the radiated wave inside the medium ( z>0 ) \\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{rad}}=-\\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{vac}}(z)+\\\\mathbf{E}_{T} \\\\exp \\\\left(i k^{\\\\prime} z\\\\right) The total field at any position z is the sum of the incident and radiated fields at that position. Adding the two components inside the medium, we get the total field \\\\mathrm{E}(z)=\\\\mathrm{E}_{T} \\\\exp \\\\left(i k^{\\\\prime} z\\\\right), z>0 This wave travels inside the dielectric at speed c/n, n=c k^{\\\\prime} / \\\\omega=\\\\sqrt{1+i \\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{\\\\epsilon_{0} \\\\omega}} We can simplify the above n to a familiar form of the index of refraction of a linear isotropic dielectric. To do so, we remember that in a linear dielectric an applied electric field \\\\mathbf E induces a polarization \\\\mathbf P proportional to the electric field \\\\mathbf P=\\\\epsilon_{0} \\\\chi_{e} \\\\mathbf{E}. When the electric field changes, the induced charges move and produces a current density given by \\\\partial \\\\mathbf{P} / \\\\partial t. Since the time dependence of the electric field is \\\\exp(-i\\\\omega t), we get \\\\mathbf{J}=-i \\\\epsilon_{0} \\\\omega \\\\chi_{e} \\\\mathbf{E} Which implies that the conductivity \\\\sigma=-i \\\\epsilon_{0} \\\\omega \\\\chi_{e}. Then substituting the conductivity in the equation of n, gives n=\\\\sqrt{1+\\\\chi_{e}} which is a more familiar form. For the region z<0, one imposes the condition of a wave traveling to the left. By setting the conductivity in this region \\\\sigma=0, we obtain the reflected wave \\\\mathrm{E}(z)=\\\\mathrm{E}_{R} \\\\exp \\\\left(-i k z\\\\right), traveling at the speed of light. Note that the coefficients nomenclature, \\\\mathbf E_{T} and \\\\mathbf E_{R}, are only adopted to match what we already expect.  Hertz vector approach  The following is a derivation based on a work by Wangsness and a similar derivation found in chapter 20 of Zangwill's text, Modern Electrodynamics . The setup is as follows, let the infinite half-space z<0 be vacuum and the infinite half-space z>0 be a uniform, isotropic, dielectric material with electric susceptibility, \\\\chi. The inhomogeneous electromagnetic wave equation for the electric field can be written in terms of the electric Hertz Potential, \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}_{\\\\mathrm{e}} , in the Lorenz gauge as abla^{2} \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}_{\\\\mathrm{e}}-\\\\frac{1}{c^{2}} \\\\frac{\\\\partial^{2} \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}_{\\\\mathrm{e}}}{\\\\partial t^{2}}=-\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{P} }{\\\\epsilon_{0}} . The electric field in terms of the Hertz vectors is given as \\\\mathbf{E}= abla \\\\times abla \\\\times \\\\boldsymbol\\\\pi_{\\\\mathrm{e}}-\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{P}}{\\\\epsilon_{0}}- \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} \\\\left( abla \\\\times \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}_{\\\\mathrm{m}} \\\\right), but the magnetic Hertz vector \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}_{\\\\mathrm{m}} is 0 since the material is assumed to be non-magnetizable and there is no external magnetic field. Therefore the electric field simplifies to \\\\mathbf{E}= abla \\\\times abla \\\\times \\\\boldsymbol\\\\pi_{\\\\mathrm{e}}-\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{P}}{\\\\epsilon_{0}} . In order to calculate the electric field we must first solve the inhomogeneous wave equation for \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}_{\\\\mathrm{e}} . To do this, split \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}_{\\\\mathrm{e}} in the homogeneous and particular solutions \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}_{\\\\mathrm{e}}(\\\\mathbf{r}, t)=\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}_{e,h}(\\\\mathbf{r}, t)+\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}_{\\\\mathrm{e,p}}(\\\\mathbf{r}, t) . Linearity then allows us to write \\\\mathbf{E}(\\\\mathbf{r}, t)=\\\\mathbf{E}_{h}(\\\\mathbf{r}, t)+\\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{p}}(\\\\mathbf{r}, t) . The homogeneous solution, \\\\mathbf{E}_{h}(\\\\mathbf{r}, t) , is the initial plane wave traveling with wave vector k_{0}=\\\\omega/c in the positive z direction \\\\mathbf{E}_{h}(\\\\mathbf{r}, t) = \\\\mathbf{E}_{0} e^{i\\\\left(k_{0} z-\\\\omega t\\\\right)} . We do not need to explicitly find \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}_{e,h}(\\\\mathbf{r}, t) since we are only interested in finding the field. The particular solution, \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}_{\\\\mathrm{e,p}}(\\\\mathbf{r}, t) and therefore, \\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{p}}(\\\\mathbf{r}, t) , is found using a time dependent Green's function method on the inhomogeneous wave equation for \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}_{\\\\mathrm{e,p}} which produces the retarded integral \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}_{\\\\mathrm{e,p}}(\\\\mathbf{r}, t)=\\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi \\\\epsilon_{0}} \\\\int d^{3} r^{\\\\prime} \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{P}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}^{\\\\prime}, t-\\\\left\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{r}^{\\\\prime}\\\\right / c\\\\right)}{\\\\left\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{r}^{\\\\prime}\\\\right} . Since the initial electric field is polarizing the material, the polarization vector must have the same space and time dependence \\\\mathbf{P}(\\\\mathbf{r}, t)=\\\\mathbf{P}_{0} e^{i(k z-\\\\omega t)}. More detail about this assumption is discussed by Wangsness. Plugging this into the integral and expressing in terms of Cartesian coordinates produces \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}_{\\\\mathrm{e,p}}(\\\\mathbf{r}, t)=\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{P}_{0} e^{ i(k z-\\\\omega t)}} {4 \\\\pi \\\\epsilon_{0}} \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} d z^{\\\\prime} e^{ i k\\\\left(z^{\\\\prime}-z\\\\right)} \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} d x^{\\\\prime} \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} d y^{\\\\prime} \\\\frac{e^{ i k_{0}\\\\left\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{r}^{\\\\prime}\\\\right}}{\\\\left\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{r}^{\\\\prime}\\\\right}.

Then using the substitution R^{2}=\\\\rho^{2}+\\\\leftz^{\\\\prime}-z\\\\right^{2} \\\\Rightarrow \\\\rho^{2}=R^{2}-\\\\leftz^{\\\\prime}-z\\\\right^{2} \\\\Rightarrow \\\\rho d \\\\rho =RdR and \\\\rho=\\\\sqrt{R^{2}-\\\\leftz^{\\\\prime}-z\\\\right^{2}} so the limits become \\\\rho=0=\\\\sqrt{R^{2}-\\\\leftz^{\\\\prime}-z\\\\right^{2}} \\\\Rightarrow R=\\\\leftz^{\\\\prime}-z\\\\right and \\\\rho = \\\\infty=\\\\sqrt{R^{2}-\\\\leftz^{\\\\prime}-z\\\\right^{2}} \\\\Rightarrow R=\\\\infty. Then introduce a convergence factor e^{-\\\\epsilon R} with \\\\epsilon \\\\in \\\\R into the integrand since it does not change the value of the integral, \\\\begin{align} I &= 2\\\\pi \\\\int_{\\\\leftz^{\\\\prime}-z\\\\right}^{\\\\infty} d R e^{ i k_{0}R} \\\\\\\\\\\\&= 2\\\\pi \\\\lim_{\\\\epsilon \\\\to 0}\\\\int_{\\\\leftz^{\\\\prime}-z\\\\right}^{\\\\infty} d R e^{(i k_{0}-\\\\epsilon)R} \\\\\\\\\\\\&= \\\\left. 2\\\\pi \\\\lim_{\\\\epsilon \\\\to 0} \\\\left[\\\\frac{e^{(i k_{0}-\\\\epsilon)R}}{i k_{0}-\\\\epsilon}\\\\right] \\\\right_{\\\\leftz^{\\\\prime}-z\\\\right}^\\\\infty \\\\\\\\\\\\&= 2\\\\pi \\\\lim_{\\\\epsilon \\\\to 0} \\\\left[\\\\frac{e^{(i k_{0}-\\\\epsilon)\\\\infty}}{i k_{0}-\\\\epsilon}-\\\\frac{e^{(i k_{0}-\\\\epsilon){\\\\leftz^{\\\\prime}-z\\\\right}}}{i k_{0}-\\\\epsilon}\\\\right]. \\\\end{align} Then \\\\epsilon \\\\in \\\\R implies \\\\lim_{\\\\epsilon \\\\to 0} e^{-\\\\epsilon\\\\infty}=0 , hence \\\\lim_{\\\\epsilon \\\\to 0}e^{(i k_{0}-\\\\epsilon)\\\\infty} = \\\\lim_{\\\\epsilon \\\\to 0}e^{i k_{0}\\\\infty} e^{-\\\\epsilon\\\\infty}=0 . Therefore, \\\\begin{align} I &= 2\\\\pi \\\\lim_{\\\\epsilon \\\\to 0} \\\\left[0-\\\\frac{e^{(i k_{0}-\\\\epsilon){\\\\leftz^{\\\\prime}-z\\\\right}}}{i k_{0}-\\\\epsilon}\\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\&= -2\\\\pi \\\\frac{e^{i k_{0}{\\\\leftz^{\\\\prime}-z\\\\right}}}{i k_{0}} \\\\\\\\\\\\&= 2\\\\pi i \\\\frac{e^{i k_{0}{\\\\leftz^{\\\\prime}-z\\\\right}}}{k_{0}}. \\\\end{align} Now, plugging this result back into the z-integral yields \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}_{\\\\mathrm{e,p}}(z, t)= \\\\frac{i\\\\mathbf{P}_{0} e^{ i(k z-\\\\omega t)} }{2 k_{0}\\\\epsilon_{0}} \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} d z^{\\\\prime} e^{ i k\\\\left(z^{\\\\prime}-z\\\\right) } e^{ i k_{0}\\\\leftz-z^{\\\\prime}\\\\right} Notice that \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}_{\\\\mathrm{e,p}} is now only a function of z and not \\\\mathbf{r} , which was expected for the given symmetry. This integration must be split into two due to the absolute value \\\\leftz-z^{\\\\prime}\\\\right inside the integrand. The regions are z<0 and z>0. Again, a convergence factor must be introduced to evaluate both integrals and the result is \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}_{\\\\mathrm{e,p}}(z, t)=-\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{P}e^{ -i \\\\omega t}} {2 \\\\epsilon_{0} k_{0}} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{array}{l} {{\\\\frac{1}{k+k_{0}} e^{ -i k_{0} z}}} & {z<0} \\\\\\\\\\\\ {\\\\frac{2 k_{0}}{k_{0}^{2}-k^{2}} e^{ i k z} \\\\+ \\\\frac{1}{k-k_{0}} e^{ i k_{0} z}} & {z>0.} \\\\end{array}\\\\right. Instead of plugging \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}_{\\\\mathrm{e,p}} directly into the expression for the electric field, several simplifications can be made. Begin with the curl of the curl vector identity, abla \\\\times( abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}_{\\\\mathrm{e,p}}})= abla( abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}_{\\\\mathrm{e,p}}})- abla^{2} \\\\mathbf{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}_{\\\\mathrm{e,p}}} , therefore, \\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{p}} &= abla \\\\times abla \\\\times \\\\boldsymbol\\\\pi_{\\\\mathrm{e}}-\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{P}}{\\\\epsilon_{0}} \\\\\\\\\\\\&= abla( abla \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}_{\\\\mathrm{e,p}})- abla^{2} \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}_{\\\\mathrm{e,p}}-\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{P}}{\\\\epsilon_{0}}. \\\\end{align} Notice that abla \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}_{\\\\mathrm{e,p}}=0 because \\\\mathbf{P} has no {\\\\mathbf{z}} dependence and is always perpendicular to \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{z}}. Also, notice that the second and third terms are equivalent to the inhomogeneous wave equation, therefore, \\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{E}_{\\\\mathrm{p}} &= -\\\\frac{1}{c^{2}} \\\\frac{\\\\partial^{2} \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}_{\\\\mathrm{e,p}}}{\\\\partial t^{2}} \\\\\\\\\\\\&= -\\\\frac{1}{c^{2}} (-i\\\\omega)^2 \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}_{\\\\mathrm{e,p}} \\\\\\\\\\\\&= k_{0}^2 \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}_{\\\\mathrm{e,p}} \\\\end{align} Therefore, the total field is \\\\mathbf{E}(z, t)=\\\\mathbf{E}_{0} e^{i\\\\left(k_{0} z-\\\\omega t\\\\right)} +k_{0}^{2} \\\\boldsymbol\\\\pi_{\\\\mathrm{e,p}}(z, t) which becomes, \\\\mathbf{E}(z, t) = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{array}{l} {\\\\mathbf{E}_{0} e^{i\\\\left(k_{0} z-\\\\omega t\\\\right)}-\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{P}}{2 \\\\epsilon_{0}} \\\\frac{k_{0}}{k+k_{0}} e^{-i\\\\left(k_{0} z+\\\\omega t\\\\right)}} & {z<0} \\\\\\\\\\\\ {\\\\mathbf{E}_{0} e^{i\\\\left(k_{0} z-\\\\omega t\\\\right)}-\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{P}}{2 \\\\epsilon_{0}} \\\\frac{k_{0}}{k-k_{0}} e^{i\\\\left(k_{0} z-\\\\omega t\\\\right)}-\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{P}}{\\\\epsilon_{0}} \\\\frac{k_{0}^{2}}{k_{0}^{2}-k^{2}} e^{i(k z-\\\\omega t)}} & {z>0.}\\\\end{array}\\\\right. Now focus on the field inside the dielectric. Using the fact that \\\\mathbf{E}(z, t) is complex, we may immediately write \\\\mathbf{E}(z>0, t)=\\\\mathbf{E} e^{i\\\\left(k_{0} z-\\\\omega t\\\\right)} recall also that inside the dielectric we have \\\\mathbf{P}=\\\\epsilon_{0} \\\\chi \\\\mathbf{E}. Then by coefficient matching we find, e^{i\\\\left(k z-\\\\omega t\\\\right)} \\\\Rightarrow 1=-\\\\chi \\\\frac{k_{0}^{2}}{k_{0}^{2}-k^{2}} and e^{i\\\\left(k_{0} z-\\\\omega t\\\\right)} \\\\Rightarrow 0=\\\\mathbf{E}_{0}-\\\\frac{\\\\chi}{2} \\\\frac{k_{0}}{k-k_{0}} \\\\mathbf{E} . The first relation quickly yields the wave vector in the dielectric in terms of the incident wave as \\\\begin{align} k &=\\\\sqrt{1+\\\\chi} k_{0} \\\\\\\\\\\\&=n k_{0}. \\\\end{align} Using this result and the definition of \\\\mathbf{P} in the second expression yields the polarization vector in terms of the incident electric field as \\\\mathbf{P} = 2 \\\\epsilon_{0}(n-1) \\\\mathbf{E}_{0}. Both of these results can be substituted into the expression for the electric field to obtain the final expression \\\\mathbf{E}(z, t) = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{array}{l} {\\\\mathbf{E}_{0} e^{i\\\\left(k_{0} z-\\\\omega t\\\\right)} -\\\\left(\\\\frac{n-1}{n+1}\\\\right) \\\\mathbf{E}_{0} e^{-i\\\\left(k_{0} z+\\\\omega t\\\\right)}} & {z<0} \\\\\\\\\\\\ {\\\\left(\\\\frac{2}{n+1}\\\\right) \\\\mathbf{E}_{0} e^{i\\\\left(n k_{0} z-\\\\omega t\\\\right)}} & {z>0.}\\\\end{array}\\\\right. This is exactly the result as expected. There is only one wave inside the medium and it has wave speed reduced by n. The expected reflection and transmission coefficients are also recovered.  Extinction lengths and tests of special relativity  The characteristic \\"extinction length\\" of a medium is the distance after which the original wave can be said to have been completely replaced. For visible light, traveling in air at sea level, this distance is approximately 1 mm. In interstellar space, the extinction length for light is 2 light years At very high frequencies, the electrons in the medium can't \\"follow\\" the original wave into oscillation, which lets that wave travel much further: for 0.5 MeV gamma rays, the length is 19 cm of air and 0.3 mm of Lucite, and for 4.4 GeV, 1.7 m in air, and 1.4 mm in carbon. Special relativity predicts that the speed of light in vacuum is independent of the velocity of the source emitting it. This widely believed prediction has been occasionally tested using astronomical observations. For example, in a binary star system, the two stars are moving in opposite directions, and one might test the prediction by analyzing their light. (See, for instance, the De Sitter double star experiment.) Unfortunately, the extinction length of light in space nullifies the results of any such experiments using visible light, especially when taking account of the thick cloud of stationary gas surrounding such stars. However, experiments using X-rays emitted by binary pulsars, with much longer extinction length, have been successful.

Club career Nimeley initially started his career with SV Muttenz but quickly moved on to FC Basel as an academy player. At Basel he was able to rise through the youth ranks and broke into their reserve team towards the end of the 2009-10 season. He made his debut for Basel II on 21 April 2010 in a 4-1 home win against SV H√∂ngg, coming on as a late substitute. He scored his first goal for the club on 12 March 2011 in a match against Grasshopper Club Z√ºrich II that ended in a 1-1 draw. After not being able to break into the Basel first-team, Nimeley transferred to FC Locarno of the Swiss Challenge League in July 2013. He made his debut for Locarno on 14 July 2014 in a 1-0 home win against FC Biel-Bienne.

Academic career Holmes was born in Sheffield, England and educated at Woodhouse Grammar School and Pembroke College, Oxford, graduating with a BA in 1948. He served in the British Army in India before returning to Oxford in 1950 as a research assistant to David Ogg. In 1952 he graduated with a B.Litt.J. V. Beckett, ‚ÄòObituary: Professor Geoffrey Holmes‚Äô, The Independent (27 November 1993), retrieved 13 January 2020. From 1952 until 1969 he was successively assistant lecturer, lecturer and senior lecturer at Glasgow University's history department. From 1969 until his retirement in 1985 he taught history at Lancaster University, first as reader (1969‚Äì72) and then as professor (1973‚Äì83). During 1977-1978 he was a visiting fellow at All Souls, Oxford and was awarded the degree of D.Litt. by the University of Oxford in 1978. He was elected to a Fellowship of the British Academy in 1983 and was a vice- president of the Royal Historical Society (1985-1989). British Politics in the Age of Anne Holmes' book on British politics during the reign of Queen Anne (1702-1714) transformed historians' understanding of the period. Whereas G. M. Trevelyan and Sir Keith Feiling had described the politics of Anne's reign as dominated by two parties (Whigs and Tories), Robert Walcott subjected the period to a Namierite analysis and concluded that the period was dominated by various factions based on sectional interests.G. V. Bennett, ‚ÄòReview: British Politics in the Age of Anne‚Äô, The English Historical Review Vol. 84, No. 331 (Apr., 1969), pp. 358-359.Robert Walcott, 'English Party Politics, 1688-1714' in Essays in Modern English History in Honor of W. C. Abbott (Harvard, 1941) and Robert Walcott, English Politics in the Early Eighteenth Century (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1956). Walcott's thesis was much criticised and Holmes' book provided a new, more convincing interpretation. Holmes used more than fifty manuscript sources that had been unavailable before 1945. Holmes' argued that the Whig/Tory division that was present during William III's reign crystallised into a more rigid two-party polarisation after 1702. His analysis of the division-lists for the House of Commons refuted Walcott's assertion that MPs were loosely attached to party: of 1,064 MPs all except 130 voted on consistent, partisan Whig/Tory lines. MPs struggled over political principles as well as for places, with the Queen's desire for coalition government largely frustrated except when the strength of the two parties was evenly balanced. Only then could the Court function as a third force. The end of her reign witnessed the grudging acceptance of a two- party system.Henry Horwitz, ‚ÄòReview: British Politics in the Age of Anne‚Äô, The Journal of Modern History, Vol. 41, No. 1 (Mar., 1969), p. 92‚Äì3. Henry Horwitz claimed that Holmes replaced Walcott's work with \\"a bold yet subtle analysis that puts Augustan politics in truer perspective than ever before\\". J. P. Kenyon said the book was the \\"crowning achievement of this new school (of late 17th- and early 18th-century historians), and the only work of political history of this century which can stand alongside Namier's Structure of Politics\\".Geoffrey Holmes, British Politics in the Age of Anne (London: Hambledon, 1987), back cover. Austin Woolrych said of British Politics in the Age of Anne: > No work of history in our time has won its author a more instant reputation, > or more decisively influenced the interpretation of the subject it treats. > ... [I]t fairly earned its acclamation as a work of art. ... [I]t is alive > with deft character-sketches, sharp detail and apt quotations. Even if it > had not effected a major historical revision, as it did, it would deserve to > be read as literature. ...
