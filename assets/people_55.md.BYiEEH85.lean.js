It is also the name of the philosophy and life-style propounded by Sarkar, described as a practical philosophy for personal development and the all-around transformation of the society. It is established in more than 180 countries across the world.  History  Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar founded the √Ånanda M√°rga Prac√°raka Sa·∏øgha (more commonly known as \\"Ananda Marga\\" or, less frequently, \\"Ananda Marg\\" or \\"Anand Marg\\") on 5 January 1955. The literal translation into English is \\"the Organization to Propagate the Path of Bliss.\\" The stated aims of the organization are \\"liberation of self and service to humanity\\". In March of the same year, the first group of acharyas was created in Jamalpur. = Sarkar's incarceration = During the 1960s, the organisation expanded rapidly in India, sending Acharyas as missionaries to other continents. Ananda Marga's popularity in India put it in direct confrontation with the Communist Party in West Bengal. In 1967, Ananda Marga headquarters came under attack by locals who were allegedly incited by Communist leaders. Criticism of corruption in the Indian government by acharyas of Ananda Marga also put it in confrontation with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. In 1971, Sarkar was imprisoned in India for the alleged murder of Ananda Marga members. In February 1973, Sarkar was poisoned in prison, allegedly by the jail doctor on orders from the higher echelons of government. On 1 April, after recovering his health, Sarkar began fasting in support of a demand for an inquest into his poisoning. That demand was never met. So he continued his fast for the next five years, four months, and two days, until 2 August 1978 when he was released from jail after having been acquitted of all charges. =Sydney Hilton bombing= The Sydney Hilton Hotel bombing occurred on 13 February 1978, when a bomb exploded outside the Hilton Hotel in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. At the time the hotel was the site of the first Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting (CHOGRM), a regional offshoot of the biennial meetings of the heads of government from across the Commonwealth of Nations. In June 1978, members of the Ananda Marga organisation were implicated by a police informant, Richard John Seary, but his evidence has been discredited. A member of Ananda Marga, Evan Pederick, claimed in 1989 that he had carried out the Hilton bombing on the orders of another member, Tim Anderson. Both men were given prison sentences, but Anderson was acquitted on appeal in 1991.John Tognolini, 1991, Green Left Weekly, Pederick appealed but his appeal failed and he served eight years in prison. = Bijon Setu massacre = On the morning of 30 April 1982, 17 Ananda Marga renunciates (16 monks and one nun) were dragged out of taxis that were taking them to an educational conference at their headquarters in Tiljala, Kolkata. They were beaten to death and then set on fire simultaneously at three different locations. It was reported that the killings took place in broad daylight and were witnessed by thousands of people, as they were performed in public. = Mahaprayan of Sarkar = P.R. Sarkar died on 21 October 1990. Acarya Shraddhananda Avadhuta was elected from the body of purodhas as President of Ananda Marga Pracharaka Samgha global organization and Purodha Pramukha.He served in that capacity until his death in 2008. = Violence towards Ananda Marga Monks = On 18 September 2003, Acarya Abhipremananda Avadhuta was killed and many others were permanently injured in a fight between two Ananda Marga groups. Control of the head office of Ananda Marga was believed to be the main motive. The two groups, one from the prominent Bengal province and the other from the rest of India, had been in rivalry. In 1975, two followers of Ananda Marga, Santosh Anand Avdhoot and Sudevanand Avdhoot, were convicted of a failed attempt to attack Chief Justice of India A. N. Ray; they were sentenced to seven years in jail. L.N. Mishra, then railway minister of India, was attacked by Ananad Marga monks and followers in 1975. The bombing killed Mishra. Santoshanand and Sudevanand were convicted of the crime. The Purulia arms drop happened on 17 December 1995 when unauthorised arms were dropped from an Antonov An-26 aircraft in Purulia district in the state of West Bengal in India. While the true motive is shrouded in mystery and conjecture, the BBC, after its investigation into it, alleged that arms were intended for the socio-spiritual organization Ananda Marga. This has been disputed by the prime accused in the case, Kim Davy, who claims the central government itself was behind the arms drop to disrupt harmony and exterminate the CPI(M) supporters.

[null Read more] Tantra yoga, as interpreted by Shrii Shrii Anandamurti, is the practical philosophy which serves as foundation of Ananda Marga. According to P.R. Sarkar's teachings Tantra means liberation from darkness, the root tan meaning darkness, and tra liberation. Meditation is the main spiritual practice of this tantric tradition, and through it the practitioner struggles to overcome weaknesses and imperfections. The basis of Ananda Marga practice is covered by a set of rules called the 'Sixteen Points' that guide the practitioner on both spiritual and social aspects. Anandamurti expounded these principles in ' a text composed in Sanskrit in 1961. = Meditation, Lalita Marmika dance and Kirtan = Meditation's posture. In the tantric tradition of Ananda Marga the spiritual aspirant (sadhaka) practices sadhana. Sadhana (a Sanskrit word) signifies the effort through which a person becomes completely realized. In Tantra the spiritual master, the guru,Who is the guru? In Ananda Sutram, on sutra 3‚Äì9, P. R. Sarkar as Shri Shri Anandamurti clearly stated Brahmaeva gururekah n√°parah: Only Brahma is the guru, no one else. Who is Brahma is explained in the first sutra (1‚Äì1): Shivashakty√°tmakam Brahma: Brahma is the composite of Shiva and Shakti plays a special role. The guru guides and leads students on the spiritual path. The aspirant learns meditation by a qualified acarya. An acarya is most commonly a monk or nun, but in the Ananda Marga tradition there are also \\"family acaryas\\". In the initiation the aspirant makes a commitment to practice meditation and to live in harmony with the universal balance, and is then taught the technique itself. The aspirant is then required to keep the individual lessons personal. In addition, he also taught Kapalika meditation to many sany√°sins. His system of yoga can be termed as R√°jadhir√°ja Yoga, Tantra Yoga, or simply √Ånanda M√°rga Yoga. The basic √Ånanda M√°rga meditation system is called Sahaja Yoga ('simple yoga'). The sahaja system consists of 6 meditation techniques or lessons taught one by one, on a personal basis.This is the short list of six lessons: 1)First Lesson: Iishvara Pranidhana (Personal mantra and Ishta Cakra), 2)Second Lesson: Guru Mantra (Personal Guru Mantra), 3)Third Lesson: Tattva Dharana (Concentration on Cakras' Tattvas), 4)Fourth Lesson: Sadharana Pranayama (Basic Pranayama. A special respiration technique), 5)Fifth Lesson: Cakra Shodhana (Purification of Cakras. A special type of Dharana), 6)Sixth Lesson: Guru Dhyana (Special type of ideation for Dhyana). There is also a set of higher meditation lessons taught to advanced practitioners committed to dedicate more time for spiritual practices and universal service. According to the Ananda Marga system the Lalita Marmika dance is performed, particularly during the collective meditation.According with the teachings of P.R. Sarkar, Lalita Marmika is a devotional dance invented by Parvati, the wife of Shiva. This yogic dance with swaying movements, combined with a kirtan (the chanting of the universal mantra), is regarded as useful in freeing the mind and preparing it for meditation. Ananda Marga system recommends to its members the practice of collective meditation at least once a week. These meetings called Dharma Chakras (weekly held in a place called Dhyan Mandir) are preceded by the singing of few Prabhat Samgiita (\\"Songs of the New Dawn\\" composed by the Ananda Marga founder) followed by the spiritual dance of Lalita Marmika along with the singing of and by the practice of meditation. Before meditation the ' mantra is chanted. At the end of meditation the ' and the ' mantras are recited. Baba Nam Kevalam is a universal kirtan mantra given by Anandamurti widely used in Ananda Marga across the world. = Vegetarian diet, yogic asanas, physical exercises and yogic treatments = Yoga Sarvangasana. Tandava dance. One of the 108 Tandava poses of Nataraja (dancing Shiva). The basic practices of Ananda Marga consist of yoga asanas, mudras, bandhas, pranayama, self-massage and two specific dances, kaos'ikii and tandava. Lacto-vegetarian diet and fasting are also included, as a fundamental part of yogic practice. *Diet and fasting: Lacto- vegetarian diet of Ananda Marga avoids meat, fish, eggs and some substances which are claimed to have a negative effect on the mind, particularly if \\"mucus-producing.\\" Moreover, on specific monthly dates called Ekadashi (Sanskrit: ‡¶è‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶¶‡¶∂‡ßÄ, ekƒÅda≈õƒ´: is the eleventh day after the full moon or after the new moon),Ananda Marga acharyas practice fasting in two additional days per month called Purnima and Amavasya the regular practice of Upavasa (yoga fasting) is recommended to improve health and strengthen the mind. * Yoga asanas, mudras and bandhas: comprises 42 asanasThe following are the Ananda Marga asanasas listed from P.R. Sarkar in \\"Ananda Marga Caryacarya part 3\\": Sarvanungasana, Matsyamudra, Matsyasana, Matsyendrasana, Virasana, Cakrasana, Naokasana (or Dhanurasana), Utkata Pascimottanasana, Parvatasana (or Halasana), Shivasana, Vajrasana, Siddhasana, Baddha Padmasana, Kukkutasana, Gomukhasana, Mayurasana, Kurmakasana, Sahaja Utkatasana, Shalabhasana, Bhujaungasana, Shashaungasana, Bhastrikasana, Janusirsasana, Ardhashivasana, Ardhakurmakasana (or Dirgha Pranama), Yogasana (or Yogamudra), Tuladandasana, Ustrasana, Utkata Kurmakasana, Jatila Utkatasana, Utkata Vajrasana, Padahastasana, Shivasana, Padmasana, Karmasana, Jinanasana, Bhavasana, Granthimuktasana, Garudasana, Dvisamakonasana, Tejasana, Mandukasana. which were chosen by Sarkar. There are mainly two types of asana: svasthyasanas and dhyanasanas.Shrii Shrii Anandamurti, 2010, p.20. They should be performed at least once a day. 15 Yoga mudras and bandhas are also part of the basic Ananda Marga yoga.Mudras and bandhas are also listed in \\"Ananda Marga Caryacarya part 3\\": Uddayana Mudra, Bandhatraya Yoga (Mahamudra, Mahabandha, Mahaveda), Parthivii Mudra, Ambhasii Mudra, Agneyii Mudra, Vayavii Mudra, Akashii Mudra, Manasii Mudra, Agnisara Mudra, Kakacaincu Mudra, Trimunda Mudra, Ashvinii Mudra, Vajrolii Mudra. *Yogic treatments: in 1957 Sarkar published in Bengali Yaogika Cikitsa o Dravyaguna, which was translated into English and published in 1983, with revisions under the title Yogic Treatments and Natural Remedies. In this handbook, he gave indications on yogic treatments using √°sanas and mudr√°s combined with claims about natural and traditional remedies for about forty diseases. The book also contains many tips for maintaining good health through the use of water, clay, etc.In the preface the author specifically warns the reader not to risk of practising √°sanas and mudr√°s without the guidance of an experienced yoga teacher. * Kaoshikii: the 'dance for mental expansion', was defined by Sarkar a 'physico-psycho-spiritual dance,' performed by all, and consists of 18 mudras aligning with 6 physical postures, each associated with a specific ideaThe spiritual ideation is carried along with the dance in order to establish a subtle link with the divine. while strengthening body and mind and making them flexible. * Tandava or TƒÅ·πá·∏çava: is a vigorous dance.Associated with Shiva in his cosmic dancer image of Nataraja. The name tandava is derived from the Sanskrit word tandu, which means 'to jump'. This dance is only performed by male followers in Ananda Marga. The dance is performed to imbue the practitioner's mind with courage and honour, dispelling all sorts of complexes and fear, even fear of death itself.Thus the dance also has an associated ideation. The dancer starts off with the two arms outstretched, the left arm with an open palm, and the right arm with a clenched fist. The dancer ideates holding a human skull in the left hand, symbolizing death, and ideates on holding a knife in the right, symbolizing the fight for life. The actual objects (human skull and knife) may be also used. The dance starts with a jump, landing with bent knees. Another jump follows, and the dance continues in a jumping manner, lifting one leg then the other continuously. Tribuneindia.com story  Spiritual and Social Philosophy  The philosophy of Ananda Marga is a synthetic outlook, recognizing a theistic singularity or 'Supreme Consciousness',See: Shrii Shrii √Ånandam√∫rti, 1954, pp. 15 and 68. which is claimed to be both transcendental and manifested in all.This universe, having been created by the 'Supreme Consciousness', is existing in the 'Supreme Entity': \\"The 'Supreme Entity' is the vastest entity; the ultimate source of all cosmic emanations. The 'Supreme Entity', which is difficult to conceive, is the subtlest of the subtle. He is farther away than any other entity, but again He is nearer than the nearest. Only the one who looks into the innermost recesses of himself can realize the 'Supreme Entity'.\\" (Shrii Shrii Anandamurti) It covers both the spiritual and the social combining the two in a unique synthesis of universal vision.In his famous discourse \\"Sambh√∫ti and Mah√°sambh√∫ti\\" given in July 1967, Delhi, India during the DMC (Dharma Maha Chakra) P.R. Sarkar well explained this concept: \\"In short, whatever was created in the past is the original creation (sambh√∫ti) of God. The sum total of all creations is the Cosmic Order (Brahm√°≈ÑdÃÅa). This includes the sun as well as the small ant which crawls on the earth. Whether it is a dead star or a living star, whether it is a nebula or a Milky Way or a galaxy ‚Äì all belong to one universal family.\\" To this end Ananda Marga suggests a practical, rational, and systematic way of life for the balanced development of all human potentialities: physical, psychic and spiritual. This system incorporate practices that range from hygiene and diet, yoga postures, to a scientific technique of meditation based on moral rules and directed to the inner fulfillment. It recognizes that a balance is needed between the spiritual and mundane aspects of existence, and that neither one should be neglected at the expense of the other. Hence, the goal of Ananda Marga is \\"self-realization and the welfare of all\\". = Spiritual philosophy = Lalita Marmika dance. Photo (Italy July 1978) of an international group of Ananda Marga followers singing a Kirtan on the occasion of Shrii Shrii Anandamurti's liberation Kaoshiki dance. The spiritual philosophy of Ananda Marga covers a vast range of topics and can be learned from P.R. Sarkar's publications. Ananda Marga philosophy recognizes that the universe is the creation of the mental thought waves of the 'Supreme consciousness'. The following is a brief list of the essential elements of Ananda Marga Spiritual Philosophy: * Atma or Soul and Paramatma or the Cosmic Consciousness: the Consciousness (Purusa) is reflected in the unit objects forming the \\"unit consciousness\\" (atma) or soul. Particularly the reflection of the soul on the mind is called jiivatma and in that case the \\"reflector-soul\\" is called Paramatma (Supreme Soul).Vis‚Äôaya purus‚Äôa'vabha‚Äôshah jiiva‚Äôtma‚Äô: \\"The reflection of Consciousness ‚Äì Purusa ‚Äì in the unit object is known as jiiva‚Äôtma ‚Äì \\"unit soul\\" ‚Äì (A‚Äônanda Sutram, Chapter 2, Sutra 8 (2‚Äì8) in Avadh≈´tika ƒÄnanda Mitra ƒÄcƒÅryƒÅ, 1981). * Realms of the Mind: according to Ananda Marga philosophy the human mind is composed of five layers called Kosas:The last three deeper layers are collectively called \\"Causal Mind\\". \\"Causal\\" signifies that these layers are in the most direct contact with the \\"Causal Consciousness\\" from which the mind has evolved and within which it exists. 1)Kamamaya Kosa (\\"desire layer\\") or \\"Crude Mind\\": is the crudest layer, purified through adherence to the yogic code of morality, Yama- Niyama.This Kosa controls the various autonomic activities of the body and the expression of the mental propensities, known as vrtti, in Samskrta. 2)Manomaya Kosa (\\"layer of thinking\\") or \\"Subtle Mind\\": is the layer of thought and memory.This Kosa gives experience of pleasure and pain. It is developed naturally through physical clash, and in Ananda Marga sadhana by pranayama with cosmic ideation. 3)Atimanasa Kosa or \\"Supramental Mind\\": is the intuitive layer.This Kosa gives the capacity of intuitive dreams, clairvoyance, telepathy and creative insight. It is developed naturally through psychic clash, and in Ananda Marga sadhana by methods of pratyahara (withdrawal) such as shuddhis and Guru Puja. 4)Vijinanamaya Kosa (\\"layer of the special knowledge\\") or \\"Subliminal Mind\\": is the layer of conscience or discrimination (viveka) and vaeragya (non-attachment).This Kosa is developed naturally through psychic clash, and its development is accelerated by the process of dharana. 5)Hiranyamaya Kosa (\\"golden level\\") or \\"Subtle Causal Mind\\": is the subtlest layer. Here the awareness of mind is very close to the direct experience of \\"Supreme Consciousness\\".Here there is only the separation of a thin veil of ignorance. This Kosa is developed naturally through the attraction for the Great, and dhyana accelerates this process for sadhakas (spirituals aspirants). * Microvita theory: Microvita is plural for Micro- vitum and literally means \\"micro-life\\". The concept was first introduced in 1986 through a series of lectures by P.R. Sarkar. According to this notion, microvita are entities which come within the realms both of physicality of psychic expression. They are smaller and subtler than physical atoms and subatomic particles. So far as physicality is concerned, the position of these microvita is just between ectoplasm and electron, but they are neither ectoplasm nor electron. The author predicted that they would be recognized by conventional science when it is developed much further. = Social philosophy = The social outlook of Ananda Marga recognizes that the welfare of the individual is linked with the welfare of the collective, each relying on the other for its existence and dynamism. According to this philosophy everyone has the right to equal opportunities of life and development and as such there should be no discrimination on the basis of superficial barriers such as race, nationality and religion. Ananda Marga advocates a world of justice, security and peace for all.Ananda Marga Social Philosophy The Social Philosophy of Ananda Marga can be categorized under the topics: * Neohumanism: in 1982, Sarkar extended his writings on the subject of human society with the introduction of his new theory of \\"Neohumanism\\".See: Sarkar, P. R., 1982. While humanism extends the recognition of equal rights to all humans, yet tends to anthropocentric worldview, neohumanism, according to Sarkar's theory, is instead the elevation of humanism to universalism, thus expanding an inclusive spirit of welfare to all living beings and the created world.\\"When the underlying spirit of humanism is extended to everything, animate and inanimate, in this universe ‚Äì I have designated this as \\"Neohumanism\\". This Neohumanism will elevate humanism to universalism, the cult of love for all created beings of this universe.\\" (Sarkar, P. R., 1982). * Education: according to the Ananda Marga system \\"Education is for Liberation.\\" Education means the simultaneous development in the physical, mental and spiritual realms of human existence. By this, dormant human potentialities will be awakened and put to proper use. Sarkar said that real education leads to a pervasive sense of love and compassion for all creation; in the Ananda Marga's education system, special emphasis is given to moral education and the inculcation of idealism together with a \\"psycho-pedagogical approach\\" and a blending of occidental extroversional science and oriental introversional philosophy.\\"The noblest form of social service is to educate the public and create a sense of consciousness in them. This sense of consciousness is to be instilled in every human being. This is your duty. The goal of education is to elevate the all-round standard, and especially the intellectual standard. In addition, the elevation of the moral standard is extremely necessary in the sphere of education. This moral standard is deficient today. It is lacking in the present educational system also. You are to create a new social order. Therefore, you should first acquire more and more knowledge in different spheres of life and also you are to upgrade your morality. Along with your intellectual standard, if you have morality, then everybody will respect you. Try to acquire as much knowledge as possible through our own books. Education which leads to the acquisition of knowledge plus morality makes for a peaceful society.\\" (Sarkar, P. R., Discourses on Neo‚Äì humanist Education.). * Culture: In his discourse \\"Talks on Prout\\", given in Ranchi in July 1961, Sarkar makes a distinction between the terms \\"culture\\" and \\"customs\\". According to Sarkar \\"culture... is the collective name for different expressions of life...\\" but \\"...all of society has the same culture. There are local variations in the mode or state of cultural expression, but the expression is universal... These local variations are called customs... Thus local modes of expression bearing local or group specialities are customs, but the expression itself is culture. Therefore it is a mistake to readjust boundaries on the basis of language and culture. Indian culture and the culture of the world are one and the same.\\" The philosophy of Sarkar reinterprets the general concept of culture by inserting it into a new universalistic outlook. As described by Antonello Maggipinto: * PROUT (\\"Progressive Utilization Theory\\"): is a socio-economic theory first mentioned in 1959 by P. R. Sarkar in his speech \\"The Cosmic Brotherood\\".Later published in Sarkar, P. R. (1961-2001) p. 89-97. In 1968, Sarkar founded the organization \\"Proutist Block of India\\" (PBI), to further the ideals of his theory through political and social action. = Tantra in Ananda Marga = Sarkar weaves continuity with the ancient philosophy of Tantra, infusing new insights in human psychology, social theory and in each individuals' roles as spiritual and \\"socio-economic-cultural-political\\" beings. √Ånanda M√°rga Tantra has a broad metaphysical base which allows for ways of knowing, feeling and processing which go far beyond intellectuality or limited rationality. Priorities are given to the spiritual development, as Shrii Shrii √Ånandam√∫rti notes, \\"spiritual life controls all other arenas of human life.\\"Bussey, Marcus. Homo Tantricus: Tantra as an Episteme for Future GenerationsAnanda Marga Tantra is a principle, a science which if practiced will lead to the desired objective. The essence of Tantra is to awaken the latent spiritual force in the human personality and unify oneself with the Cosmic Consciousness.\\"It is not a religion or empty philosophy which can be confined to the realms of abstract speculation or theoretical debate. Tantra is a process of subjective transformation, which may be practiced by anyone irrespective of gender, cultural background, education, social status or intellectual evolution, as an adequate system of spiritual endeavor is the birthright of all. Tantra does not discriminate by any racial, genealogical, political, national or economic differences amongst human beings, as the later might form the basis for one human group to assert superiority over another. Tantra does, however, give recognition to individual vigor and the development of latent human potentialities, which make some people outstand in their lives. Consequently Tantra puts greater emphasis on human values than on social values\\".(Coyle, G. 1985). = Guru and Disciple = According to tantric tradition a proper preceptor and a proper disciple are both essential for success on the path of Tantra. P.R. Sarkar clearly explainsSee: Shrii Shrii Anandamurti, 1982 and 1994. that, disciples are of three categories: 1) disciples that acquire spiritual knowledge when they are in close contact with the preceptor, but as soon as they are apart from him they forget all his/her teachings, 2) disciples that learn many things from the preceptor with great hardship, but do not take proper care to preserve those instructions. They lose their hard-earned knowledge out of negligence, 3) disciples that carefully preserve deep in their minds and hearts whatever they have learned from their preceptor by wisely putting those teachings into practice. This is the best category of disciples.

Publication history Shadis was conceived and started by Jolly Blackburn as an independent gaming fanzine in 1990. In 1993, Blackburn formed Alderac Entertainment Group (AEG) to publish Shadis as a quality small-press magazine, and brought on John Zinser and David Seay as partners. A year later, in late 1994, the magazine received its biggest success by including a random Magic: The Gathering card in each issue at a time when booster packs of the new card game were scarce; many players bought multiple copies of each issue hoping to find a rare or out-of-print card. Many readers were also drawn to a small comic strip, Knights of the Dinner Table, which was initially intended to fill a blank spot in the magazine, but later took on a life of its own. In 1995, Blackburn left AEG because he felt that Zinser and Seay were too focussed on the new collectible card game (CCG) industry while he wanted to keep the company fun and small and focus on Knights of the Dinner Table. Blackburn departed with the rights to Knights of the Dinner Table and a few other properties. In a 2000 interview on the Gaming Outpost web site, Zinser explained that he had wanted the in-debt company to grow at a faster pace than Blackburn was comfortable with, hence Blackburn's departure. In 1998, Shadis went \\"on hiatus\\" and publication ceased. In drawing lessons from this magazine's demise, Wolfgang Baur, the editor-in-chief of Kobold Quarterly, thought it was a mistake for Shadis to rely too heavily on content that was not focused on fantasy in general and Dungeons & Dragons in particular. Contents Each issue contained a variety of articles covering many different aspects of role-playing game systems and genres. The series included game reviews, adventures, fiction, maps, gaming advice, and cartoons. In addition to Knights of the Dinner Table, comic strips Fineous Fingers and Bright Future also proved to be very popular. Reception In the August 1994 edition of Dragon (Issue 208), Lester Smith wrote a favourable review, saying \\"A truly independent publication, it covers a wide range of topics in the gaming hobby, and always entertains.\\" Awards During its five-year existence, Shadis was the winner of the 1994, 1995, and 1996 Origins Awards for Best Professional Gaming Magazine References External links * Index of issues at the Pen & Paper RPG publishing database (broken link) * Category:Defunct magazines published in the United States Category:Magazines established in 1990 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1998 Category:Origins Award winners Category:Role-playing game magazines ","title":"Shadis"},{"id":"852782","text":"Vicia cracca (tufted vetch, cow vetch, bird vetch, blue vetch, boreal vetch), is a species of vetch native to Europe and Asia.

The leaves are 3‚Äì8 cm long, pinnate, with 8‚Äì12 pairs of leaflets, each leaflet 5‚Äì10 mm long. The plant is fast-growing and flowers prolifically, sending out 10 to 40 flowered one-sided racemes cascading pea-flower shaped purple to violet flowers from the leaf axil during its late spring to late summer flowering period. The flowers are mostly visited by bumblebees; when the flowers drop off and tiny bright green seed pods 10‚Äì20 mm long, start to form.Clapham, A.R., Tutin, T.G. and Warburg, E.F. (1968).

Habitat Recorded as very frequent on waste ground as an introduced species occurring casually.Hackney, P. (Ed) 1992. Stewart and Corry's Flora of the North-east of Ireland Third Edition. Institute of Irish Studies. The Queen's University of Belfast. In hedges and waste places. Cultivation and uses With Bombus sylvarum Cow vetch is widely used as a forage crop for cattle, and is beneficial to other plants because, like other leguminous plants, it enriches the soil in which it grows by its nitrogen-fixing properties. Cow vetch is also much appreciated by bees and butterflies as a source of nectar. The plant may also be used to curb erosion. Owners of pet birds such as budgerigars often use cow vetch as a nutritious food; the birds are especially fond of the seeds but may also eat the foliage. Its utility as a cover crop and source of green manure has encouraged the introduction and naturalisation of cow vetch far beyond its native range. In North America the plant is naturalised from southern Canada to upstate South Carolina; it is considered an invasive weed in some areas and its sale may be regulated. Cow vetch can be a potentially detrimental species in areas where it is not native. The vetch may crowd out native plants, especially in areas of disturbed soil where the vetch may dominate before other plants have a chance to take hold. This is especially a concern in prairie and other natural habitat restoration or land reclamation projects in North America.

The river is part of the Cumberland River drainage basin, and flows primarily in Middle Tennessee and southern Kentucky. Via the Cumberland and Ohio rivers, it is part of the Mississippi River watershed. It is not to be confused with the Wolf River of West Tennessee which flows into the Mississippi at Memphis. The source of the Wolf River is located at the confluence of Pogue Creek and Delk Creek in a rugged hollow approximately southeast of the community of Pall Mall. Two miles below its source, the river absorbs Rotten Fork before entering the communities of Wolf River and Pall Mall, both of which are associated with World War I hero Alvin C. York. York's farm and gristmill were both located along the river at Pall Mall, and he and his family are buried in the large cemetery at Wolf River. York's farm is now part of a state historic park. Beyond Pall Mall, the river continues westward across the northeastern Highland Rim into Pickett County, passing just north of Byrdstown and flowing through a rolling area of forest and farmland. It crosses briefly into Clinton County, Kentucky, where its water becomes slack due to the impoundment of Dale Hollow Reservoir on the Obey River.

The label's LV monogram appears on most of its products, ranging from luxury trunks and leather goods to ready-to-wear, shoes, watches, jewelry, accessories, sunglasses and books. Louis Vuitton is one of the world's leading international fashion houses; it sells its products through standalone boutiques, lease departments in high-end department stores, and through the e-commerce section of its website. For six consecutive years (2006‚Äì2012), Louis Vuitton was named the world's most valuable luxury brand. Its 2012 valuation was US$25.9 billion. The 2013 valuation of the brand was US$28.4 billion with revenue of US$9.4 billion.forbes.com Louis Vuitton The company operates in 50 countries with more than 460 stores worldwide.Globe and Mail Louis Vuitton Louis Vuitton's \\"LV\\" logo History =Founding to World War II= The Louis Vuitton label was founded by Vuitton in 1854 on Rue Neuve des Capucines in Paris, France. Louis Vuitton started at $10,567 as a sales price. Louis Vuitton had observed that the HJ Cave Osilite trunk could be easily stacked. In 1858, Vuitton introduced his flat-topped trunks with trianon canvas, making them lightweight and airtight. Before the introduction of Vuitton's trunks, rounded-top trunks were used, generally to promote water runoff, and thus could not be stacked. It was Vuitton's gray Trianon canvas flat trunk that allowed the ability to stack them on top of another with ease for voyages. Many other luggage makers later imitated Vuitton's style and design. The company participated in the 1867 Universal Exhibition in Paris. In 1871, ≈åyama Iwao became the first recorded Japanese customer, ordering a set of luggage while in Paris as a military observer during the Franco-Prussian War. To protect against the duplication of his look, Vuitton changed the Trianon design to a beige and brown stripes design in 1876. By 1885, the company opened its first store in London on Oxford Street. Soon thereafter, due to the continuing imitation of his look, in 1888, Vuitton created the Damier Canvas pattern, which bore a logo that reads \\"marque L. Vuitton d√©pos√©e\\", which translates into \\"L. Vuitton registered trademark\\". In 1892, Louis Vuitton died, and the company's management passed to his son. Ad for Louis Vuitton luggage, 1898 After the death of his father, Georges Vuitton began a campaign to build the company into a worldwide corporation, exhibiting the company's products at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893. In 1896, the company launched the signature Monogram Canvas and made the worldwide patents on it. Its graphic symbols, including quatrefoils and flowers (as well as the LV monogram), were based on the trend of using Japanese Mon designs in the late Victorian era. The patents later proved to be successful in stopping counterfeiting. In this same year, Georges travelled to the United States, where he toured cities such as New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago, selling Vuitton products. In 1901, the Louis Vuitton Company introduced the Steamer Bag, a smaller piece of luggage designed to be kept inside Vuitton luggage trunks. By 1913, the Louis Vuitton Building opened on the Champs-Elysees. It was the largest travel-goods store in the world at the time. Stores also opened in New York, Bombay, Washington, London, Alexandria, and Buenos Aires as World War I began. Afterwards, in 1930, the Keepall bag was introduced. During 1932, LV introduced the No√© bag. This bag was originally made for champagne vintners to transport bottles. Soon thereafter, the Louis Vuitton Speedy bag was introduced (both are still manufactured today). In 1936 Georges Vuitton died, and his son, Gaston-Louis Vuitton, assumed control of the company. =Collaboration= During World War II, Louis Vuitton collaborated with the Nazis during the German occupation of France. The French book Louis Vuitton, A French Saga, authored by French journalist Stephanie Bonvicini and published by Paris-based Editions Fayard tells how members of the Vuitton family actively aided the puppet government led by Marshal Philippe P√©tain and increased their wealth from their business affairs with the Germans. The family set up a factory dedicated to producing artefacts glorifying P√©tain, including more than 2,500 busts. Caroline Babulle, a spokeswoman for the publisher, Fayard, said: \\"They have not contested anything in the book, but they are trying to bury it by pretending it doesn't exist.\\" Responding to the book's release in 2004, a spokesman for LVMH said: \\"This is ancient history. The book covers a period when it was family-run and long before it became part of LVMH. We are diverse, tolerant and all the things a modern company should be.\\" An LVMH spokesman told the satirical magazine Le Canard Encha√Æn√©: \\"We don't deny the facts, but regrettably the author has exaggerated the Vichy episode. We haven't put any pressure on anyone. If the journalists want to censor themselves, then that suits us fine.\\" That publication was the only French periodical to mention the book, LVMH is the country's biggest advertiser in the press. =1945 through 2000= Louis Vuitton store in Nicosia, Cyprus Louis Vuitton store in Lugano, Switzerland. Toronto, Ontario, Canada. During this period, Louis Vuitton began to incorporate leather into most of its products, which ranged from small purses and wallets to larger pieces of luggage. In order to broaden its line, the company revamped its signature Monogram Canvas in 1959 to make it more supple, allowing it to be used for purses, bags, and wallets. It is believed that in the 1920s, counterfeiting returned as a greater issue to continue on into the 21st century. In 1966, the Papillon was launched (a cylindrical bag that is still popular today). By 1977 with annual revenue up to 70 million Francs (US$14.27 million). A year later, the label opened its first stores in Japan: in Tokyo and Osaka. In 1983, the company joined with America's Cup to form the Louis Vuitton Cup, a preliminary competition (known as an eliminatory regatta) for the yacht race. Louis Vuitton later expanded its presence in Asia with the opening of a store in Taipei, Taiwan in 1983 and Seoul, South Korea in 1984. In the following year, 1985, the Epi leather line was introduced. 1987 saw the creation of LVMH. Mo√´t et Chandon and Hennessy, leading manufacturers of champagne and cognac, merged respectively with Louis Vuitton to form the luxury goods conglomerate. Profits for 1988 were reported to have been up by 49% more than in 1987. By 1989, Louis Vuitton came to operate 130 stores worldwide. Entering the 1990s, Yves Carcelle was named president of LV, and in 1992, his brand opened its first Chinese location at the Palace Hotel in Beijing. Further products became introduced such as the Taiga leather line in 1993, and the literature collection of Voyager Avec... in 1994. In 1996, the celebration of the Centennial of the Monogram Canvas was held in seven cities worldwide. In 1997, Louis Vuitton made Marc Jacobs its Artistic Director. In March of the following year, he designed and introduced the company's first \\"pr√™t-√†-porter\\" line of clothing for men and women. Also in this year products introduced included the Monogram Vernis line, the LV scrapbooks, and the Louis Vuitton City Guide. The last events in the 20th century were the release of the mini monogram line in 1999, the opening of the first store in Africa in Marrakech, Morocco, in 2000, and finally, the auction at the International Film Festival in Venice, Italy, where the vanity case \\"amfAR\\" designed by Sharon Stone was sold, with the proceeds going to the Foundation for AIDS Research (also in 2000). =2001 to 2011= The store on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue A Louis Vuitton boutique in the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, in Milan, Italy Fifth Avenue, NYC, 2013 A Louis Vuitton store in Central, Hong Kong Louis Vuitton store in Singapore Las Vegas Louis Vuitton VIP room in Vienna for ordering custom designed goods By 2001, Stephen Sprouse, in collaboration with Marc Jacobs, designed a limited-edition line of Vuitton bags that featured graffiti written over the monogram pattern. The graffiti read Louis Vuitton and, on certain bags, the name of the bag (such as Keepall and Speedy). Certain pieces, which featured the graffiti without the Monogram Canvas background, were only available on Louis Vuitton's V.I.P. customer list. Jacobs also created the charm bracelet, the first-ever piece of jewellery from LV, within the same year. In 2002, the Tambour watch collection was introduced. During this year, the LV building in Tokyo's Ginza district was opened, and the brand collaborated with Bob Wilson for its Christmas windows scenography. In 2003, Takashi Murakami, in collaboration with Marc Jacobs, masterminded the new Monogram Multicolore canvas range of handbags and accessories. This range included the monograms of the standard Monogram Canvas but in 33 different colors on either a white or black background. (The classic canvas features gold monograms on a brown background.) Murakami also created the Cherry Blossom pattern, in which smiling cartoon faces in the middle of pink and yellow flowers were sporadically placed atop the Monogram Canvas. This pattern appeared on a limited number of pieces. The production of this limited-edition run was discontinued in June 2003. Within 2003, the stores in Moscow, Russia and in New Delhi, India were opened, the Utah and Suhali leather lines were released, and the 20th anniversary of the LV Cup was held.

LV was in the first place in the BrandZ‚Äôs top 10 most valuable luxury brands in 2019, with a worth of $47.2 billion. On 15 January 2020, the company acquired the Sewel√¥ diamond, which is the second-largest rough diamond ever found in history, from Lucara Diamond who mined it from their mine in Botswana. Brand The Louis Vuitton brand and the LV monogram are among the world's most valuable brands. According to a Millward Brown 2010 study, Louis Vuitton was then the world's 19th most valuable brand, and was estimated to be worth over US$19 billion. For six consecutive years, Louis Vuitton was number one of the 10 most powerful brands list published by the Millward Brown Optimor's 2011 BrandZ study with value of $24.3 billion. It was more than double the value of the second ranking brand. A Louis Vuitton \\"Sarah Wallet\\" Louis Vuitton is one of the most counterfeited brands in the fashion world due to its image as a status symbol. Ironically, the signature Monogram Canvas was created to prevent counterfeiting. In 2004, Louis Vuitton fakes accounted for 18% of counterfeit accessories seized in the European Union. The company actively seeks to eradicate counterfeiting, and employs a team of lawyers and special investigation agencies to pursue offenders through the courts worldwide. The company allocates approximately half of its communications budget to counteract counterfeiting of its goods. LVMH, Vuitton's parent company, has described \\"Some 60 people at various levels of responsibility working full- time on anti-counterfeiting in collaboration with a wide network of outside investigators and a team of lawyers.\\" The company closely controls the distribution of its products. Until the 1980s, Vuitton products were widely sold in department stores, such as Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue. Today, Vuitton products are primarily available at company-owned Louis Vuitton boutiques, with a small number of exceptions noted in upscale shopping districts or inside luxury department stores. Company boutiques within department stores operate independently, and are operated by company managers and employees. LV has an official online store, through its main website. In 2006, the company filed a lawsuit against Colorado-based Manifest Information Services Ltd. (aka Manifest Hostmaster and Manifest.com), through WIPO, in order to compel Manifest transfer the domain name LV.com to Louis Vuitton; the legal action failed and the domain was subsequently acquired by Liverpool Victoria (LV=), England's largest fraternal insurance company.Louis Vuitton Malletier S.A. v. Manifest Information Services c/o Manifest Hostmaster accessed 24 February 2015. Several high-profile rap music artists have mentioned the company in song lyrics, most notably: Bohemia, Kanye West, Juicy J, and Wiz Khalifa. Products Louis Vuitton products Louis Vuitton shopwindow (2019) Houston, United States Since the 19th century, Louis Vuitton trunks have been made by hand. Contemporary Fashion gives a preview of the creation of the LV trunks: > The craftsmen line up the leather and canvas, tapping in the tiny nails one > by one and securing the five-letter solid pick-proof brass locks with an > individual handmade key, designed to allow the traveler to have only one key > for all of his or her luggage.

Iconic bags of Louis Vuitton include the Speedy bag and Neverfull bags. Each season Louis Vuitton produces rare, limited edition bags that are generally only available by reservation through larger Louis Vuitton stores. Many of the company's products utilize the brown Damier and Monogram Canvas materials, both of which were first used in the late 19th century. All of the company's products exhibit the eponymous LV initials. The company markets its product through its own stores located throughout the world, which allows it to control product quality and pricing. It also allows LV to prevent counterfeit products entering its distribution channels. In addition, the company distributes its products through the company's own website, LouisVuitton.com. Advertising campaigns The Louis Vuitton company cultivates a celebrity following and has featured famous models, musicians and actors, such as Jennifer Lopez, Keith Richards, Madonna, Sean Connery, Matthias Schoenaerts, Angelina Jolie, Gisele B√ºndchen, Mikhail Gorbachev, Oh Sehun, JO1 and David Bowie in its marketing campaigns. The company commonly uses print ads in magazines and billboards in cosmopolitan cities. Louis Vuitton Posters by Razzia were popular in the 1980s. It previously relied on selected press for its advertising campaigns (frequently involving prestigious stars like Steffi Graf, Andre Agassi and Catherine Deneuve) shot by Annie Leibovitz. However, Antoine Arnault, director of the communication department, has recently decided to enter the world of television and cinema: The commercial (90 seconds) is exploring the theme \\"Where will life take you?\\" and is translated into 13 different languages. This is the first Vuitton commercial ad ever and was directed by renowned French ad director Bruno Aveillan. In 2002, president and CEO of LVMH Watches Daniel Lalonde (later, global CEO for LVMH brands Mo√´t and Dom P√©rignon) recruited celebrities, such as Maria Sharapova, Brad Pitt, Tiger Woods, and Uma Thurman, for advertising campaigns photographed by Patrick Demarchelier. Ads featuring Woods reportedly led to a 30% boost in sales, resulting in TAG Heuer being rated as the No. 2 luxury watch brand in America by 2005.Gupte, Pranay \\"Daniel Lalonde Works His Marketing Magic for LVMH\\", The New York Sun, 16 May 2005. Retrieved 29 November 2018. Special collaborations Louis Vuitton has had many collaborations with prominent artists and designers. * Takashi Murakami created special edition collections, such as the Monogramouflage Collection, which debuted in 2008, and a previous collection, released in 2002, which featured some of his artwork. The creations were \\"painted\\" over the traditional monogram canvas, which brought a radical new twist to the timeless design. * Marc Jacobs also commemorated a previous collaboration, designed by Stephen Sprouse. This collection, originally released in 2001, featured bold print that looked like graffiti, over the traditional canvas. The recreation of the collab used the same idea, but gave it a new twist using bold colors, like hot pink, neon green, and orange, that also glow in the dark. This recreated version of the graffiti collection was finally released in 2009 to much fanfare. * Louis Vuitton also collaborated with Kanye West in 2009, designing his own limited run of shoes. * In July 2012, Jacobs teamed up with Yayoi Kusama to create the \\"Infinitely Kusama\\" Collection, which features bold colors of dots over the vernis leather or the monogram canvas. These pieces come in black with white dots, red with white dots, and yellow with black dots. * Louis Vuitton collaborated in their Spring‚ÄìSummer 2016 collection advertising campaign with the highly popular Japanese video game franchise Final Fantasy and their Games Main Heroin called Lighting from Final Fantasy 13. * In 2017 Louis Vuitton collaborated with American streetwear brand Supreme (brand), releasing products in various pop- up stores in major cities around the world. Items feature the Louis Vuitton monogram canvas mixed with the Supreme box-logo design. * Also in 2017, Louis Vuitton collaborated with artist Jeff Koons for two collections in an effort to \\"further [explore] the intersection of fashion and art.\\" * Nicolas Ghesquiere collaborated with Vogue creative director Grace Coddington on a cat-themed \\"Catogram\\" collection in 2018. * In June 2019, the brand collaborated with six contemporary artists Sam Falls, Urs Fischer, Nicholas Hlobo, Alex Israel, Tschabalala Self and Jonas Wood on \\"Artycapucines.\\" Each artist designed their version of the Capucine bag which were sold in numbered, limited quantities. * In July 2019, Louis Vuitton opened a temporary exhibition titled \\"Louis Vuitton X\\" in Los Angeles, showcasing items from its various collaborations over the years. * In October 2019, Louis Vuitton partnered with Riot Games to create digital assets for new skin line named \\"True Damage\\", where you can clearly see the LV logo on Qiyana in League of Legends, along with a specialty trophy case for the 2019 League of Legends World Championship. * In June 2020, the brand collaborated with Japanese designer Nigo x Virgil Abloh capsule collection. * In October 2020, Nicolas Ghesqui√®re reportedly revamped the La Samaritaine department store for the Women‚Äôs Spring-Summer 2021 fashion show by providing a virtual runway with 360-degree views and social-distanced seating for guests. Controversy and disputes =Britney Spears video= On 19 November 2007 Louis Vuitton, in further efforts to prevent counterfeiting, successfully sued Britney Spears for violating anti-counterfeiting laws. A part of the music video for the song \\"Do Somethin'\\" shows fingers tapping on the dashboard of a hot pink Hummer with what looks like Louis Vuitton's \\"Cherry Blossom\\" design bearing the LV logo. Britney Spears herself was not found liable, but a civil court in Paris ordered Sony BMG and MTV Online to stop showing the video. They were also fined ‚Ç¨80,000 to each group. An anonymous spokesperson for LVMH stated that the video constituted an \\"attack\\" on Louis Vuitton's brands and its luxury image. =\\"Simple Living\\"= \\"Simple Living\\" image (left) and Vuitton's Audra bag, created by Takashi Murakami (right) On 13 February 2007, Louis Vuitton sent a cease-and-desist order to Danish art student Nadia Plesner for using an image of a bag that allegedly infringed Louis Vuitton's intellectual property rights. Plesner had created a satirical illustration, \\"Simple Living\\", depicting a malnourished child holding a designer dog and a designer bag, and used it on T-shirts and posters to raise funds for the charity \\"Divest for Darfur\\". On 25 March, the court ruled in favour of LV that the image was a clear infringement of copyright. Despite the ruling, Plesner continued to use the image, arguing artistic freedom, and posted copies of the cease-and-desist order on her website. On 15 April 2008, Louis Vuitton notified Plesner of the lawsuit being brought against her. Louis Vuitton demanded $7,500 (‚Ç¨5,000) for each day Plesner continues to sell the \\"Simple Living\\" products, $7,500 for each day the original cease-and-desist letter is published on her website and $7,500 a day for using the name \\"Louis Vuitton\\" on her website, plus legal and enforcement costs. An LVMH spokeswoman interviewed by New York Magazine said that Louis Vuitton were forced to take legal action when Plesner did not respond to their original request to remove the contested image, nor to the subsequent cease-and-desist order. In October 2008, Louis Vuitton declared that the company had dropped its lawsuit but have since reopened it along with a new ‚Ç¨205,000 claim due to a painting by the same artist. In May 2011, the court in The Hague found in favour of Plesner's right to freedom of expression. =Checker-pattern chair in Hong Kong barber shop= In February 2013, Louis Vuitton issued a complaint against the owner of a barber shop in Hong Kong for allegedly violating its intellectual property rights in relation to a stool using fabric coating that is similar to the checker pattern in Louis Vuitton's handbags. According to the Hong Kong-based Apple Daily newspaper, the company was seeking a compensation of HK$25,000 (around US$3,200) and the publication of an apology in the form of newspaper advertisement. The owner had sourced basic furniture and equipment from the PRC for starting his shop. Facing this accusation, the barbershop owner said he had no means to tackle Louis Vuitton and may have to close down his shop which has been operating for one year in a remote local district on Hong Kong Island. The controversy had caused tremendous concern on Hong Kong news forums and viral protest on Facebook pages. =S-Lock copyright in Hong Kong= In another legal warning dated back to September 2012, Louis Vuitton had filed complaints against two small retail shops in Hong Kong for allegedly violating its intellectual property rights in relation to the \\"S-Lock\\" design for Louis Vuitton's handbags. According to the Hong Kong-based Apple Daily newspaper, the company was seeking compensation of HK$40,000 (around $US 5,000) and a public apology in the newspaper. The shopkeeper refused to pay, and Louis Vuitton demanded further damages up to HK$150,000 in February 2013. The shop claimed to have sourced two such handbags from Japan at around HK$120, which it retailed at HK$220. In the case of the other small shop selling two handbags, they argued with Louis Vuitton that the designs were different, and got LV's demand reduced to HK$5,000 (around US$640). The owner refused to pay and said they were ready to face LV in court. =Alleged mistreatment of models= In May 2017, media reported on alleged mistreatment of Louis Vuitton exclusive model Ulrikke H√∏yer who was to appear on a Louis Vuitton cruise show in Kyoto. The 20-year-old model, who, on arrival, measured around her hips, was told she was \\"too bloated\\" and \\"too big\\" for her ensemble and instructed to drink only water for 24 hours. The model alleged that she was only informed via her agent in France, who received an email including the text \\"[she] came yesterday in Tokyo to do her final fitting, and she doesn't fit the exact same dress anymore. She has a belly, her face is more puffy [sic] and the back of her dress is open and you can see it is tight.\\" Despite following the instructions, she was eventually excluded from the show. The model stated that she has \\"received hundreds of messages from models\\" who have experienced similar mistreatment from the same Louis Vuitton casting director. The casting director denied the allegations and explained the instructions regarding intake of water as a misunderstanding, that the model was instructed that her intake of liquids was to be limited to water.

While the series' cover-logo trademark reads All Star Comics, its copyrighted title as indicated by postal indicia is All-Star Comics, with a hyphen. With the exception of the first two issues, All Star Comics told stories about the adventures of the Justice Society of America, the first team of superheroes, and introduced Wonder Woman.  Publication history  =Original series= All Star Comics #1 (Summer 1940). Cover art is a collage of previously published panels by various artists. The original concept for All Star Comics was an anthology title containing the most popular series from the other anthology titles published by both All-American Publications and National Comics. All Star Comics #1 (cover-dated Summer 1940) contained superhero stories that included All-American's Golden Age Flash, Hawkman, Ultra-Man, as well as National's Hour-Man, Spectre, and Sandman. The adventure strip \\"Biff Bronson\\" and the comedy-adventure \\"Red, White, and Blue\\" also premiered with the Summer 1940 cover date. Issue #3 (Winter 1940‚Äì1941) depicted the first meeting of the Justice Society of America, with its members swapping stories of their exploits which were subsequently illustrated in the comic's array of solo adventures. In addition to the Flash, Hawkman, Hour-Man, the Spectre, and the Sandman were Doctor Fate from National's More Fun Comics; and the Green Lantern and the Atom from All-American's flagship title All-American Comics. The Justice Society of America (JSA) was originally a frame story used to present an anthology of solo stories about the individual characters, with each story handled by a different artist. Comic historian Les Daniels noted, \\"this was obviously a great notion, since it offered readers a lot of headliners for a dime, and also the fun of watching fan favorites interact.\\" The anthology format was dropped in 1947 and replaced with full issue stories featuring the heroes teaming up to fight crime. All Star Comics #8 (cover dated January 1942) featured the first appearance of Wonder Woman in an eight- page story written by William Moulton Marston, under the pen name of \\"Charles Moulton\\" with art by H. G. Peter. The insert story was included to test reader interest in the Wonder Woman concept. It generated enough positive fan response that Wonder Woman would be awarded the lead feature in the Sensation Comics anthology title starting from issue #1.Wallace \\"1940s\\" in Dolan, p. 40: \\"Wonder Woman...took the lead in Sensation Comics following a sneak preview in All Star Comics #8.\\" That same issue saw the induction of Doctor Mid-Nite and Starman as members of the Justice Society as well. Starting with issue #11, Wonder Woman would appear in All Star Comics as a member of the Justice Society as their secretary. With issue #34 (April‚ÄìMay 1947), Gardner Fox left the series and a new super-villain, the Wizard,Wallace \\"1940s\\" in Dolan, p. 55: \\"Gardner Fox penned his last story about the Justice Society of America in this issue. The writer...introduced an ill-tempered illusionist called the Wizard.\\" was introduced. The Injustice Society first battled the JSA in issue #37 in a tale written by Robert Kanigher.Wallace \\"1940s\\" in Dolan, p. 56: \\"In Robert Kanigher's story...a cabal of villains united as the Injustice Society of the World and took revenge on the JSA's assembled do-gooders.\\" The Black Canary guest starred in issue #38 and joined the team three issues later in #41.Wallace \\"1940s\\" in Dolan, p. 57: \\"Black Canary made her first appearance outside of Flash Comics in a feature by writer Robert Kanigher and artist Alex Toth...By the story's end, Black Canary was considered for JSA membership but wouldn't officially join until All Star Comics #41.\\" All Star Comics increased its frequency from a quarterly to a bimonthly publication schedule, and the JSA lasted through March 1951 with issue #57 in a story titled \\"The Mystery of the Vanishing Detectives\\". Superhero comics slumped in the early 1950s, and All Star Comics was renamed All-Star Western in 1951 with issue #58. In this issue, the \\"Justice Society of America\\" feature was replaced by Western heroes.Irvine, Alex \\"1950s\\" in Dolan, p. 66: \\"As superhero comics continued to decline in popularity, many of them mutated into Western, crime, and horror titles. The superhero omnibus All Star Comics was one such series, becoming All-Star Western as of issue #58.\\" Artwork from an unpublished All Star Comics story titled \\"The Will of William Wilson\\" survived and was reprinted in various publications from TwoMorrows Publishing. All Star Comics #58 (January‚ÄìFebruary 1976). Art by Mike Grell. =1976 revival series= In 1976, the name All Star Comics was resurrected for a series portraying the modern-day adventures of the JSA. The new series dismissed the numbering from All-Star Western and continued the original numbering, premiering with All- Star Comics #58. Starting with issue #66, a hyphen was added to the title and the words \\"All-Star Comics\\" became a much smaller part of the cover; while the words \\"Justice Society\\" became much larger. The 1970s series introduced the new characters Power GirlMcAvennie, Michael \\"1970s\\" in Dolan, p. 169: \\"Along with artist Ric Estrada, [Gerry] Conway also introduced the DC Universe to the cousin of Earth-2's Superman, Kara Zor-L a.k.a. Power Girl.\\" and the Helena Wayne version of the Huntress. This series ran for seventeen issues before it was abruptly canceled with issue #74 as part of the DC Implosion and the JSA's adventures were folded into Adventure Comics. After 23-year-old Gerry Conway became an editor at DC Comics, long-time JSA-fan Roy Thomas suggested to Conway that the JSA be given their own title again. Conway offered Thomas a chance to ghostwrite an issue of the revived All-Star Comics, but he declined as Thomas was under an exclusive contract with Marvel Comics at the time. However, in 1981 Thomas moved to DC and was able to work with the characters. =Subsequent revival= A two-issue All-Star Comics series was published as a part of the \\"Justice Society Returns\\" storyline in May 1999.

Geography Landscape of Peggy's Cove Peggy's Cove is 43 kilometers (26 miles) southwest of Downtown Halifax and comprises one of the numerous small fishing communities located around the perimeter of the Chebucto Peninsula. The community is named after the cove of the same name, a name also shared with Peggy's Point, immediately to the east of the cove. The village marks the eastern point of the St. Margaret's Bay. History Fishing boats in the harbour at Peggy's Cove The first recorded name of the cove was Eastern Point Harbour or Peggs Harbour in 1766. The village is likely named after Saint Margaret's Bay (Peggy being the nickname for Margaret), which Samuel de Champlain named after his mother Marguerite Le Roy.Peggy's Cove: The Amazing History of a Coastal Village by Lesley Choyce, Lawrencetown Beach, Nova Scotia : Pottersfield Press, 2008. Over 150 years later DesBarres used his mother's name to rename the bay, Saint Charlotte's Bay. There has been much folklore created to explain the name. One story suggests the village may have been named after the wife of an early settler. The popular legend claims that the name came from the sole survivor of a shipwreck at Halibut Rock near the cove. Artist and resident William deGarthe said she was a young woman while others claim she was a little girl too young to remember her name and the family who adopted her called her Peggy.'William deGarthe, This is Peggy's Cove The young shipwreck survivor married a resident of the cove in 1800 and became known as \\"Peggy of the Cove\\", attracting visitors from around the bay who eventually named the village Peggy's Cove, after her nickname.Bruce Nunn, History with a Twist, Halifax, N.S.: Nimbus, 1998, pp. 49-53. The village was founded in 1811 when the Province of Nova Scotia issued a land grant of more than to six families of German descent. The settlers relied on fishing as the mainstay of their economy but also farmed where the soil was fertile. They used surrounding lands to pasture cattle. In the early 1900s the population peaked at about 300. The community supported a schoolhouse, church, general store, lobster cannery and boats of all sizes that were nestled in the cove. Many artists and photographers flocked to Peggy's Cove. As roads improved, the number of tourists increased. Today the population is smaller but Peggy's Cove remains an active fishing village and a favourite tourist destination. Roads and several homes were badly damaged at Peggy's Cove in 2003 by the extensive flooding that accompanied Hurricane Juan, which also damaged the cove's breakwater. The breakwater was further washed away by Hurricane Bill in 2009, allowing waves to seriously damage a home and gift shop, and washed away one of the cove's characteristic wooden fish sheds. Tourism The cove Cove ropes and rigging From its inception, the community's economy revolved around fishery. However, tourism began to overtake fishing in economic importance following the Second World War. Today, Peggy's Cove is a major tourist attraction, although its inhabitants still fish for lobster, and the community maintains a rustic undeveloped appearance. The regional municipality and the provincial government have strict land-use regulations in the vicinity of Peggy's Cove, with most property development being prohibited. Similarly there are restrictions on who can live in the community to prevent inflation of property values for year-round residents. The historic Carpenter Gothic style St. John's Anglican Church, the only church in Peggy's Cove, is a municipally designated heritage site.Canada's Historic Places: St. John's Anglican Church The lighthouse at Sunset The first public art gallery, tea-room, and gift shop was opened in a shack in Peggy's Cove in 1937.Peggy's Cove Mist and Rocks, by R. Webber,2013 Geology View of Peggy's Cove from The Whalesback, 1 km north of the community. St. Margaret's Bay is to the right, the Atlantic Ocean straight ahead. More than 400 million years ago, in the Devonian Period, the plate tectonics movement of the Earth's crust allowed molten material to bubble up from the Earth's interior. This formed the rocks seen today and are part of the Great Nova Scotia batholith. The landscape of Peggy's Cove and surrounding areas was subsequently carved by the migration of glaciers and the ocean tides. About 20,000 years ago, an ice ridge moved south from Canada's Arctic region covering much of North America. Along with the ebb and flow of the glaciers, the ice ridge eventually melted and shifted and in the process scooped away and scoured large sections of rock, vegetation and topsoil. As melted land glaciers flowed back to the oceans the changing tidal flows and rising sea levels filled the scarred areas with water, forming coves and inlets. Large boulders composed of 415-million-year-old Devonian granite, called glacial erratics, were lifted by the ice and carried for long distances before being deposited upon the landscape as the ice receded, leaving rugged barrens. The movement of the glacial ice and rocks left scouring marks in the bedrock that are still visible. Peggy's Cove has been declared a preservation area to protect its rugged beauty. The Peggy's Cove Commission Act, passed in 1962, prohibits development in and around the surrounding village and restricts development within Peggy's Cove. The area comprised about stretching from Indian Harbour to West Dover and includes barrens, bogs, inland ponds, and rocky coastline. Peggy's Cove from Swissair 111 Memorial Site Atlantic Ocean The Atlantic tide runs about . The ocean temperature ranges between 12 and 20¬∞ Celsius (54‚Äì68¬∞ Fahrenheit) in the summer and falls to between 0.5 and 4.5¬∞ Celsius (33‚Äì40¬∞ Fahrenheit) in the winter. The ocean moderates the air temperature over the land year round. The shape of the ocean floor and the numerous ocean currents facilitate a rich diversity of marine life along the Atlantic coastline. The Labrador Current flowing south from the Arctic cools the ocean during the summer months. Offshore, the Gulf Stream, travelling northwest from the Caribbean to the northern Europe warms the ocean waters. The confluence of currents off Nova Scotia brings unusual Arctic and tropical species to St. Margarets Bay. Marine life includes Atlantic bluefin tuna, white-sided and white-beaked dolphins, and pinnipeds. Endangered Atlantic leatherback sea turtles are seen in the waters near shore. Endangered right whales and many other species are found in the waters. Cultural impact The cove was the scene of a youth novel by Bryan Doyle called You Can Pick Me up at Peggy's Cove (1976), which was made into a film directed by Don McBrearty and into a video released by Beacon Films, Inc., in 1982. In 2016 it was announced that a Peggy's Cove‚Äìthemed resort had opened in Thailand.Lisa Blackburn, \\"Iconic Peggys Cove recreated at resort in Thailand\\", CBC News, July 07, 2016 =William deGarthe= Sculptor and painter William E. deGarthe lived in Peggy's Cove. A gallery exhibiting his work is open to the public between May 1 and October 31 each year. Outside the gallery, in the William E. deGarthe Provincial Park, is a carved granite outcropping. This 30 m (100 ft) sculpture was carved by deGarthe as \\"a lasting monument to Nova Scotian fishermen\\". It depicts 32 fishermen, their wives, and children enveloped by the wings of St Elmo, the patron saint of sailors, as well as the legendary Peggy. Swissair Flight 111 Swissair 111 Memorial near Peggy's Cove On September 2, 1998, Swissair Flight 111 crashed into St. Margaret's Bay approximately eight kilometres (five miles) southwest of Peggy's Cove with the loss of all 229 aboard. The cove became one of the staging areas for First Responders that were involved in the search and rescue response, crash recovery operation, and investigation of the crash. Many of the CCGA volunteers that were first to approach the crash site were privately owned fishing boats that were operating out of Peggy's Cove and surrounding harbours. In the days following the crash many families and media came to Peggy's Cove to see the crash site. Some of the victims' family members were displeased with the plans for burial of unidentified remains, believing they should have been buried at the site of the memorial. https://web.archive.org/web/20160426152115/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/swissair- victims-displeased-with-memorial-plans-1.172255  See also  * References Sources * List of Lights 1870‚Äì1998 Canadian Coast Guard * Peggys Cove Geological Guide Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources * HRM Civic Address Map External links * Peggys Cove Lighthouse page‚ÄîNova Scotia Lighthouse Preservation Society Category:Communities in Halifax, Nova Scotia Category:Coves of Canada Category:Bays of Nova Scotia Category:General Service Areas in Nova Scotia Category:Fishing villages Category:Fishing communities in Canada Category:Swissair Category:Tourist attractions in Halifax County, Nova Scotia ","title":"Peggy's Cove, Nova Scotia"},{"id":"852838","text":"South Bethlehem may refer to- *South Bethlehem, New York *South Bethlehem, Pennsylvania Category:Place name disambiguation pages ","title":"South Bethlehem"},{"id":"852840","text":"300px The Daughters of Hawaii was founded in 1903 by seven women who were daughters of American Protestant missionaries.

Hanaiakamalama, now known as the Queen Emma Summer Palace was the \\"mountain\\" home of Queen Emma Na'ea, wife of Kamehameha IV. She had inherited it from her uncle, John Young II, son of the famous advisor to Kamehameha I, John Young I. Queen Emma used the home as a retreat where she could escape from the oppressive heat of Honolulu into the coolness of Nuuanu. The Queen Emma Summer Palace was acquired by the Daughters of Hawaii in 1913, narrowly avoiding the demolition of the house and construction of a baseball field on the grounds. The Territorial Government granted the Daughters the use of the home and of the grounds as long as the home was used and maintained as a museum. Having acquired and restored Hanaiakamalama, the Daughters set about to save Hulihe‚Äòe Palace in 1924. The Palace was in ruins. The grounds were so overgrown that the house could not be seen from the road. In 1925, the Territorial Legislature purchased Hulihe‚Äòe and set it aside for the Daughters to use and maintain as a museum. When the Daughters finally took over Hulihee in 1927, there was little interest in historic preservation in the islands. At this time, the Inter-Island Steam Navigation Company began to formulate plans for an oceanfront hotel in Kailua-Kona. They decided that the Hulihee grounds was the most desirable location in Kailua-Kona and at once began to pressure the Daughters to relinquish Hulihee. The ladies held firm and because of their spirit, the State of Hawaii has an important educational museum and Kailua- Kona still has some open waterfront. Hulihee Palace was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Birthplace of Kamehameha III The Daughters of Hawaii also own and maintain the site of Kamehameha III's birth at Keauhou Bay, Kona. It is also added to the Register of Historic Places in 1978. The Daughters of Hawaii is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization supported by donations, dues, admission fees and fundraising events.

Born in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, he was most active between about 1910 and 1930, often collaborating with the lyricist Joseph McCarthy. His mother was a pianist, his father a trumpeter, and he himself toured as a concert pianist in his early years. After a brief spell working in London for a music publisher, he returned to the United States in 1916. Over the next couple of decades many of his songs were used in the famous Ziegfeld Follies, and were performed by the premier singers of the day, such as Eddie Cantor, Anna Held and Edith Day. The year 1919 saw his greatest Broadway hit, the show Irene, which contained perhaps his most well-known song, \\"Alice Blue Gown\\", as well as \\"Castle of Dreams,\\" an adaptation of Chopin's Minute Waltz. This same show was made into a film in 1926, then remade in 1940 with Anna Neagle and Ray Milland, and again for the stage in 1973 with Debbie Reynolds.

Film and television In film and television, a script breakdown is an analysis of a screenplay in which all of the production elements are reduced into lists. Within these lists, are in essence the foundation of creating a production board, which is fundamental in creating a production schedule and production budget of an entire production of any film or television program in pre production. This process is a very tedious and complex task, and is usually the responsibility of the Assistant Director or first or 1AD within the production staff of any given production company. However, many film directors, film producers have knowledge of breaking down a script. 2nd 2nd In particular, literally breaking down the script is a very a thorough and detailed creative analysis of dramatic action in filmmaking, highlighting the reciprocal struggle, theme, and design elements of a screenplay. Which is to code the entire cast, extras, props, special effects, stunts, wranglers, picture cars, wardrobe, make-up and hair stylists, special equipment and or cameras, ADR, Foley, film scores and soundtracks etc., which are all broken-down with different colored marker highlights within a shooting script. After which, these highlights are then organized and broken-down into strips to organize the production schedule within the actual physical production board. This process is more easily done nowadays utilizing a computer than done manually, with features inside Final Draft called tagger, or utilizing tagging mode inside Movie Magic Screenwriter, another effective computer program. This information can easily be imported over to Movie Magic Scheduling to create a digital production board, and then easily imported over to Movie Magic Budgeting to create the entire production budget. Most of the script and production computer software out there comes in both Microsoft and MacOS versions, and even though there is competing software on the market, these which are listed are considered to be an entertainment industry standard. This whole process of the script breakdown however is not to be confused with character breakdowns utilized with casting calls, this is an entire different process with similar names, however administered by two entirely separate departments. Comics In comic books, it is the process of determining how each action, character, and piece of dialogue described in the script will be placed visually on a page. In the studio system that dominated mass-market comic-book production from the 1940s through the 1970s, breakdowns were done by the penciller or by a separate breakdown artist, rarely by the scriptwriter; in some cases, breakdowns were done from a rough story outline before the dialogue was written (the \\"Marvel method\\"). Later comics writers such as Alan Moore and Neil Gaiman, influenced by cinematic technique, began to include more layout details within their scripts. Cartoonists who both write and draw their own work sometimes begin with a script and do their own breakdowns, and sometimes work through drawings without a separate script.

It is located at the northwestern edge (in the Magnetic Hill Area) of the city of Moncton in the Canadian province of New Brunswick. The general area is at the base of a ridge named \\"Lutes Mountain\\", which rises several hundred feet above the surrounding Petitcodiac River valley. History Cover of 1969 tourist pamphlet for Magnetic Hill In the 19th century, a cart path was built from the city in the south onto the ridge. The path was subsequently expanded during the early 20th century and during the age of the automobile, ca. 1931, it was noticed that at one point near the base of the ridge when driving south, motorists were required to accelerate in order to prevent rolling backward (i.e., what appears to be uphill). The novelty became known as \\"Magnetic Hill\\" and was more-or-less an amusing local attraction for residents and visitors to try. Eventually with the rise in tourism after the Second World War, along with local highway construction which saw a \\"Mountain Road\\" bypass built further west from Magnetic Hill, the roughly 1 kilometre segment of gravel road became one of Moncton's prime tourist attractions (along with the tidal bore on the Petitcodiac River). Magnetic Hill is now a historic property.Historic Places, of Canada. To experience Magnetic Hill today, drivers must pay up some money to drive their cars to the end of the road (which has been preserved). When a car is placed in neutral, it will begin to roll backwards, apparently uphill. Observers will also note that water in the adjacent drainage ditches also seemingly runs \\"uphill.\\" Magnetic Hill is one of several Canadian icons mentioned in the Stompin' Tom Connors song \\"Cross Canada\\", later covered (as \\"C-A-N-A-D-A\\") by Raffi on his Bananaphone album.

Early years Otto played high school football at Wisconsin's Wausau High School, under coach Win Brockmeyer. He then went on to play collegiate football at the University of Miami, where he joined the Phi Delta Theta fraternity. In addition to playing offensive center at UM, he also played linebacker on defense. Professional career No National Football League team showed interest in the undersized center. Otto was drafted by the proposed Minneapolis franchise of the new American Football League. When the Minneapolis contingent reneged to accept an NFL franchise, Otto's rights defaulted to the AFL's Oakland Raiders. He then signed with the Raiders and played for the entire ten years of the league's existence and five years beyond. He was issued jersey number 50 for the AFL's inaugural season, 1960, but switched to his familiar 00 the next season. Otto worked diligently to build his body up to his playing weight of 256 pounds. For the next 15 years, Otto became a fixture at center for the Raiders, never missing a single game due to injury, and played in 210 consecutive games. He won one AFL/AFC championship in 1967 against the Houston Oilers with the Raiders, but lost five: in 1968, 1969, 1970, 1973, and 1974 to the New York Jets, Kansas City Chiefs, Baltimore Colts, Miami Dolphins, and Pittsburgh Steelers, respectively, with all five teams winning the Super Bowl. He played alongside Gene Upshaw, another Hall of Famer, at left guard from 1967 to 1974.https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/U/UpshGe00.htm In the 1967 regular season, Oakland scored 468 points (33.4 points/game), leading the AFL, but lost Super Bowl II to the Green Bay Packers. In the 1968 regular season, Oakland scored 453 points (32.4 points/game), again leading the AFL, and beat the Kansas City Chiefs in the divisional round before losing to the Jets. In the 1969 regular season, Oakland scored 377 points (26.9 points/game) to lead the AFL for the third consecutive year, and beat the Houston Oilers in the divisional round of the playoffs before losing to the Chiefs. In the 1970 regular season, the first year of the NFL-AFL merger, Oakland scored 300 points (21.4 points/game), ranking ninth in the 26 team NFL, and beat the Miami Dolphins in the 1970-71 NFL playoffs before losing to the Colts. The Raiders missed the playoffs for the first time in 5 years in 1971, despite scoring 344 points (24.6 points/game), second highest in the NFL. The Raiders came back stronger in 1972, scoring 365 points (26.1 points/game), ranking third in the NFL, but lost 13-7 to the Pittsburgh Steelers in the divisional round of the 1972-73 NFL playoffs, the famous Immaculate Reception game, in which Otto also made the only pass reception of his professional career. In the 1973 regular season, Oakland scored 292 points (20.9 points/game), tenth in the NFL, and avenged their defeat to the Steelers during the 1972-73 NFL playoffs before losing to the Dolphins. In Otto's final year, 1974, Oakland scored 355 points (25.4 points/game), leading the NFL, and avenged their loss to the Dolphins during 1973-74 NFL playoffs before losing to the Steelers again. In 1975, he was replaced by Dave Dalby. He was the last member of the Oakland Raiders inaugural team from 1960 to retire. Otto was one of only 20 players to play for the entire 10-year existence of the American Football League, and one of only three players to play in all of his team's AFL games. Otto was also selected as the Sporting News All-League center from 1960 through 1969. He was an All-Star in the first 13 of his 15 seasons ‚Äì every year in the AFL from 1960 through 1969 and three of his five seasons in the NFL. He was also named the starting center on the AFL All-Time Team. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1980, the first year he was eligible. In 1999, he was ranked number 78 on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Football Players. In 2019, he was revealed as being selected to the National Football League 100th Anniversary All-Time Team. Injuries and operations Otto's body was punished greatly during his NFL career, resulting in nearly 74 operations, including 28 on his knee (nine of them during his playing career) and multiple joint replacements. His joints became riddled with arthritis, and he developed debilitating back and neck problems. In his book, \\"The Pain of Glory\\" Otto described near death experiences from medical procedures, including fighting off three life-threatening infections due to complications from his artificial joints. During one six-month stretch, he was without a right knee joint because he had to wait for an infection to heal before another artificial knee could be implanted. Otto eventually had to have his right leg amputated on August 1, 2007. Despite his maladies, Otto says he has no regrets and wouldn't change a thing even if given the opportunity to do it over again. He discussed his sports injuries as well as the concussions issue in a 2013 Frontline interview for \\"League of Denial: The NFL's Concussion Crisis\\".The Frontline Interview: Jim Otto Personal life Otto was also the subject of 'The Jim Otto Suite', a series of three multimedia works by American contemporary artist Matthew Barney which served as a precursor to The Cremaster Cycle.

He began in Manchester as a church organist, for 14 years, and taught music while beginning to compose church music and secular songs in the late 1870s. In the 1880s, he began to promote and conduct orchestral and vocal concerts of popular and theatre music as \\"Mr. T. A. Barrett's Concerts\\". He began to focus his composition on music hall, including songs for blackface performers, such as \\"Lily of Laguna\\"; songs for musical theatre, such as pantomimes and London shows touring through Manchester; and ballads such as \\"Soldiers of the King\\". Stuart later campaigned against the interpolation of new songs into musical theatre scores and for better enforcement of musical copyrights. In 1895, Stuart began to write songs for George Edwardes's London shows at the Gaiety Theatre and Daly's Theatre. His first full musical comedy score was Florodora in 1899. The show became an international hit, and its song \\"Tell me, pretty maiden\\", became a vaudeville standard. Other musical comedy successes followed, including The School Girl (1903), The Belle of Mayfair (1906) and Havana (1908). Of his later shows, only Peggy made much of an impact. By 1911, Stuart's gambling debts sent him into bankruptcy. Unable to adapt to changing musical tastes, he was no longer in demand as a composer, although he had some success as a piano sketch artist in variety theatre. Life and career =Early years= Stuart was born in Southport, on the Lancashire coast. He was the younger son of Thomas Barrett, a cabinet-maker, and his wife, Mary Ann Burke, n√©e Lester, who were both from western Ireland.Lamb, Andrew. \\"Barrett, Thomas Augustine (1863‚Äì1928)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, online edition, May 2007, accessed 26 May 2012 He grew up in Liverpool, where he attended St Francis Xavier's College.

Stuart also promoted and conducted orchestral and vocal concerts. In the 1880s and 1890s he presented \\"Mr T. A. Barrett's Concerts\\" at the Free Trade Hall, Manchester, and later at the larger St James's Hall.Lamb, pp. 26 and 33 These concerts featured popular orchestral music and selections from comic operas by such composers as Sullivan and Cellier, and excerpts from English grand operas by Balfe and Wallace.Murray, Roderick.

Stuart's elder brother, Stephen (1855‚Äì1924), became a music-hall performer, appearing under the stage name Lester Barrett. Gradually the music Stuart composed for local shows, and his popular ballads and music-hall songs began to supersede the composition of serious and religious music. He composed music hall songs as \\"T. A. Barrett\\" and under the pseudonyms \\"Leslie Thomas\\", \\"Lester Barrett\\" and, most notably, \\"Leslie Stuart\\". He wrote many popular songs for the blackface performer Eugene Stratton, including perhaps his best- remembered music hall song, \\"Lily of Laguna\\" (1898), and \\"Little Dolly Daydream.\\" He also wrote the patriotic ballad \\"Soldiers of the King\\" (1894, now sung as \\"Soldiers of the Queen\\"). In 1886, Stuart married Mary Catherine Fox, a schoolteacher (died 1941).Lamb, p. 27 Sheet music for \\"Florodora\\", 1899 Stuart's earliest theatrical composing and writing was also for the Manchester theatre. Here he provided songs and incidental music for, in particular, the local pantomimes, which boasted famous names in their casts.Lamb, p. 62 Stuart made a name in the 1890s by writing popular individual numbers that were interpolated into several West End and touring musicals by other composers. Later in his career, he would actively oppose this practice. The first of these songs was \\"Lousiana Lou\\". This had already been published and performed in music hall before being picked up by Ellaline Terriss and inserted, along with \\"The Little Mademoiselle\\", into the original production of The Shop Girl (1894), at the Gaiety Theatre.Lamb, pp. 54‚Äì55 During the run of George Edwardes's An Artist's Model (1895), Stuart wrote several numbers that were interpolated (including \\"The Soldiers of the Queen\\", which was later famous as \\"Soldiers of the King\\"), and both wrote the lyric and composed \\"Trilby Will Be True\\" for Maurice Farkoa to perform at Daly's Theatre.Lamb, p. 58 Subsequently he had songs used in Baron Golosh, The Circus Girl (1896), the London production of the American musical A Day in Paris (1897), Carl Kiefert's The Ballet Girl (1897) and The Yashmak (1897).Lamb, pp. 58 (Baron Galosh), 63 (The Circus Girl), 275 (The Ballet Girl) and 276 (A Day in Paris and The Yashmak) Stuart composed some 65 songs including, in addition to those mentioned above, \\"The Bandolero\\", and \\"Little Dolly Daydream.\\" His instrumental pieces included at least one Cakewalk.\\"An Eighth Garland of British Light Music\\", MusicWeb International, accessed 26 May 2012 As a songwriter, Stuart suffered so much from the effects of copyright infringement that it can be speculated that his move to the musical theatre was an attempt to avoid the loss of royalty income from the publication of sheet music and performances. =Peak years= { style=\\"float:right; width:250px;\\"  Music from Florodora (1899) } Stuart's greatest acclaim came in 1899 with Florodora, his first full musical comedy score, with a book by Owen Hall. With traditional slow love ballads as well as waltzes and more rhythmic and playful concerted numbers, the score and show became a worldwide hit. The double sextet from that show, \\"Tell me, pretty maiden\\", became a vaudeville standard.Traubner, p. 212 The music critic Neville Cardus wrote about the \\"beautiful and unexpected phrasing and transitions\\" in the number, continuing, \\"it begins with a long phrase, rather like the opening bars of a Brahms symphony. It is extraordinary to find music such as this in a musical comedy\\". He ended by writing that in its own way it was \\"just as perfect a composition ‚Ä¶ as is the quintet in Meistersinger\\".Milnes, Rodney. \\"Rodney Milnes reviews a new biography of Leslie Stuart\\", Opera, July 2003, p. 817 Florodora was followed by The Silver Slipper (1901), The School Girl (1903), The Belle of Mayfair (1906), and Havana (1908). All these shows were successful and were produced internationally.Lamb, pp. 58 (The Silver Slipper), 145‚Äì46 (The School Girl), 186 (The Belle of Mayfair) and 192 (Havana) Stuart was an active campaigner for intellectual property rights and called for tighter laws on both national and international copyright. Publishers and wealthy second-rate songwriters would pay producers, for the exposure, to insert their songs into a hit musical. With the strength of the fame of Florodora behind him, Stuart succeeded in stopping this practice in his next few pieces. Similarly, he had succeeded from time to time in parts of his fight in Britain and in America against unauthorized music distribution and on behalf of firmer national and international copyright laws. Music cover showing Olive May, Phyllis Dare and Gabrielle Ray in Peggy, 1911 The success of Stuart's shows led George Edwardes to hope that he would be able to replace the Caryll and Monckton writing partnership on their departure from the Gaiety Theatre. Stuart's next show, Captain Kidd (1909), however, was not for the Gaiety, and it was a flop. The Observer praised the performances of Terriss, Seymour Hicks and Ivy St Helier, but said that Stuart's music \\"had one striking and ingenious melody ... and two or three pretty tunes, and was adequate throughout without being remarkable.\\"\\"At the Play\\", The Observer, 16 January 1910, p. 5 His next production, The Slim Princess (1910), made only a modest impact, though it was produced in New York as well as in London.\\"Elsie Janis a Slim Princess\\", The New York Times, 3 January 1911 Peggy was produced at the Gaiety in 1911 and had a reasonable but not outstanding run, from March to November in London,\\"Theatres\\", The Times, 7 March 1911, p. 8 and \\"Theatres\\", The Times, 15 November 1911, p. 8 as well as a Broadway run.\\"'Peggy,' at Casino, is queer mixture\\", The New York Times, 8 December 1911 In the words of Stuart's biographer Andrew Lamb, these pieces \\"failed to add to his reputation\\". =Later years= By 1911, the lack of any new stage successes, coupled with gambling debts and the interest due on them, resulted in Stuart's appearance before the bankruptcy courts.\\"Mr. Leslie Stuart's Affairs: Losses Owing to 'Pirated' Music\\", The Manchester Guardian, 21 August 1912, p. 9 He was declared bankrupt in 1913 and not discharged until 1920. At the age of 48 he found that changing tastes in musical styles and the influence of modern dance rhythms meant his career as a composer was effectively over,Cardus, Neville, \\"Leslie Stuart ‚Äì Famous Song-Writer's Death\\", The Manchester Guardian, 28 May 1928, p. 6 although he did write a number of songs that were inserted, against his principles, in the shows of other composers and a musical, Bubbles (1914), that was produced only in the provinces on a small scale. Stuart retained an income, provided by continued revivals and performances of the popular Florodora, and supplemented this by appearing with success in variety theatre, where he performed his most famous songs accompanying himself on the piano. However, after the bankruptcy, he began to drink and have marital problems. Stuart's last years were spent partly in trying to achieve production of his musical play Nina, also known as The Girl from Nyusa. The Shubert brothers took out an option to produce the work, but nothing materialised. In 1927, shortly before his death, Stuart wrote a series of fourteen short pieces for the Empire News, consisting of recollections and reminiscences.Lamb, p. 258 They were collected and republished in 2003 under the title My Bohemian Life.Stuart, passim Stuart and his wife, Kitty, had five children who survived to adulthood, Mary \\"May\\" (1886‚Äì1956), Thomas \\"Leslie\\" (1888‚Äì1970), Marie \\"Dollie\\" (1891‚Äì1949), Stephen \\"Chap\\" (b. 1894) and Constance \\"Lola\\" (b. 1896).Lamb, pp. 28, 30, 42, 54, 164, 258 and 264 Stuart died at his daughter May's home in Richmond, Surrey in 1928, at the age of 65,Stuart was evasive about his true age. Various different years of birth have been given including 1866, and no official birth record is known to exist. However, his 1871 and 1881 census entries seem to establish that he was born in 1863. See Lamb, p. vii and was buried in Richmond Cemetery. Reputation and legacy The mid-20th century critic James Agate said that he had proved the quality of Stuart's music: he took a Stuart song, halved the tempo, supplied German words ‚Äì and serious musicians accepted without demur his assertion that it was a recently discovered cradle song by Brahms.Lamb, p. 66 In 2003 the critic Rodney Milnes called Stuart \\"the most gifted composer of musical comedy in Britain between Sullivan and Vivian Ellis\\". A 1941 biographical film entitled You Will Remember about Stuart starred Robert Morley as Stuart. It features several of Stuart's songs.Erickson, Hal. \\"You Will Remember (1941)\\", Allmovie.com, accessed June 1, 2016 Stuart's songs have been used in over a dozen other films.

The Institute was based in England, while the other body, the Faculty of Actuaries, was based in Scotland. While the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries were separate institutions, they worked very closely together, and their professional qualifications and actuarial standards were identical. On 25 May 2010, voting members of the Institute who took part in a ballot voted to merge the Institute with the Faculty, thus creating the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, which came into being on 1 August 2010. The Institute of Actuaries ceased to exist on that date. Establishment of the Institute of Actuaries The actuaries of a number of life assurance companies established the Institute of Actuaries in London on the 8th of July 1848. The Institute of Actuaries was the oldest actuarial professional body in the world. In July 1884, the Institute of Actuaries was granted a Royal Charter. The Royal Charter confirmed the Institute's role and the right to confer qualifications, i.e. the Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries (FIA). Since then there has been an underpinning concept of professional behaviour and the implicit right, or even duty, to discipline members who did not conduct themselves appropriately. Examinations An actuarial qualification from the Institute of Actuaries consisted of a combination of the completion of various examinations and courses. The examinations were split into four sections: Core Technical (CT), Core Applications (CA), Specialist Technical (ST), and Specialist Applications (SA). Study material for the examinations is usually obtained through the official bookshop of the Institute of Actuaries Bookshop, The Official Actuarial Bookshop or through The Actuarial Education Company (ActEd),ActEd The Actuarial Education Company a subsidiary of BPP Actuarial Education Ltd. In addition to examinations and courses, it was required that the candidate both complete at least three years work as an actuary and be at least 23 years of age, for one to qualify as a ‚ÄúFellow of the Institute of Actuaries‚Äù (FIA) Becoming a student, Actuarial Profession, Faculty and Institute of Actuaries, 2006-06-11 =Core Examinations= The Core Technical section consisted of the 8 exams and a ‚ÄúBusiness Awareness Module,‚Äù CT9. These were usually first sat by a candidate and included the underlying mathematics involved in actuarial work as well as an introduction to financial and economic issues. These were also the most common exams for which candidates may get exemptions. While these were the first exams, candidates coming from a less mathematical background often find these more difficult than the later ones due to the mathematical theory content. Topics covered include annuities, stochastic modelling, time series, and economics. The Core Applications section consisted of two exams and a modeling course, CA2, that focus on the application of concepts learned, especially to insurance companies. This included the communications model, CA3, which tested the candidate on their ability to communicate complex actuarial concepts to others. =Specialist Examinations= The Specialist Technical section represented the first time the candidate had a choice of which exams to take. The candidate chose two from the various actuarial specialist subjects i.e. Health and Care, Life Insurance, General Insurance, Pensions, Finance or Investments and further technical knowledge on said subjects is attained. The Specialist Applications section allowed the candidate to choose one area for which they take the SA paper and attain full Fellowship; leading to many referring to this as the ‚ÄúFellowship paper.‚Äù However, as the rules on the ordering of examinations were relaxed, this examination may be taken before taking some earlier examinations resulting in candidates qualifying on other papers. List of Examinations The following list will be replaced by a new curriculum structure from 31 December 2018. =Core Technical Stage= * CT1 - Financial Mathematics * CT2 - Finance and Financial Reporting * CT3 - Probability and Mathematical Statistics * CT4 - Models * CT5 - Life Contingencies * CT6 - Statistical Models * CT7 - Business Economics * CT8 - Financial Economics * CT9 - Business Awareness =Core Applications Stage= * CA1 - Actuarial Risk Management * CA2 - Model Documentation, Analysis and Reporting * CP3 - Communication Practice =Specialist Technical Stage= * ST1 - Health and Care Specialist Technical * ST2 - Life Insurance Specialist Technical * ST3 - General Insurance Specialist Technical * ST4 - Pensions and other Benefits Specialist Technical * ST5 - Finance and Investment Specialist Technical A * ST6 - Finance and Investment Specialist Technical B * ST7 - General Insurance - Reserving and Capital Modelling Specialist Technical * ST8 - General Insurance - Pricing Specialist Technical * ST9 - Enterprise Risk Management Specialist Technical =Specialist Applications Stage= * SA0 - Research Dissertation Specialist Applications * SA1 - Health and Care Specialist Applications * SA2 - Life Insurance Specialist Applications * SA3 - General Insurance Specialist Applications * SA4 - Pensions and other Benefits Specialist Applications * SA5 - Finance Specialist Applications * SA6 - Investment Specialist Applications =UK Practice Modules= For students working in the UK only * P0 - Generic UK Practice Half Module * P1 - Health and Care * P2 - Life Insurance * P3 - General Insurance * P4 - Pensions * P5 - Finance * P6 - Investment University-based examinations A student may choose to complete an accredited actuarial science degree at an undergraduate or at a postgraduate level through a number of recognised universities. Successful students may offer proof of having covered the topics whilst at university and students may be granted exemptions from certain professional examinations from the Institute of Actuaries. Depending on the University, a different number of courses may be recognised for exemption. The examinations and the exemption pass level for the examinations is usually externalised by members of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries. Naturally, the quality of the courses and lecturing at these universities are a determinant as to whether the course is recognised by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries. Most universities offering actuarial science courses also require the student in addition to complete various other related topics, including statistics, mathematics, applied mathematics, economics and accounting for recognition of an actuarial degree. Upon completion of the university degree, students would then complete all remaining examinations through the Institute of Actuaries to qualify as an actuary and become a Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries(FIA). Membership Categories In total there were approximately 15700 members of the Institute of Actuaries falling into the following categories. Membership data, Actuarial Profession, Faculty and Institute of Actuaries * Affiliates were non-actuary members of the Institute of Actuaries who are kept up-to-date with the developments within the Actuarial Profession through publications and affiliates are able to participate in meetings, research and conferences; * Student actuaries were members of the Institute who are taking exams but have not attained the rank of Associate; * Associates were members who had completed the CT and CA stages of exams and have completed one year's worth of relevant work-based skills experience. There were about 500 Associates in the Institute. They bear the letters AIA after their names; * Fellows were \\"fully qualified\\" members of the Institute who had met the training demands by both completing all the examinations and meeting the work experience requirements. Fellows and Associates have the right to describe themselves as an actuary. There were about 9500 Fellows in the Institute. They bear the letters FIA after their names; * Honorary Fellows were voted on by the Council if it feels are appears to be able to render assistance in promoting the objects of the Institute and who is not professionally engaged in practice as an actuary. Criticism Following the near collapse of The Equitable Life Assurance Society, the Government commissioned Derek Morris, the former head of the Competition Commission, to look into the failings of the actuarial profession and make recommendations for reform (2005). His report highlighted concerns about the process by which the Profession had sought to keep its syllabus and teaching materials up to date, about the way that ‚Äòentrenched commercial interests‚Äô had hindered the development of the Institute's education policy, referring to 'an insularity that constrained the extent and effectiveness of input from academics, other professions and those in wider fields of practice'. Morris, D. (2005) Morris Review of the Actuarial Profession. Norwich: HMSO, March. The Review proposed a regime of independent oversight of the Institute's regulation of the profession by the Financial Reporting Council https://www.frc.org.uk/actuaries/oversight-of-the-actuarial- profession/morris-review.

Life Westminster Cathedral was designed by John Francis Bentley and constructed between 1895 and 1903. Bentley was born in Doncaster. In 1858, he was associated with the firm of Holland & Hannan. He was an apt modeller and had tried his hand with success at stone carving. He studied under Henry Clutton before branching out on his own in 1868.Williamson, George. \\"John Francis Bentley.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 5 June 2019 His first important commission was from Cardinal Manning, for the seminary at Hammersmith. Examples of his work include Holy Rood Church, Watford, St John's Beaumont School, Corpus Christi Church, Brixton, St Mary's, Cadogan Street, Chelsea (1879), the high altar at St Gabriel's, Warwick Square, and St Luke's Church, Chiddingstone Causeway (1897), and the Sacred Heart Chapel at the Jesuit Church of the Immaculate Conception, Farm Street. Though much of his work was in the neo-Gothic style, he was selected to create a Byzantine Revival design for Westminster Cathedral. The great opportunity of Bentley's career came in 1894, when he was commissioned to design a new Roman Catholic cathedral in Westminster, London. After deciding on a Byzantine Revival design, Bentley travelled to Italy to study some of the great early Byzantine-influenced cathedrals, such as St Mark's Basilica in Venice. Because of illness and an outbreak of cholera in Istanbul, he was unable to complete his tour with a study of the Hagia Sophia. Bentley ended his tour in Venice and returned to London to begin work on Westminster Cathedral.Paul Waterhouse, Bentley, John Francis (1839‚Äì1902), rev. Peter Howell, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 31 Jan 2011 He was a person of brusque, reserved manner, but kind and friendly to those who knew him. He had the strongest dislike to the preparation of show drawings and to the system of architectural competition and, being a man wholly lacking in self-assertion, and reticent in conversation, was never as well known in general circles as he deserved to be. His great characteristics as an architect were his careful attention to detail, his solicitude that all the fittings should be in perfect harmony with the building. Bentley was awarded the gold medal of the Institute of Architects in February, 1902, but never received it, as on 1 March he was seized with paralysis and died the following morning in Clapham. He is buried at St Mary Magdalen Church, Mortlake.

After working on computer simulations of transsonic airfoils and developing the Korn airfoil,http://aero- comlab.stanford.edu/Papers/Garabedian.pdf he switched fields to computer science and became a member of technical staff at Bell Laboratories in 1976. He developed Korn shell in response to problems he and his colleagues had with the most commonly used shells at the time, Bourne shell and C shell. The Korn shell pioneered the practice of consultative user interface design, with input from Unix shell users, and from mathematical and cognitive psychologists. The user interface, which included a choice of editing styles (the choices included styles based on vi and on two variants of Emacs) was incorporated into, or copied by, most subsequent Unix shells. The Korn shell is backward- compatible with Bourne shell, but takes a lot of ideas from C shell, such as history viewing and vi-like command line editing. Korn shell and Microsoft Microsoft once included a version of the Korn shell produced by Mortice Kern Systems (MKS) in a UNIX integration package for Windows NT. This version was not compatible with ksh88 (a Korn shell specification), and Korn mentioned this during a question and answer period of a Microsoft presentation during a USENIX NT conference in Seattle in 1998. Greg Sullivan, a Microsoft product manager who was participating in the presentation, not knowing who the commenter was, insisted that Microsoft had indeed chosen a \\"real\\" Korn shell. A polite debate ensued, with Sullivan continuing to insist that the man giving the criticisms was mistaken about the compatibility issues.

It is in the perch family (family Percidae) of the order Perciformes. First recorded in 1973, the snail darter was listed as endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act of 1973 by 1975 and was involved in a legal controversy leading to a Supreme Court ruling to halt the completion of Tellico Dam, which posed a risk of extinction for the snail darter by blocking its migratory route -- see Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill, snail darter controversy. In 1978, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), and Tennessee Wildlife Resource Agency launched a recovery plan to preserve the snail darter by transferring the species to other river systems.Etnier, DA & Starnes, WC. 1993. The fishes of Tennessee. Knoxville, TN: University of Tennessee Press. Its native range was originally in the lower parts of the Little Tennessee River, the Sequatchie River, and in Chickamauga Creek, but was later eliminated from the Little Tennessee River by the completion of Tellico Dam.Ashton, MJ & Layzer, JB. 2008. Distribution of the Threatened Snail Darter (Percina Tanasi) in the Upper Tennessee River Drainage. Journal of The Tennessee Academy of Science 83:52-56. The species was then transplanted into the Hiwassee River in southeastern Tennessee. The species inhabits large creeks or deeper portions of rivers and reservoirs with gravel and sand shoals substrate. The snail darter spawns between February to mid-April with the female producing 600 eggs which drift downstream. Juveniles occupy slack water habitats and migrate upstream to the breeding ground. The lifespan of the snail darter ranges between 2 and 4 years. The snail darter adult length ranges between .Page, LM. 1983. Handbook of Darters. Neptune City, NJ: TFH Publications. The species‚Äô diet consists mostly of snails and insects (caddisflies, midges, and blackflies). Snail darters have camouflage dorsal patterns and burrow in the substrate to conserve energy and hide from predators. They are largely preyed upon by banded sculpin (Cottuss carolinae).Starnes, WC. 1977. The ecology and life history of endangered snail darter, Percina (Imostoma) tanasi (Etnier). Knoxville, Tennessee: PhD dissertation, University of Tennessee. 144 pp. The specific name tanasi derives from capital of the Cherokee Nation located on the Little Tennessee River where the species was first recorded.Kuehne, RA & Barbour, RW.1983. The American Darters. Lexington, KY: University Press of Kentucky. The species was relisted as threatened in 1984 after being successfully transplanted into other river systems. Geographic distribution The original range of the snail darter was thought to be strictly in the lower portion of the Little Tennessee River with a few individuals dispersing into the headwaters of the Watts Bar Reservoir below Fort Loudon Dam. Prior to the completion of the Tellico Dam in 1979, TVA biologists made several efforts to relocate the remaining individuals of the species into other river systems. In 1975 the species was successfully transplanted to the Hiwassee River, where the population has risen to about 2,500 individuals. Another transplant attempt was made to the Nolichucky River in 1975, but was later stopped by the discovery of another federally protected species, the sharphead darter (Etheostoma acuticeps). Other unsuccessful transplant locations included lower parts of the Holston River, French Broad River, and middle Elk River. With the completion of the Tellico Dam, the snail darter was extirpated from the Little Tennessee River. In 1980, additional populations of snail darters were discovered in South Chickamauga Creek in Chattanooga, the lower portion of Big Sewee Creek in Meigs County, the lower Sequatchie River in Marion County, Little River in Blount County, and the lower portion of Paint Rock River in Madison County, Alabama. These discoveries indicated the snail darter's possible range as being from the lower reaches of major tributaries of the Tennessee River from the northward bend in Alabama upstream; the snail darter was reclassified from endangered to threatened in July 1984. Snail darter, Percina tanasi Ecology The snail darters are found in gravel shoals free of silt and aquatic plants, with moderate to strong currents, and moderate depths.Ashton, MJ & Layzer, JB. 2010. Summer microhabitat use by adult and young-of-year snail darters (Percina tanasi) in two rivers. Ecology of Freshwater Fish 19:609-617. The substrate generally consists of dark micaceous sand, with little to no silt, and 25 to 50 percent of the area scattered with gravel. Agricultural development has also affected the water clarity, and silt run-off causes problem for reproduction and migration. In 1976, the winter temperature ranged from 41¬∞ to 54 ¬∞F, and summer temperature averaged near 64 ¬∞F in the Little Tennessee River. These temperature fluctuations are due to impoundments, resulting in colder water when the dam is discharging and warming water when flow is diminished. Current velocities ranged from a moderate 0.25 m/s to nearly 0.7 m/s. The snail darter actively feeds in spring and winter with a diet consisting of 60% small gastropods (5mm or less in diameter) and other prey such as caddisflies, midges, and blackflies. Snails are the preferred food source until late spring when they outgrow the gape size of the fish, resulting in a diet change to insect larvae.Haag, WR & Warren ML. 2006. Seasonal Feeding Specialization on Snails by River Darters (Percina Shumardi) with a Review of Snail Feeding by Other Darter Species. The American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists 4:604-614. The most effective predator on adult snail darters is Cottus carolinae while Salmo trutta, Morone chrysops, Sizostedion canadense, and other darters would prey on eggs and juveniles. The snail darters‚Äô dorsal patterns and coloration allow the fish to camouflage with the substrate to avoid detection from predators. Burrowing behavior also is a defense mechanism and can help conserve energy for the current. Life history The snail darter spawning occurs in early February through April when water temperatures range from 12¬∞-13 ¬∞C. The female produces over 600 eggs and has multiple mates over the course of two weeks. The snail darter does not display territorial behavior during the breeding, unlike other species of darters. The eggs are deposited on the shallowest portion of gravel shoals and hatch after 15‚Äì20 days. Silt run-off can deprive eggs of oxygen, leading to higher mortality. When eggs hatch, the larvae drift downstream to deeper, calmer water and feed on zooplankton. The larvae are phototaxic (attracted to light) which may have implications regarding diurnal movements in the water column or depth maintenance. After 3 to 4 months of age, the juveniles migrate upstream during spring, and remain at the breeding shoal areas. The snail darter reaches sexual maturity at one year. The snail darter life span is 2 to 4 years, depending on predation and access to the breeding ground. More research on the snail darter life history is needed. Current management The snail darter is a federally protected species and is listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 as a result of habitat destruction from the completion of the Tellico Dam. Another factor in the decline of snail darters is siltation, which degrades spawning habitat and food availability. Other influences include agricultural development, environmental contamination and pollution, and channel modification, which affect the water clarity, reproduction success, and migration patterns.U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. Snail Darter [Online]. Available from: http://ecos.fws.gov/docs/life_histories/E010.html. Accessed November 18, 2012. A recovery plan was made and completed on May 5, 1983. The recovery efforts focused on finding and transplanting individuals to suitable habitat areas in the Tennessee River, continuing research to locate already-existing populations, and maintaining current populations of snail darters. Programs are in progress to educate the public and to work with state officials and local citizens to broaden protection efforts. However, more recent research on snail darters is still needed to better manage and protect the species and its habitat. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, TVA, Tennessee Wildlife Resource Agency, and other law enforcement agencies are utilizing legislation and regulations to protect the snail darter during the recovery effort.Biggins, RG, Eager, RB & Hurst, H. 1983. Snail darter recovery plan. US Fish and Wildlife Service, Asheville, North Carolina. It is recommended that at least five separate viable populations should be maintained, the species should be kept on the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife, and federal permits to collect the species should be required. As a result of the current recovery plan, the snail darter's federal listing was degraded from endangered species to vulnerable species, though it is still considered threatened.U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.

VI, ¬ß1: \\"Camalet or Cadbury\\", p. 118\\\\. J. B. Nichols & Son (London), 1839. is a Bronze and Iron Age hillfort in the civil parish of South Cadbury in the English county of Somerset. It is a scheduled monument and has been associated with King Arthur's legendary court at Camelot. The hillfort is formed by a plateau surrounded by ramparts on the surrounding slopes of the limestone Cadbury Hill. The site has been excavated in the late 19th and early 20th century by James Bennett and Harold St George Gray. More recent examination of the site was conducted in the 1960s by Leslie Alcock and since 1992 by the South Cadbury Environs Project. These have revealed artifacts from human occupation and use from the Neolithic through the Bronze and Iron Ages. The site was reused by the Roman forces and again from c. 470 until some time after 580. In the 11th century, it temporarily housed a Saxon mint. Evidence of various buildings at the site has been unearthed, including a \\"Great Hall\\", round and rectangular house foundations, metalworking, and a possible sequence of small rectangular temples or shrines. Background Hillforts developed in the Late Bronze and Early Iron ages, around the start of the 1st millennium BC. The reason for their emergence in prehistoric Britain and their purpose has been a subject of debate. It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture. The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of iron ore were located in different places from the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze and, as a result, trading patterns shifted. The old elites lost their economic and social status and power passed into the hands of a new group of people. Archaeologist Barry Cunliffe believes that population increase still played a role and has stated that Location Cadbury Castle is located north east of Yeovil. It stands on the summit of Cadbury Hill, a limestone hill situated on the southern edge of the Somerset Levels, with flat lowland to the north. The summit is above sea- level on lias stone. The hill is surrounded by terraced earthwork banks and ditches and a stand of trees. On the north west and south sides there are four ramparts, with two remaining on the east. The summit plateau covers , and is surrounded by the inner bank which is long. The hill fort is overlooked by Sigwells, a rural plateau rich in archaeological remains. Due to scrub and tree growth the site has been added to the Heritage at Risk Register.  History  =Early occupation of the site= Yetholm-type shield from South Cadbury. Displayed at the Museum of Somerset, Taunton. The earliest settlement on the site is represented by pits and post holes dated with Neolithic pottery and flints. These are the remains of a small agricultural settlement which was unenclosed. Bones recovered from the site have been radiocarbon dated to 3500 and 3300 BC. A bank under the later Iron Age defences is likely to be a lynchet or terrace derived from early ploughing of the hilltop. The site was also occupied in the Late Bronze Age, from which ovens have been identified. Radical revisions of the Bronze Age archaeology on the lower slopes resulted from discoveries during excavations and survey work by the South Cadbury Environs Project. Finds include the first Bronze Age shield from an excavation in northwest Europe, an example of the distinctive Yetholm-type. Carbon dating implies that the shield was deposited in the 10th century BC, although metallurgical evidence suggests that it was manufactured two centuries earlier. A metal-working building and associated enclosure were discovered south east of the hillfort, roughly contemporary with the period of manufacture. Human occupation continued throughout the Iron Age. A stone enclosure was constructed around 300 BC with timber revetting, and ploughing ceased within the hilltop site. Excavations have shown the signs of four and six post rectangular buildings which were gradually replaced with roundhouses. Large ramparts and elaborate timber defences were constructed and refortified over the following centuries. Excavation revealed round and rectangular house foundations, metalworking, and a possible sequence of small rectangular temples or shrines, indicating permanent oppidum-like occupation. Excavations were undertaken by local clergyman James Bennett in 1890 and Harold St George Gray in 1913, followed by major work led by archaeologist Leslie Alcock from 1966‚Äì1970. He identified a long sequence of occupation on the site and many of the finds are displayed in the Museum of Somerset in Taunton. The finds from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age, exploring the ramparts and southwestern gate structure, represent one of the deepest and most complex Iron Age stratigraphic sequences excavated in southern Britain. =Castle= During the first century BC additional lines of bank and ditch were constructed turning it into a multivallate hillfort which is now known as the castle. There is evidence that the fort was violently taken in around 43 and that the defences were further slighted later in the 1st century after the construction of a Roman army barracks on the hilltop. Excavations of the southwest gate in 1968 and 1969 revealed evidence for one or more severe violent episodes, associated with weaponry and destruction by fire. Whereas the excavator, Leslie Alcock, believed this to have been dated to around AD 70, Richard Tabor argues for a date associated with the initial invasion, either 43 or 44. Michael Havinden states that it was the site of vigorous resistance by the Durotriges and Dobunni to the second Augusta Legion under the command of Vespasian. There was significant activity at the site during the late third and fourth centuries, which may have included the construction of a Romano-British temple. =Post-Roman occupation= Following the withdrawal of the Roman administration, the site is thought to have been in use from until some time after 580. Alcock revealed a substantial \\"Great Hall\\" and showed that the innermost Iron Age defences had been refortified, providing a defended site double the size of any other known fort of the period. Shards of pottery from the eastern Mediterranean were also found from this period, indicating wide trade links. It therefore seems probable that it was the chief caer (\\"fort\\") of a major Brythonic ruler, his family, his teulu (literally meaning \\"family\\", but actually meaning \\"warband\\"), servants, and horses. Between 1010 and 1020, the hill was reoccupied for use as a temporary Saxon mint, standing in for that at Ilchester. =Medieval Period= According to the Domesday Book, Cadbury Castle appears to have been part of the feudal barony of North Cadbury held by Turstin FitzRolf in 1086. Some small-scale fortification of the site may also have occurred in the 13th century. Interpretation Engraving of Cadbury Castle, drawn in 1723 by alt= The suffix -bury (from byrig, an Anglo-Saxon word meaning \\"fort\\" or \\"town\\") is frequently, but not exclusively, used to refer to hill-forts. The first part of the name may come from the River Cam, as with the nearby villages of West Camel and Queen Camel. Other scholars suggest a derivation from some figure named \\"Cador\\" or \\"Cada\\". It is one of three sites in Somerset to include the Cadbury name, the others being Cadbury Camp, near Tickenham, and Cadbury Hill, which is also known as Cadbury-Congresbury to distinguish it from the other sites. Local tradition, first written down by John Leland in 1542, holds that Cadbury Castle was King Arthur's Camelot. The site and the Great Hall are extensive, and the writer Geoffrey Ashe argued in an article in the journal Speculum that it was the base for the Arthur of history. His opinion has not been widely accepted by students of the period. Militarily, the location makes sense as a place where refugees and the southwestern Brythons of Dumnonia could have defended themselves against attacks from the east. If Arthur was indeed conceived at Tintagel, as tradition asserts,Geoffrey of Monmouth, Historia Regum Britanniae Book 8.19‚Äì24, Book 9, Book 10, Book 11.1‚Äì2 he may have been a prince of Dumnonia and used Cadbury as a stronghold on his eastern frontier. South Cadbury Environs Project The recent work on the archaeology of the site and the surrounding area has been carried out by the South Cadbury Environs Project. Since 1992 the project team, which included local volunteers South East Somerset Archaeological and Historical Society and the Yeovil Archaeology and Local History Society, have carried out geophysical surveys including gradiometry and electrical resistivity tomography, ploughzone sampling, test pits, deeper excavations and geographic information system (GIS) approaches. The project had input from academics and archaeologists from the universities of Bristol, Glasgow, Birmingham and Oxford, funded by the Leverhulme Trust and Arts and Humanities Research Council.

Harnick began his career writing words and music to comic songs in musical revues. One of these, \\"The Merry Minuet\\", was popularized by the Kingston Trio. It is in the caustic style usually associated with Tom Lehrer and is sometimes incorrectly attributed to Lehrer. Early life Sheldon Mayer Harnick was born to American Jewish parents and grew up in the Chicago neighborhood of Portage Park. Yiddish was rarely spoken in the home, mostly as a way his parents kept conversations between themselves private. Musical career Harnick began writing music while still in Carl Schurz High School in Chicago. After his Army service, he graduated from the Northwestern University School of Music (1946-1949) with a Bachelor of Music degree, and worked with various orchestras in the Chicago area. He then moved to New York City and wrote for many musicals and revues. He was friends with Charlotte Rae from college, and he went to see her one night at the Village Vanguard where she was singing a revue. Yip Harburg, who was one of Harnick's idols, heard she was singing a song of his and decided to come. He told Harnick that he enjoyed his writing, and urged him to continue. Harburg advised Harnick to work with a large number of composers. He also counseled him to write character and comic songs, not ballads, for Broadway. Harnick followed both tips even though Harburg's advice contradicted that of Jay Gorney, who had told Harnick that ballads were the key to success on Broadway. Around 1956, Harnick met Jerry Bock, forming \\"what is arguably the most important musical partnership of the '60s.\\" Their first musical was The Body Beautiful, running for only 60 performances in 1958, but Fiorello! (1959) ran for 795 performances and won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama.

It consists of two parallel mountain chains, with the valley of the Pa Sak River in the middle. The strange rock formations of Phu Hin Rong Kla and fields where the Siam tulip flower (Curcuma alismatifolia), known as dok krachiao (‡∏î‡∏≠‡∏Å‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∞‡πÄ‡∏à‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏ß) in Thai, grows wild are some of the characteristics of the Phetchabun Mountains. Geography The mountain system as a whole is named after the city of Phetchabun which lies within the mountainous area. To the south and southeast lie the Dong Phaya Yen Mountains. Both sections of the Phetchabun massif are parallel and of a similar length, extending in a roughly north-south direction. The western range is a prolongation of the southern end of the Luang Prabang Range. The eastern range separates the broad Chao Phraya river basin of central Thailand from the Khorat Plateau of Isan. The northward- flowing Loei River, a tributary of the Mekong, has its sources in the eastern range. The southern limit of the Phetchabun massif is not clearly defined, roughly beginning south of the 16th parallel north where both ranges become a group of scattered mountains of lesser height, rarely surpassing 800 m, extending southwards. The eastern mountain chain is mentioned as the Phang Hoei Range in some geographical works,Britannica Khorat Plateau a name that encompasses the whole northern section of the Dong Phaya Yen mountain system, for Khao Phang Hoei is a 1,008 m high summit west of Chaiyaphum town, beyond the southern end of the Phetchabun Range proper in the northern Dong Phaya Yen.

Geologically, the mountains consist of limestone, interfused with slate and sandstone. A few igneous rocks are also found: granite, basalt and porphyry. History Historically the long mountainous system of the Phetchabun-Dong Phaya Yen- Sankamphaeng formed a barrier between Isan and the Central Plain. Until recently few roads crossed the system. During the period between 1968-1982 the area around 1,143 m high Khao Kho (‡πÄ‡∏Ç‡∏≤‡∏Ñ‡πâ‡∏≠) and Phu Hin Rong Kla became an occasional battleground.Phu Hin Rong Kla, bizarre rock formations and montane forest At that time insurgents of the Communist Party of Thailand established their base in hidden mountain locations and fought skirmishes against the Thai Army.

Geography Located about east of the city centre, Herttoniemi can be reached by the Helsinki Metro in 10 minutes, or by road via the It√§v√§yl√§ arterial road (Finnish regional road no. 170) running from the inner city area through the eastern suburbs. Herttoniemi comprises four distinct areas: *L√§nsi-Herttoniemi (West Herttoniemi) *Roihuvuori, formerly It√§-Herttoniemi (East Herttoniemi) *Herttoniemenranta (Herttoniemi Harbour) *Herttoniemi industrial area History Map of Herttoniemi. Part of a larger map by Kalmberg from 1855 Herttoniemi has been inhabited for a long time. One of Helsinki's bronze age graves has been found near the Herttoniemi metro station. Some Finnish place names have also survived in Herttoniemi, which testify that Tavastians have used the area and inhabited it before Swedes colonized Uusimaa. In the light of place names, a permanent settlement by Tavastians occurred possibly as early as the 12th century. The village of Herttoniemi was one of the oldest in the Helsinge Parish. The Herttoniemi manor is the oldest in eastern Helsinki, and it belonged to the J√§gerhorn family already in the 16th century. When Count Augustin Ehrensv√§rd bought the estate in 1752, the lands of the manor extended to Puotila in the east and to Viikki and Malmi in the north. The area of Myllypuro also belonged to the lands owned by Ehrensv√§rd. Later, the manor and its lands belonged to Carl Olof Cronstedt, a famous hero of the Battle of Svensksund and the last commandant of Viapori during the Swedish reign. In addition to the Herttoniemi manor, the Str√∂ms manor is also located in this area. The last owner of the Herttoniemi manor, Councillor of agriculture John Bergbom began to rent out plots of the manor lands in 1880 to people who would build villas in the area. The leases were made for 50 years. There would eventually be 70 of such villas in the area. The area of the villas extended from Herttoniemenranta all the way to Fastholma. The villas were inhabited by members of the nobility, by factory owners, businessmen and politicians. The arrived here by steam boats from the city. The travelling time was around 20 minutes. The villas of the wealthy people were in the southern part of the area, but in the north, in the Fastholma area, the villas were inhabited by people of the working class. The latter sometimes had cows in their yards. The area formed a densely populated community in 1917, although already the year before, that is, in 1916, Bergbom sold the area to a company which was supposed to build a private port and an industrial area in the lands it had acquired. The process of buying back of the villas now began. However, the lands were acquired by the city of Helsinki in 1919, and the developmet of the community was halted, and no bylaws were written for the community. Almost 30 of the villas were now acquired by the city. They were rented out to clerks of the city, although some were also rented out for year-round use, and some to associations. The beginning of the end began in the 1930s, when the city began to build an oil terminal in Herttoniemi and a railway line to link it with the existing railway system of the country. The terminal and industrial areas were to have a street network and plans for construction were adopted, for the terminal in 1936 and for the industrial area in 1943. Also a highway was built across the area, where It√§v√§yl√§ now is located. At that time, some of the villas were torn down, although the biggest changes were to take place only after the war. By 2020, only one of villas has survived, and many villas seem to have disappeared without even photographs existing of them, says second hand book seller, historian and writer Jan Strang, who is planning to write a book of the villas. Herttoniemi was annexed to Helsinki in the Great annexation of Helsinki in 1946. The construction of new neighbourhoods was begun in the annexed areas, Herttoniemi being the first and biggest of these neighbourhoods. Myllypuro was originally part of Herttoniemi, but it was assigned to Vartiokyl√§, instead, in 1959.Terho et al., p. 207. The harbour and the oil depot in Herttoniemi were demolished in the 1990s and redeveloped into a residential area and marina called Herttoniemenranta. Some fortifications of Krepost Sveaborg can be found in Herttoniemi, dating to World War I. Famous residents *Swedish military architect Augustin Ehrensv√§rd whose life's work was building the fortress of Sveaborg owned the Herttoniemi manor in the area. *Another famous owner of Herttoniemi manor was admiral Carl Olof Cronstedt, who had the existing building built and lived in the manor the last years of his life.

It involves landing on a runway and taking off again without coming to a full stop. Usually the pilot then circles the airport in a defined pattern known as a circuit and repeats the maneuver. This allows many landings to be practiced in a short time.Teaching Touch And Goes (sic) If the pilot brings the aircraft to a full stop before taking off again then it is known as \\"stop-and-go\\". If the aircraft's wheels do not touch the ground it is known as a go-around or low pass. Touch-and-go landings can perform a crucial safety role when a plane lands with not enough space to come to a complete stop, but has enough space to accelerate and take off again. In British parlance, the maneuver is often called circuits and bumps. Standard procedure In a normal landing, the pilot flies the traffic pattern and establishes the aircraft on final approach. As the aircraft crosses the threshold of the runway the pilot executes the landing flare, touches the aircraft down, and immediately retracts the flaps and applies braking until the aircraft has decelerated enough to exit onto a taxiway. In a touch-and-go landing, after the wheels are down, the pilot does not apply the brakes but instead increases the engine power to full and only partially retracts the flaps, accelerates back to rotation speed, and lifts off again. At a towered airport, the pilot must receive ATC permission to perform a touch-and-go landing by requesting it by name or as \\"the option,\\" which allows the pilot to perform a touch-and-go, stop-and-go, low approach, full-stop landing or go-around as desired. At a non-towered airport, the pilot announces position and intent over the CTAF or UNICOM radio frequency to coordinate the flow of local air traffic with any other pilots. Debate over role in flight instruction Some flight instructors believe touch-and-gos should not be heavily used, if at all, with student pilots. They argue that this procedure results in less attention to learning to land properly, and thus creates safety problems. They note that neither the Federal Aviation Administration's Practical Test Standards nor its Airplane Flying Handbook discusses touch-and-gos. Instructors who favor the use of touch-and-gos contend that it makes it possible to practice more landings per hour of instruction. Students doing touch-and-gos find it easier to master landing, particularly the final stage known as landing flare, which is often difficult to learn. Preparing to take off while landing is a necessary safety skill, they add, because any pilot must be able to do it in order to reject a landing. Commercial aviation As a result of the Australian government's Two Airlines Policy, airlines other than Ansett Australia and Trans Australia Airlines were not permitted to operate routes directly between major cities. To circumvent this policy, East-West Airlines would perform touch-and-go landings in smaller cities along the way. For instance, East-West's Melbourne to Sydney route included a touch-and-go landing at Albury Airport, on the border of New South Wales and Victoria.TBT (Throwback Thursday) in Aviation History: East-West Airlines, Airline Geeks, 20 April 2016. Retrieved 11 August 2018. Carrier aviation Super √âtendard commencing a touch-and-go landing on during Gringo-Gaucho joint US-Argentine manoeuvres. In the United States Navy, touch-and-go landings are part of training for carrier pilots.

It won the 1975 US National Book Award in category Philosophy and Religion, has been translated into 11 languages, and was named one of the \\"100 most influential books since the war\\" (1945‚Äì1995) by the UK Times Literary Supplement. In opposition to A Theory of Justice (1971) by John Rawls, and in debate with Michael Walzer,The United States in the World ‚Äì Just Wars and Just Societies: An Interview with Michael Walzer, in Imprints, Volume 7, Number 1, 2003 Nozick argues in favor of a minimal state, \\"limited to the narrow functions of protection against force, theft, fraud, enforcement of contracts, and so on.\\" When a state takes on more responsibilities than these, Nozick argues, rights will be violated. To support the idea of the minimal state, Nozick presents an argument that illustrates how the minimalist state arises naturally from anarchy and how any expansion of state power past this minimalist threshold is unjustified. Summary Nozick's entitlement theory, which sees humans as ends in themselves and justifies redistribution of goods only on condition of consent, is a key aspect of Anarchy, State, and Utopia. It is influenced by John Locke, Immanuel Kant, and Friedrich Hayek. The book also contains a vigorous defense of minarchist libertarianism against more extreme views, such as anarcho-capitalism (in which there is no state and individuals must contract with private companies for all social services). Nozick argues that anarcho-capitalism would inevitably transform into a minarchist state, even without violating any of its own non-aggression principles, through the eventual emergence of a single locally dominant private defense and judicial agency that it is in everyone's interests to align with, because other agencies are unable to effectively compete against the advantages of the agency with majority coverage. Therefore, even to the extent that the anarcho-capitalist theory is correct, it results in a single, private, protective agency which is itself a de facto \\"state\\". Thus anarcho- capitalism may only exist for a limited period before a minimalist state emerges. =Philosophical activity= The preface of Anarchy, State, and Utopia contains a passage about \\"the usual manner of presenting philosophical work\\"‚Äîi.e., its presentation as though it were the absolutely final word on its subject. Nozick believes that philosophers are really more modest than that and aware of their works' weaknesses. Yet a form of philosophical activity persists which \\"feels like pushing and shoving things to fit into some fixed perimeter of specified shape.\\" The bulges are masked or the cause of the bulge is thrown far away so that no one will notice. Then \\"Quickly, you find an angle from which everything appears to fit perfectly and take a snapshot, at a fast shutter speed before something else bulges out too noticeably.\\" After a trip to the darkroom for touching up, \\"[a]ll that remains is to publish the photograph as a representation of exactly how things are, and to note how nothing fits properly into any other shape.\\" So how does Nozick's work differ from this form of activity? He believed that what he said was correct, but he doesn't mask the bulges: \\"the doubts and worries and uncertainties as well as the beliefs, convictions, and arguments.\\" =Why state-of-nature theory?= In this chapter Nozick tries to explain why investigating a Lockean state of nature is useful in order to understand whether there should be a state in the first place. If one can show that an anarchic society is worse than one that has a state we should choose the second as the less bad alternative. To convincingly compare the two, he argues, one should focus not on an extremely pessimistic nor on an extremely optimistic view of that society. Instead, one should: Nozick's plan is to first describe the morally permissible and impermissible actions in such a non-political society and how violations of those constraints by some individuals would lead to the emergence of a state. If that would happen, it would explain the appearance even if no state actually developed in that particular way. He gestures towards perhaps the biggest bulge when he notes (in Chapter 1, \\"Why State-of-Nature Theory?\\") the shallowness of his \\"invisible hand\\" explanation of the minimal state, deriving it from a Lockean state of nature, in which there are individual rights but no state to enforce and adjudicate them. Although this counts for him as a \\"fundamental explanation\\" of the political realm because the political is explained in terms of the nonpolitical, it is shallow relative to his later \\"genealogical\\" ambition (in The Nature of Rationality and especially in Invariances) to explain both the political and the moral by reference to beneficial cooperative practices that can be traced back to our hunter-gatherer ancestors and beyond. The genealogy will give Nozick an explanation of what is only assumed in Anarchy, State, and Utopia: the fundamental status of individual rights. Creativity was not a factor in his interpretation. =The state of nature= Nozick starts this chapter by summarizing some of the features of the Lockean state of nature. An important one is that every individual has a right to exact compensation by himself whenever another individual violates his rights. Punishing the offender is also acceptable, but only inasmuch as he (or others) will be prevented from doing that again. As Locke himself acknowledges, this raises several problems, and Nozick is going to try to see to what extent can they be solved by voluntary arrangements. A rational response to the \\"troubles\\" of a Lockean state of nature is the establishment of mutual-protection associations, in which all will answer the call of any member. It is inconvenient that everyone is always on call, and that the associates can be called out by members who may be \\"cantankerous or paranoid\\". Another important inconvenience takes place when two members of the same association have a dispute. Although there are simple rules that could solve this problem (for instance, a policy of non intervention) most people will prefer associations that try to build systems to decide whose claims are correct. In any case, the problem of everybody being on call dictates that some entrepreneurs will go into the business of selling protective services (division of labor). This will lead (\\"through market pressures, economies of scale, and rational self interest\\") to either people joining the strongest association in a given area or that some associations will have similar power and hence will avoid the costs of fighting by agreeing to a third party that would act as a judge or court to solve the disputes. But for all practical purposes, this second case is equivalent to having just one protective association. And this is something \\"very much resembling a minimal state\\". Nozick judges that Locke was wrong to imagine a social contract as necessary to establish civil society and money. He prefers invisible-hand explanations, that is to say, that voluntary agreements between individuals create far reaching patterns that look like they were designed when in fact nobody did. These explanations are useful in the sense that they \\"minimize the use of notions constituting the phenomena to be explained\\". So far he has shown that such \\"invisible hand\\" would lead to a dominant association, but individuals may still justly enforce their own rights. But this protective agency isn't yet a state. At the end of the chapter Nozick points out some of the problems of defining what a state is, but he says: The protective agencies so far don't make any such announcement. Furthermore, it doesn't offer the same degree of protection to all its clients (who may purchase different degrees of coverage) and the individuals who don't purchase the service (the \\"independents\\") don't get any protection at all (spillover effects aside). This goes against our experience with states, where even tourists typically receive protection. Therefore, the dominant protective agency lacks the monopoly on the use of force and fails to protect all people inside its territory. =Moral constraints and the state= Nozick arrives at the night-watchman state of classical liberalism theory by showing that there are non-redistributive reasons for the apparently redistributive procedure of making its clients pay for the protection of others. He defines what he calls an ultraminimal state, which would not have this seemingly redistributive feature but would be the only one allowed to enforce rights. Proponents of this ultraminimal state don't defend it on the grounds of trying to minimize the total of (weighted) violations of rights (what he calls utilitarianism of rights). That idea would mean, for example, that someone could punish another person he or she knows to be innocent in order to calm down a mob that would otherwise violate even more rights. This is not the philosophy behind the ultraminimal state. Instead, its proponents hold its members' rights are a side-constraint on what can be done to them. This side-constraint view reflects the underlying Kantian principle that individuals are ends and not merely means, so the rights of one individual cannot be violated to avoid violations of the rights of other people. Which principle should we choose, then? Nozick won't try to prove which one is better. Instead, he gives some reasons to prefer the kantian view and later points to problems with classic utilitarianism. The first reason he gives in favor of the Kantian principle is that the analogy between the individual case (in which we choose to sacrifice now for a greater benefit later) and the social case (in which we sacrifice the interests of one individual for the greater social good) is incorrect: A second reason focuses on the non-aggression principle. Are we prepared to dismiss this principle? That is, can we accept that some individuals may harm some innocent in certain cases? (This non-aggression principle does not include, of course, self- defense and perhaps some other special cases he points out). He then goes on to expose some problems with utilitarianism by discussing whether animals should be taken into account in the utilitarian calculation of happiness, if that depends on the kind of animal, if killing them painlessly would be acceptable, and so on. He believes that utilitarianism is not appropriate even with animals. But Nozick's most famous argument for the side-constraint view against classical utilitarianism and the idea that only felt experience matters is his Experience Machine thought experiment. It induces whatever illusory experience one might wish, but it prevents the subject from doing anything or making contact with anything. There is only pre-programmed neural stimulation sufficient for the illusion. Nozick pumps the intuition that each of us has a reason to avoid plugging into the Experience Machine forever. This is not to say that \\"plugging in\\" might not be the best all-things-considered choice for some who are terminally ill and in great pain. The point of the thought experiment is to articulate a weighty reason not to plug in, a reason that should not be there if all that matters is felt experience.\\"[...] we need merely to note the intricacy of the question of what matters for people other than their experiences\\" =Prohibition, compensation, and risk= The procedure that leads to a night-watchman state involves compensation to non- members who are prevented from enforcing their rights, an enforcement mechanism that it deems risky by comparison with its own. Compensation addresses any disadvantages non-members suffer as a result of being unable to enforce their rights. Assuming that non-members take reasonable precautions and adjusting activities to the association's prohibition of their enforcing their own rights, the association is required to raise the non-member above his actual position by an amount equal to the difference between his position on an indifference curve he would occupy were it not for the prohibition, and his original position. The purpose of this comparatively dense chapter is to deduce what Nozick calls the Compensation Principle. That idea is going to be key for the next chapter, where he shows how (without any violation of rights) an ultraminimal state (one that has a monopoly of enforcement of rights) can become a minimal state (which also provides protection to all individuals). Since this would involve some people paying for the protection of others, or some people being forced to pay for protection, the main element of the discussion is whether these kinds of actions can be justified from a natural rights perspective. Hence the development of a theory of compensation in this chapter. He starts by asking broadly what if someone \\"crosses a boundary\\" (for instance, physical harm). If this is done with the consent of the individual concerned, no problem arises. Unlike Locke, Nozick doesn't have a \\"paternalistic\\" view of the matter. He believes anyone can do anything to himself, or allow others to do the same things to him. But what if B crosses A's boundaries without consent? Is that okay if A is compensated? What Nozick understands by compensation is anything that makes A indifferent (that is, A has to be just as good in his own judgement before the transgression and after the compensation) provided that A has taken reasonable precautions to avoid the situation. He argues that compensation isn't enough, because some people will violate these boundaries, for example, without revealing his identity. Therefore, some extra cost has to be imposed on those who violate someone else's rights. (For the sake of simplicity this discussion on deterrence is summarized in another section of this article). After discussing the issue of punishment and concluding that not all violations of rights will be deterred under a retributive theory of justice (which he favors)\\"Constructing counterexamples to this bizarre view [the utilitarian deterrence theorist's] is left as an exercise for the reader\\", Nozicks returns to compensation. Again, why don't we allow anyone to do anything provided he or she gives full compensation afterwards? There are several problems with that view. Firstly, if some person gets a big gain by violating another's rights and he then compensates the victim up to the point where he or she is indifferent, the infractor is getting all the benefits that this provides.See \\"Dividing the benefits of exchange\\" But one could argue that it would be fair for the felon to give some compensation beyond that, just like in the marketplace, where the buyer doesn't necessarily just pay up to the point where the seller is indifferent from selling or not selling. There is usually room for negotiation, which raises the question of fairness. Every attempt to make a theory of a fair price in the marketplace has failed, and Nozick prefers not to try to solve the issue. Instead, he says that, whenever possible, those negotiations should take place, so that the compensation is decided by the people involved. But when one cannot negotiate, it is unclear whether all acts should be accepted if compensation is paid. Secondly, allowing anything if compensation is paid makes all people fearful. Imagine that someone could break your arm at any point and then pay you a compensation. The other people would fear the same happening to them. This raises important problems: * Making the assaulters pay not only for the damage but also for the fear that the assaulted had before that won't do, as the assaulter is not the only responsible of that fear.\\"[...] a victim's fear is not caused by the person who assaulted\\" * If that was the way to compensate, non assaulted people would be left uncompensated for the fear they have.\\"And who will compensate the other apprehensive persons [...]?\\" * One cannot compensate anyone for fear after the fact because we remember the fear we had as less important than it actually was. Because of that, what should be calculated instead is what Nozick calls \\"Market Compensation\\", which is the compensation that would be agreed upon if the negotiations took place before the fact. But this is impossible, according to Nozick. The conclusion of these difficulties, particularly the last one, is that anything that produces general fear may be prohibited. Another reason to prohibit is that it would imply using people as a means, which violates the kantian principle that he defended earlier. But if so, what about prohibiting all boundary crossing that isn't consented in advance? That would solve the fear problem, but it would be way too restrictive, since people may cross some boundaries by accident, unintentional acts, etc.) and the costs of getting that consent may be too high (for instance if the known victim is on a trip in the jungle). What then? \\"The most efficient policy forgoes the fewest net beneficial acts; it allows anyone to perform an unfeared action without prior agreement, provided the transaction costs of reaching a prior agreement are greater, even by a bit, than the costs of the posterior compensation process.\\" Note that a particular action may not cause fear if it has a low probability of causing harm. But when all the risky activities are added up, the probability of being harmed may be high. This poses the problem that prohibiting all such activities (which may be very varied) is too restrictive. The obvious response, that is, establishing a threshold value V such that there is a violation of rights if p \\\\cdot H \\\\geq V\\"[...] an action violates someone's rights if its expected harm to him (that is, the probability of harm to him multiplied by a measure of that harm) is greater than, or equal to, the specified value\\" (where p is the probability of harming and H is the amount of harm that could be done) won't fit a natural-rights position. In his own words: Granted, some insurance solutions will work in these cases and he discusses some. But what do you do with people who don't have the means to buy insurance or compensate other people for the risks of his actions? Do you forbid them to do it? (This is going to have important consequences in the next chapter, see next section). So Nozick's conclusion is to prohibit specially dangerous actions that are generally done and compensating the specially disadvantaged individual from the prohibition. This is what he calls the Principle of Compensation. For example, it is allowed to forbid epileptics from driving, but only if they are compensated exactly for the costs that the disadvantaged has to assume (chauffeurs, taxis). This would only take place if the benefit from the increased security outweighs these costs. But this is not a negotiation. The analogy he gives is blackmail: it isn't right to pay a person or group to prevent him from doing something that otherwise would give him no benefit whatsoever. Nozick considers such transactions as \\"unproductive activities\\". Similarly, (it should be deduced) it is not right for the epileptic to negotiate a payment for not doing something risky to other people. However, Nozick does point to some problems with this principle. Firstly, he says that the action has to be \\"generally done\\". The intention behind that qualification is that eccentric and dangerous activities shouldn't be compensated.\\"This principle is meant to cover forbidding the epileptic to drive while excluding the cases of involuntary Russian roulette and the special manufacturing process\\". His extreme example is someone who has fun playing Russian roulette with the head of others without asking them. Such action must be prohibited, with no qualifications. But one can define anything as a \\"generally done\\" action.\\"This possibility of diverse descriptions of actions prevents easy application of the principle as stated\\" The Russian roulette could be considered \\"having fun\\" and hence be compensated.\\"Playing Russian roulette is a more dangerous way of \\"having fun\\", which others are allowed to do [...] almost any two actions can be construed as the same or different [...].\\" Secondly, if the special and dangerous action is the only way a person can do something important to him (for instance, if it is the only way one can have fun or support himself) then perhaps it should be compensated. Thirdly, more generally, he recognizes he doesn't have a theory of disadvantage, so it is unclear what counts as a \\"special disadvantage\\". This has to be further developed, because in the state of nature there is no authority to decide how to define these terms (see the discussion of a similar issue in p. 89). =The state= An independent might be prohibited from using his methods of privately enforcing justice if: * His method is too risky (‚Äúperhaps he consults tea leaves‚Äù) * He uses a method of unknown riskiness. Nevertheless, an independent may be using a method that doesn‚Äôt impose a high risk on others but, if similar procedures are used by many others the total risk may go beyond an acceptable threshold. In that case it is impossible to decide who should stop doing it, since nobody is personally responsible and therefore nobody has a right to stop him. Independents may get together to decide these questions, but even if they agree to a mechanism to keep the total risk below the threshold, each individual will have an incentive to get out of the deal. This procedure fails because of the rationality of being a free rider on such grouping, taking advantage of everyone else's restraint and going ahead with one's own risky activities. In a famous discussion he rejects H. L. A. Hart's \\"principle of fairness\\" for dealing with free riders, which would morally bind them to cooperative practices from which they benefit. One may not charge and collect for benefits one bestows without prior agreement. But Nozick refutes this. If the principle of fairness doesn‚Äôt work, how should we decide this? Natural law tradition doesn‚Äôt help much in clarifying what procedural rights we have. Nozick assumes that we all have a right to know that we are being applied a fair and reliable method for deciding if we are guilty. If this information isn‚Äôt available publicly, we have a right to resist. We may also do it if we find this procedure unreliable or unfair after considering the information given. We may not even participate in the process, even if it would be advisable to do so. The application of these rights may be delegated to the protective agency, which will prevent others from applying methods of which it finds unacceptable in terms of reliability or fairness. Presumably, it would publish a list of accepted methods. Anyone who violates this prohibition will be punished. Every individual has a right to do this, and other companies could try to enter the business, but the dominant protective agency is the only one that has the power to actually carry out this prohibition. It is the only one that can guarantee its clients that no unaccepted procedure will be applied to them. But there is another important difference: the protective agency, in doing this, can put some independents in a situation of disadvantage. Specifically, those independents who use a prohibited method and can‚Äôt afford its services without great effort (or are even too poor to pay no matter what). These people will be at the expense of paying clients of the agency. In the previous chapter we saw that it was necessary to compensate others for the disadvantages imposed on them. We also saw that this compensation would amount only to the extra cost imposed to the disadvantaged beyond the costs that he would otherwise incur (in this case, the costs of the risky/unknown procedure he would want to apply). Nevertheless, it would amount to even the full price of a simple protection policy if the independent is unable to pay for it after the compensation for the disadvantages. Also, the protective services that count here are strictly against paying clients, because these are the ones against whom the independent was defenceless in the first place. But wouldn‚Äôt this compensation mechanism generate another free riding problem? Nozick says that not much, because the compensation is only ‚Äúthe amount that would equal the cost of an unfancy policy when added to the sum of the monetary costs of self-help protection plus whatever amount the person comfortably could pay‚Äù. Also, as we just said, it is an unfancy policy that protects only against paying clients, not against compensated clients and other independents. Therefore, the more free riders there are, the more important it becomes to buy a full protection policy. We can see that what we now have resembles a state. In chapter 3 Nozick argued that two necessary conditions to be fulfilled by an organization to be a state were: # Monopoly of the use of force. # Universal protection. The protective agency resembles a state in these two conditions. Firstly, it is a de facto monopoly due to the competitive advantage mentioned earlier. It doesn‚Äôt have any special right to be it, it just is. Secondly, most of the people are its clients. There may be independents, however, who apply procedures it approves of. Also, there might still be independents who apply methods that it disapproves of to other independents with unreliable procedures. These conditions are important because they are the basis for the ‚Äúindividualist anarchist‚Äù to claim that every state is necessarily illegitimate. This part of the book is a refutation of that claim, showing that some states could be formed by a series of legitimate steps. The de facto monopoly has arisen by morally permissible steps and the universal protection, isn‚Äôt really redistributive because the people who are given money or protective services at a discount had a right to this as a compensation for the disadvantages forced upon them. Therefore, the state isn‚Äôt violating anybody‚Äôs rights. Note that this isn‚Äôt a state as we usually understand it. It is presumably organized more like a company and, more importantly, there still exist independents. But, as Nozick says: He does recognize, however, that this entity doesn‚Äôt fit perfectly in the Weberian tradition of the definition of the state. It isn‚Äôt ‚Äúthe sole authorizer of violence‚Äù, since some independents may conduct violence to one another without intervention. But it is the sole effective judge over the permissibility of violence. Therefore, he concludes, this may be also called a ‚Äústatelike entity‚Äù Finally, Nozick warns us that the step from being just a de facto monopoly (the ultraminimal state) to becoming this ‚Äústatelike entity‚Äù that compensates some independents (the minimal state) isn‚Äôt a necessary one. Compensating is a moral obligation. But this doesn‚Äôt invalidate Nozick‚Äôs response to the individualist anarchist and it remains an invisible hand explanation: after all, to give universal protection the agency doesn‚Äôt need to have any plan to become a state. It just happens if it decides to give the protection it owes. =Further considerations on the argument for the state= A discussion of pre-emptive attack leads Nozick to a principle that excludes prohibiting actions not wrong in themselves, even if those actions make more likely the commission of wrongs later on. This provides him with a significant difference between a protection agency's prohibitions against procedures it deems unreliable or unfair, and other prohibitions that might seem to go too far, such as forbidding others to join another protective agency. Nozick's principle does not disallow others from doing so. =Distributive justice= Nozick's discussion of Rawls's theory of justice raised a prominent dialogue between libertarianism and liberalism. He sketches an entitlement theory, which states, \\"From each as they choose, to each as they are chosen\\". It comprises a theory of (1) justice in acquisition; (2) justice in rectification if (1) is violated (rectification which might require apparently redistributive measures); (3) justice in holdings, and (4) justice in transfer. Assuming justice in acquisition, entitlement to holdings is a function of repeated applications of (3) and (4). Nozick's entitlement theory is a non-patterned historical principle. Almost all other principles of distributive justice (egalitarianism, utilitarianism) are patterned principles of justice. Such principles follow the form, \\"to each according to...\\" Nozick's famous Wilt Chamberlain argument is an attempt to show that patterned principles of just distribution are incompatible with liberty. He asks us to assume that the original distribution in society, D1, is ordered by our choice of patterned principle, for instance Rawls's Difference Principle. Wilt Chamberlain is an extremely popular basketball player in this society, and Nozick further assumes 1 million people are willing to freely give Chamberlain 25 cents each to watch him play basketball over the course of a season (we assume no other transactions occur). Chamberlain now has $250,000, a much larger sum than any of the other people in the society. This new distribution in society, call it D2, obviously is no longer ordered by our favored pattern that ordered D1. However Nozick argues that D2 is just. For if each agent freely exchanges some of his D1 share with the basketball player and D1 was a just distribution (we know D1 was just, because it was ordered according to the favored patterned principle of distribution), how can D2 fail to be a just distribution? Thus Nozick argues that what the Wilt Chamberlain example shows is that no patterned principle of just distribution will be compatible with liberty. In order to preserve the pattern, which arranged D1, the state will have to continually interfere with people's ability to freely exchange their D1 shares, for any exchange of D1 shares explicitly involves violating the pattern that originally ordered it. Nozick analogizes taxation with forced labor, asking the reader to imagine a man who works longer to gain income to buy a movie ticket and a man who spends his extra time on leisure (for instance, watching the sunset). What, Nozick asks, is the difference between seizing the second man's leisure (which would be forced labor) and seizing the first man's goods? \\"Perhaps there is no difference in principle,\\" Nozick concludes, and notes that the argument could be extended to taxation on other sources besides labor. \\"End-state and most patterned principles of distributive justice institute (partial) ownership by others of people and their actions and labor. These principles involve a shift from the classical liberals' notion of self ownership to a notion of (partial) property rights in other people.\\" Nozick then briefly considers Locke's theory of acquisition. After considering some preliminary objections, he \\"adds an additional bit of complexity\\" to the structure of the entitlement theory by refining Locke's proviso that \\"enough and as good\\" must be left in common for others by one's taking property in an unowned object. Nozick favors a \\"Lockean\\" proviso that forbids appropriation when the position of others is thereby worsened. For instance, appropriating the only water hole in a desert and charging monopoly prices would not be legitimate. But in line with his endorsement of the historical principle, this argument does not apply to the medical researcher who discovers a cure for a disease and sells for whatever price he will. Nor does Nozick provide any means or theory whereby abuses of appropriation‚Äîacquisition of property when there is not enough and as good in common for others‚Äîshould be corrected. =The Difference Principle= Nozick attacks John Rawls's Difference Principle on the ground that the well-off could threaten a lack of social cooperation to the worse-off, just as Rawls implies that the worse-off will be assisted by the well-off for the sake of social cooperation. Nozick asks why the well-off would be obliged, due to their inequality and for the sake of social cooperation, to assist the worse- off and not have the worse-off accept the inequality and benefit the well-off. Furthermore, Rawls's idea regarding morally arbitrary natural endowments comes under fire; Nozick argues that natural advantages that the well-off enjoy do not violate anyone's rights and that, therefore, the well-off have a right to them. He also states that Rawls's proposal that inequalities be geared toward assisting the worse-off is morally arbitrary in itself. =Original position= Nozick's opinions on historical entitlement ensures that he naturally rejects the Original Position since he argues that in the Original Position individuals will use an end-state principle to determine the outcome, whilst he explicitly states the importance of the historicity of any such decisions (for example punishments and penalties will require historical information). =Equality, envy, and exploitation= Nozick presses \\"the major objection\\" to theories that bestow and enforce positive rights to various things such as equality of opportunity, life, and so on. \\"These 'rights' require a substructure of things and materials and actions,\\" he writes, \\"and 'other' people may have rights and entitlements over these.\\" Nozick concludes that \\"Marxian exploitation is the exploitation of people's lack of understanding of economics.\\" =Demoktesis= Demoktesis is a thought- experiment designed to show the incompatibility of democracy with libertarianism in general and the entitlement theory specifically. People desirous of more money might \\"hit upon the idea of incorporating themselves, raising money by selling shares in themselves.\\" They would partition such rights as which occupation one would have. Though perhaps no one sells himself into utter slavery, there arises through voluntary exchanges a \\"very extensive domination\\" of some person by others. This intolerable situation is avoided by writing new terms of incorporation that for any stock no one already owning more than a certain number of shares may purchase it. As the process goes on, everyone sells off rights in themselves, \\"keeping one share in each right as their own, so they can attend stockholders' meetings if they wish.\\" The inconvenience of attending such meetings leads to a special occupation of stockholders' representative. There is a great dispersal of shares such that almost everybody is deciding about everybody else. The system is still unwieldy, so a \\"great consolidational convention\\" is convened for buying and selling shares, and after a \\"hectic three days (lo and behold!)\\" each person owns exactly one share in each right over every other person, including himself. So now there can be just one meeting in which everything is decided for everybody. Attendance is too great and it's boring, so it is decided that only those entitled to cast at least 100,000 votes may attend the grand stockholders' meeting. And so on. Their social theorists call the system demoktesis (from Greek Œ¥·øÜŒºŒøœÇ demos, \\"people\\" and Œ∫œÑ·øÜœÉŒπœÇ ktesis, \\"ownership\\"), \\"ownership of the people, by the people, and for the people,\\" and declare it the highest form of social life, one that must not be allowed to perish from the earth. With this \\"eldritch tale\\" we have in fact arrived at a modern democratic state. =A framework for Utopia= The utopia mentioned in the title of Nozick's first book is a meta-utopia, a framework for voluntary migration between utopias tending towards worlds in which everybody benefits from everybody else's presence. This is meant to be the Lockean \\"night- watchman state\\" writ large. The state protects individual rights and makes sure that contracts and other market transactions are voluntary. The meta- utopian framework reveals what is inspiring and noble in this night-watchman function. They both contain the only form of social union that is possible for the atomistic rational agents of Anarchy, State, and Utopia, fully voluntary associations of mutual benefit. The influence of this idea on Nozick's thinking is profound. Even in his last book, Invariances, he is still concerned to give priority to the mutual-benefit aspect of ethics. This coercively enforceable aspect ideally has an empty core in the game theorists' sense: the core of a game is all of those payoff vectors to the group wherein no subgroup can do better for itself acting on its own, without cooperating with others not in the subgroup. The worlds in Nozick's meta-utopia have empty cores. No subgroup of a utopian world is better off to emigrate to its own smaller world. The function of ethics is fundamentally to create and stabilize such empty cores of mutually beneficial cooperation. His view is that we are fortunate to live under conditions that favor \\"more-extensive cores\\", and less conquest, slavery, and pillaging, \\"less imposition of noncore vectors upon subgroups.\\" Higher moral goals are real enough, but they are parasitic (as described in The Examined Life, the chapter \\"Darkness and Light\\") upon mutually beneficial cooperation. In Nozick's utopia if people are not happy with the society they are in they can leave and start their own community, but he fails to consider that there might be things that prevent a person from leaving or moving about freely. Thomas Pogge states that items that are not socially induced can restrict people's options. Nozick states that for the healthy to have to support the handicapped imposes on their freedom, but Pogge argues that it introduces an inequality. This inequality restricts movement based on the ground rules Nozick has implemented, which could lead to feudalism and slavery, a society which Nozick himself would reject. David Schaefer notes that Nozick himself claims that a person could sell himself into slavery, which would break the very ground rule that was created, restricting the movement and choices that a person could make. Other topics covered in the book =Retributive and deterrence theories of punishment= In chapter 4 Nozick discusses two theories of punishment: the deterrence and the retributive ones. To compare them, we have to take into account what is the decision that a potential infractor is facing. His decision may be determined by: G \\\\cdot (1-p)-(C+D+E) \\\\cdot p Where G are the gains from violating the victim's rights, p is the probability of getting caught and (C + D + E) are the costs that the infractor would face if caught. Specifically, C is full compensation to the victim, D are all the emotional costs that the infractor would face if caught (by being apprehended, placed on trial and so on) and E are the financial costs of the processes of apprehension and trial. So if this equation is positive, the potential infractor will have an incentive to violate the potential victim's rights. Here the two theories come into play. On a retributive justice framework, an additional cost R should be imposed to the transgressor that is proportional to the harm done (or intended to be done). Specifically, R = r\\\\cdot H, where r is the degree of responsibility the infractor has and 0 \\\\leq r \\\\leq 1. Therefore, the decision a potential infractor would now face would be: G\\\\cdot (1 - p) - (C+D+E+R) \\\\cdot p But this still won't deter all people. The equation would be positive if G is high enough or, more importantly, if p is low. That is, if it is very unlikely that you will be caught, you may very well choose to do it even if you have to face the new cost R. Therefore, retributive justice theories allow some failures of deterrence. On the other hand, deterrence theories (\\"the penalty for a crime should be the minimal one necessary to deter commission of it\\") don't give enough guidance on how much deterrence should we aim at. If every single possible violation of rights is to be deterred, \\"the penalty will be set unacceptably high\\". The problem here is that the infractor may be punished well beyond the harm done to deter other people. According to Nozick, the utilitarian response to the latest problem would be to raise the penalty until the point where more additional unhappiness would be created than would be saved to those who won't be victimized as a consequence of the additional penalty. But this won't do, according to Nozick, because it raises another problem: should the happiness of the victim have more weight in the calculation than the happiness of the felon? If so, how much? He concludes that the retributive framework is better on grounds of simplicity. Similarly, under the retributive theory, he contends that self-defense is appropriate even if the victim uses more force to defend him or herself. In particular, he proposes that the maximum amount of force that a potential victim can use is: f(H) + r \\\\cdot H ~~~~~(where~~ f(H) \\\\geq H ) And in this case H is the harm that the victim thinks that the other is going to inflict upon him or herself. However, if he uses more force than f(H), that additional force has to be subtracted later from the punishment that the felon gets. =Animal rights and utilitarianism= Nozick discusses in chapter 3 whether animals have rights too or whether they can be used, and if the species of the animal says anything about the extent to which this can be done. He also analyzes the proposal \\"utilitarianism for animals, Kantianism for people\\". Reception Anarchy, State, and Utopia came out of a semester-long course that Nozick taught with Michael Walzer at Harvard in 1971, called Capitalism and Socialism.Interview with E. J. Dionne The course was a debate between the two; Nozick's side is in Anarchy, State, and Utopia, and Walzer's side is in his Spheres of Justice (1983), in which he argues for \\"complex equality\\". Murray Rothbard, an anarcho-capitalist, criticizes Anarchy, State, and Utopia in his essay \\"Robert Nozick and the Immaculate Conception of the State\\" on the basis that: # No existing State has been immaculately conceived, and therefore Nozick, on his own grounds, should advocate anarchism and then wait for his State to develop. # Even if any State had been so conceived, individual rights are inalienable and therefore no existing State could be justified. # A correct theory of contracts is the title-transfer theory which states that the only valid and enforceable contract is one that surrenders what is, in fact, philosophically alienable, and that only specific titles to property are so alienable. Therefore no one can surrender his own will, his body, other persons, or the rights of his posterity. # The risk and compensation principles are both fallacious and result in unlimited despotism. # Compensation, in the theory of punishment, is simply a method of trying to recompense the victim after a crime occurs; it can never justify the initial violation of individual rights. # Nozick‚Äôs theory of ‚Äúnonproductive‚Äù exchanges is invalid since in economic theory all voluntary exchanges are by definition productive, so that the prohibition of \\"nonproductive\\" risky activities and hence the ultra-minimal state falls on this account alone. # Contrary to Nozick, there are no ‚Äúprocedural rights,‚Äù and therefore no way to get from his theory of risk and nonproductive exchange to the compulsory monopoly of the ultra-minimal state. # Nozick‚Äôs minimal state would, on his own grounds, justify a maximal State as well. # The only ‚Äúinvisible hand‚Äù process, on Nozick‚Äôs own terms, would move society from his minimal State back to anarchism. The American legal scholar Arthur Allen Leff criticized Nozick in his 1979 article \\"Unspeakable Ethics, Unnatural Law\\". Leff stated that Nozick built his entire book on the bald assertion that \\"individuals have rights which may not be violated by other individuals\\", for which no justification is offered. According to Leff, no such justification is possible either. Any desired ethical statement, including a negation of Nozick's position, can easily be \\"proved\\" with apparent rigor as long as one takes the licence to simply establish a grounding principle by assertion. Leff further calls \\"ostentatiously unconvincing\\" Nozick's proposal that differences among individuals will not be a problem if like-minded people form geographically isolated communities. Philosopher Jan Narveson described Nozick's book as \\"brilliant\\". Cato Institute fellow Tom G. Palmer writes that Anarchy, State, and Utopia is \\"witty and dazzling\\", and offers a strong criticism of John Rawls's A Theory of Justice. Palmer adds that, > \\"Largely because of his remarks on Rawls and the extraordinary power of his > intellect, Nozick's book was taken quite seriously by academic philosophers > and political theorists, many of whom had not read contemporary libertarian > (or classical liberal) material and considered this to be the only > articulation of libertarianism available. Since Nozick was writing to defend > the limited state and did not justify his starting assumption that > individuals have rights, this led some academics to dismiss libertarianism > as 'without foundations,' in the words of the philosopher Thomas Nagel. When > read in light of the explicit statement of the book's purpose, however, this > criticism is misdirected\\". Libertarian author David Boaz writes that Anarchy, State, and Utopia, together with Rothbard's For a New Liberty (1973) and Ayn Rand's essays on political philosophy, \\"defined the 'hard-core' version of modern libertarianism, which essentially restated Spencer's law of equal freedom: Individuals have the right to do whatever they want to do, so long as they respect the equal rights of others.\\" In the article \\"Social Unity and Primary Goods\\", republished in his Collected Papers (1999), Rawls notes that Nozick handles Sen's liberal paradox in a manner that is similar to his own. However, the rights that Nozick takes to be fundamental and the basis for regarding them to be such are different from the equal basic liberties included in justice as fairness and Rawls conjectures that they are thus not inalienable. In Lectures on the History of Political Philosophy (2007), Rawls notes that Nozick assumes that just transactions are \\"justice preserving\\" in much the same way that logical operations are \\"truth preserving\\". Thus, as explained in Distributive justice above, Nozick holds that repetitive applications of \\"justice in holdings\\" and \\"justice in transfer\\" preserve an initial state of justice obtained through \\"justice in acquisition or rectification\\". Rawls points out that this is simply an assumption or presupposition and requires substantiation. In reality, he maintains, small inequalities established by just transactions accumulate over time and eventually result in large inequalities and an unjust situation.

A senior lecturer in philosophy at Newcastle University, she was known for her work on science, ethics and animal rights. She wrote her first book, Beast And Man (1978), when she was in her fifties, and went on to write over 15 more, including Animals and Why They Matter (1983), Wickedness (1984), The Ethical Primate (1994), Evolution as a Religion (1985), and Science as Salvation (1992). She was awarded honorary doctorates by Durham and Newcastle universities. Her autobiography, The Owl of Minerva, was published in 2005. Midgley strongly opposed reductionism and scientism, and any attempts to make science a substitute for the humanities‚Äîa role for which it is wholly inadequate, she argued. She wrote extensively about what philosophers can learn from nature, particularly from animals. Several of her books and articles discussed philosophical ideas appearing in popular science, including those of Richard Dawkins. She also wrote in favour of a moral interpretation of the Gaia hypothesis. The Guardian described her as a fiercely combative philosopher and the UK's \\"foremost scourge of 'scientific pretension'\\". Early life Midgley was born in London to Lesley and Tom Scrutton. Her father, the son of the eminent judge Sir Thomas Edward Scrutton, was a curate in Dulwich and later chaplain of King's College, Cambridge. She was raised in Cambridge, Greenford and Ealing, and educated at Downe House School in Cold Ash, Berkshire, where she developed her interest in classics and philosophy: King's College chaplain. > [A] new and vigorous Classics teacher offered to teach a few of us Greek, > and that too was somehow slotted into our timetables. We loved this and > worked madly at it, which meant that with considerable efforts on all sides, > it was just possible for us to go to college on Classics ‚Ä¶ I had decided to > read Classics rather than English ‚Äì which was the first choice that occurred > to me ‚Äì because my English teacher, bless her, pointed out that English > literature is something that you read in any case, so it is better to study > something that you otherwise wouldn't. Someone also told me that, if you did > Classics at Oxford, you could do Philosophy as well. I knew very little > about this but, as I had just found Plato, I couldn't resist trying it. Greats at Oxford, going up to Somerville in 1938. She took the Oxford entrance exam in the autumn of 1937, gaining a place at Somerville College. During the year before starting university, it was arranged that she would live in Austria for three months to learn German, but she had to leave after a month because of the worsening political situation. At Somerville she studied Mods and Greats alongside Iris Murdoch, graduating with first-class honours. Several of her lasting friendships that began at Oxford were with scientists, and she credited them with having educated her in a number of scientific disciplines. After a split in the Labour club at Oxford over the Soviet Union's actions, she was on the committee of the newly formed Democratic Socialist Club alongside Tony Crosland and Roy Jenkins. She writes that her career in philosophy may have been affected by women having a greater voice in discussion at the time, because many male undergraduates left after a year to fight in the Second World War: \\"I think myself that this experience has something to do with the fact that Elizabeth [Anscombe] and I and Iris [Murdoch] and Philippa Foot and Mary Warnock have all made our names in philosophy... I do think that in normal times a lot of good female thinking is wasted because it simply doesn't get heard.\\" Career Midgley left Oxford in 1942 and went into the civil service, as \\"the war put graduate work right out of the question\\". Instead, she \\"spent the rest of the war doing various kinds of work that were held to be of national importance\\". During this time she was also a teacher at Downe School and Bedford School. She returned to Oxford in 1947 to do graduate work with Gilbert Murray. She began research on Plotinus's view of the soul, which she has described as \\"so unfashionable and so vast that I never finished my thesis\\". In retrospect Midgley has written of her belief that she is \\"lucky\\" to have missed out in having a doctorate. She argues that one of the main flaws in doctoral training is that, while it \\"shows you how to deal with difficult arguments\\", it does not \\"help you to grasp the big questions that provide its context ‚Äì the background issues out of which the small problems arose.\\" In 1949 Midgley went to Reading University, teaching in the philosophy department there for four terms. In 1950 she married Geoffrey Midgley (died 1997), also a philosopher. They moved to Newcastle, where he got a job in the philosophy department of Newcastle University. Midgley gave up teaching for several years while she had three sons (Tom, David and Martin), before also getting a job in the philosophy department at Newcastle, where she and her husband were both \\"much loved\\". Midgley taught there between 1962 and 1980. During her time at Newcastle, she began studying ethology and this led to her first book, Beast and Man (1978), published when she was 59. \\"I wrote no books until I was a good 50, and I'm jolly glad because I didn't know what I thought before then.\\" Awards Midgley was awarded an honorary D.Litt. by Durham University in 1995 and an honorary Doctor of Civil Law by Newcastle University in 2008. She was an honorary fellow of the Policy, Ethics and Life Sciences Research Centre at Newcastle University. In 2011 she was the first winner of the Philosophy Now Award for Contributions in the Fight Against Stupidity. Death Midgley died at the age of 99 in Jesmond on 10 October 2018. Ideas and arguments =Views on philosophy and religion= Midgley argued that philosophy is like plumbing, something that nobody notices until it goes wrong. \\"Then suddenly we become aware of some bad smells, and we have to take up the floorboards and look at the concepts of even the most ordinary piece of thinking. The great philosophers ... noticed how badly things were going wrong, and made suggestions about how they could be dealt with.\\" Despite her upbringing, she did not embrace Christianity herself, because, she says, \\"I couldn't make it work. I would try to pray and it didn't seem to get me anywhere so I stopped after a while. But I think it's a perfectly sensible world view.\\" She also argues that the world's religions should not simply be ignored: \\"It turns out that the evils which have infested religion are not confined to it, but are ones that can accompany any successful human institution. Nor is it even clear that religion itself is something that the human race either can or should be cured of.\\" Midgley's book Wickedness (1984) has been described as coming \\"closest to addressing a theological theme: the problem of evil.\\" But, Midgley argues that we need to understand the human capacity for wickedness, rather than blaming God for it. Midgley argues that evil arises from aspects of human nature, not from an external force. She further argues that evil is the absence of good, with good being described as the positive virtues such as generosity, courage and kindness. Therefore, evil is the absence of these characteristics, leading to selfishness, cowardice and similar. She therefore criticises existentialism and other schools of thought which promote the 'Rational Will' as a free agent. She also criticises the tendency to demonise those deemed 'wicked', by failing to acknowledge that they also display some measure of some of the virtues. Midgley also expressed her interest in Paul Davies' ideas on the inherent improbability of the order found in the universe. She argued that \\"there's some sort of tendency towards the formation of order\\", including towards life and \\"perceptive life\\". The best way, she argued, of talking about this is using the concept of \\"a life force\\", although she acknowledged that this is \\"vague\\". She also argued that \\"gratitude\\" is an important part of the motivation for theism. \\"You go out on a day like this and you're really grateful. I don't know who to.\\" This understanding also links with Midgley's argument that the concept of Gaia has \\"both a scientific and a religious aspect.\\" She argued that people find this hard to grasp because our views on both science and religion have been narrowed so much that the connections between them are now obscured. This is not, however, about belief in a personal God, but instead about responding to the system of life, as revealed by Gaia, with \\"wonder, awe and gratitude\\" =Gaia and philosophy= Midgley was supportive of James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis. This was part of her \\"principal passion\\" of \\"reviving our reverence for the earth\\". Midgley also described Gaia as a \\"breakthrough\\", as it was \\"the first time a theory derived from scientific measurements has carried with it an implicit moral imperative ‚Äì the need to act in the interests of this living system on which we all depend. In 2001 Midgley founded, along with David Midgley and Tom Wakeford, the Gaia Network, and became its first Chair. Their regular meetings on the implications of Gaia led to the 2007 book Earthy realism edited by Midgley, which sought to bring together the scientific and spiritual aspects of Gaia theory. Midgley's 2001 pamphlet for Demos Gaia: The next big idea argues for the importance of the idea of Gaia as a \\"powerful tool\\" in science, morality, psychology and politics, to gain a more holistic understanding of the world. Instead, Midgley argued that we \\"must learn how to value various aspects of our environment, how to structure social relationships and institutions so that we value social and spiritual life, as well as the natural world, alongside commercial and economic aspects. Her book Science and Poetry, also published in 2001, also includes a discussion on the idea of Gaia, which she argued \\"is not a gratuitous, semi-mystical fantasy\\", but instead is \\"a useful idea, a cure for distortions that spoil our current world-view.\\" It is useful both in finding practical solutions to environmental problems and also in giving us \\"a more realistic view of ourselves\\". Gaia has, Midgely argued, both scientific and moral importance, which also involves politics. There is also a religious angle to Gaia. =On reductionism and materialism= Beast and Man was an examination of human nature and a reaction against the reductionism of sociobiology, and the relativism and behaviorism she saw as prevalent in much of social science. She argued that human beings are more similar to animals than many social scientists then acknowledged, while animals are in many ways more sophisticated than was often accepted. She criticised existentialists who argued that there was no such thing as human nature and writers such as Desmond Morris who she understood as arguing that human nature was \\"brutal and nasty\\". Instead, she argued that human beings and their relationship with animals could be better understood by using the qualitative methods of ethology and comparative psychology, and that this approach showed that \\"we do have a nature and it's much more in the middle.\\" Writing in the 2002 introduction to the reprint of Evolution as a Religion (1985), Midgley reported that she wrote both this book, and the later Science as Salvation (1992) to counter the \\"quasi-scientific speculation\\" of \\"certain remarkable prophetic and metaphysical passages that appeared suddenly in scientific books, often in their last chapters.\\" Evolution as a Religion dealt with the theories of evolutionary biologists, including Dawkins, while Science as Salvation dealt with the theories of physicists and artificial intelligence researchers. Midgley writes that she still believes that these theories, \\"have nothing to do with any reputable theory of evolution,\\" and will not solve the real social and moral problems the world is facing, either through genetic engineering or the use of machines. She concludes: \\"These schemes still seem to me to be just displacement activities proposed in order to avoid facing our real difficulties.\\" \\"[I]n exposing these rhetorical attempts to turn science into a comprehensive ideology,\\" she wrote in The myths we live by, \\"I am not attacking science but defending it against dangerous misconstructions.\\" Midgley argued against reductionism, or the attempt to impose any one approach to understanding the world. She suggests that there are \\"many maps, many windows,\\" arguing that \\"we need scientific pluralism‚Äîthe recognition that there are many independent forms and sources of knowledge‚Äîrather than reductivism, the conviction that one fundamental form underlies them all and settles everything.\\" She writes that it is helpful to think of the world as \\"a huge aquarium. We cannot see it as a whole from above, so we peer in at it through a number of small windows ... We can eventually make quite a lot of sense of this habitat if we patiently put together the data from different angles. But if we insist that our own window is the only one worth looking through, we shall not get very far.\\" She argued that, \\"acknowledging matter as somehow akin to and penetrated by mind is not adding a new ... assumption ... it is becoming aware of something we are doing already.\\" She suggested that \\"this topic is essentially the one which caused Einstein often to remark that the really surprising thing about science is that it works at all ... the simple observation that the laws of thought turn out to be the laws of things.\\"Midgley 1992, p. 14 Midgley wrote her 2014 book, Are you an illusion? as a response to Francis Crick's argument in his book The Astonishing Hypothesis that a person's sense of personal identity and free will is no more than the behaviour of nerve cells. She attacks the understanding inherent in this argument that everything, including a sense of self, can be understood through its physical properties. Instead, she argues that there are different levels of explanation, which need to be studied using different methods. This means that thoughts and memories are an integral part of reality for both humans and animals and need to be studied as such. =Midgley‚ÄìDawkins debate= In volume 53 (1978) of Philosophy, the journal of the Royal Institute of Philosophy, J. L. Mackie published an article entitled The Law of the Jungle: Moral Alternatives and Principles of Evolution, praising Dawkins's The Selfish Gene, and discussing how its ideas might be applied to moral philosophy. Midgley responded in volume 54 (1979) with \\"Gene-Juggling,\\" arguing that The Selfish Gene was about psychological egoism, rather than evolution.Midgley 1979. The paper criticised Dawkins' concepts. Midgley argued that while Dawkins purports to be talking about genes‚Äîthat is, chemical arrangements‚Äîhe nonetheless slides over to saying that \\"we are born selfish\\" (The Selfish Gene, p. 3). She wrote that she had previously \\"not attended to Dawkins, thinking it unnecessary to 'break a butterfly upon a wheel'. But Mr Mackie's article is not the only indication I have lately met of serious attention being paid to his fantasies.\\" In a rejoinder in 1981, Dawkins retorted that the comment was \\"hard to match, in reputable journals, for its patronising condescension toward a fellow academic.\\"Dawkins 1981 He wrote that she \\"raises the art of misunderstanding to dizzy heights. My central point had no connection with what she alleges. I am not even very directly interested in man, or at least not in his emotional nature. My book is about the evolution of life, not the ethics of one particular, rather aberrant, species.\\" In volume 58 (1983), Midgley replied again, in \\"Selfish Genes and Social Darwinism\\": \\"Apology is due, not only for the delay but for the impatient tone of my article. One should not lose one's temper, and doing so always makes for confused argument ... [but my] basic objections remain.\\" The bad feeling between Dawkins and Midgley appeared not to diminish. In a note to page 55 in the 2nd edition of The Selfish Gene (1989), Dawkins refers to her \\"highly intemperate and vicious paper.\\" Midgley continued to criticise Dawkins' ideas. In her books Evolution as a Religion (2002) and The Myths We Live By (2003), she writes about what she sees as his confused use of language‚Äîthe sleight of hand involved in using terms such as \\"selfish\\" in different ways without alerting the reader to the change in meaning‚Äîand some of what she regards as his rhetoric (\\"genes exert ultimate power over behaviour\\"), which she argues is more akin to religion than science. She wrote in a letter to The Guardian in 2005: > [There is] widespread discontent with the neo-Darwinist‚Äîor > Dawkinsist‚Äîorthodoxy that claims something which Darwin himself denied, > namely that natural selection is the sole and exclusive cause of evolution, > making the world therefore, in some important sense, entirely random. This > is itself a strange faith which ought not to be taken for granted as part of > science. In an interview with The Independent in September 2007, she argued that Dawkins' views on evolution are ideologically driven: \\"The ideology Dawkins is selling is the worship of competition. It is projecting a Thatcherite take on economics on to evolution. It's not an impartial scientific view; it's a political drama.\\" In April 2009 Midgley reiterated her critical interpretation of The Selfish Gene as part of a series of articles on Hobbes in The Guardian. In her 2010 book The Solitary Self: Darwin and the Selfish Gene, she argues that \\"simple one-sided accounts of human motives, such as the \\"selfish gene\\" tendency in recent neo-Darwinian thought, may be illuminating but are always unrealistic.\\"The Solitary Self, publisher's description Midgley in art Midgley is referred to in The Lives of Animals (1999), an unusual fictional work by the South African novelist J. M. Coetzee. The book has been likened to a cross between a short story and a philosophical dialogue, as Coetzee's protagonist, Elizabeth Costello, often speaks at length about philosophical ideas. Many reviewers expressed bafflement at the text, which has an enigmatic and riddling style. As one reviewer noted, \\"the reader is not quite sure whether he is intended to spot some confusion or contradiction or non-sequitur in [the protagonist's] arguments.\\" Other critics however have noted many affinities between The Lives of Animals and Midgley's philosophy, and have used Midgley's ideas to make sense of Coetzee's famously confusing work. The main character, who also appears in Coetzee's novel Elizabeth Costello, is concerned with the moral status of animals, a subject Midgley addressed in Animals and Why They Matter, and discusses at length the idea of sympathy as an ethical concept, a subject Midgley wrote about in Beast and Man. Andy Lamey wrote that the result of these and other similarities is that Coetzee's work \\"evoke[s] a particular conception of ethics, one very similar to that of the philosopher Mary Midgley. Such a view affords a central role to sympathy and is fundamentally opposed to a long-standing rival view, most clearly exemplified by the social contract tradition, which prioritizes an instrumental conception of rationality.\\"Lamey 2010, p. 172; for similarities between Midley and Coetzee, see pp. 175‚Äì181 Coetzee and Midgley additionally shared a longstanding fascination with Robinson Crusoe. Coetzee retells the Crusoe story in his novel Foe, while Midgley wrote about Crusoe in her essay \\"Duties Concerning Islands.\\" Midgley's essay argued for the idea that human beings can have ethical obligations to non-human entities such as animals and ecosystems, an idea also found in The Lives of Animals, Foe and many other works by Coetzee.Lamey 2010, p. 175 Midgley agreed to sit for sculptor Jon Edgar in Newcastle during 2006, as part of the Environment Triptych, along with heads of Richard Mabey and James Lovelock.Edgar 2008 This was exhibited at Yorkshire Sculpture Park in 2013.Jon Edgar - Sculpture Series Heads: Terracotta Portraits of Contributors to British Sculpture (2013) Scott, M., Hall, P., and Pheby, H.

Until its demise in 2004, it was one of the oldest operating experimental theater ensembles in the U.S. History The company formed in 1969 as an informal workshop by a group of UW‚ÄìMilwaukee faculty and students. It became a professional company by 1971, touring throughout the United States and to Europe and Japan. It was named for the algebraic symbol x, which means an unknown quantity, thus implying a theater of unlimited possibility. The ensemble was a resident company at the Water Street Art Center in Milwaukee, where they rehearsed, performed and hosted traveling productions from other theater companies. The site soon included an art gallery and small press bookstore that years later became Woodland Pattern Book Center, as well as a grass roots outreach company, Friends Mime Theatre, which evolved into the Milwaukee Public Theatre. Finally, it moved into offices in the Broadway Theater Center in Milwaukee's Historic Third Ward and remained there until its collapse. Much of its early work was created improvisationally as an ensemble, with influences including The Living Theatre and Jerzy Grotowski. The company created over 60 new plays among its 180 productions. In its last two years, Theatre X's board of directors gave then producing director David Ravel and artistic director John Schneider control over play selection and casting, which had previously involved the entire group, and then dissolved the acting company. This move away from an ensemble structure led to a public dispute when the board gave ensemble members John Kishline, Deborah Clifton and Marcie Hoffmann a forced leave of absence from acting in hopes of re-structuring the company, leaving only Schneider and Flora Coker as the remaining founding members. Though litigation was proposed, the lawsuit was dropped after it became too costly. Theatre X continued for 2 seasons but chose to turn off the lights in 2004. Willem Dafoe was an early member of the ensemble and, when he stayed in New York to eventually join the Wooster Group, was replaced by Victor DeLorenzo, who later was one of the founders of Violent Femmes. Delorenzo was later replaced by David Rommel. John Sobczak, Cate Woodruff (then Pamela C. Woodruff) and Wesley Savick were also long-time members of Theatre X. Lory Lazarus, a member of Theatre X in the mid 1970s, went on to become a writer for Cartoon Network's \\"Courage, the Cowardly Dog\\" and a songwriter for \\"Barney & Friends\\" on PBS. Two of Theatre X's founding members, Conrad Bishop and Elizabeth Fuller, went on to form The Independent Eye. Theatre X won a 1978 Obie Award for the set design and lighting design for the New York City production of their original play A Fierce Longing, based on the life of Yukio Mishima.

The original model could print 600 lines of text per minute and could skip blank lines at up to 75 inches per second (190 cm/s), while the model 3 could print at up to 1400 lines per minute. The standard model had 120 print positions. An additional 12 positions were available as an option. A print chain with up to 15 copies of the character set spun horizontally in front of the ribbon and paper. Hammers struck the paper from behind at exactly the right moment to print a character as it went by. In later models, the print chain was replaced by a print train; print slugs instead of being mounted on a chain were placed in a track. IBM 1403 in the \\"Haus zur Geschichte der IBM Datenverarbeitung\\" museum, Sindelfingen, Germany The 1403 chain or train contained 240 characters, however numerous duplications allowed a line to be printed in less than the 0.4 s required for one full rotation. The original standard \\"A\\" chain contained 48 different characters, repeated five times each. A \\"preferred character set\\" variant used in later models printed the same 48 characters, but varied the number of appearances: 10 digits appeared eight times each, 26 upper-case letters appeared four times each, and 12 special characters \`. , - * % $ / & # @ ‚åë ‚ßß\`That last character, \\"record mark\\", is depicted as two horizontal lines crossed with one vertical line, like two vertically offset, overapping + signs, or like a differently proportioned \\"double dagger\\" symbol ‚Ä°. The most accurate representation is , but that is missing from many fonts. appeared eight (first four), four (middle four) or two (last four characters) times each. Special chains or trains could be ordered for other character sets. Scientific users, for example, would use a chain that had the left parenthesis, the right parenthesis, and the plus sign in place of the per cent sign (%), the lozenge (‚åë),The \\"lozenge\\" is the square lozenge (U+2311) that resembles an overstuffed pillow, not the diamond-shaped one. Some Unicode typefaces do not render it correctly at this low resolution. and the ampersand (&). The numerics chain had 15 copies each of only 16 characters. The \\"T\\" chain for general text had two copies of 120 characters, including upper-and lower-case letters and numerous special symbols. The ink ribbon was a long roll the width of the print area that was positioned between the print chain and the paper. The roll came in two parts, the feeder roll and take-up roll. The roll was constantly wound and rewound during printing. An IBM 1403, foreground, part of an IBM 7030 Harvest installation at the U.S. National Security Agency Like most IBM printers of the era, the 1403 used fan-folded paper with perforated edges for tractor feeding. A carriage control tape or, later, a buffer, under program control,this was system dependent specified form length and the form line where printing was to begin so that paper of various sizes could be used. An IBM 1403 printer played a cameo role in Stanley Kubrick's 1964 movie Dr. Strangelove, serving as a hiding place for a portable radio. The overstrike capability of the printer was used to generate a wide range of grey-scale equivalents. Many images were scanned, pixelated and could be reproduced on the 1403, most notably the Mona Lisa. These were noisy machines, especially when the cover was raised. Some people were able to create text that used the timing of the print hammers to generate desired frequencies and actually play music when that text was printed.1403-generated music at the Computer History Museum  History  Prior to the introduction of the model 1403, IBM printers utilized technology originally developed for their line of accounting machines. Models 402 and 405 used type bars. These were vertical bars, one for each print position. Each bar was one character wide with either the entire alphabet, including numerals and symbols, or just numerals & symbols only, molded into the front surface, in a single column. In printing, each bar was raised up until the correct character for that print position was opposite the paper, whereupon the bar was pushed toward the paper, so that the correct numeral or letter pressed against the ribbon, striking the paper much the way type slugs leave an impression on paper in a standard typewriter. This action was relatively slow, as it took time for each bar to be brought up into the correct position and then drop back down in preparation to print the next line. In the model 407, each type bar was replaced with a type wheel, with the characters along the outside edge. To print, each wheel was rotated to the correct character position, then the entire wheel was pushed forward to strike the paper. This action was somewhat faster in that the wheels were less massive than the bars and could be positioned more rapidly. Still, however, speeds of 150 lines per minute were all that were achieved. Although this might seem slow by later printing standards, the speed at which electromechanical accounting machines could read punched cards and perform their basic arithmetic functions meant that no faster printing speeds were needed. The IBM 1132 was the last printer manufactured by IBM to use this technology. IBM 1403 printer opened up as it would be to change paper. The print chain is behind the wide black ribbon, hinged open to the right, which is the width of the paper. Also note carriage control tape in upper right. When faster computers were developed, however, the speed of card reading, magnetic tape, and early disk drives, along with newer high speed transistorized circuits, meant that processing could be done at a much higher speed, and a faster print mechanism was needed to match the resulting productivity. IBM's early computers, such as the IBM 701, were developed for higher speed calculation than was possible with earlier electromechanical calculating machines. They did not have a demand for high speed printing, as the results of massive calculations produced very little printed output. Around the time that the 1403 was introduced, IBM's line of computers had been largely divided into two lines, \\"scientific\\" and \\"business.\\" However, as newer computers were being used for a greater variety of purposes, there was a need to print a greater variety of characters from a single device, including upper and lower case alphabets. With type bars and type wheels, changing character sets was impractical. The advent of the chain printer, as used in the 1403, allowed the type chain assembly to be removed and replaced within a few minutes. With the cover open, the print unit was unlatched and swung open, the ribbon roll covering the front of the chain was removed, whereupon the print chain assembly could be unlatched and lifted out. When it was first introduced, 1401 computer system, of which the printer was a part, leased for $6500 per month (equivalent to $54,000 in 2017) and IBM received 3000 orders in the first month.  Technology  Chain printing allowed a single set of characters to pass horizontally across the front of paper at high speed, with a ribbon the full width of the paper passing vertically in between the chain and the front of the paper. Instead of pressing the characters toward the paper, individual type hammers behind the paper, one for each column on the page (120 or 132), pushed the paper from behind, causing the front of the paper at that spot to push forward into the ribbon with the character behind it, causing the paper to strike the character, rather than the other way around, as had been done in the past. Each hammer was moved by a powerful electromagnet, with its coil connected to a high current drive circuit, such that the hammer could be forced out to hit the paper within only a few milliseconds, at exactly the right time to strike the correct character on the chain as it came by. The columns on the paper were spaced at the standard typewriter pitch of 10 characters per inch, 0.1‚Ä≥ per column. The characters on the chain were spaced 0.1505‚Ä≥ apart, so that for each 0.001‚Ä≥ movement of the chain, a new character aligned with a print column. Moving at 7.5 feet per second, one hammer might fire each , but they were never exactly simultaneous.  Models  The IBM 1403 had the following models: * Model 1: 100 print positions, maximum of 600 lines per minute, or 1285 with the Numerical Print Special Feature. * Model 2: 132 print positions, maximum of 600 lines per minute, or 1285 with the Numerical Print Special Feature, or 750 with Universal Character Set. * Model 3: 132 print positions, maximum of 1100 lines per minute, or 1400 with the Preferred or Universal Character Sets. * Model 4: 100 print positions, maximum of 465 lines per minute. * Model 5: 132 print positions, maximum of 465 lines per minute. * Model 6: 120 print positions, maximum of 340 lines per minute, single- carriage. * Model 7: 120 print positions, maximum of 600 lines per minute, single-carriage. * Model N1: 132 print positions, maximum of 1100 lines per minute, or 1400 with Universal Character Set. The model N1 had a power driven cover that went to the floor to cut noise. Only models 2, 3, 7 and N1 could be attached to the IBM System/360 and its successors. Attachment was generally by means of the IBM 2821 Control Unit, but some 360 models included an integrated control unit for direct 1403 connection. Only the Model 6 (340 LPM) or the Model 7 (600 LPM) could be attached to an IBM 1130.

It is the principal station on the City network and is located in the Brisbane central business district. History Ann & Edward Streets from the verandah of the People's Palace in 1911 View to the west toward the platforms circa 1911 Central Station Cafe in Brisbane, 1927 The first building for Central railway station was a structure of wood and corrugated galvanised iron, and opened on 18 August 1889 as the terminus of the line when it was extended from Roma Street railway station. In 1891, the tunnel to Brunswick Street station (now Fortitude Valley) was opened so trains could run directly from Central to northern destinations. An elegant new station was constructed and opened in 1899 with arches of corrugated galvanised iron over the platforms and a portico on Ann Street. A new entrance with its distinctive row of clocks was constructed in 1901 in sandstone from nearby quarries. In 1904, Central had the only electro-pneumatic system in Australia for changing points and signals.Station clocks were central to city's life The Courier Mail 3 December 2009 The station had two through and two bay platforms. In 1909, the bay platforms were converted to through platforms. Ann Street was widened in 1954 for the construction of government offices which required the portico to be demolished. The vaulted roof was removed in 1966 and replaced by awnings over each platform. Between 1968 and 1970, the station was redeveloped with office towers built over the platforms at the Edward Street end, involving the demolition of the 1901 entrance buildings and the construction of a modern pedestrian retail concourse behind the old station buildings. Further redevelopment in the 1980s saw the Sheraton Hotel towers (now Sofitel Brisbane) built over the remaining platforms.

A group of economists (notably John Hicks, Franco Modigliani and Paul Samuelson), attempted to interpret and formalize Keynes' writings and to synthesize it with the neoclassical models of economics. Their work has become known as the neoclassical synthesis and created the models that formed the core ideas of neo-Keynesian economics. These ideas dominated mainstream economics in the post-war period and formed the mainstream of macroeconomic thought in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. A series of developments occurred that shook neo-Keynesian theory in the 1970s as the advent of stagflation and the work of monetarists like Milton Friedman cast doubt on neo-Keynesian theories. The result would be a series of new ideas to bring tools to Keynesian analysis that would be capable of explaining the economic events of the 1970s. The next great wave of Keynesian thinking began with the attempt to give Keynesian macroeconomic reasoning a microeconomic basis. These new Keynesians helped create a \\"new neoclassical synthesis\\" that currently forms the mainstream of macroeconomic theory.Woodford, Michael.

No. 98‚Äì5. http://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/working_papers/1998/pdf/wp98-5.pdf. Following the emergence of the new Keynesian school, neo-Keynesians have sometimes been referred to as \\"Old-Keynesians\\".  Origins  John Maynard Keynes provided the framework for synthesizing a host of economic ideas present between 1900 and 1940 and that synthesis bears his name, as is generally known as Keynesian economics. The first generation of Keynesians were focused on unifying the ideas into workable paradigms, combining them with ideas from classical economics and the writings of Alfred Marshall. These neo-Keynesians generally looked at labor contracts as sources of wage stickiness to generate equilibrium models of unemployment. Their efforts (known as the neo-classical synthesis) resulted in the development of the IS‚ÄìLM model and other formalizations of Keynes' ideas. This intellectual program would produce eventually monetarism and other versions of Keynesian macroeconomics in the 1960s.  Neoclassical synthesis  The IS‚ÄìLM model is used to analyze the effect of demand shocks on the economy After Keynes, Keynesian analysis was combined with neoclassical economics to produce what is generally termed \\"the neoclassical synthesis\\", which dominated mainstream macroeconomic thought from the 1950s to the 1970s. Though it was widely held that there was no strong automatic tendency to full employment, many believed that if government policy were used to ensure it, the economy would behave as classical or neoclassical theory predicted. In the post-World War II years, Keynes's policy ideas were widely accepted. For the first time, governments prepared high-quality economic statistics on a regular basis and had a theory that could answer questions about how to influence the macroeconomy. = IS‚ÄìLM model (investment saving‚Äìliquidity preference money supply) = It was with John Hicks that Keynesian economics produced a clear model which policy-makers could use to attempt to understand and control economic activity. This model, the IS‚ÄìLM model, is nearly as influential as Keynes' original analysis in determining actual policy and economics education. It relates aggregate demand and employment to three exogenous quantities, i.e. the amount of money in circulation, the government budget and the state of business expectations. This model was very popular with economists after World War II because it could be understood in terms of general equilibrium theory. This encouraged a much more static vision of macroeconomics than that described above. = Phillips curve's successes and collapse = The Phillips curve in the U.S in the 1960s The second main part of a Keynesian policy-maker's theoretical apparatus was the Phillips curve. This curve, which was more of an empirical observation than a theory, indicated that increased employment over unemployment implied increased inflation. Keynes had only predicted that increase employment would cause a higher price, not a higher inflation rate. Thus the economist could use the IS‚ÄìLM model to predict, for example, that an increase in the money supply would raise output and employment‚Äîand then use the Phillips curve to predict an increase in inflation. The strength of Keynesianism's influence can be seen by the wave of economists which began in the late 1940s with Milton Friedman. Instead of rejecting macro-measurements and macro-models of the economy, they embraced the techniques of treating the entire economy as having a supply and demand equilibrium, but unlike the Keynesians‚Äîthey argued that \\"crowding out\\" effects would hobble or deprive fiscal policy of its positive effect. Instead, the focus should be on monetary policy, which was largely ignored by early Keynesians. The monetarist critique pushed Keynesians toward a more balanced view of monetary policy and inspired a wave of revisions to Keynesian theory. Through the 1950s, moderate degrees of government demand leading industrial development and use of fiscal and monetary counter-cyclical policies continued and reached a peak in the \\"go go\\" 1960s, where it seemed to many Keynesians that prosperity was now permanent. However, with the oil shock of 1973 and the economic problems of the 1970s, modern liberal economics began to fall out of favor. During this time, many economies experienced \\"stagflation\\" : high and rising unemployment, coupled with high and rising inflation, contradicting the Phillips curve's prediction. This stagflation meant that both expansionary (anti-recession) and contractionary (anti-inflation) policies had to be applied simultaneously, a clear impossibility. This dilemma led to the rise of ideas based upon more classical analysis, including monetarism, supply-side economics and new classical economics. This produced a \\"policy bind\\" and the collapse of the Keynesian consensus on the economy, leading to the development of new classical macroeconomics and new keynesianism.Chapter 1.

It emphasizes the harsh aspects of Midwestern rural life under the pressures of crime, disease, mental illness, and urbanization. The book was adapted into a film in 1999. Film adaptation The 1999 film adaptation was directed by James Marsh as a docudrama. It was shot primarily in black-and-white, with contrasting color sequences of modern life in the area. It combined re-enactments of some of the events described in the book with a voice-over narration by Ian Holm. Its visual style was intended to carry the content of the film; as Marsh said: > I wanted to convey in the film the real pathos contained in a four line > newspaper report that simultaneously records and dismisses the end of > someone's life.http://www.wisconsindeathtrip.com/about.html In popular culture =Music= The book inspired a number of musical works, including the opera Black River by Conrad Susa, which was composed in 1975 and revised 1981; the \\"dramatic cantata\\" Songs of Madness and Sorrow by Daron Hagen; and the 1999 album Wisconsin Death Trip by the band Static-X. British post-punk band Echo & the Bunnymen used photographs from the book as artwork for their 2001 album Flowers, as well as its singles. A song performed by Jerry Joseph was inspired by the title of the film.http://www.jerryjoseph.com/lyrics/self-titled-lyrics/ Most recently, the book was adapted into a bluegrass/roots-rock opera by Tim Raphael and composer Jeff Berkson, which had its world premiere at Georgetown University's Davis Performing Arts Center on February 1, 2008. The soundtrack for the film adaptation of the book features original music by DJ Shadow and John Cale. =Literature= The Australian author Rod Jones cites Wisconsin Death Trip as an inspiration for his novel Billy Sunday, and the American author Robert Goolrick also cites it as an inspiration for his novel A Reliable Wife. Stephen King's book of novellas, Full Dark, No Stars, cites Wisconsin Death Trip as the inspiration for the story 1922.

He is currently signed to Impact Wrestling and also wrestles on the independent circuit. He is known for his trademark style of hardcore wrestling, which he pioneered in his time with Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) from 1995 to 2000. He is a three-time World Heavyweight Champion having held the ECW World Heavyweight Championship twice and the NWA World Heavyweight Championship once. Under the tutelage of his uncle The Sheik, Brunk began his career wrestling in the North American independent scene in 1985 under the name of Sabu, before traveling to Japan, competing in Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling (FMW) and New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), winning several championships, including the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship. He returned to the United States in 1995, briefly working for World Championship Wrestling (WCW), before beginning his most well-known stint in ECW, where he quickly became a fixture of the promotion. During his time in ECW, he became a two-time ECW World Heavyweight Champion and a one-time ECW World Television Champion. He would have a feud with The Tazmaniac, winning with him the ECW ECW World Tag Team Championship and defeated him for the non- sanctioned ECW FTW Championship. In 1997, Sabu began a tag team with Rob Van Dam, winning the Tag Team Championship twice. After leaving ECW, Sabu wrestled in several national promotions, winning the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in 2000. In 2006, he was hired by WWE as part of their new third brand, a rebooted version of ECW. Sabu would wrestle for WWE until he was fired in 2007. He also became a wrestler in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA, now Impact Wrestling) since the creation of the promotion in 2002. Professional wrestling career = Early career (1985‚Äì1991) = Brunk was trained by his uncle, Ed Farhat (The Sheik), and was initially trained to be a technical wrestler. He began his wrestling career in 1985 in Farhat's promotion, Big Time Wrestling, and was billed as being from Saudi Arabia under the ring names \\"Sabu the Elephant Boy\\" (use of \\"The Elephant Boy\\" was later dropped) and \\"Terry S.R.\\" (the \\"S.R.\\" standing for \\"Sheik's Revenge\\"). During the 1980s, Brunk wrestled for various independent promotions in Memphis, Michigan, Ohio, Canada, and Hawaii. He was rarely billed under his real name, in order to avoid confusion with the similarly-named Terry Funk, but has wrestled under his real name of Terry Brunk in Hawai'i. = United States Wrestling Association (1991) = In 1991, Sabu made a few appearances for United States Wrestling Association as Samu. He feuded with Jeff Jarrett and Robert Fuller. =World Wrestling Federation (1993)= Sabu made three appearances for the World Wrestling Federation. He defeated Scott Taylor in a dark match before Monday Night Raw on October 18, 1993. He lost to Owen Hart the next night for a dark match at a Wrestling Challenge taping and the 20th defeated Scott Taylor again in a dark match at a WWF Superstars of Wrestling taping. = Frontier Martial‚ÄìArts Wrestling (1991‚Äì1994) = In 1991, Sabu made his first tour of Japan with Frontier Martial‚ÄìArts Wrestling (FMW). While wrestling for FMW, Sabu received many of the scars on his arms and torso for which he became famous. Brunk cleared rumors that the scars were self-induced in a shoot interview with RF Video, confirming that they were a result of numerous hardcore matches he was involved in, including participating in over two dozen no-rope barbed wire death matches. In May 1992, Sabu teamed with his uncle, the Sheik, in a \\"Ring of Fire Deathmatch\\" against Atsushi Onita and Tarzan Goto. The match was set in a ring where the ropes were replaced with barbed wire with sheets soaked in gas wrapped around it. As the match started, the ring crew lit the sheets on fire using torches. They were in the ring for about a minute before all men got out of the ring due to the intense heat. The match ended with no winner. Sabu said in an interview that the ring burned for 19 hours. Sabu often competed in Japanese hardcore matches, where he teamed with the Sheik, Tiger Jeet Singh and Horace Boulder. Sabu feuded with the likes of Tarzan Goto and Atsushi Onita in FMW. His final match in FMW was a loss to the debuting Hayabusa at the 1994 Summer Spectacular. =Eastern/Extreme Championship Wrestling (1993‚Äì1995)= Brunk revealed in a shoot promo and in the documentary film Forever Hardcore that in fact it was not Paul Heyman that brought him into Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) but that he was at the right place at the right time. He was referred by a friend to Tod Gordon. According to the storyline, Sabu, who at that time often arrived to the ring by his handler 911, was an uncontrollable madman strapped to a gurney and with a Hannibal Lecter-style face mask while trying to break free (he claimed to hate this part of his gimmick as he was normally tired before he started his match). Sabu could only be released from his bonds to wrestle his matches. Sabu also quickly became synonymous with table-breaking at this time; if a table was not broken during the match, Sabu would break a table with his own body after the bell had sounded, sometimes leading to 911 having to restrain Sabu during backstage interviews if a table was present. One of the most notable aspects of Sabu's early career was his refusal to speak, a gimmick that he inherited from The Sheik (who never spoke English in public to protect kayfabe). In his early career, Sabu was billed as being from Saudi Arabia, or Bombay, India (in real life he is a second generation Lebanese American from Michigan). In ECW, however, he was clearly heard speaking in the ring on several occasions and it was fairly common knowledge that Brunk was an American citizen from birth. This led to a joke at kayfabe's expense when Sabu began to be billed as hailing from \\"Bombay, Michigan\\". The most significant matches during the early part of Sabu's career in ECW by defeating Terry Funk to win the ECW World Heavyweight Championship and the ECW World Television Championship in a title versus title dream partner tag team match. Also, he was a part in the three way dance for the ECW World Heavyweight Championship at The Night the Line Was Crossed, against Terry Funk and Shane Douglas, which went to a one-hour time limit draw and his tag team feud with The Public Enemy in which Sabu and his partner The Tazmaniac captured the ECW World Tag Team Championship in a double tables match. Another notable event occurred in April 1995 when, after being scheduled to compete in the main event of Three Way Dance for the ECW World Tag Team title, Sabu no‚Äìshowed the event to accept a booking in Japan for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), which led Paul Heyman to publicly and legitimately fire Sabu at the event. Sabu stated in the Forever Hardcore documentary that he had a career wrestling in Japan yet only wrestled once every so often for ECW; thus, he chose Japan over ECW. = New Japan Pro-Wrestling (1995) = Sabu wrestled for New Japan Pro-Wrestling throughout 1995, making a total of 64 appearances. He made his debut on January 4 in the Tokyo Dome, teaming with Masahiro Chono to defeat Junji Hirata and Tatsumi Fujinami. Sabu and Chono teamed together on several more occasions to face Heisei Ishingun. On May 3, 1995, Sabu defeated Koji Kanemoto in the Fukuoka Dome to win the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship. He lost the title to Kanemoto on June 14, 1995 in Tokyo's Nippon Budokan in a bout where Kanemoto's UWA World Welterweight Championship was also on the line. He went on to face Gran Hamada in a series of matches, culminating in Sabu defeating Gran Hamada to win the UWA World Junior Light Heavyweight Championship on November 23, 1995 in the Todoroki Arena in Kawasaki. He held the championship for just over a week, losing to El Samurai on December 1, 1995 in Niigata. Sabu made his final appearance with NJPW on December 11, 1995 in Osaka, teaming with Hiro Saito to defeat Dean Malenko and Wild Pegasus. =World Championship Wrestling (1995)= Sabu made his WCW debut on the September 11, 1995 episode of WCW Monday Nitro against Alex Wright. Sabu won the match, but the decision was reversed when, after the match, he put Wright through a table. Sabu continued to wrestle some of the cruiserweights in WCW in the early days of the division, including a match against Mr. J.L. at Halloween Havoc. Sabu came out victorious against Mr. J.L. and following the match Sabu's uncle Sheik shot J.L. in the face with his trademark fireball. His last match in WCW was against Disco Inferno, which Sabu won. = Big Japan and All Japan Pro Wrestling (1996-1997) = Sabu returned to Japan to work for Big Japan Pro Wrestling in March 1996. He had an 18 match winning streak first defeating Jason Knight on March 13 to June 4 losing to Kendo Nagasaki. He made his debut for All Japan Pro Wrestling in November 1996 teaming with Gary Albright. In 1997, he teamed with Rob Van Dam. = Return to ECW (1995‚Äì2000) = Sabu at an ECW event in 1998 Sabu returned to ECW on November 18, 1995 at November to Remember, and eventually engaged in matches and feuds with the likes of Rob Van Dam, with whom he later teamed up with and won the ECW World Tag Team Championship twice. In the meantime, former tag team partner Tazmaniac (who had shortened his name to \\"Taz\\") began to publicly challenge Sabu at every given opportunity, but got no response. After a year of call-outs and insults from Taz, Heyman revealed that he had asked Sabu, as a friend, to ignore Taz's challenge. This standoff culminated in a grudge match at ECW's first pay-per-view, Barely Legal, which Taz won. Following the match, Taz's manager Bill Alfonso turned on him and sided with Sabu and Rob Van Dam, who then formed a tag team. Sabu and Taz continued to feud on and off for the remainder of Taz's ECW career. Sabu was later included in the WWF invasion angle, in which ECW wrestlers invaded WWF's Monday Night Raw program and held ECW-style matches and angles on the show. One memorable moment occurred at this show when Sabu appeared during a match and prepared for an aerial move off the \\"R\\" in the \\"RAW\\" lettered entryway onto Team Taz members, but accidentally fell off the \\"R\\". This was not planned which led to Sabu landing on top of Team Taz members and becoming an inside joke between him and Taz backstage. This invasion angle also led to a heel turn for Sabu in ECW, along with Van Dam and Alfonso, who began promoting the virtues of the WWF product over ECW's. Sabu feuded with ECW loyalists Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman during this period. One of Sabu's most infamous matches was the No- Rope barbed wire match with Terry Funk at Born to be Wired, a match which was promoted as being \\"too extreme even for ECW\\". In one of the most memorable moments in ECW history, Sabu attempted the \\"Air Sabu\\" corner splash on Funk, Terry moved and Sabu ended up colliding violently into the wire which tore open his biceps. He then asked his manager Bill Alfonso for some tape and after Alfonso went to get some Sabu began to tape the approximately 10 inch gash up. Funk has stated that, to this day, he has never seen anything like what Sabu did that night. The match ended with both men so badly tangled up together in the barbed wire that it took several ring technicians armed with wire cutters to free them from the predicament (on the DVD Bloodsport ‚Äì ECW's Most Violent Matches released by World Wrestling Entertainment, Paul Heyman said that the match was \\"so gruesome, I never ever dared to schedule another one like it\\", and that they never had another Barbed-Wire match in ECW because \\"no one could top that one ‚Äì and in good conscience, I never wanted anyone to try\\"). Rhino Brunk racked up an astounding catalog of injuries during his ECW tenure, including broken ribs, a broken jaw, and breaking his neck twice. The first time he broke his neck was during his match with Chris Benoit at the 1994 November to Remember. Benoit threw Sabu with the intention that he would take a flapjack bump, but Brunk attempted to turn mid-air and take a back body drop bump instead, which he was not able to do and landed on his head causing the injury. The other was during a match against Taz in December 1998, when Brunk took a Taz‚ÄìPlex through a table and landed incorrectly. Brunk was able to recover from the neck injuries and return to wrestling, and he even wore a neck brace in his return match in the United States a month following the injury at Taz's hands; by Brunk's account, however, he started actively wrestling in Japan with his partner on a short tour a little over two weeks after that injury. Brunk departed from ECW for the final time in early 2000. =Independent circuit (2000-2002)= After leaving ECW, Sabu went to compete in the independent circuit. Worked for many promotions Xtreme Pro Wrestling, IWA Mid-South, Stampede Wrestling, Border City Wrestling, and others. On April 29, 2000, he won a tournament for the vacated XPW World Heavyweight Championship defeating John Kronus in the first round, Damien Steele in the second and The Messiah in the finals. He was the only champion to defend the title outside of the States. He would hold the title for a year until it was taken away in May 2001 by Josh Lazie when Sabu was not present for an event. He would to return to All Japan Pro Wrestling in 2000 as a singles competitor. In 2001 he competed against Abdullah the Butcher and Giant Kimala. On July 8, 2001 he defeated Angel at ECW Reunion Show in Buffalo, New York. In 2002 he worked for Pro-Pain Pro Wrestling. He won the 3PW World Heavyweight Championship defeating Gary Wolfe on October 19. He would drop the title to Wolfe on December 28. =Return to Frontier Martial‚ÄìArts Wrestling (1997-2002)= Sabu returned to Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling on December 22, 1997 when he defeated ECW rival The Sandman at Super Extreme Wrestling War 1997 at Tokyo's Korakuen Hall. Then on December 13, 1998 he and Rob Van Dam defeated the Dudley Boyz to retain the ECW World Tag Team Titles at ECW/FMW Supershow. He would team up with Super Leather in a few tag team matches during 1999. On February 3, 2002 Sabu defeated former ECW wrestlers The Sandman and Vic Grimes in a three way dance. The next day was his last match with FMW was when he teamed with Tetsuhiro Kuroda and lost to The Sandman and Kodo Fuyuki for the vacated WEW Tag Team titles. This would be the promotion last event as it went bankrupt on the 15th. = World Wrestling All-Stars (2002, 2003)= Sabu competed for the World Wrestling All-Stars (WWA) in a number of events during 2002 and 2003. This included four appearances on PPV and a number of memorable matches. His first appearance was at Revolution PPV in Las Vegas in February 2002. He faced Devon Storm in a hardcore match. He was defeated in this match after his manager Bill Alfonso accidentally hit him with a chair after Storm moved out the way. After the match Sabu and Storm continued to fight onto the ring entrance way. Sabu placed Storm on a table and leaped from the entrance way through Storm and the table. This feud continued on the next PPV, the Eruption, in Australia in April. Sabu fought Storm in a steel cage match. The action spilled out of the ring and the cage with Sabu gaining the victory after leaping from the top of the cage through Storm, who was placed on top of two tables on top of each other. Next up Sabu took part in WWA European tour of November‚ÄìDecember 2002. This included the Retribution PPV in Glasgow, which was broadcast two months later in February 2003. On this tour and PPV he fought former fellow ECW stars Perry Saturn and Simon Diamond in a three-way hardcore match. Sabu took the victory in each of these matches, usually gaining the pinfall over Diamond after Saturn left the match to defend his companion. His final appearance for the WWA came in their last PPV, The Reckoning, in New Zealand. During this tour he first fought Shane Douglas but due to injury he did not face him at the PPV. Instead Douglas came to the ring and eventually allowed Joe E Legend to face Sabu instead. Sabu won this match, his second and last WWA match ever. When the All World Wrestling League began in April 2003 (a spin-off of Big Time Wrestling), which was run by Eddie & Tom Farhat, Sabu joined them for a while, before he left for another territory. =Total Nonstop Action Wrestling= Early appearances and injury (2002-2004) Sabu debuted in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) on July 17, 2002, defeating Malice in a ladder match. The next week he faced Ken Shamrock in a ladder match which was declared a No Contest when Malice interfered. In 2004, Sabu teamed with Raven to defeat Raven's former \\"Gathering\\" prot√©g√©s, CM Punk and Julio Dinero. In March he began feuding with Monty Brown and Abyss, who outnumbered him on several occasions after Raven failed to \\"watch his back\\". Eventually Raven challenged Sabu to an empty arena match to be held on June 9, but Sabu refused to wrestle him, claiming that he had promised his uncle, The Sheik, that he would never fight Raven. Raven then waged a campaign against Sabu, disrespecting the memory of his uncle and assaulting Sabu's friend Sonjay Dutt, until Sabu finally broke and attacked him on July 23. Raven defeated Sabu on August 4, and a scheduled return match on August 18 was canceled after Sabu legitimately suffered a serious back injury. While injured, Brunk contracted a virus and was hospitalized, sidelining him for ten months. On December 12 a benefit show, A Night of Appreciation for Sabu, was held by the AWWL to raise funds for him. The show was considered a success, raising enough money for Brunk to cover the costs of his medical care and he was able to make a full recovery. In his first match back from the injury in the AWWL/BTW, he defeated N8 Mattson. Sabu then appeared at Hardcore Homecoming, where he defeated Terry Funk and Shane Douglas in a three-way no-ropes barbed wire match, and at ECW One Night Stand two days later, where he defeated Rhyno. Recovery and departure (2005-2006) Sabu returned to TNA on July 29, 2005. At Sacrifice Sabu teamed with his old enemy, and then NWA World Heavyweight Champion, Raven to face Jeff Jarrett and Rhino. Rhino and Jarrett won the match after Rhino gored Raven through a table and pinned him. The match saw Abyss interfering and attacking Sabu, starting a feud between the two of them. They went on to have a match at Unbreakable in September which Abyss won after performing his Black Hole Slam finisher on to a pile of tacks in the ring. Sabu once again found himself squaring off against Rhino and Abyss, as well as Jeff Hardy, during Bound for Glory in the Monster's Ball 2 match. Rhino won the match. On the same night, Sabu competed in a ten-man Gauntlet Match to decide a number one contender, which he also lost, once again to Rhino. Sabu continued his feud with Abyss, once again losing to him at Genesis after taking a Black Hole Slam onto a barbed wire steel chair. They met up again, in the promotion's first ever Barbed Wire Massacre at Turning Point. Sabu finally beat Abyss, but following the match was not seen on TNA TV for several months. He made his return at Lockdown on April 23, 2006 in a match against Samoa Joe for Joe's TNA X Division Championship, despite Sabu having a broken forearm. Sabu was defeated. Sabu was released soon afterwards from TNA. =World Wrestling Entertainment (2006‚Äì2007)= Sabu in the ring at a WWE house show in 2006 Shortly after his TNA release, on April 24, 2006, Sabu's official website reported that he had signed a one-year contract with World Wrestling Entertainment. At the One Night Stand pay-per-view, Sabu faced Rey Mysterio for the World Heavyweight Championship. At the end of the match, Mysterio found himself standing on a ringside table with Sabu flying at him. Sabu caught the champ in a front facelock and nailed him with a DDT which caused both men to crash through the table. At this point, the WWE medical staff rushed to the injured men and declared neither man could continue and ordered the match stopped, resulting in a No Contest in which Mysterio kept his title. On the June 13 premiere of ECW on Sci Fi, Sabu won a 10-man Extreme Battle Royal with the stipulation that the winner face John Cena at Vengeance. Sabu further fueled the feud during the next week's Raw, when he interfered in a Cena match and performed a Triple Jump Leg Drop on him, diving onto Cena and putting him through the announcers' table. Cena defeated Sabu in their \\"Extreme Lumberjack match\\" at Vengeance. On July 2, Sabu, traveling with fellow ECW wrestler Rob Van Dam, was arrested and charged with possession of drug paraphernalia, and nine Vicodin tablets following a traffic stop in Hanging Rock, Ohio following a house show in Huntington, WV. Brunk was fined $1,000 based on the guidelines of WWE's Wellness Policy. He pleaded guilty to possession of a controlled substance and the charge of possession of drug paraphernalia was dropped. He was given a suspended sentence of 10 days in jail and a $500 fine. Meanwhile, he defeated Stevie Richards in an Extreme Rules match at Saturday Night's Main Event XXXIII. Sabu wrestling C.W. Anderson at the ECW Arena in June 2006 Towards the end of July, Sabu began to talk on camera for himself ‚Äì instead of using a go between ‚Äì and demanded a shot at The Big Show's ECW World Championship which Paul Heyman refused to grant him in order to \\"protect\\" his champion. Instead he forced him into a match against the returning Kurt Angle to determine a number one contender. When that match was interrupted by the returning Rob Van Dam another match was signed, Angle versus Van Dam versus Sabu, for the number one contendership (Angle then became too injured to compete and was pulled from the match). Sabu beat Rob Van Dam in their ladder match to win a shot at Big Show at SummerSlam, a match which he ended up losing. At Survivor Series, Sabu teamed up with John Cena, Bobby Lashley, Rob Van Dam and Kane to face the team of The Big Show, Test, Montel Vontavious Porter, Finlay and Umaga. Sabu eliminated Test following a Tornado DDT, but he was later eliminated by Big Show via pinfall after receiving a chokeslam. In the end, Team Cena gained victory. At December to Dismember, Sabu was originally set to appear in the main event, an extreme elimination chamber match against The Big Show, Test, Rob Van Dam, CM Punk and Bobby Lashley, but was \\"taken out\\" and replaced by Hardcore Holly. The following episode on ECW, CM Punk and Rob Van Dam got on the mic before their match with Test and Hardcore Holly and dedicated the match to Sabu. When Punk and Van Dam won the match, Paul Heyman and his security team came out and had beaten down on the two. Sabu later made his return with a heavily wrapped arm to make the save. Sabu made his Royal Rumble match debut in the 2007 Royal Rumble on January 28, where he was eliminated by Kane after receiving a chokeslam over the top rope and through a table. Sabu joined the ECW Originals along with Rob Van Dam, Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman. The ECW Originals began a feud with the New Breed (Elijah Burke, Kevin Thorn, Marcus Cor Von and Matt Striker). The two teams faced off in a match at WrestleMania 23 in which the ECW Originals won. On the April 3 edition of ECW, the ECW Originals faced the New Breed again in a rematch, which the New Breed won after Burke performed the Elijah Express on Sabu through a table. Sabu's final WWE match was on the May 1 episode of ECW, where he competed in a fatal four-way match against Dreamer, Van Dam and Sandman to determine the number one contender for the ECW Championship, which Van Dam won.

Liberalism as a specifically named ideology begins in the late 18th century as a movement towards self-government and away from aristocracy. It included the ideas of self-determination, the primacy of the individual and the nation as opposed to the state and religion as being the fundamental units of law, politics and economy. Since then liberalism has broadened to include a wide range of approaches from Americans Ronald Dworkin, Richard Rorty, John Rawls and Francis Fukuyama as well as the Indian Amartya Sen and the Peruvian Hernando de Soto. Some of these people moved away from liberalism while others espoused other ideologies before turning to liberalism. There are many different views of what constitutes liberalism, and some liberals would feel that some of the people on this list were not true liberals. It is intended to be suggestive rather than exhaustive. Theorists whose ideas were mainly typical for one country should be listed in that country's section of liberalism worldwide. Generally only thinkers are listed whereas politicians are only listed when they also made substantial contributions to liberal theory beside their active political work. Classical contributors to liberalism =Aristotle= Aristotle Aristotle (Athens, 384‚Äì322 BC) is revered among political theorists for his seminal work Politics. He made invaluable contributions to liberal theory through his observations on different forms of government and the nature of man. He begins with the idea that the best government provides an active and \\"happy\\" life for its people. Aristotle then considers six forms of government: Monarchy, Aristocracy, and Polity on one side as 'good' forms of government, and Tyranny, Oligarchy, and Democracy as 'bad' forms. Considering each in turn, Aristotle rejects Monarchy as infantilizing of citizens, Oligarchy as too profit-motivated, Tyranny as against the will of the people, Democracy as serving only to the poor, and Aristocracy (known today as Meritocracy) as ideal but ultimately impossible. Aristotle finally concludes that a polity‚Äîa combination between democracy and oligarchy, where most can vote but must choose among the rich and virtuous for governors‚Äîis the best compromise between idealism and realism. In addition, Aristotle was a firm supporter of private property. He refuted Plato's argument for a collectivist society in which family and property are held in common: Aristotle makes the argument that when one's own son or land is rightfully one's own, one puts much more effort into cultivating that item, to the ultimate betterment of society. He references barbarian tribes of his time in which property was held in common, and the laziest of the bunch would always take away large amounts of food grown by the most diligent. Humanism =Niccol√≤ Machiavelli= Niccol√≤ Machiavelli Niccol√≤ Machiavelli (Florence, 1469‚Äì1527), best known for his Il Principe was the founder of realist political philosophy, advocated republican government, citizen armies, protection of personal property, and restraint of government expenditure as being necessary to the liberties of a republic. He wrote extensively on the need for individual initiative‚Äîvirtu‚Äîas an essential characteristic of stable government. He argued that liberty was the central good which government should protect, and that \\"good people\\" would make good laws, whereas people who had lost their virtue could maintain their liberties only with difficulty. His Discourses on Livy outlined realism as the central idea of political study and favored \\"Republics\\" over \\"Principalities\\". Machiavelli differed from true liberal thinking however, in that he still noted the benefits of princely governance. He states that republican leaders need to \\"act alone\\" if they want to reform a republic, and offers the example of Romulus, who killed his brother and co-ruler to found a great city. Republics need to refer to arbitrary and violent measures if it is necessary to maintain the structure of the government, as Machiavelli says that they have to ignore thoughts of justice and fairness. Anti-statist liberals consider Machiavelli's distrust as his main message, noting his call for a strong state under a strong leader, who should use any means to establish his position, whereas liberalism is an ideology of individual freedom and voluntary choices. * Contributing literature: **Discorsi sopra la prima deca di Tito Livio, 1512‚Äì1517 (Discourse on the First Decade of Titus Livius) =Desiderius Erasmus= Desiderius Erasmus Desiderius Erasmus (Netherlands, 1466‚Äì1536) was an advocate of humanism, critic of entrenched interests, irrationality and superstition. Erasmusian societies formed across Europe, to some extent in response to the turbulence of the Reformation. In his De libero arbitrio diatribe sive collatio (1524), he analyzes the Lutheran exaggeration of the obvious limitations on human freedom. * Contributing literature ** Stultitiae Laus, 1509 (The Praise of Folly, ) ** De libero arbitrio diatribe sive collatio, 1524 =Thomas Hobbes= Thomas Hobbes Thomas Hobbes (England, 1588‚Äì1679) theorized that government is the result of individual actions and human traits, and that it was motivated primarily by \\"interest\\", a term which would become crucial in the development of a liberal theory of government and political economy, since it is the foundation of the idea that individuals can be self-governing and self-regulating. His work Leviathan, did not advocate this viewpoint, but instead that only a strong government could restrain unchecked interest: it did, however, advance a proto-liberal position in arguing for an inalienable \\"right of nature,\\" the right to defend oneself, even against the state. Though his own ideological position is open to debate, his work influenced Locke, Hamilton, Jefferson, Madison and many other liberals, leading Strauss to identify Hobbes as the \\"father of liberalism\\".Lucien Jaume, \\"Hobbes and the Philosophical Sources of Liberalism\\", The Cambridge Companion to Hobbes' Leviathan, 211 * Contributing literature: **Leviathan, 1651 (Theologico-Political Treatise) =Baruch Spinoza= Baruch Spinoza (Netherlands, 1632‚Äì1677) is in his Tractatus Theologico-Politicus and Tractatus Politicus a proto-liberal defending the value of separation of church and state as well as forms of democracy. In the first mentioned book, Spinoza expresses an early criticism of religious intolerance and a defense of secular government. Spinoza was a thoroughgoing determinist who held that absolutely everything that happens occurs through the operation of necessity. For him, even human behaviour is fully determined, freedom being our capacity to know we are determined and to understand why we act as we do. So freedom is not the possibility to say \\"no\\" to what happens to us but the possibility to say \\"yes\\" and fully understand why things should necessarily happen that way. * Contributing literature: ** Tractatus Theologico-Politicus, 1670 (Theologico-Political Treatise, ) ** Tractatus Politicus, 1677 (Political Treatise) From Locke to Mill =John Locke= John Locke John Locke's (England, 1632‚Äì1704) notion that a \\"government with the consent of the governed\\" and man's natural rights‚Äîlife, liberty, and estate (property) as well on tolerance, as laid down in A letter concerning toleration and Two treatises of government‚Äîhad an enormous influence on the development of liberalism.

In government, Montesquieu encouraged division into the now standard legislative, judicial and executive branches; in society, he perceived a natural organization into king, the people and the aristocracy, with the latter playing a mediating role. \\"I do not write to censor that which is established in any country whatsoever,\\" Montesquieu disclaimed in the Laws; however, he did pay special attention to what he felt was the positive example of the constitutional system in England, which in spite of its evolution toward a fusion of powers, had moderated the power of the monarch, and divided Parliament along class lines. Montesquieu's work had a seminal impact on the American and French revolutionaries. Ironically, the least liberal element of his thought‚Äîhis privileging of the aristocracy‚Äîwas belied by both revolutions. Montesquieu's system came to fruition in America, a country with no aristocracy; in France, political maneuvering by the aristocracy led to the convocation of the 1789 Estates-General and popular revolt.

The National Gain) proposed roughly same the ideas as Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations, a decade earlier, including foundations of liberalism and capitalism and (roughly) the invisible hand. He demanded complete economic and individual freedom, including the freedom of religion (although he was a priest), worker's rights to freely move and choose their professions and employers, the freedom of speech and trade and abolitions of all privileges and price and wage controls. He was also a member of the Swedish four-estates parliament, elected three times as representative of the clergy in the northern and western parts of Finland. In his first parliamentary session, 1765‚Äì1766, he was very successful as a member of the subcommittee that wrote Sweden's famous Constitutional Law of the Freedom of Printing, Tryckfrihetsf√∂rordningen, of 1766. In this law Chydenius combined freedom of the press, and abolishment of the political censorship, with free access for the citizens to most government documents. Chydenius liberal system, where transparency reinforces press freedom, and the right for everyone to print the public document reinforces transparency, has been a fundamental constitutional principle in Sweden ever since, except for the years of royal autocracy 1772‚Äì1809. Chydenius model for press freedom and freedom of information was reestablished and strengthened in the Swedish Constitution 1809. It is now the foundation of the present Tryckfrihetsf√∂rordningen of 1949, which is one of the fundamental laws of Sweden. In diluted form, and without the strong constitutional protection of the Swedish free press model, the principle of free access to public documents that originated in Chydenius law of 1766, has in recent decades been spread from Sweden to the Freedom of Information Acts of many countries. This way, Anders Chydenius, has become one of the older liberal thinkers that has most practical influence on politics and public administration of modern western societies.

In his Wealth of Nations Adam Smith outlined the key idea that if the economy is basically left to its own devices, limited and finite resources will be put to ultimately their most efficient use through people acting purely in their self-interest. This concept has been quoted out of context by later economists as the invisible hand of the market. Smith also advanced property rights and personal civil liberties, including stopping slavery, which today partly form the basic liberal ideology. He was also opposed to stock-holding companies, what today is called a \\"corporation\\", because he predicated the self-policing of the free market upon the free association of moral individuals. * Some literature: ** An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, 1776 ** The Theory of Moral Sentiments, 1759 =Immanuel Kant= Immanuel Kant Immanuel Kant (Germany, 1724‚Äì1804) * Some literature: ** Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten, 1785 (Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysic of Morals ) ** Kritik der praktischen Vernunft, 1788 (Critique of Practical Reason ) ** √úber den Gemeinspruch: Das mag in der Theorie richtig sein, taugt aber nicht f√ºr die Praxis, 1793 (On the common saying: this may be true in theory but it does not apply in practice) ** Zum ewigen Frieden, 1795 (Perpetual Peace ) ** Metaphysik der Sitten, 1797 (Metaphysics of Morals ) =Anne Robert Jacques Turgot= Anne Robert Jacques Turgot (France, 1727‚Äì1781) * Some literature: ** Le Conciliateur, 1754 ** Lettre sur la tol√©rance civile, 1754 ** R√©flexions sur la formation et la distribution des richesses, 1766 ** Lettres sur la libert√© du commerce des grains, 1770 =Joseph Priestley= Joseph Priestley (United Kingdom/United States, 1733‚Äì1804) * Some literature: ** Essay on the First Principles of Government, 1768 ** The Present State of Liberty in Great Britain and her Colonies, 1769 ** Remarks on Dr Blackstone's Commentaries, 1769 ** Observations on Civil Liberty and the Nature and Justice of the War with America, 1772 =August Ludwig von Schl√∂zer= August Ludwig von Schl√∂zer (Germany, 1735‚Äì1809) =Patrick Henry= Patrick Henry (United States, 1736‚Äì1799) * Some literature: ** Liberty or Death, 1775 =Thomas Paine= Thomas Paine (United Kingdom/United States, 1737‚Äì1809) * Some literature: ** Rights of Man, 1791‚Äì92 ** Agrarian Justice, 1797 =Thomas Jefferson= Thomas Jefferson Thomas Jefferson (United States, 1743‚Äì1826) was the third President of the United States and author of the Declaration of Independence.

For Spencer, voluntary cooperation was the hallmark of the most vibrant form of society, accommodating the widest diversity of members and the greatest diversity of goals. Spencer's evolutionary approach has been characterized as an extension of Adam Smith's \\"invisible hand\\" explanation of economic order; his extensive work on sympathy (in psychology as well as the foundation of ethics, particularly in The Data of Ethics) explicitly carried on Smith's approach in The Theory of Moral Sentiments.

These, Berlin felt, tended towards totalitarianism. Negative conceptions, by contrast, argued that liberty was achieved when individuals were given maximal freedom from external constraints (so long as these did not impinge on the freedom of others to achieve the same condition).

It has been primarily operated as a bush plane and has been used for a wide variety of utility roles, such as cargo and passenger hauling, aerial application (crop dusting and aerial topdressing), and civil aviation duties. Shortly after the end of the Second World War, de Havilland Canada decided to orient itself towards civilian operators. Based on feedback from pilots, the company decided that the envisioned aircraft should have excellent STOL performance, all-metal construction, and accommodate many features sought by the operators of bush planes. On 16 August 1947, the maiden flight of the aircraft, which had received the designation DHC-2 Beaver, took place. In April 1948, the first production aircraft was delivered to the Ontario Department of Lands and Forests. A Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) Beaver played a supporting role in Sir Edmund Hillary's famous 1958 Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition to the South Pole. In addition to its use in civilian operations, the Beaver has been widely adopted by armed forces as a utility aircraft. The United States Army purchased several hundred aircraft; nine DHC-2s are still in service with the U.S. Air Force Auxiliary (Civil Air Patrol) for search and rescue. By 1967, over 1,600 Beavers had been constructed prior to the closure of the original assembly line. Various aircraft have been remanufactured and upgraded. Additionally, various proposals have been made to return the Beaver to production. The Beaver's versatility and performance led to it being the preferred aircraft of bush pilots servicing remote locations in the Canadian north, and it is considered by aviation historians to be a Canadian icon. In 1987, the Canadian Engineering Centennial Board named the DHC-2 one of the top ten Canadian engineering achievements of the 20th century. The Royal Canadian Mint honoured the aircraft on a special edition Canadian quarter in November 1999, and on a 50-cent commemorative gold coin in 2008. Large numbers continue to be operational into the 21st century, while the tooling and type certificate for the Beaver have been acquired by Viking Air who continue to produce replacement components and refurbish examples of the type.

Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources deHavilland DHC-2 Mk 3 Turbo Beavers on amphibious floats in Dryden, Ontario in 1995 PT6 turbine engine, retaining original fin shape and fitted with floats, at Bartow Municipal Airport, Florida in 2011 Following the end of the Second World War, de Havilland Canada's management team, recognising that there were would be a corresponding downturn in military orders in the immediate post-war climate, decided to focus the company's energies upon finding work within the civilian sector. The company had recently hired Punch Dickins as Director of Sales; Dickins carried out an extensive market research program in the form of requesting and collecting feedback from other pilots, to understand what they needed in a new aircraft. It was on the basis of this information from the prospective operators themselves, as opposed to aerodynamic research or fiscal data, that the future aircraft has its origins. In response, almost without exception, these pilots specified their desire for tremendous extra power and STOL performance, in a design that could be easily fitted with wheels, skis or floats. When de Havilland engineers noted this would result in poor cruise performance, one pilot replied, \\"You only have to be faster than a dog sled to be a winner\\". Other suggestions that were seemingly mundane, but important in the bush plane world, included the installation of full-sized doors on both sides of the aircraft, which meant that it could be readily loaded no matter which side of a dock it tied up on; the doors were also made wide enough to allow for a 44 Imperial gallon drum to be rolled up into the aircraft. On 17 September 1946, de Havilland officially put together a design team consisting of Fred Buller, Dick Hiscocks, Jim Houston and W. Jakimiuk, led by Phil Garratt. The new aircraft was designed to be all-metal (unlike older designs, like the famous Noorduyn Norseman), using \\"steel from the engine to the firewall, heavy aluminium truss frames with panels and doors throughout the front seat area, lighter trusses toward the rear and all monocoque construction aft\\". At the time, de Havilland Canada was still a British-owned company and there were plans to fit the evolving design with the British de Havilland Gipsy engine. As a result of its comparatively limited power, the wing area was greatly increased in order to maintain STOL performance. When Pratt & Whitney Canada offered to supply war-surplus Wasp Junior radial engines at a low price, the aircraft ended up with extra power as well as the original long wing. The result was unbeatable STOL performance for an aircraft of its size. In line with the convention for aircraft produced by de Havilland Canada being named after animals, it was decided that the new bush plane would be named after the beaver, which was known for its hard-working nature. On 16 August 1947, the maiden flight of the DHC-2 Beaver was in Downsview, Ontario; it was flown by Second World War flying ace Russell Bannock. After completing its flight test programme, the prototype received several adjustments and improvements in order for it to serve as a flying demonstration model ready for the sales circuit. The prototype was ultimately sold to Central British Columbia Airways, as a routine day-to-day working air-taxi airplane and continued to fly as such with various until 1980, after which it was retired and preserved. In April 1948, the first production aircraft was delivered to the Ontario Department of Lands and Forests, who had been a design partner. =Production= Initial sales were slow, perhaps two or three a month but as the plane was demonstrated sales started to improve. A key event in the Beaver's history occurred the next year when the US Army commenced its search for a new utility aircraft to replace their fleet of Cessnas. The competition quickly boiled down to the Beaver and the Cessna 195; however, the Beaver proved itself to outperform the 195 and, as a consequence of the outbreak of the Korean War, this led to orders for hundreds of aircraft being placed. The US Army would ultimately order 970 Beavers, more than half of the overall production run for the type. Soon, the Beaver grew to become an export success as orders for the type increased from customers around the world. Individual military services of more than 30 different nations would ultimately be included amongst its operators. In later life, as the type was gradually phased out of military service, many examples underwent conversion work so that they could continue to be operated as civilian aircraft instead. During the 1960s, de Havilland developed an improved model of the Beaver, the Mk.III Turbo Beaver, which was equipped with a Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6 turboprop engine. A total of sixty aircraft were built during the late 1960s. In 1967, when production of the type finally ceased, a total of 1,657 DHC-2 Beavers had been constructed. The Beaver was designed for flight in rugged and remote areas of the world. Its STOL capability made it ideal for areas normally only accessible by canoe or foot. Because the aircraft often flies to remote locations and in cold climates, its oil reservoir filler is located in the cockpit and oil can be filled in flight. A series of upgrades to the basic design were incorporated. One major customer introduced the use of flat steps replacing the earlier tubes, a feature now almost universal. In 1987, the Canadian Engineering Centennial Board named the DHC-2 as one of the top ten Canadian engineering achievements of the 20th century.Cooper, Russ. \\"Winged Workhorse.\\" Canadian Geographic magazine, July/August 2007, p. 26. =Recent developments= A Beaver on floats DHC-2 MK. III Turbo Beaver At one point in its production, plans to license-build the Beaver in New Zealand were proposed. The remaining tooling was purchased by Viking Air of Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, which manufactures replacement parts for most of the early de Havilland line. The company markets and sells the remanufactured DHC-2T Turbo Beaver, an improved variant of the aircraft which has been upgraded with a PT6A-34, which enables an increased maximum gross takeoff weight of and the carriage of up to of freight, a roughly 25 per cent increase in usable payload.\\"DHC-2T Turbo Beaver: The Legend Continues.\\" vikingair.com.

The ownership of the certificates gives the company the exclusive right to manufacture new aircraft. Viking has stated its interest in the potential restart of production of the Beaver, and commented that, dependent upon market demand, the firm may offer two separate models of the Beaver, one intended to be close to the design of the original batch, and another incorporating various improvements such as new avionics, engines, and doors, as well as likely being stretched to provide increased internal space.Sarsfield, Kate. \\"Viking restarts Twin Otter production.\\" Flight International, 2 April 2007.Sarsfield, Kate. \\"Beaver to bring back bush aircraft.\\" Flight International, 8 April 2003.

In September 2017 the Transportation Safety Board of Canada recommended stall warning devices be mandated for commercial Beaver operators. In March 2019, Harbour Air announced plans to convert a DHC-2 Beaver to an electric aircraft and eventually to convert its entire fleet of aircraft. The first test flight of the aircraft took place in Vancouver in December 2019. Design The de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver is a single-engined high-wing propeller-driven STOL aircraft, principally operated as a bush plane and other utility roles, such as cargo and passenger hauling, aerial application (crop dusting and aerial topdressing), and general civil aviation purposes; aviation publication Plane & Pilot described the type as being \\"arguably the best bush plane ever built\\".Vivon, Michael. \\"Sixty years in the sky: de Havilland Beaver.\\" Plane & Pilot, 1 September 2007. The Beaver was designed to operate in all seasons and the majority of weather conditions; a large proportion were also equipped with floats for buoyancy in water; it reportedly possesses favourable performance characteristics for a floatplane. As a result of its favourable characteristics as a hard working and productive aircraft, the Beaver has had a lengthy service life and many examples have been remanufactured or have otherwise received life extension modifications. The Beaver is typically powered by a single Pratt & Whitney R-985 Wasp Junior radial engine. In order to provide the necessary weight balance for optimal loading flexibility, the engine was mounted as far rearwards as possible, resulting in elements intruding into the cockpit space, such as the oil tank being positioned within the center console between the pilot and copilot's feet and the main fuel tank within the forward belly of the aircraft, which also improves accessibility for replenishment. Many Beavers have had wingtip tanks also installed; careful fuel management between the various fuel tanks is required throughout flights in order to maintain the aircraft's center of gravity. The remanufactured DHC-2T Turbo Beaver is equipped with a PT6A-34 turboprop engine. The Beaver is functionally shaped in order to accommodate a useful and sizable payload, typically close to , even when equipped with floats. While the front doors are narrow, the aft doors are wider, having been designed to facilitate the loading of 55-gallon barrels, either upright or on their sides. The Beaver is considered a 'working' aircraft, which was designed for vigorous use. In addition to cargo, passengers can also be carried; when appropriately fitted out, the Beaver Mk.I can accommodate up to seven passengers while the more spacious Beaver Mk.III can hold a maximum of 11. Various alterations have been approved, including alternative seating arrangements, enlarged cargo doors, larger windows and smaller batteries have been approved for use. During takeoff, both the ailerons and flaps are lowered, which is a relatively uncommon design approach but results in substantially elevated STOL performance. The flaps can be deployed to an extreme range, extending out at full to a 58-degree position; the flight manual notes that the full setting is recommended only for performing emergency landings. In the skies, the Beaver is relatively easy to handle, having been described as possessing light and comfortable controls; however, effective application of the rudder is necessitated in order to counteract adverse yaw. It should be flown with a relatively nose-low pitch attitude to maintain airspeed. Reportedly, the aircraft is very easy to land, even upon less than calm water conditions. Operational history RNZAF Beaver that supported the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition PZL engine modification Despite the fact that production ceased in 1967, hundreds of Beavers are still flying‚Äîmany of them heavily modified to adapt to changes in technology and needs. Kenmore Air of Kenmore, Washington provides Beaver and Otter airframes with zero-hour fatigue-life ratings, and owns dozens of supplemental type certificates (STCs) for aircraft modifications. These modifications are so well known and desirable in the aviation community, rebuilt Beavers are often called \\"Kenmore Beavers\\" or listed as having \\"Kenmore mods\\" installed.\\"Beaver Rebuild Program.\\" Kenmore Air, 21 May 2007. Retrieved: 20 November 2009. The original Wasp Jr radial engine of the Beaver is long out of production, so repair parts are getting harder to find. Some aircraft conversion stations have addressed this problem by replacing the piston engine with a turboprop engine such as the PT6. The added power and lighter installed weight, together with greater availability of kerosene fuel instead of high-octane aviation gasoline, make this a desirable modification, but at a high financial cost. The Beaver was deployed by the British Army Air Corps during the Troubles, at least until 1979, for photo-reconnaissance missions. One of them was hit seven times by machine gun fire in South County Armagh, near the border with the Republic of Ireland in November 1979, while taking valuable photos of an IRA checkpoint.

From 1971 to 1987 he was a member of the electronic group Tangerine Dream. Initially a drummer with The Agitation, later renamed Agitation Free, his primary focus eventually shifted to keyboards and synthesizers as the group moved away from its psychedelic rock origins. While he was not the first musician to use an analog sequencer, he was probably the first to turn it into a live performance instrument, thus laying the rhythmic foundation for classic Tangerine Dream pieces and indeed for the whole Berlin school sound. After his departure from the group, he founded the Sonic Images record label, a new-age music label called Earthtone and the Berlin Symphonic Film Orchestra, and produced a number of solo music works. After leaving Tangerine Dream, his only live concert was on 9 October 1991 at the Astoria Theatre in London. He performed on stage with Edgar Rothermich (a.k.a. Richard E. Roth) who is also his producer and engineer on all his solo projects and film music after 1990. Franke moved to Los Angeles in 1991 to pursue film work. In 1995 he scored the AFI short Requiem. He may be best known for composing the music for the science fiction television series Babylon 5, as well as the score of the anime movie Tenchi Muyo! in Love and in 2005 the music for German musical Ludwig¬≤ (with Konstantin Wecker).

For economics, see historical school of economics. The German Historical School of Jurisprudence is a 19th-century intellectual movement in the study of German law. With Romanticism as its background, it conceived of law as the organic expression of a national consciousness (Volksgeist). It stood in opposition to an earlier movement called Vernunftrecht (Rational Law). Overview The Historical School is based on the writings and teachings of Gustav von Hugo and especially Friedrich Carl von Savigny. Natural lawyers held that law could be discovered only by rational deduction from the nature of man. The basic premise of the German Historical School is that law is not to be regarded as an arbitrary grouping of regulations laid down by some authority. Rather, those regulations are to be seen as the expression of the convictions of the people, in the same manner as language, customs and practices are expressions of the people. The law is grounded in a form of popular consciousness called the Volksgeist. Laws can stem from regulations by the authorities, but more commonly they evolve in an organic manner over time without interference from the authorities. The ever-changing practical needs of the people play a very important role in this continual organic development. In the development of a legal system, is it the professional duty of lawyers ‚Äì in the sense of the division of labor in society ‚Äì to base their academic work on law on ascertaining the will of the people. In this way, lawyers embody the popular will. The German Historical School was divided into Romanists and the Germanists. The Romanists, to whom Savigny also belonged, held that the Volksgeist springs from the reception of the Roman law. While the Germanists (Karl Friedrich Eichhorn, Jakob Grimm, Georg Beseler, Otto von Gierke) saw medieval German Law as the expression of the German Volksgeist. The German Historical School has had considerable influence on the academic study of law in Germany. Georg Friedrich Puchta and Bernhard Windscheid continued the Romanist vein founded by Savigny, leading to the so-called Pandektenwissenschaft which is seen as Begriffsjurisprudenz (conceptual jurisprudence).  Criticism  Karl Marx devoted an 1842 essay \\"The philosophical manifesto of the historical school of law\\" to criticizing the historical school of law, calling it the \\"sole frivolous product\\" of the eighteenth century.

He is best known for his in-ring work in Smoky Mountain Wrestling, Extreme Championship Wrestling, and World Wrestling Entertainment. Snow has also held various backstage positions for professional wrestling promotions. Snow worked as a road agent for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA, later Impact Wrestling) from 2010 to 2017 and has owned Ohio Valley Wrestling since 2018. Professional wrestling career =Early career (1982‚Äì1995)= Sarven attended a professional wrestling tryout camp held by Ole and Gene Anderson. There he met Jim Lancaster, promoter of Ohio's Midwest Championship Wrestling, who agreed to train him. Lancaster later described Sarven as \\"a leader in the ring\\" who \\"had drive and natural ability\\". He made his debut on May 22, 1982. Sarven defeated Lancaster on May 5, 1985, for the Midwest Championship Wrestling title. Sarven wrestled in various independent promotions throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, capturing both tag team and singles titles, but failed to make any big breaks. In 1993 he competed in the WWF as a jobber losing to Marty Jannetty and The Undertaker under the name Steve Moore. He gained a reputation as \\"the best-kept secret in wrestling\\". Sarven helped train future Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) Hall of Fame member and NWA World Heavyweight Champion Dan Severn. During this time he would sometimes wrestle as Shinobi, a ninja-style masked gimmick. He wrestled in the November 19, 1994, tournament for the vacant NWA World Heavyweight Championship, but he lost to Chris Candido, the eventual winner of the tournament. From 1995-1997, Snow operated a professional wrestling school called \\"Body Slammers\\" in Lima, Ohio, hiring D'Lo Brown as an assistant trainer. It has since branched out with one of his trainers running \\"Bodyslammers\\" in Ottawa. =Extreme Championship Wrestling (1995)= After a tour of Japan, Sarven wrestled a match in Michigan against Sabu, an Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) regular, who suggested he try ECW. After making his debut against The Tazmaniac and losing via pinfall on February 4, 1995, Sarven faced Chris Benoit as Al Snow, in a 15-minute match that was hailed as one of the best of the year. =Smoky Mountain Wrestling (1995)= Sarven was also being courted by Jim Cornette for his Smoky Mountain Wrestling federation. ECW booker Paul Heyman agreed to let him work for both companies. Sarven soon found that he was not being utilized by ECW and went to Smoky Mountain full-time. In Smoky Mountain Wrestling, Snow teamed with Unibomb (Glenn Jacobs, later to be known as Kane) as The Dynamic Duo and defeated The Rock 'n' Roll Express for the SMW Tag Team Championship. Both wrestlers caught the attention of the World Wrestling Federation and were signed by the end of 1995. =World Wrestling Federation (1995‚Äî1997)=  Various gimmicks (1995‚Äî1996)  Sarven began working for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) when he signed a contract in August 1995. Sarven wrestled under numerous gimmicks in the WWF, such as Avatar a Ninja Ranger with Sarven coming to the ring unmasked, putting on a mask to wrestle, then removing it afterwards. The gimmick was based on Mighty Morphin Power Rangers whose popularity the company wanted to capitalize on at that time and during his short run Sarven's WWF debut as Avatar took place on the October 23, 1995, episode of Monday Night RAW, defeating Bryan Walsh, one month after his debut he was supposed to be the 3rd man for The Underdogs at Survivor Series but got replaced by Bob Holly for unknown reasons and after this, he partnered with Aldo Montoya, his two final matches as Avatar were against Sycho Sid & 1-2-3 Kid in a tag team match partnered with Aldo Montoya and his final match was against Isaac Yankem. On February 20, 1996, Sarven wrestled as Shinobi, a \\"ninja assassin\\" hired by Jim Cornette to dispose of Shawn Michaels, who defeated Shinobi in quick fashion.  New Rockers (1996‚Äî1997)  Sarven received his first mainstream exposure with the WWF as Leif Cassidy, the tag team partner of Marty Jannetty in February 1996. The duo were promoted as The New Rockers, a throwback to the original Rockers team of Jannetty and Shawn Michaels. Eventually, Jannetty left, and Sarven was reduced to jobbing for mid-carders in January 1997. In the late 1990s, WWF and ECW began to cross-promote their organizations to counteract the success of World Championship Wrestling (WCW); Sarven was one of the wrestlers sent to Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW). His last appearance in WWF in September 1997 was a loss to Tiger Ali Singh at WWF One Night Only. =Return to ECW (1997‚Äì1998)= Sarven found success back in ECW, billed once again as Al Snow. Sarven developed a new character gimmick after reading about abnormal psychology and finding a mannequin head on the street near the ECW Arena during a Mummers Day parade. He got the idea to portray an individual with a schizophrenic disorder using the head as a prop for projection. In this role, Sarven received a lot of fan and management support for his J.O.B. Squad storyline, which promoted him as being driven insane by his years as a jobber for the WWF. In the storyline, Snow, upset at his lot in life, asked Cactus Jack what he had to do to get anywhere in wrestling. Jack said to Snow that to become famous he had to \\"get a little head\\" (meaning he had to be willing to sleep with/have sex with the booker). Snow, however took this literally, and thus he started coming to the ring with a mannequin head (with the words \\"Help Me\\" written backwards on its forehead, an action Snow himself began to do) whom he talked to as if it were a real person, which prompted ECW crowds to chant \\"We want Head\\", an intentional double entendre. ECW promoters handed out styrofoam mannequin heads at wrestling shows, and audience members started waving them and shouting, \\"Head! Head! Head!\\" in time to \\"Breathe\\" by The Prodigy, his entrance music. The entire audience would then throw the heads into the ring before the match started. The biggest match of his ECW career came when he wrestled for the promotion's World Heavyweight Championship, losing to Shane Douglas at Wrestlepalooza in 1998. =Return to the WWF/E (1998‚Äî2008)= Hardcore Championship pursuits (1998‚Äì1999) Sarven was then recalled to the company, where he continued his gimmick of talking to \\"Head,\\" creating some of the more memorable humorous skits of \\"The Attitude Era\\" including fighting himself in a hardcore match (which he won by putting himself through a table) and his short lived comedy tag team with Steve Blackman. Al Snow with \\"Head\\" in 1999.Snow received some mainstream publicity in 1999 when Wal-Mart pulled his action figure from their shelves after Sabrena Parton, a professor at Kennesaw State University, complained that \\"Head\\" was a \\"decapitated woman's head\\" that sent an inappropriate message about violence towards women. Parton was quoted as saying \\"What kind of message would this toy send children about brutalization of women?\\" Sarven used the story as part of an angle in which the controversy caused Al Snow to suffer from depression. At WrestleMania XV, Snow lost a WWF Hardcore Championship triple threat match involving Hardcore Holly and Billy Gunn. During the summer of 1999, at the conclusion of a storyline where Head was impaled with a spike by Prince Albert, Snow replaced Head with a chihuahua named Pepper, who he claimed talked to him. A variety of segments were broadcast showing Snow's interactions with the dog, including bringing Pepper to the ring to either \\"participate\\" in matches or be held by the broadcast team. This led to a storyline where Big Boss Man kidnapped Pepper. Boss Man agreed to return the dog if Snow defeated him in a match for the Hardcore title; however, after losing the match he reneged and kept the dog. Later, in a segment on SmackDown, Boss Man invited Snow to his hotel room to discuss the situation, before serving Snow dinner which was then revealed to be Pepper. (In a 2008 interview, Snow said that this angle had been based on a story of Mr. Fuji having done something similar with a neighborhood dog.) The feud culminated at a \\"Kennel from Hell\\" match at Unforgiven, which consisted of a regular cage which was surrounded by a Hell in a Cell structure, with \\"a trained pack of wild dogs\\" in between the two, and the objective was to escape both cages without being attacked by the dogs. Al Snow won the match. Various alliances and feuds (1999‚Äì2004) Snow would later team with real life friend Mick Foley and became tag team champions with him for a short amount of time, but turned heel by betraying him due to Foley's jokes about him in his autobiography, Have A Nice Day, and his growing jealousy of Foley's tag team partner, The Rock. He would later turn face again due to fan reaction. Snow was often the butt of Foley's jokes during Foley's tenure as the Commissioner in 2000. However, they are close friends in real life.Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (Foreword p.x) Foley continued to use Snow as the butt of many jokes in his second book, Foley Is Good: And the Real World Is Faker than Wrestling. In early 2000, he began to team with Steve Blackman as an \\"odd couple\\" tag team called Head Cheese (the \\"cheese\\" part being given various explanations, including Snow's claim that Blackman was a voracious eater of cheese and later his attempt to force him to wear a Green Bay Packers \\"Cheesehead\\" hat). At WrestleMania 2000 the two suffered a loss against Test and Albert. Also in the same year, Snow won the European Championship from Perry Saturn. He then began a tongue-in-cheek gimmick of entering the ring to various European countries' native music, with his theme song sung in the language of the country, and wearing attire which would suit the stereotype of that country. This continued until he lost the title to William Regal. In 2001, Snow tried to rally support from the fans to vote for him as the new Commissioner of the company following Foley's on- screen firing by Vince McMahon in December 2000. By March 2001, a match was set up between Snow and Regal to determine the new Commissioner, which resulted in Regal winning. Snow then took some time off from the ring in order to commit more time for the reality show Tough Enough. He made his return to the ring in October 2001 during the InVasion era and challenged Christian for the European Championship at Survivor Series, which he lost. Snow's last championship reign came on March 11, 2002, when he defeated Goldust to win his last Hardcore Championship. He lost the title to his former Tough Enough student, Maven, a few days later. He was drafted to SmackDown! as part of the 2002 Brand Extension, where he teamed up with Maven. After taking time off again for another season of Tough Enough, Snow returned as a member of the Raw roster and eventually became a commentator for Sunday Night Heat alongside Jonathan Coachman. When Coachman sided with Eric Bischoff, Snow followed suit, turning heel. The two feuded with Jim Ross and Jerry Lawler, and briefly replaced them at the Raw announce table after a victory at Unforgiven in 2003. When Tough Enough IV came to SmackDown!, Snow was on the scene and turned face once again. Commentator and ECW (2004‚Äì2006) In September 2004 Snow left Sunday Night Heat as a commentator and went to Velocity. In June 2006, Snow returned to wrestling full-time as a member of the new ECW brand. His first appearance in the new brand was in the WWE vs ECW Battle Royal at the \\"WWE vs. ECW Head to Head\\" special, where he was accompanied by Head. He was eliminated from the match. On the June 13, 2006, debut of ECW on Sci-Fi, Snow participated in an Extreme Battle Royal, which was won by Sabu. Over the next six months, he was used sporadically, mostly as a jobber, losing to people such as Test and Kevin Thorn. Developmental and departure (2007‚Äì2008) Snow then returned with the company as a trainer at Ohio Valley Wrestling in 2007. On the February 3, 2007 OVW TV tapings, Snow was named the new OVW Troubleshooter by Danny Davis in response to Danny Basham's WWE release. On Raw XV, the 15th-Anniversary special on December 10, 2007, Snow participated in the 15th Anniversary Battle Royal. After WWE ceased affiliations with Ohio Valley Wrestling in February 2008, Sarven was released from his position as a trainer. =Independent circuit (2005‚Äì2006, 2009‚Äìpresent)= Prior to returning to WWE's active roster in 2006, Snow was allowed to compete on the independent circuit. In 2006, Snow was pinned by the Millennium Wrestling Federation (MWF) Heavyweight Champion \\"Sudden Impact\\" Dylan Kage of Paul Bearer's Trifecta stable at MWF Fireworks On The 4th. Since early 2009, Snow has regularly competed in several independent promotions in the U.S. and Europe, especially in the U.K. and Germany. In March 2009, he made an appearance in Chikara's King of Trios tournament, teaming up with Glacier and D'Lo Brown. =Total Nonstop Action Wrestling / Impact Wrestling (2008‚Äì2017)= In the lead-up to the December 7, 2008, TNA show Final Resolution, Mick Foley assigned himself as the special guest enforcer for the match between Kurt Angle and Rhino. Angle said he had hired \\"another former World Champion\\" and someone who had co-held a world tag team title with Foley. This person would debut during Angle's match to \\"take care of Foley\\". And on the night in question, Al Snow revealed himself to be the mystery ally of Angle, who interrupted the match by slapping Foley. The distraction allowed Angle to beat Rhino. In March 2010, Sarven received a tryout as an agent for TNA Wrestling. He made his return to television on the July 15, 2010, edition of Impact!, aligning himself with fellow ECW alumni Tommy Dreamer, Raven, Stevie Richards, Rhino, Brother Devon, Pat Kenney and Mick Foley in their invitation by Dixie Carter to TNA. The following week, TNA president Dixie Carter agreed to give the ECW alumni their own reunion pay‚Äìper‚Äìview event, Hardcore Justice: The Last Stand, as a celebration of hardcore wrestling and a final farewell to the company. At the event Snow was defeated by Rhino in a three-way match, which also included Brother Runt. After that, he appeared onscreen in his real-life role as company agent on multiple occasions, often alongside fellow agents Ace \\"D'Lo Brown\\" Conner and Pat Kenney. Sarven currently holds the title of producer for the company. In Spring 2011, Snow returned to OVW, dividing his time between his TNA duties and work as a show producer for OVW. In November of that year, OVW became TNA's official developmental territory. In May 2012, Snow began appearing as a judge in the monthly Gut Check segment on Impact Wrestling. The following July, Snow started a storyline rivalry with Joey Ryan, who had been denied a spot on the TNA roster, following his appearance on TNA Gut Check. After Snow tricked Ryan into signing a contract for a match, the two met on October 14 at Bound for Glory, where Snow wrestled only his second match for TNA, losing to Ryan, following interference from Matt Morgan. Al Snow with Head at a show in 2013. On January 12, 2013, Snow took part in Joker's Wild (which aired May 3, 2013), teaming with recent rival Joey Ryan, in a loss against Matt Morgan and Robbie T. On the August 7, 2014, edition of Impact Wrestling, Snow returned to team with Team 3D (Bully Ray and Devon) and Tommy Dreamer against Ethan Carter III, Rhino, Big Rycklon and Gene Snitsky in an eight-man Hardcore War in a winning effort. On the February 13, 2015, edition of Impact Wrestling (which was taped on January 29), Snow returned to TV as a heel, where he was seen in the SSE Hydro, calling out Scottish wrestler and British Boot Camp 2 contestant, Grado. Grado would come out to the ring where Snow would give him the opportunity to retire from wrestling, Grado would not take the offer. On the February 20 edition of Impact Wrestling (also taped January 29) Snow would face Grado in a losing effort, after which he would then go on to shake Grado's hand turning face in the process. Afterwards, the Beat Down Clan (BDC) would go on to attack both Snow and Grado, but were saved by the debuting Drew Galloway, would fend off the BDC and who would then stand tall in the ring alongside Al Snow and his friend, Grado. At Bound for Glory 2015 Snow competed in the Bound for Gold Gauntlet. On the March 29, 2016 Impact Wrestling Snow returned as a heel attacking Grado backstage. On the April 5, 2016 Impact Wrestling TNA Management Director Billy Corgan suspended Al Snow for the week without pay and said next week he must apologise. When Al Snow returned from his suspension week, he entered the ring and said the ease new talents get today with earning respect and a name in the professional wrestling business, drove him crazy as he and others of his and generations before him needed to get some for quite a long time and fight hard to prove themselves worthy back then. He invited Mahabali Shera to the ring and apologized to him for attacking him and Grado, breaking Grado's arm in the process. Shera shook hands with him, only for Al Snow to betray and attack him once they went out of the ring. At a backstage segment, Al Snow said angrily he doesn't need to apologize and explain himself to rookies and if they want his apology and respect they need to defeat him in a match. A week after, Al Snow had a match with Shera in which before and a bit during the match he has blamed the wrestling changes on the fans and said they are cowards for sitting behind the barricades and not coming to the ring to face him. Shera gave a good fight, but Al Snow eventually won the match. In the May 10 episode of Impact!, Shera and Snow had a rematch where Al Snow played games and almost won with his cheating tactics, however, he eventually failed to win due to Grado involving himself in the match, making sure Shera wins. At backstage, a bit later, Al Snow was interviewed and talked angrily, cursing Grado and Shera in the process. On May 24 episode of Impact!, Al Snow went on to win a back and forth street fight against Grado with the help of the debuting Basille Baraka and Baron Dax, thus forming the tag team faction known as The Tribunal. On November 10, episode of Impact, The Tribunal attacked him until Shera made the save, turning face once again in the process. On December 8 episode of Impact Wrestling, Snow and Shera defeated The Tribunal in a Double Strap Match to end the feud. On June 19, 2017, Al Snow was released from Impact Wrestling. =Ohio Valley Wrestling (2018‚Äìpresent)= On April 7, 2018, it was reported Snow purchased Ohio Valley Wrestling.

They along with other professional wrestlers (including Joe E Legend, Doug Williams, Phil Powers, Jonny Storm, John Klinger, and many more) held tryouts in February 2016. In April 2019, local media in Louisville reported that the academy had applied to the Kentucky Department of Education for formal accreditation as a vocational school. The academy has developed a two-year, 60-credit hour program (on the semester system) in all aspects of the wrestling business, ranging from in-ring performance to writing and TV production. Assuming state approval is received, the Louisville academy will start accepting applications for the vocational program in May 2019 and start accredited instruction that August.

Co-written by Ross Owen Williams, who also co-authored Bob Holly's autobiography The Hardcore Truth, the book was released in April 2019.

It is based on the C programming language and is implemented in the Aurora toolset. Neverscript, an open source 3rd party editor, has been created for the Mac OS X and Linux versions of Neverwinter Nights because the Aurora toolset has not been ported to those platforms. NWScript is also used in the video games The Witcher, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II The Sith Lords, which use the Odyssey Engine. Neverwinter Nights 2, the sequel to the original NWN, features a modified version of this scripting language. Syntax While based on C, NWScript does not have many functions from the C family, excluding logical and binary / ternary operators and some mathematical functions. Function source code is not accessible to the end-user, but the correct syntax is defined in a script file called nwscript.nss. The users can create their own functions, and these can be included in other scripts through the #include directive, which works slightly differently than in C++. =Hello world= NWScript has no way to directly target the screen for output. Instead, for instance, in-game characters such as the player character can be made to speak the typical \\"Hello world\\" example message. This script puts a \\"Hello world\\" message in the player's message log. For it to work, it should be placed in the OnClientEnter event of the module's properties. void main() { SendMessageToPC(GetEnteringObject(), \\"Hello world\\"); } The first line is the void main function which is the function that a NWScript will start at. In the third line, the text Hello world is sent to the player's in-game message log. =Data types= NWScript allows structs, but not objects. The following common data types are available in NWScript: * integer (int) * float * string * struct NWScript has also introduced some data types for purposes of the Neverwinter Nights game: * object (refers to game objects, such as NPCs and placeable objects). * location (refers to the in-game location of an object, consisting of an area object reference, a vector and a float describing the position and facing within the area). * talent (refers to spells and abilities). * vector (refers to coordinates of an object, and is a construct of three floats). * itemproperty (refers to abilities on items such as weapons for use in the game). * effect (refers to game-mechanics-altering effects on objects; for example effects created by spells, diseases, and displayed visual effects). File format When saving a script, the Aurora Toolset saves the plain text of the script as a file with a .nss filename extension. When compiling the script, a .ncs containing Bytecode to be run on the NWScript Virtual Machine file is created. If turned on, a debug information file with an .ndb extension is also created. The game uses only the .ncs file (and the .ndb file if called). When saving the created module, the files are packed into a single module file with a .mod extension, along with other information about the layout of the module.

The game was created and developed by 42 Entertainment. Many of the same personnel had previously created an ARG for the film A.I. titled The Beast. I Love Bees was commissioned by Microsoft, Halo 2's publisher and Bungie's ultimate parent company at the time. I Love Bees was first advertised by a hidden message in a Halo 2 trailer; players who investigated the titular website discovered that the pages appeared to be hacked by a mysterious intelligence. As players solved puzzles, audio logs were posted to the ilovebees.com site which gradually revealed more of the fictional back-story, involving a marooned artificial intelligence stranded on Earth and its attempts to put itself back together. 250,000 people viewed the ilovebees website when it was launched in July 2004, and more than 500,000 returned to the site every time the pages were updated. More than three million visitors viewed the site over the course of three months, and thousands of people around the world participated in the game. I Love Bees won numerous awards for its innovation and helped spawn numerous other alternate reality games for video games. Overview Alternate reality games or ARGs are designed to involve fans of video games or other media in a form of viral marketing which CNET described as encompassing \\"real-life treasure hunting, interactive storytelling, video games and online [communities]\\". I Love Bees began when jars of honey were received in the mail by people who had previously participated in alternate reality games. The jars contained letters leading to the I Love Bees website and a countdown. At around the same time, theatrical trailers for Halo 2 concluded with the Xbox logo and a URL, Xbox.com, that quickly flashed a link to ilovebees.com, ostensibly a hacked site related to beekeeping. Both events, not connected publicly for several weeks, caused the curious to visit the website ilovebees.com. The site, which appeared to be dedicated to honey sales and beekeeping, was covered in confusing random characters and sentence fragments. Dana, the ostensible webmaster of the ilovebees site, created a weblog stating that something had gone wrong with her website, and the site itself had been hacked. Suspecting that this was a mystery that could be unraveled, Halo and ARG fans spread the link and began to work on figuring out what was going on. The gameplay of I Love Bees tasked players around the world to work together to solve problems, with little or no direction or guidance. For example, the game presented players with 210 pairs of global positioning system coordinates and time codes, with no indications to what the locations referred to. Players eventually figured out the coordinates referred to pay phones and the times to when the phones would ring; one player in Florida stayed by a phone while Hurricane Frances was minutes away in order to recite answers to prerecorded questions. Other phone calls were made by live persons known as \\"operators\\"; these calls allowed players to interact with the characters of the games in spontaneous and occasionally humorous ways. Other players treated the corrupted data on ilovebees.com as encrypted files to decipher, or used image files found on the web server to solve puzzles. After players completed certain tasks, they were rewarded with new installments to an audio drama which revealed the reasons for the ilovebees.com malfunction. Over time, the game's mechanisms for contacting players grew more complex. Players were sent messages via email, called on their cell phones, and travelled to arranged meetings between players and characters. The game culminated by inviting players of the game to visit one of four cinemas where they could get a chance to play Halo 2 before its release and collect a commemorative DVD. Plot The game's plot begins with a military spaceship crashing to Earth in an unknown location, leaving the craft's controlling artificial intelligence or AI damaged. This AI, known as the \\"Operator\\" or \\"Melissa\\", is not alone; other AI programs share its system. In an effort to survive and contact any surviving allies, Melissa transfers herself to a San Francisco-area web server, which happens to host a bee enthusiast website known as I Love Bees. To the distress of Dana Awbrey, the website's maintainer, Melissa's attempts to send signals began to appear largely as codes, hidden in images or other text, interfering with the operation of the I Love Bees site and corrupting much of the content. Dana, attempting to regain control over the corrupted website, accidentally erases data which comprises part of Melissa's memory. Furious, Melissa lashes out at the webmaster, obtaining pictures of her using the webcam on her computer and promising to take revenge. Alarmed, Dana announces that she is removing herself from the situation and is taking a previously planned trip to China earlier than expected. All AI units contain a program called SPDR, short for System Peril Distributed Reflex. As SPDR attempts to fix Melissa, random dumps from Melissa's memory began to spill into the website, largely detailing Melissa's history and revealing the presence of a malicious Trojan-horse virus known as the \\"Pious Flea.\\" The Spider tries to erase the Flea but is outwitted, as Melissa erases the Spider instead of the Flea. The Flea continues to overwrite Melissa's programming with its own mysterious goals, with it eventually being revealed that it is actually an espionage AI more properly called the Seeker, built by the Covenant. With the assistance of other characters revealed by audio chapters, the fictional protagonists break into a secure military installation and manage to deactivate a Forerunner device which is implied to begin the firing sequence of the Halo installations. However, the price paid for the deactivation is a powerful energy transmission alerting the Covenant to the location of Earth. Whole again, Melissa sees how she has been manipulated by the Pious Flea, and returns to her time. I Love Bees ends with the Covenant invading Earth, corresponding to a major plot point in Halo 2. Due to Bungie's commitment to the development of Halo 2 during I Love Bees run, they were unable to assist 42 Entertainment with story creation, and so the ARG's story is only tangentially related to the main Halo storyline. The events of I Love Bees were, therefore, originally not considered to be Halo canon. In a 2006 interview, however, Bungie's content manager Frank O'Connor expressly confirmed that I Love Bees is part of \\"things that we embrace as canon.\\"The 1UP Show: Episode 07/28/2006 , 27:49 - 27:55 References to elements of I Love Bees have since appeared in the 2006 Halo Graphic NovelAmazon.com - The Halo Graphic Novel (Hardcover) and the 2009 Halo Encyclopedia,Amazon.com - Halo Encyclopedia (Hardcover) both of which are official canon. Development Jordan Weisman, CEO of 42 Entertainment I Love Bees developer, 42 Entertainment, was founded by Jordan Weisman, the former creative director for Microsoft's Xbox division. 42 Entertainment had previously created the first ARG, The Beast, which had been used to promote the movie A.I.. Other members of the I Love Bees team included Sean Stewart, a World Fantasy Award-award- winning author who served as I Love Bees writer, and Jim Stewartson, I Love Bees technical lead who produced the first commercial 3D game delivered by the internet. Weisman stated that the goal of I Love Bees was to utilize every person who interacted with the game, and to use any electronic resource to do so: \\"If we could make your toaster print something we would. Anything with an electric current running through it. A single story, a single gaming experience, with no boundaries. A game that is life itself.\\" 42 Entertainment conceived I Love Bees as a radio drama, and used the pay phones as a way to excite players. Chris Di Cesare, Microsoft's director of marketing, stated that the radio drama's similarities with War of the Worlds was intentional, and that \\"[ILB] remains true to the radio drama tradition of Orson Welles that we were shooting for and also allowed us to tell the story in an unorthodox way.\\" In order to prevent non-players from being scared by the sounds of gunfire from the pay phones, 42 Entertainment established passwords that had to be repeated. Stewart described writing for the game as more enjoyable than writing printed fiction, both for the money and the unique experience of ARGs as opposed to other media: > The audiences that we built for those campaigns are having a different > experience. They're having a collective experience in which they literally > bring different pieces, one to the next, swap them back and forth, gossip > about them. They have an element of cocreation and a collaborative nature > that doesn't really have an analog that I've been able to think of in the > arts. Reception I Love Bees is credited with helping drive attention to Halo 2; former Electronic Gaming Monthly editor Dan Hsu stated in an interview that \\"I Love Bees really got existing gamers and other consumers talking about the universe of [Halo].\\" Billy Pidgeon, a game analyst, noted that I Love Bees achieved what it had been designed to do: \\"This kind of viral guerrilla marketing worked ... Everyone started instant messaging about it and checking out the site.\\" I Love Bees not only received coverage from gaming publications, but attracted mainstream press attention as well. At its height, ilovebees received between two and three million unique visitors over the course of three months. 9,000 people also actively participated in the real- world aspects of the game. The players of I Love Bees themselves were quite varied. The target demographic for the promotion was younger males, but one player noted that even middle-aged men and women were engaged in the game. I Love Bees received several awards for its innovation. The design team was one of the recipients of the Innovation Award at the 5th annual Game Developers Choice Awards. I Love Bees was also announced as the winner of a Webby Award in the Game-Related category, presented by the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences. =Legacy= Along with 42 Entertainment's previous ARG known as The Beast, I Love Bees is credited with bringing greater attention to the fledgling marketing form; I Love Bees not only helped assuage fears by marketers about the costs of ARG failure, but attracted interest from other game developers in using alternate reality games to promote their own products. Before I Love Bees, The Guardian stated that \\"ARGs were destined to join Letsbuyit.com and Barcode Battlers in the e-dustbin of nice ideas that never really caught on\\"; the explosion of broadband internet access and a renewed interest in codes allowed I Love Bees to become wildly successful. Bungie would later use another ARG called \\"Iris\\" to promote Halo 2s sequel, Halo 3. I Love Bees also attracted attention in the wider discussion of user- based marketing and cooperation. Author Charles Leadbeater argued that I Love Bees was an example of \\"We-Think\\" collective thinking; Leadbeater noted that after the \\"puppet masters\\" began the game, I Love Bees \\"displayed all the characteristics of a mass movement, propelled into existence in a matter of weeks simply by collective enthusiasm guided by a few cyberspace 'avatars'\\". The game proved successful with gamers, as well as attracting nontraditional players who had no experience with Halo before joining the game. . In a 2016 Bandcamp interview, artist Ramona Andra Xavier, known for pioneering the Vaporwave musical genre under the pseudonym Vektroid (among others), claimed to be acutely influenced by \\"I Love Bees,\\" in its use of \\"hacked\\" websites, internet communities and IRL tasks to blur the lines between reality and fiction.

Sometimes the term is extended to cover cases in which the king moves out of check and reveals a discovered check from another piece (this is also known as a royal check); it does not generally apply to cases where the original checking piece is captured, but it does apply to cases where the check is actually a checkmate (since there's no term \\"cross-checkmate\\"). The cross- check is an essential tactic in winning some endgames such as those with two queens versus one, or a queen and pawn versus a queen. In these cases, the defense usually tries for a perpetual check and sometimes the stronger side can stop it only by a cross-check. Examples A cross-check occurs from time to time in games. It is an essential tactic in winning endgames such as two queens versus one queen, or queen and pawn versus queen, where it is used to stop a series of checks from the opponent and force the exchange of queens. It is also used in some chess problems. =Botvinnik vs. Minev game= Cross- checks are rare in actual play, though they do occur, and in some endgames, particularly queen endgames, they are very important. The position shown to the right is the final position in the famous queen endgame from the game Botvinnik vs. Minev between Mikhail Botvinnik and Nikolay Minev, Amsterdam Olympiad, 1954. In the position shown, after 91. Kc5!!, Black resigned because the promising looking checks 91...Qc7+, 91...Qg1+, 91...Qf2+ and 91...Qc2+ are answered by the cross-checks 92.Qc6+, 92.Qd4+, 92.Qd4+ and 92.Qc4+ respectively, forcing an exchange of queens in all cases, which will result in the promotion of the pawn and winning the game by a basic checkmate. This is an important theme in queen endgames: the weaker side often gives a series of checks, and it is frequently important for them to avoid simplifying cross- checks such as these in reply , . If the black queen attacks the pawn instead of checking it does no good since the promotion square of the pawn is protected by its queen. =Two queens versus one= In the position on the left from Botvinnik‚ÄìRavinsky,Botvinnik vs. Ravinsky Black resigned. With best play according to the endgame tablebase, 126...Kb3 127.Qf7+ Ka4 128.g8=Q Qg4+ 129.Kh6 Qh4+ 130.Kg7 Qg3+ 131.Kf8 Qd6+ 132.Qe7 Qh6+ 133.Qgg7 Qf4+ 134.Qgf7 Qb8+ and the position on the right is reached. Then the cross-check 135.Qee8+ (or Qfe8+) forks the king and queen, forces an exchange, and wins the game. =Anderson problem, 1919= Cross-checks are relatively infrequent in actual play, but are popular in chess problems since they make for a relatively unobvious solution. In the problem shown to the right, White is to move and mate in two moves against any defence. It is by G.F. Anderson and was first published in Il Secolo in 1919. The key 1.Kd6, threatening 2.Qb7#, gives the black king two flight squares, and two of the variations exploit these: 1...Kb6 2.Bc2# and 1...Kb4 2.Kxc6#. The other two defences exploit the fact that the key exposes the white king to checks, and are answered by cross- checks: 1...Rg6+ 2.Be6# and 1...Rd3+ 2.Bd5#. =Anderson problem, 1961= The problem to the right, also by G. F. Anderson (first published in The Observer in 1961) and also a mate in two, features no less than five cross-checks. The key is 1.Qb6 (threat: 2.Ne4#), with the following variations: :1...exf6+ 2.Nb7# :1...exd6+ 2.Nd7# :1...Nd4+ 2.Rf5# :1...Nxd6+ 2.Nd3# :1...Nf-other+ 2.Ne4# :1...Kxf6 2.Qb2# :1...Kxd6 2.Rd4# See also * Pawnless chess endgame References Bibliography  Further reading * John Rice, Chess Wizardry: The New ABC of Chess Problems (London, Batsford, 1996) External links * Three successive cross-checks in a game Category:Chess terminology Category:Chess problems Category:Chess tactics ","title":"Cross-check"},{"id":"853089","title":"St. George Dragons"},{"id":"853091","text":"The House of Mystery is the name of several horror, fantasy, and mystery Comics anthologies published by DC Comics. It had a companion series, House of Secrets. It is also the name of the titular setting of the series. First series =Genesis= House of Mystery started out as a horror anthology, featuring tales of the supernatural as well as supernatural-themed mystery stories. Issue #1 was dated December-January 1951. With the growing backlash against American horror comics in the mid-1950s, as well as the advent of the Comics Code Authority and its restrictions on horror-themed storylines (banning stories dealing with such supernatural fare as vampires and werewolves), the series quietly was revamped into dealing with science-fiction type monsters and other mystery-suspense type tales that were permitted by the Comics Code. =Superheroes= In the mid-1960s, the series was revamped to include superhero stories. From House of Mystery #143 (June 1964) through #155 (December 1966), \\"J'onn J'onzz, the Manhunter from Mars\\" headlined the book, as his back-up feature from Detective Comics was moved to House of Mystery. This was followed with the introduction of \\"Dial H for Hero\\" in issue #156 (January 1966),McAvennie, Michael \\"1960s\\" in Dolan, p. 116: \\"Writer Dave Wood and artist Jim Mooney put young Robby Reed in touch with the mysterious H-Dial.\\" which took over as headliner until #173 (March‚ÄìApril 1968). The Martian Manhunter was again relegated to back-up status during this time. =Return of horror= Cain and Gregory move out in the final issue of The House of Mystery, #321 (October 1983). Art by Michael Kaluta. With issue #174, EC Comics veteran Joe Orlando was hired by DC to take over as editor of House of Mystery. As the Comics Code Authority was now being challenged by both DC and Marvel over content restrictions, the series returned to its overt horror themes. The first issue under Orlando would be a reprint issue of old horror/suspense stories, as the new direction would truly begin with #175 (July-August 1968). The issue would introduce a new figure to the series, Cain, the \\"able care taker\\" of the House of Mystery who would introduce nearly all stories that would run in the series before its cancellation.McAvennie \\"1960s\\" in Dolan, p. 130: \\"Editor Joe Orlando decided that The House of Mystery was in need of renovation.\\" Cain would also host the spin-off humor series Plop! and later become a recurring character in Blue Devil and The Sandman. Artist Bernie Wrightson's first professional comic work was the story \\"The Man Who Murdered Himself\\" which appeared in issue #179 (March-April 1969).McAvennie \\"1960s\\" in Dolan, p. 132: \\"'The Man Who Murdered Himself' in House of Mystery was...the first DC story illustrated by Berni Wrightson (who left the \\"e\\" off his first name to distinguish himself from a famous diver.\\" Under Orlando's stewardship, the series won a good deal of recognition in the comics industry, including the \\"Shazam Award for Best Individual Short Story (Dramatic)\\" in 1972 for \\"The Demon Within\\" in #201 by John Albano and Jim Aparo, and the \\"Shazam Award for Best Humor Story\\" in 1972 for \\"The Poster Plague\\" by Steve Skeates and Sergio Aragon√©s. Limited Collectors' Edition #C-23 (Winter 1973) featured reprints of House of Mystery stories. House of Mystery #224 (April-May 1974) to #229 (Feb.-March 1975) were in the 100 Page Super Spectacular format. The series was in the Dollar Comics format for issues #251 (March-April 1977) to #259 (July-August 1978). House of Mystery featured stories by writers T. Casey Brennan (#260, 267, 268 and 274) and Scott Edelman (#257, 258, 260, 264, 266, 270, 272, 273). Orlando's tenure as editor ended with #257 (March-April 1978). Karen Berger became editor of the series with #292 (May 1981), her first for DC Comics. Under Berger, the series experimented with long-form storylines in the popular I‚Ä¶Vampire serial created by writer J. M. DeMatteis.Manning, Matthew K. \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 193 \\"Writer J. M. DeMatteis unveiled vampire/vampire hunter Andrew Bennett with the help of artist Tom Sutton in The House of Mystery #290.\\" \\"I... Vampire\\" revolved around the heroic vampire, Andrew Bennett, who sought to defeat his nemesis and former lover Mary Seward, the Queen of Blood. This series began in #290 (March 1981) and would last until #319 (August 1983), two issues before the title ended with #321 (October 1983). Since 2006, DC Comics has reprinted stories from the original run: three black and white Showcase Presents volumes have been published, reprinting the series from #174-194, #195-211 and #212-226, respectively. A one-shot reprint in color, Welcome Back to the House of Mystery, featured ten of the most highly regarded stories as selected by Alisa Kwitney in a Cain wraparound by Neil Gaiman and Sergio Aragon√©s, under the Vertigo Comics imprint. The first issue from 1951 was reissued as a Millennium Edition bearing the Vertigo imprint. Elvira's House of Mystery In 1986-1987, DC comics published a new series, Elvira's House of Mystery. It lasted 11 issues plus a special. The series was a quasi-follow up towards the original series, with famed horror movie hostess Elvira, Mistress of the Dark tasked by the House with finding Cain, though she spent much of her time making fun of him, introducing horror stories similar to the original series. One issue of this series, #3, was released without Comics Code Approval and contained significant implied nudity, but subsequent editorial comments in later issues stated that the experiment in releasing an unapproved issue was not considered successful. 2008 series DC's Vertigo imprint began a new ongoing series in May 2008, written by Lilah Sturges and Bill Willingham. It features at least one different story each issue, told by people trapped in a \\"purgatory-like house\\". The series ended in October 2011 with issue #42. The House The House of Mystery exists as a location in the DC Universe simultaneously just north of Louisville, Kentucky, where it was built and almost immediately abandoned by one Col. Braitwaithe before the American Civil War, and in The Dreaming. Very little is known about the House of Mystery in general. The architecture is indeterminate and changes periodically. The same holds true for the inside of the house: the rooms constantly shift, and one never enters the same room twice. The House of Mystery lies in the same graveyard as the House of Secrets, its companion. Whereas Abel resides in the House of Secrets, Cain makes the House of Mystery his abode. Cain is not the only person to have resided within the House; in addition to boarders, including Mister Mxyzptlk, Elvira took shelter within the House. Her brief stay in the House of Mystery is notable for two reasons: first, the House of Mystery is established as being the same House throughout its publication history. Three distinct personalities of the House are shown: the original horror House of Mystery, a dark humor \\"House of Weirdness\\"-style which harkened back to Cain's stint in Plop!, and the current version of the House of Mystery in Kentucky. The second reason is the timing of Elvira's stay. She took up residence during the Crisis on Infinite Earths. Elvira, tasked by the House of Mystery to find Cain, took over his role of host for a brief period, while Cain was relegated to being the butt of jokes during occasional cameos. The House of Mystery possesses sentience, along with mystic powers. It has possessed someone before, and merged with the House of Secrets briefly. This ties into the constantly shifting appearance of the House of Mystery. It was torn down in the metafictional The House of Mystery #321, but its existence was restored during the Crisis. Batman entered the house in The Brave and the Bold #93, tripped on a floorboard, and would have been shot had his pursuer's gun not jammed. He never actually met Cain, who instead narrates a story about him occurring in Scotland, which climaxes in a castle he describes as \\"a house of mystery\\" rather than \\"the House of Mystery\\". Superman teamed with Cain against Mister Mxyzptlk, who was attempting to take over the House, in DC Comics Presents #53. The House of Mystery appears mainly in various Vertigo titles, especially those tied into Neil Gaiman's Sandman; it has appeared briefly in Resurrection Man. Something called the House of Mystery appeared in 52 #18, where it seems to have been used for some time as a base for a team of detectives called the Croatoan Society, which counts both Detective Chimp and Ralph Dibny as members. It is unclear if the Croatoan's House of Mystery is meant to be the same as the original House of Mystery, a post-Infinite Crisis version of the original House of Mystery, or simply a different location with the same name. Cain's name appeared on this house's mailbox, implying some sort of connection to the original House. In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, the House reappeared in the pages of Justice League Dark, being used as a base for the team. The House is shown to currently belong to John Constantine, who claims to have won the key to the house in a poker game against Doctor Occult and Father Time. John Constantine takes his time to adjust to the House of Mystery due to the changing rooms and feels that the house has to play tricks on people and the superheroes that enter it.

After Klarion's defeat and the House of Mystery disappearing, John Constantine finds the key to the House of Mystery on the ground. * In the live-action television series Constantine, the title character lives in a magical safehouse (an old mill) with various similarities to the House of Mystery, though it is stationary in Atlanta and does not possess to ability to move through space. This old mill is described by John Constantine to have belonged to Jasper Winters (an old friend of his). * The House of Mystery has probably inspired the house regularly featured in the fifth season episodes of DC's Legends of Tomorrow as the once former home of John Constantine. The House is located in Northumberland County, UK . But other than its look, this house doesn't have much in common with DC's house of Mystery, as it does not have a soul nor any magical powers attributed, and it is not even used to store magical artifacts safely. =Film= The House of Mystery appears in the movie Justice League Dark. In this version the magic of the house created itself a body in the form of Black Orchid.

Cover art by Bernie Wrightson. The series was revived three years later with a definite article as The House of Secrets, beginning with issue #81 (Aug.-Sept. 1969). Now its horror and suspense tales were introduced by a host named Abel,McAvennie \\"1960s\\" in Dolan, p. 134: \\"Abel never earned any respect from his brother...Yet it didn't stop him from reopening House of Secrets with issue #81, following the series' three-year hiatus.\\" who would also host the satirical comic Plop!. His brother Cain hosted The House of Mystery. The Swamp Thing first appeared in The House of Secrets #92 (July 1971) in a stand-alone horror story set in the early 20th century written by Len Wein and drawn by Bernie Wrightson.McAvennie \\"1970s\\" in Dolan, p. 146: \\"'Swamp Thing' was the name of Len Wein and Bernie Wrightson's turn-of-the-century tale, and its popularity with readers led a modernized version of the character into his own series a year later.\\" The woman appearing on the cover of this issue was modeled after future comics writer Louise Simonson. The Patchwork Man, a character from the Swamp Thing ongoing series, was to have become an ongoing feature in the series, but only appeared in one issue. The revival of The House of Secrets, sporting many covers by Neal Adams, Bernie Wrightson, and Michael Kaluta, ran through issue #154 (Nov. 1978), with six months passing between #140 (February-March 1976) and #141 (August-September 1976). Canceled as a result of the DC Implosion, it was then \\"merged\\" into The Unexpected with issue #189, through issue #199. The series was 68 ad-free pages, allowing all three portions to be full-length issues. The House of Secrets also came to be the name of the actual edifice in which Abel lives. Writer Mike Friedrich and artist Jerry Grandenetti introduced the house and explained its origins. The building itself was constructed for a Senator Sanderson using only materials from Kentucky, and went under the enchantment that only pure-blood Kentuckians would be able to live there. Later, Sanderson's wife went insane in the upper floors, leading the Senator to sell the house. The next four owners, none of them pure Kentuckians, found themselves driven away for various reasons. The following owner attempted to move the home from its original location, but the house tore itself free from its trailer, ran its owner over a cliff to his death, and settled less than 200 yards from the Kentucky state line in a graveyard. Whether by fate or some mystical alignment, the companion House of Mystery stands at the other end of the graveyard. Shortly after this, Abel was driven to the house and entrusted as its caretaker by a man who revealed himself to be an aspect of the House's existence, but making vague references to an employer. Abel was showing living in the House of Mystery in the quarterly DC Special #4, published one month earlier (July-Sept. 1969). In the 1980s and 1990s, The Sandman series revealed that the House of Secrets edifice exists both in the real world of the DC Universe and in The Dreaming, as a repository for secrets of all kinds. The character of Abel would later become a recurring character in The Sandman and related series such as The Dreaming. = Second series = DC's Vertigo imprint revived the name House of Secrets as a new title and concept. Here the House of Secrets was a mobile manor, appearing in different places. The building itself is haunted by the Juris, a group of ghosts who summon those with secrets in order to judge them and pass sentence. To the Juris, all offenses carry the same weight, from rape and murder to simply lying at a crucial moment. A runaway named Rain Harper stumbled upon the House of Secrets and took up a position as an unwilling witness to the Juris trials, validating the judgments and either condemning the tried souls to imprisonment in the basement, or setting them free to live their life purged of their secret. Starting fresh with a new #1 (October 1996), this series ran 25 issues, plus a two-part House of Secrets: Facade special. This House of Secrets series was creator-owned except for its title which was \\"licensed\\" by DC to the series' creators. The letters column in issue #6 indicates that for legal reasons, they could not include Cain and Abel in the stories. This series was used for the framing story in the first Vertigo Winter's Edge special, featuring Rain happening upon an art gallery in the house whose paintings allow her to see stories from The Sandman, The Dreaming, Hellblazer, The Invisibles, The Books of Magic, The Minx, Sandman Mystery Theatre and Nevada.  Secret Six headquarters  In the mid-2000s, the Secret Six made their headquarters in the House of Secrets. Scandal stated in issue five of Villains United that the House would not show up on technological scans or mystical surveillance. She also said that Mockingbird claimed the House was a \\"house of victims\\". In other media The House of Secrets appeared in the Young Justice episode \\"Secrets\\". In the series, it was depicted as a magic shop across the street from the house of Greta and Billy Hayes.

The system of two-tier local government introduced in the 1970s by the Local Government Act 1972 and the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 was abolished in Scotland and Wales on 1 April 1996 and replaced with single-tier authorities. In England, some areas remained two-tier but many single-tier authorities (designated as Unitary Authorities in England) were created. No changes were made to local government in Northern Ireland. Background Prior to the 1970s, the UK had had a mixed system of local government, with some areas being covered by a county council and a more local district council, while large towns had only a single tier of authority (in England and Wales these were termed county boroughs, and in Scotland 'counties of cities'). The Acts abolished the existing county boroughs or counties of cities, and created a uniform two-tier system of government with regions or counties, and districts. In 1986, Margaret Thatcher's government abolished the county councils of the six metropolitan counties that had been created in 1974, along with the Greater London Council, effectively creating 68 new single-tier authorities: 32 London boroughs and 36 metropolitan boroughs. In 1990, Thatcher's government introduced the Community Charge, popularly known as the Poll Tax, a new way of funding local councils based on a fixed per-head fee. This proved very unpopular, and led to riots. Eventually, Thatcher was ousted by her own party, and the new Conservative leader and Prime Minister, John Major, was pledged to abolish the Community Charge. Legislation for the Council Tax was introduced and passed in the 1991/1992 session. Also at this time the government took the opportunity to review the structure of local government throughout Great Britain. England The Local Government Commission for England was established under the Local Government Act 1992, allowing the Secretary of State to order the Commission to undertake 'structural reviews' in specified areas, to create unitary authorities in the two-tier shire counties. After much political debate, the Commission's proposals resulted in the abolition of the counties of Avon, Cleveland, Hereford and Worcester and Humberside, created in 1974, the county council of Berkshire, and the creation of unitary authorities covering many of the larger urban districts of England. Scotland The previous system in Scotland had been the regions and districts. These were quite unbalanced in terms of population ‚Äî the Strathclyde region had nineteen districts and over two million people, whereas the Borders region had four districts and only 100,000 people. The Act established 29 new 'council areas', and retained the three Island Councils. Variance in population was much less in the council areas, with just over half a million in the largest authority, City of Glasgow, compared to 50,000 in the smallest on the mainland, Clackmannanshire. These are however outliers, and only six are outside the range 75,000 to 250,000. In some cases the names of traditional counties were revived as administrative areas, although often with vastly different borders. Wales In Wales the existing system was replaced with a new single-tier system, of counties and county boroughs, the only difference between them now being the name (and the councils of Cardiff, Swansea and Newport are styled as cities). The 1974 reform in Wales had abandoned use of the names of the historic counties of Wales as local government areas. This was partially reversed in 1996, with Anglesey, Carmarthenshire, Cardiganshire, Denbighshire, Flintshire, Monmouthshire and Pembrokeshire all reappearing as local government areas, although not necessarily with their traditional borders. The names and areas of the administrative counties abolished in 1996 remained in use (with modifications) as the preserved counties of Wales for purposes such as Lieutenancy.

There is no distinction between the public and private domains: \\"The very essence of patrimonialism consists in the idea that \\"the whole government authority and the economic rights which correspond to it, tend to be treated as privately appropriated economic advantages\\" (Medard, 1996). These regimes are autocratic or oligarchic and exclude the lower, middle and upper classes from power. The leaders of these countries typically enjoy absolute personal power. Usually, the armies of these countries are loyal to the leader, not the nation. Various definitions =Max Weber= Max Weber wrote of Patrimonialism as a form of traditional domination. Initially it was centered on family structures, particularly on the authority of fathers within families, in other words patriarchy. But patriarchy only describes the earlier, smaller form. For Weber, patrimonial monarchies and similar forms of government were projections of patriarchy (the rule of the father within the family) onto a broader set of social relationships. There are two main forms of patrimonialism in Weber's analysis of traditional authority (domination). One form is characterised by a top-down structure where the emperor or sultan rules on the basis of his own legitimate authority through traditional bureaucratic officials (e.g., eunuchs). In principle the Roman Catholic Church is patrimonial in this traditional sense, with the Pope as the Patrimonial Ruler. The other form of patrimonialism is still top down but it approaches the Ideal Type of Western European Feudalism, with a basis for legitimate authority outside of the central ruler's authority. In 12th century France or England, for example, it could have consisted of the knightly aristocracy. This feudal form of patrimonialism eventually evolved into Constitutional Monarchy. The U.S. Senate is a vestige of the House of Lords in England. The Lords were literally the peers of the realm. Weber's overarching argument was that with modernity, traditional bureaucratic patrimonial forms of government eventually gave way to modern capitalist bureaucratic rationalism as the main principle of both government and governance. =Nathan Quimpo= Nathan QuimpoPolitical Scientist at the University of Tsukuba defines patrimonialism as \\"a type of rule in which the ruler does not distinguish between personal and public patrimony and treats matters and resources of state as his personal affair.\\"Quimpo, p. 2 =Richard Pipes= Richard Pipes, a historian and Professor Emeritus of Russian history at Harvard University defines patrimonial as \\"a regime where the rights of sovereignty and those of ownership blend to the point of being indistinguishable, and political power is exercised in the same manner as economic power.\\"Richard Pipes, Russia under the Old Regime, page 22 =Julia Adams= Julia Adams, a sociologist at Yale University, argues for increased application of the term.Interview with Julia Adams http://aapss.org/the-annals/recent-volumes/2011/08/11/julia-adams-and- liping-wang-bridging-the-gap-between-china-and-europe =J.

He claimed that Turkey and Muscovy were the only European examples.Richard Pipes, Russia under the Old Regime, page 65 He believed they came about through conquest and were common in Africa and Asia.

He was the son of statesman Jos√© Paranhos, Viscount of Rio Branco. The Baron of Rio Branco was a member of the Brazilian Academy of Letters, occupying its 34th chair from 1898 until his death in 1912. As a representative of Brazil, through his diplomacy, he managed to peacefully resolve all Brazil's border disputes with its South American neighbours Biography =Early life= Jos√© Paranhos J√∫nior was born in Rio de Janeiro in 1845, as son of Jos√© Maria da Silva Paranhos Sr, Viscount of Rio Branco, future Prime Minister of Brazil and famous statesman and his wife, Teresa de Figueiredo Faria. He began his work in the letters in 1863, in the pages of the Popular magazine, with a biography on Lu√≠s Barroso Pereira, commander of the frigate Imperatriz. Later, in 1866, in the magazine L'Illustration, he drew and wrote about the Paraguayan War, defending the point of view of Brazil. In 1868, he replaced for three months Joaquim Manuel de Macedo as lecturer of Chorography and History of Brazil, in Col√©gio Pedro II. =The diplomacy= Decree of President Rodrigues Alves, naming Rio Branco to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in 1902. He began his political career as a promoter and deputy, still in the Empire. In 1871 he was editor in the newspaper A Na√ß√£o, having collaborated, from 1891, in Jornal do Brasil. He became Consul General in Liverpool from 1876, was accredited minister in Germany in 1900, taking over the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 3 December 1902 until his death in 1912. He held the position throughout the term of four presidents of the republic - the governments of Rodrigues Alves, Afonso Pena, Nilo Pe√ßanha and Hermes da Fonseca - forming a national unanimity in their time. He received the title of Baron of Rio Branco on the eve of the end of the imperial period, but continued to use the title in his signature even after the proclamation of the republic in 1889. This was due to being a convinced monarchist and to honor his late father, the senator and diplomat Jos√© Maria da Silva Paranhos, Viscount of Rio Branco. =Nobleman= The Baron of Rio Branco in 1875. In 1889, Emperor Pedro II of Brazil granted him the Brazilian nobility title Baron of Rio Branco (Bar√£o do Rio Branco), a few days before the Proclamation of the Republic. Rio Branco continued to use the title throughout his life, despite governmental prohibition, because of his monarchist beliefs . Being a monarchist, however, was no impediment for his success as a diplomat: the Baron of Rio Branco reached the heights of his career during the Republic, when he acted as Minister of Foreign Affairs for 10 years and settled all of Brazil's remaining border disputes by peaceful means. =Last years= Suffering from kidney problems, he offered his resignation, which was refused by President Hermes da Fonseca. In his last moments of life, he lamented the bombing of the capital of Bahia, Salvador, motivated by a political crisis and which occurred on 10 January 1912. His death, during the carnival of 1912, altered the calendar of the popular feast that year due to official mourning and great tributes in his honor in the city of Rio de Janeiro. He was buried along his father, in the Caju Cemetery in Rio de Janeiro. Rio Branco is considered the patron of Brazilian diplomacy. Career history and legacy Rio Branco began his political career as a congressman in the House of Commons. From 1876 on, he was the Brazilian Consul General in Liverpool, England. He was also the Brazilian Ambassador in Berlin in the beginning of the 20th century. Rio Branco's most important legacy to Brazil was his successful effort, as Minister of Foreign Affairs, in defining the country's borders with all of its neighbours. He was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1902 and retained office until 1912, under four different Presidents, a feat unequalled in Brazilian history. Before and during his term, he negotiated territorial disputes between Brazil and some of its neighbours and consolidated the borders of modern Brazil. He is considered one of the most prominent Brazilian statesmen ever, as his proverbial work capacity, knowledge and skills were essential for the successful outcome of difficult boundary disputes, some of which submitted to international arbitration ‚Äì such as with Argentina and France ‚Äì, as well as for incorporating new territory (the state of Acre, originally Bolivian). As a mediator he negotiated and settled disputes between the United States and many European countries. On those occasions, he never abandoned his belief in diplomacy as the means to handle international matters, thus helping establish Brazil's reputation as a peace-loving nation. Resolved boundary disputes Picture of Rio Branco in the 1890s =Border question with France= Rio Branco obtained a victory over France on the border of Amap√° with French Guiana, cause won by Brazil in 1900 in an arbitration of the Swiss government. The border was defined in the river Oiapoque. =Treaty of Petr√≥polis with Bolivia= In 1903 Rio Branco signed the Treaty of Petr√≥polis with Bolivia, putting an end to the dispute involving the present Brazilian state of Acre. The region was settled mostly by native Brazilians, but the Bolivian government had come close to leasing this rubber-rich area to American private entrepreneurs. Today, the state's capital bears the name Rio Branco in his honor. =Tobar-Rio Branco Treaty with Ecuador= The representative of Brazil, Don Jos√© Maria da Silva Paranhos, who was Baron of Rio Branco met the representative of Ecuador, Dr. Carlos R. Tobar, in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro, to peacefully discuss a final border between their countries. On May 6, 1904, an agreement was reached and the two representatives signed the Tobar-Rio Branco Treaty, in which Ecuador renounced its claims to the disputed area between the Caquet√° River and the Amazon river in favour of Brazil, in return Brazil recognized Ecuador as its neighbour. The border would be a straight line that starts midpoint between the cities of Tabatinga, Brazil and Leticia, Colombia, on the Amazon River and runs north until it reaches the Caquet√° River, also known as the Japur√° River. =Other success= Rio Branco has negotiated with Uruguay the condominium on the Rio Jaguar√£o and Lagoon Mirim, essentially a voluntary concession from Brazil to a neighbor who needed those channels. For this reason, he was honored by the government of Uruguay, and his name was given to the old Pueblo Artigas, now the city of R√≠o Branco, in the department of Cerro Largo, near the Brazilian Jaguar√£o. Statue of Rio Branco in Porto Alegre. The municipality of Paranhos, in Mato Grosso do Sul, located on the border with Paraguay was baptized in his honor. In 1908, then in Rio de Janeiro, he invited the engineer Augusto Ferreira Ramos to design a cable car system that would facilitate access to the summit of Morro da Urca, known worldwide as the Sugar Loaf. In 1909, his name was suggested for the presidential succession of the following year. Rio Branco preferred to decline any candidacy that was not of national unanimity. He was president of the Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute (1907-1912) and wrote two books. His son, Paulo do Rio Branco, was a prominent French-born Brazilian rugby player. Popularity In 1909, Rio Branco was encouraged to run for the Presidency, but he declined, as he could not envisage consensus around his name. He was very popular, however, among the people, at the time of his death, to the point of paralysing Carnival ‚Äì another unparalleled feat in Brazilian history ‚Äì on the day he died (February 10), when official mourning was declared. The first recorded instance of an official moment of silence dedicated to a person's death took place in Portugal on February 13, 1912. The Portuguese Senate dedicated 10 minutes of silence to the baron. This moment of silence was registered in the Senate's records of that day. As a writer he wrote many books, dealing mostly with the history of Brazil, and was awarded prizes and occupied the 34th seat of the Brazilian Academy of Literature. Brazil's diplomacy academy (Instituto Rio Branco) is named after the Baron. Rio Branco is portrayed on the fifty centavos coin of the Brazilian real currency.

Its last role was as an attack aircraft squadron. The squadron was first formed during World War II on 5 March 1941 by renumbering 14 Squadron SAAF in Egypt. It later carried out bombing operations in Kenya and North Africa, before taking part in the Italian campaign before disbanding in late 1945 at the conclusion of hostilities. The squadron was later re-raised and operated jet aircraft in an attack role during the Border War. It was finally disbanded in early 1991. History On 5 March 1941 24 Squadron SAAF was formed when No.14 Squadron SAAF and its Maryland bombers were moved from Kenya to Egypt, and renumbered as No.24 Squadron. The squadron then operated alongside No. 39 Squadron RAF as a daytime tactical bomber unit carrying out bombing sorties against targets in the Mediterranean theatre. 24 Squadron was later in the year re-equipped with Bostons. In December 1943, the squadron was relocated to Algeria and re-equipped with the B-26 Marauders and in 1944 flew to a new base at Pescara, Italy, before later advancing to Jesi, Italy. At the end of the war the squadron used its Marauders as transport aircraft, before moving to Egypt in October 1945 and disbanding on 6 November 1945. The Buccaneer entered SAAF service in 1965. SAAF Buccaneers saw active service during the Border War in South-West Africa, notably at Cassinga in 1978. They flew over Angola and Namibia in the 1970s and 1980s, and attacked SWAPO guerrilla camps with rockets and bombs. The squadron was disbanded in March 1991 at AFB Waterkloof, Pretoria.

Sometimes erroneously referred to as Ulm Cathedral because of its great size, the church is not a cathedral as it has never been the episcopal see of a bishop. Though the towers and all decorative elements are of stone masonry, attracting the attention of visitors, most of the walls, including the fa√ßades of the nave and choir, actually consist of visible brick. Therefore, the building is sometimes referred to as a brick church. As such, it lays claim to the rank of second- to fourth-largest, after San Petronio Basilica in Bologna and together with Frauenkirche in Munich and St. Mary's Church in Gda≈Ñsk.

At it gives a panoramic view of Ulm in Baden-W√ºrttemberg and Neu-Ulm in Bavaria and, in clear weather, a vista of the Alps from S√§ntis to the Zugspitze. The final stairwell to the top (known as the third Gallery) is a tall, spiralling staircase that has barely enough room for one person. History =First construction phase= The original parish church in Ulm was built at the gate of the city outside the walls, and this caused much trouble for the citizens of the city in the 14th century's conflicts that involved Ulm, as demonstrated by Emperor Charles IV's siege of the city. This parish church had also been subordinated to Reichenau Monastery by Charlemagne in 813, and the denizens of Ulm wanted a new, independent church inside the city's walls. To this end, the city's near 10,000 inhabitants decided to finance construction themselves. On 30 June 1377, Mayor Ludwig Krafft laid the first stone, the foundation stone, of the new church. This church, whose design would be given to Heinrich Parler, the architect of Holy Cross Minster in Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd. The first plan was to build a stepped hall church with aisles as wide and almost as high as the central nave, with a main spire on the west and two steeples above the choir ( long, wide). The women of the Ulmer Assemblage would also make their contributions to the foundation works, something memorialized by 17th and 18th century composer Barbara Kluntz.City of Ulm: Ulmer Geschichte(n) - Die Ulmer Sammlung 1230‚Äì1808 Michael Parler, who had experience from working at the Dombauh√ºtte in Prague, assumed construction of the church in 1381 and continued work on the nave, which had originally been conceived as a triple-aisled hall church with approximately equal height and width. From 1387 to 1391, Heinrich III Parler managed construction as head of the Bauh√ºtte. Then in 1392 Ulrich Ensingen, associated with Strasbourg Cathedral, was appointed master builder. It was Parler's plan to construct the Ulm Minster's spire, the highest of any church. In order to balance its proportions, the nave was now to be much taller than the Parlers had intended, making a noticeable difference in height between the chancel and nave. The church was consecrated on 25 July 1405. In 1446, Ulrich's son Matth√§us took over construction and finished the choir vault in 1449 and the vault over the northern nave in 1452. When he died in 1463, his own son, Mortiz, took over construction. Himself dying in 1471, he completed the vaulting over the nave and constructed the sacrament house, finally making the church a basilica according to Ulrich's plan. In 1477, Matth√§us B√∂blinger took over and made changes to the plans of the church but especially to the main tower and in doing so caused the church's first major structural threat: the heavy vaults of the wide aisles and high nave burdened the columns with too much lateral force at different heights. A new master builder, Burkhart Engelberg of Augsburg, tackled the structural damage by reinforcing the foundation of the west tower and demolishing the heavy aisle vaults and replacing them with vaults of half widths, which afforded rows of additional columns dividing each of the aisles in two. Although catastrophe had been avoided, the walls were left without their buttresses for 350 years and the northern wall of the nave bulges outward by even today. In a referendum in 1530/31, the citizens of Ulm converted to Protestantism during the Reformation. Ulm Minster became a Lutheran church. Although as large as many cathedrals, Ulm is not a cathedral, as the responsible bishop of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in W√ºrttemberg ‚Äì member of the Evangelical Church in Germany ‚Äì resides in Stuttgart. In 1543, construction work ceased at a time when the steeple had reached a height of some . The suspension of the building process was due to a variety of factors which were political and religious (the Reformation, the Thirty Years' War, the War of the Spanish Succession) as well as economic, since the discovery of the Americas during the voyages of Christopher Columbus 1492‚Äì1504, the Portuguese discovery of the sea route to India in 1497‚Äì99, and Magellan's circumnavigation of the globe led to a epochal shift in trade routes and commodities. One result was economic stagnation and a steady decline, preventing major public expenditure.

In 1844, construction work resumed. After a phase of repairs lasting until 1856, the central nave was stabilized by the addition of flying buttresses. Then the small steeples beside the choir were built ‚Äì without medieval plans. At last, the main steeple was completed, changing the available medieval plan in making it about ten metres taller. Finally, on 31 May 1890 the building was completed. =World War II= A devastating air raid hit Ulm on 17 December 1944, which destroyed virtually the entire town west of the church to the railway station and north of the church to the outskirts. The church itself was barely damaged. However, almost all the other buildings of the town square (M√ºnsterplatz) were severely hit and some 80% of the medieval centre of Ulm was destroyed. =Current events= The church is currently dealing with problems caused by large numbers of men urinating around the structure. In addition to the health issues this presents, acids and salts in the urine are degrading the sandstone foundation of the M√ºnster. Church officials say that festivals and events in the adjacent M√ºnsterplatz draw large numbers of people to the area, but event organizers do not provide sufficient free toilets. After costly repairs to the structure, church leaders pressed city officials to increase patrols and fines, but these have failed to stop offenders. Architecture While the walls of the choir, the side aisles and the tower were constructed of brick, the upper levels of the nave are ashlar, a sandstone from Isny im Allg√§u. Limestone from the nearby Swabian Jura was used in small quantities. Works of art * Late medieval sculptures include the tympanum of the main Western entrance depicts scenes from the Genesis. The central column bears a sculpture, the Man of Sorrows, by the local master Hans Multscher. * The 15th century choir stalls by J√∂rg Syrlin the Elder, made from oak and adorned with hundreds of carved busts are among the most famous pews of the Gothic period. * The pulpit canopy is by J√∂rg Syrlin the Younger. * The original high altar was destroyed by the iconoclasts of the Reformation. The current altarpiece from the early 16th century is a triptych, showing figures of the Holy Family and the Last Supper in the predella. * The five stained glass windows of the apse, which is in the form of half a decagon, show Biblical scenes and date to the 14th and 15th century. *The main organ of the church was destroyed by iconoclasts and replaced in the late 16th century. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is known to have played it in 1763. For some decades it was the largest organ in existence. In the late 1960s it was reconstructed to solve acoustic problems of reverberation. *In 1877, the Jewish congregation of the synagogue of Ulm‚Äîincluding Hermann Einstein, the father of Albert Einstein‚Äîdonated money for a statue of the Biblical prophet Jeremiah. The figure was placed below the main organ. *Later renovations in the modern era added gargoyles and a sculpture, The Beggar, by the expressionist Ernst Barlach. File:Ulmer M√ºnster 3.+4.

Although some species of venomous and mildly venomous snakes do use constriction to subdue their prey, most snakes which use constriction lack venom. The snake initially strikes at its prey and holds on, pulling the prey into its coils or, in the case of very large prey, pulling itself onto the prey. The snake will then wrap one or two loops around the prey, forming a constriction coil. The snake will monitor the prey's heartbeat to ascertain when it is dead. A Brazilian Rainbow Boa (Epicrates cenchria cenchria) constricting and swallowing a mouse Contrary to myth, the snake does not crush the prey, or break its bones. However, several natural observations exist involving wild Anacondas that show broken bones in large prey. Also, contrary to previous belief, the snake does not cause suffocation by constricting the victim; instead, a study of death caused by boa constrictors showed that constriction \\"shuts off\\" blood flow (and therefore oxygen) needed by vital organs such as the heart and brain, leading to unconsciousness within seconds and cardiac arrest shortly thereafter. Further, multiple species of snakes have been shown to constrict with pressures higher than those shown to induce cardiac arrest. In conjunction with observations of oral and nasal hemorrhaging in prey, constriction pressures are also thought to interfere with neural processing by forcing blood towards the brain. In other words, constriction can work by different mechanisms at varying pressures. It likely interferes with breathing at low pressures, can interrupt blood flow and overwhelm the prey's usual blood pressure and circulation at moderate pressures, and can interfere with neural processing and damage tissues at high pressures. During constriction events where the prey's heart is impeded, arterial pressure drops while venous pressure increases, and blood vessels begin to close. The heart does not have enough strength to pump against the pressure and blood flow stops. Internal organs with high metabolic rates, including the brain, liver, and heart, begin to stop functioning and die due to ischemia, a loss of oxygen and glucose. There is evidence that boa constrictors have more difficulty killing ectotherms‚Äîanimals like lizards and snakes that rely on external heat to regulate their body temperatures. A boa constrictor was observed attacking a spinytail iguana for an hour, and the iguana survived. As this is comparatively recent research (2015), it is possible that other constrictors kill in other ways. It had previously been accepted that constrictors used their body to hold the prey tight and prevent the prey from drawing air into its lungs, resulting in death from asphyxia, or that the pressure of constriction causes a rise in the pressure in the prey's body cavity greater than the heart can counter, resulting in immediate cardiac arrest; data from earlier studies had also indicated that snakes can exert enough pressure for these to be plausible. Certain groups of snakes have characteristic patterns of constriction, including the number of coils they use and the orientation of the coils.Bealor, M.T. and Saviola, A.J., 2007.

Broadcasting since 17 March 1997 (Saint Patrick's Day), it carries music and talk. Purchased by Denis O'Brien's Communicorp in 2007, Today FM holds a licence from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland as far as the year 2027. The station recorded pretax profits of ‚Ç¨7.4 million on a turnover of ‚Ç¨19.4 million in early 2009, more than twice what it was two years previously. Today FM broadcasts from studios in Marconi House, Digges Lane, Dublin 2. History The original Independent National Radio franchise holder in the Republic of Ireland was 100-102 Century Radio, which launched in 1989 and closed down abruptly in November 1991 amid heavy financial losses. The Independent Radio and Television Commission did not re-advertise the contract until 1996. Radio Ireland Limited, originally owned by John McColgan and Moya Doherty (and because of their involvement, dubbed \\"Radio Riverdance\\"), won the contract when it was advertised. In 2002, Scottish Radio Holdings plc acquired Radio Ireland Limited from its shareholders. In June 2005, an agreed takeover offer for that company was made by Emap. Denis O'Brien's Communicorp was the highest bidder for Emap's Irish operations when that company decided to sell its radio stations, buying FM104, Highland Radio and Today FM on 14 July 2007. In October 2007, the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland (BCI) approved Communicorp's proposed takeover of Today FM and Highland Radio, but not FM104. The deal was completed by January 2008. Due to a Competition Authority decision, Communicorp was required to sell-on FM104, which it did (to UTV Media) immediately upon its acquisition. The takeover closed in April 2008. In 2008, Today FM moved their studios from their original base at 112 Upper Abbey Street, Dublin, across the Liffey to Marconi House in Digges Lane, Dublin 2, where it shares the building with its Communicorp sister station, Newstalk. The building also housed another Communicorp station, Phantom (later TXFM), until it ceased broadcasting in October 2016. In June 2017 it was announced that the group's other Dublin-based stations, 98FM and Spin 1038, would also be moving into the same premises. The experienced broadcaster and radio programmer Tom Hardy served as the station's Director of Programming from 1998 until January 2013, when he was replaced by Martin McGuire. The position was later taken up by the station's former evening presenter Colm O'Sullivan, now of Cork's Red FM, and is now held by Adelle Nolan. Broadcast history The station went on air, originally known as Radio Ireland, on St. Patrick's Day, 17 March 1997. At first, the station was a mixed network, airing much talk programming and various types of music. However, following six months of disastrous ratings, and with a listenership of just 1%, the station was revamped, and on 1 January 1998 became 100-102 Today FM. The station axed almost all of its programming and changed its music policy entirely. Eamon Dunphy's co-host (Anne-Marie Hourihan) was axed, with him being heavily promoted as a solo act and Ian Dempsey and Ray D'Arcy were poached from arch- rivals RT√â. The IRTC went along with the schedule changes, though in a statement soon after the relaunch said it was not entirely satisfied with the new schedule. However, within three months, the station's listenership had almost doubled. Today FM reshuffled its daytime schedule in 2004, reducing The Ian Dempsey Breakfast Show to add an extra hour to The Ray D'Arcy Show so that it could compete directly with rival, The Gerry Ryan Show. Philip Cawley's afternoon show was reduced and Tony Fenton was given a lunchtime show. In April 2006, Ray D'Arcy conducted an interview with comedian Des Bishop. Bishop joked about being gay. D'Arcy asked Bishop to provide an \\"exclusive\\". Bishop said, \\"I'm gay... I'm not, but hey!\\" D'Arcy said, \\"You're very comfortable with your sexuality?\\" Bishop said, \\"Me and Derek Mooney are doing a show\\". The audience laughed. D'Arcy moved to a commercial break before, he said, Bishop \\"outs anyone else\\". The incident provoked much commentary in the media, with the Sunday Independent observing \\"Instantly, the Irish-American comedian was the villain of the piece and Derek was all over the front page\\", while Ray D'Arcy was also criticised for his choice of words. On 29 February 2008, Matt Cooper's The Last Word was the final show to be presented from the old studios. The first show to be presented from the new Digges Lane studio was Friday Night 80s with Phil Cawley from 19:00. The first song played was \\"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\\" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Today FM had a crucial role in the Brian Cowen nude portraits controversy of March 2009, specifically Will Hanafin and The Ray D'Arcy Show. On 15 October 2011, Today FM confirmed Sam Smyth's Sunday radio show was being dropped. He had been presenting it for 14 years. Smyth had previously offended his bosses by commenting in a newspaper and on television about the Moriarty Tribunal which criticised Today FM owner Denis O'Brien. Smyth said on air the next morning that he had been told not to talk about the end of his show and stopped one of his guests from talking about it too \\"before someone comes downstairs and pulls a wire we better move onto something else.\\" The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) said it was concerned at the development. The Irish Independent, of which Denis O'Brien is a leading shareholder, reported that Anton Savage was being lined up to replace Sam Smyth. Eamon Dunphy subsequently resigned from Today FM's sister station Newstalk, in solidarity with Smyth and because, he said, the radio station's management wanted \\"dissenting voices\\" such as Constantin Gurdgiev off the airwaves. Schedule Today FM airs a mixture of popular music and news and current affairs programming. Its breakfast show is The Ian Dempsey Breakfast Show, followed by Dermot & Dave. Mairead Ronan presents the lunchtime show. Its afternoon host is Fergal D'Arcy. The early evening current affairs programme is The Last Word, currently presented by Matt Cooper. Ed Smith then presents \\"Ed's National Anthems\\", which has a more diverse playlist than the daytime shows. This is followed by the Paul McLoone Show, which broadcasts until midnight. Weekend shows include Saturday and Sunday Breakfast with Alison Curtis, a Saturday afternoon music, sports and magazine programme with Declan Pierce and Anna Geary, the Phil Cawley Show, Claire Beck, and Ed's Songs of Praise, an alternative indie, rock and eclectic music show presented by Ed Smith. Of note is the station's satirical slot, Gift Grub, a feature broadcast during The Ian Dempsey Breakfast Show, which is performed by Mario Rosenstock and includes popular caricatures of former Taoiseach Enda Kenny, former T√°naiste Joan Burton, and singers Daniel O'Donnell and Keith Duffy. Rosenstock also presents his own show on Sunday mornings. Other occasional presenters at the station include Shelly Gray and Tara Harrison. Former presenters of Radio Ireland/Today FM include Philip Boucher-Hayes, Mark Byrne, Mark Cagney, Enda Caldwell, Breffni Clack, Bob Conway, Tom Dunne (Pet Sounds), Eamon Dunphy (original presenter of The Last Word), Tony Fenton, Derek Flood, Bob Gallico, Nadine O'Regan, Tommy Greene, Anne-Marie Hourihan (originally Eamon Dunphy's co-host), Bill Hughes, Robbie Irwin (weekend sports programs presenter), Mark Kavanagh (dance show), Ann Marie Kelly, John Kelly, Tim Kelly, Stephen Keogh, Tracey Lee, Nails Mahoney (briefly), Marty Miller (now of Radio Nova 100FM), the late Dermot Morgan, Paddy Murray and Liam Mackey (Murray and Mackey), Ian Noctor (newsreader who also for a period presented Dad Rock), Ed Myers, Jim O'Neill, Paul Power, Ita Ryan (The Celtic Reel), John Ryan (original presenter of The Sunday Supplement), Donal Scannell, Jon Troy (Between The Sheets - love songs), Ray Foley, Karl Tsigdinos (The River of Soul), Dave Couse, Anton Savage, Ray D'Arcy, Al Porter, and Kelly-Anne Byrne. Current presenters and shows The current Today FM schedule and list of shows can be found here. The weekend schedule is regularly changed at particular times of year to accommodate extra sports programming, such as during the GAA hurling and football championships, when Championship Sunday, hosted by Paul Collins, airs. Similarly, Ross Lindsay's Scrum Saturday during the Six Nations Championship and other periods when the Irish national side is in action. Outside of the Premier League season, or on weekends without league games, the Saturday afternoon slot is, in the case of 2017, hosted by Muireann O'Connell. = 2014‚Äìpresent changes = The lunchtime slot was previously presented by Keith \\"KC\\" Cunningham, who left Today FM in April 2014 for family reasons to return to Red FM in Cork. Louise Duffy moved from the Early Breakfast to take over the slot from April until August 2014 when she was succeeded by Dermot Whelan and Dave Moore, who left the Dublin regional radio station 98FM after twelve years to take over the slot permanently from September 2014 onwards, their show airing for the first time on 1 September 2014 with the show continuing to air every Monday to Friday from midday to 2:30 pm. Duffy had also served as a regular substitute for Tony Fenton's mid-afternoon show throughout 2013 and 2014. Following Fenton's death in March 2015, Duffy took over the show on a permanent basis and presented her own show titled \\"The Louise Duffy Show\\" which aired every Monday to Friday from 2:30 pm to 4:30 pm before ending in July 2016. Paula MacSweeney previously hosted a Friday Night Anthems show, moving to Saturday nights in April 2014, when her previous show was succeeded by Friday Night 90's hosted by Shauna O'Reilly who works as a researcher on Today FM's flagship breakfast program, \\"The Ian Dempsey Breakfast Show\\" and Eoghan Doherty with the show airing every Friday night from 10 pm to 1 am. MacSweeney has since moved to the 5 am weekday slot and now hosts Early Breakfast with Paula MacSweeney which airs every Monday to Friday from 5 am to 7 am while Friday Night 90s ended in July 2016 and was replaced by \\"Friday Night Anthems\\" which is hosted by Phil Cawley. Ray D'Arcy originally hosted the weekday mid-morning slot for 15 years but abruptly left Today FM to rejoin RT√â with immediate effect in December 2014. Alison Curtis served as an interim host until the appointment of Anton Savage who began his show, The Anton Savage Show on January 26, 2015, which now airs every Monday to Friday from 9 am to midday. Savage's previous Sunday morning show, \\"Savage Show\\" which aired every Sunday from 11 am to 1 pm ended and the slot was taken over by comedian Neil Delamere who now presents his own show titled \\"Neil Delamere's Sunday Best\\" which airs every Sunday from 11 am to 1 pm. On August 17, 2015, Colm O'Sullivan announced that his show The Mix-Up which had aired every Monday-Thursday 7-9 pm was ending after three years of being on-air and that O'Sullivan himself was retiring from the DJ business after nearly twenty years to take up a position as the new Programme Director of Today FM, O'Sullivan having joined Today FM in February 2013 with his show, \\"The Mix-Up\\" airing for the first time on Monday 4 February 2013. Two days, later on August 19, Fergal D'arcy, a radio presenter formerly associated with iRadio, a regional radio station that is primarily located in the North West of the Republic of Ireland was announced as being the newest DJ to join Today FM and also as O'Sullivan's replacement. On August 27, 2015, \\"The Mix-Up with Colm O'Sullivan\\" aired for the final time with Cork band, The Frank and Walters serving as the musical guests. Two weeks later, on September 14, 2015, D'arcy's show aired on Today FM for the first time, with Ed Smith continuing to serve on as the producer with the show itself ending in June 2016. On Friday, May 20, it was announced that Fergal D'arcy and Louise Duffy would be permanently exchanging shifts with D'arcy going to Duffy's slot of 2:30 pm‚Äì 4:30 pm while Duffy would take over D'arcy's slot of 7 pm - 9 pm. D'arcy began his new show, \\"Off the Charts with Fergal D'arcy\\" during July 2016 while Duffy's new show, \\"Lost in Music with Louise Duffy\\" aired for the first time on Monday, August 8, 2016. Anton Savage left the radio station on 2 December 2016 due to a disagreement with the radio station, and was replaced by Dermot Whelan and Dave Moore. On 25 January 2017, comedian Al Porter was announced, live on air, as the new host of the midday show, moving into Whelan and Moore's old slot. On February 13, 2017, Porter's show aired for the first time. However, in November 2017, after allegations of sexual misconduct made against Porter, he decided to resign from Today FM with immediate effect. Porter's midday slot was taken over by Muireann O'Connell. Additional Stations On March 26, 2018, Today FM launched sister streaming stations that focus on music from the 1980s, 1990s, and alternative indie music, these being Today FM 80s, Today FM 90s and Today XM all three stations are available exclusively through TodayFM.com and app. See also * Radio in the Republic of Ireland * List of companies of Ireland References External links * Official website Category:Communicorp Category:Mass media companies of Ireland Category:Radio stations established in 1997 Category:Radio stations in Northern Ireland Category:Radio stations in the Republic of Ireland ","title":"Today FM"},{"id":"853123","text":"Aztek is the name of a fictional superhero in the DC Universe. Both versions are based out of the fictional Vanity City. Aztek is the champion of the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl. The first Aztek first appeared in Aztek, The Ultimate Man #1 in August 1996, created by Grant Morrison and Mark Millar. Following the short run series, Aztek appeared in several issues of JLA also written by Morrison. The second Aztek appeared in Justice League of America vol. 5 #20 in December 2017, created by Steve Orlando and Ivan Reis, as the rival and later partner of the Ray. Fictional character biography =Uno= Uno is raised from childhood by a secret organization named the Q Society to be the champion of the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl to battle their enemy, the Aztec god Tezcatlipoca. He is given a magical suit of armor that bestows many abilities, complementing Uno's peak human mental and physical abilities. After his training is completed, he enters the United States and assumes the identity of recently deceased physician Curt Falconer.Aztek: The Ultimate Man #1 (August 1996) Aztek later joins the Justice League,Aztek: The Ultimate Man #10 (May 1997) but resigns when it is revealed that one of the mysterious benefactors of the Q Society is supervillain Lex Luthor.JLA #15 (February 1998) He is later blinded helping the League save the Earth in a battle against the planet- destroying machine Mageddon (apparently the Tezcatlipoca that the cult was referring to all along). Aztek ultimately sacrifices himself to allow Superman the chance to destroy Mageddon/Tezcatlipoca, during the World War III story arc.JLA #41 (May 2000) =Nayeli Constant= A new version of the character appeared in Justice League of America vol. 5 #20; instead of being Uno/Curt Falconer, the new hero is Nayeli Constant. She was a software engineer in Austin, Texas who was startled by the Aztek helmet bursting into her window and telling her about the millennia-long war against the dark god Tezcatlipoca. She decided to accept the role of the new Aztek and modified the armor to suit her purposes; eventually finding her way to Vanity after The Ray left the city to join the Justice League of America. When he returned from a mission, the two encountered one another and briefly argued about who should protect the citizens of Vanity but they teamed up to stop a criminal and decided that the city could use both heroes. Powers and abilities Aztek has peak human physical and mental conditioning. He wears an ancient helmet and armor (powered by a \\"four-dimensional mirror\\"), from which he derives flight, infrared and X-Ray vision, invisibility, intangibility, bodyheat camouflage, entrapment nets, plasma beams and density manipulation, as well as augmenting his peak physical abilities to superhuman levels. The helmet could feed information directly into his brain even after he was blinded in his first confrontation with Mageddon. The four-dimensional power source could self-destruct in a highly explosive manner. Other versions =The Rock of Ages= Another version of Aztek, with the same abilities, was seen in Grant Morrison's run on JLA during \\"The Rock of Ages\\" storyline in which the JLA traveled to an alternate future overrun by Darkseid. She sacrifices her life to destroy Darkseid's lunar facilities. In other media Aztek in Justice League Unlimited along with Shayera Hol, Superman and King Faraday in the episode \\"I Am Legion\\". =Television= *Aztek appeared in Justice League Unlimited, mostly appearing in brief cameos throughout the series. After making a very brief appearance in \\"Question Authority\\" (voiced by Chris Cox), he made a more significant appearance in \\"I Am Legion\\" (voiced by Corey Burton) where he helped Superman and Shayera Hol investigate where Lex Luthor had gone after escaping prison. Superman asked Aztek to scan the scene to see if he could find out where Luthor went, but had no luck after finishing his scan. King Faraday then appeared behind the trio and introduced himself to Aztek.

He also performed lead vocals on two Black Sabbath songs: \\"It's Alright\\" from the album Technical Ecstasy and \\"Swinging the Chain\\" from the album Never Say Die!. Biography =Early years and Black Sabbath= Bill Ward started to play drums as a child, listening to the big bands of the 1940s and his major influences were Gene Krupa, Buddy Rich and Louie Bellson. Later he was influenced by drummers such as Larrie Londin, Bernard Purdie, Joe Morello, Keef Hartley, Hughie Flint, John Bonham, Ringo Starr, Jim Capaldi and Clive Bunker. In the mid-1960s Ward sang and played drums in a band called the Rest. Ward and guitarist Tony Iommi played together in a band called Mythology, and upon that band's dissolution joined vocalist Ozzy Osbourne and bassist Geezer Butler, who had played together in a band called Rare Breed. The new band called themselves Earth, but were soon renamed Black Sabbath. Ward's drug and alcohol use increased throughout Black Sabbath's heyday. By the late 1970s he was drinking during gigs, something he had never done before. He also began experiencing panic attacks. Ward has said he cannot remember the recording of the 1980 album Heaven and Hell due to his alcohol abuse. According to Black Sabbath bandmate Iommi, Ward disappeared on 21 August 1980, without saying goodbye, other than a telephone call to then-Black Sabbath vocalist Ronnie James Dio informing him \\"I'm off then, Ron.\\" He then briefly played in a band called Max Havoc. He sat out one album (1981's Mob Rules) before returning to Black Sabbath for 1983's Born Again album. Ward once again left for health reasons before the band toured in support of Born Again. He again rejoined Black Sabbath in 1984 to record new material with David Donato but after several demo tapes, he once again left Sabbath. =Pranks= Ward with Black Sabbath in 1973 According to Tony Iommi, he and the band would often set Ward's beard on fire and perform other harmful pranks on him. On one occasion, Ward even received third-degree burns. In an interview with Guitar World, Tony described it as follows: Iommi claims that Ward almost died after a prank-gone-wrong during recording of Vol. 4 in 1972. The band were renting a Bel Air mansion belonging to John DuPont of the DuPont chemical company. The band found several spray cans of gold DuPont paint in a room of the house; finding Ward naked and unconscious after a night of heavy drinking, they thought it would be funny to cover the drummer from head to toe in gold paint. Ward soon became violently ill and had a seizure and an ambulance had to be called. The paint had blocked all of Ward's pores, which his bandmates were subsequently informed can be fatal. During the recording of Heaven and Hell in 1980, Iommi doused Ward with a solution used by studio technicians to clean the tape heads. He then set light to the solution, which was much more flammable than Iommi had anticipated. Ward suffered third degree burns as a result and still has scars on his legs from the incident. =Solo career= After a few years in hiatus, Ward decided to return to playing music in the late 1980s. In 1989 he went to work on a solo album, which featured a huge array of guest musicians, including former Black Sabbath bandmate Ozzy Osbourne and his guitarist, Zakk Wylde. Released in January 1990, Ward One: Along the Way showcased Ward's versatility in musical tastes and abilities; he even sang vocals on some of the songs. It would be seven years before he released his second solo album, When the Bough Breaks, in 1997. In 2002 he released the song \\"Straws\\" as a single for charity. The song would reappear on his 2015 album Accountable Beasts. =Later career= Ward onstage with Black Sabbath in Stuttgart, Germany in 1999 Before the full Black Sabbath reunion, Ward and the original Sabbath had reunited twice for short sets, first for Live Aid in 1985 and then at a Costa Mesa, California Ozzy Osbourne show on 15 November 1992. Sabbath, with Judas Priest singer Rob Halford replacing Ronnie James Dio who had recently left the band, opened the show for Osbourne. The Ozzy Osbourne band (Osbourne, Zakk Wylde, Mike Inez, Randy Castillo and John Sinclair) then did a full set before Osbourne was reunited with Iommi, Butler and Ward for four numbers. Ward made a brief return to the band for a South American tour in 1994 with Tony Martin fronting, before finally rejoining the band for the two shows at the Birmingham NEC, England on 4 and 5 December 1997, which made up the Reunion album. When what was billed as the original line-up reunited for the Ozzfest tour in 1997, Mike Bordin played drums. Ward was forced to skip all but the last two Black Sabbath appearances in 1998 while he recovered from a heart attack suffered during the tour rehearsals that May. As the band rehearsed, Ward stopped and asked if he could lie down for a spell. He then asked for his assistant and informed the band that his arm had gone numb. Iommi and Butler then left for a short time, not knowing the severity of Ward's condition. Outside, they saw an ambulance pass but weren't aware what was happening. Upon returning to the rehearsal space a short time later, a frantic Osbourne informed them \\"Bill has had a heart attack! Bill has had a heart attack!\\" As was the case in 1980, he was replaced at short notice by Vinny Appice, although this time it was always intended to be a temporary absence for Ward, health permitting. In 2000, Ward participated in a partial Black Sabbath reunion of sorts, joining Iommi and Osbourne to record the track \\"Who's Fooling Who\\" for Iommi's first solo album. Since mid-2002, Ward has done a monthly internet-only radio show named Rock 50 on radio station WPMD from Cerritos College in California. Ward plays a variety of metal, hard rock, and some classic rock. =Brief reunion with Black Sabbath= In October 2006, news leaked that Ward would be reuniting with Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Ronnie James Dio for a tour though under the moniker Heaven & Hell. However, Ward later decided not to participate in the tour or continue participation in the band because of musical differences with \\"a couple of the other bandmembers\\" and a reported concern about extended touring. On 11 November 2011, Iommi, Butler, Osbourne, and Ward announced that they were reuniting to record a new album with producer Rick Rubin and to start touring in 2012. In February 2012, however, Ward left before work commenced on 13, the first studio recording to include original band members Iommi, Osbourne and Butler since the live album Reunion (1998), which contained two new studio tracks. Ward said that he had failed to reach an agreement regarding his contract. However, he did later admit that his weight would have been an issue in a 2013 tour. Osbourne also suggested in an open letter that Ward's decision not to take part was down to his health. In April 2015, Ward criticised Osbourne on his Facebook fan page via a letter to his and the band's fans. Which prompted a rebuttal from Osbourne on his Facebook page: Ward's surgery on his shoulder prevented him from playing drums again until May 2014, delaying his third studio album Accountable Beasts. He had also expressed a desire to tour behind the album once it is released, provided that sales were acceptable. Ward reunited with Sabbath members Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler to accept the \\"Lifetime Achievement\\" award at the May 2015 Ivor Novello Awards. In 2016, Ward debuted with a new band called \\"Day of Errors\\", which played its first gig in June that year at Gaslamp in Long Beach, California and also features Joe Amodea on guitar/vocals and Kill Devil Hill singer Jason \\"Dewey\\" Bragg on vocals. Ward was due to play a string of dates with his new band in December 2017 but had to cancel these when he was hospitalised with heart problems in November. He once again reunited with Iommi and Butler in Los Angeles in May 2019, as Black Sabbath were awarded a Lifetime Achievement Grammy. Though Sabbath did not perform, Rival Sons performed a set of their songs for the occasion. A short time later Osbourne said in an interview that he wants to play one last show with the band's original lineup. Ward announced 3 weeks later on his Instagram that he loved all 3 of his former Black Sabbath bandmates very much and was open-minded to playing a very last show with them. Personal life Ward has two sons, Nigel and Aron, and one daughter, Emily. According to his Black Sabbath bandmates Tony Iommi and Ozzy Osbourne, Ward has dramatically changed his lifestyle since Black Sabbath's 1970s and early 80s heyday. Iommi says he quit smoking, gave up alcohol, adopted a vegan diet, and no longer uses drugs of any kind. Osbourne says that Ward has been sober for approximately 30 years. However, more recently Osbourne has criticised Ward's health, describing him in 2013 as \\"incredibly overweight\\" and suggesting that he would have been unable to drum for Black Sabbath had he stayed in the band following their 2011 reunion, given his physical condition, although Ward himself has insisted his health has not affected his ability to play the drums. Ward later admitted he underwent gastrointestinal surgery in 2013, and is still recovering. \\"My health right now is not bad but it's not good enough to certainly play in any band never mind Black Sabbath.\\" Ward stated in an interview he \\"lost a friend\\" in Osbourne after his statements about Ward's health in 2012, but maintained contact with Butler and Iommi. However, they have since appeared to have reconciled, as Osbourne named Ward as one of the people that kept in touch with him during his health problems in 2019.  Influence  Drumming website Totaldrumsets has listed Ward among \\"The 100 Most Influential Drummers Ever!\\" and has defined him \\"the mastermind behind the unholy birth of heavy metal drumming\\".

The character, created by writer Tony Isabella and artist Trevor Von Eeden, first appeared in Black Lightning #1 (April 1977), during the Bronze Age of Comic Books. Note that the official credit reads Isabella \\"WITH\\" Von Eeden and not \\"AND\\". While his origin story has been retconned several times, his current origin story states that he was born in the DC Universe as a metahuman, a human being with superhuman abilities. Black Lightning was DC's first African-American superhero with his own series. Black Lightning is originally depicted as a schoolteacher from the crime-ridden Suicide Slum area of Metropolis who acquires electrical superpowers from a technologically advanced power belt that he puts to use to clean up crime in his neighborhood. Over time, Pierce establishes himself as a successful superhero in the DC Universe, and later stories depict him as having \\"internalized\\" the belt's powers as a result of his latent metagene. Later retellings of Black Lightning's origins simplify his story by depicting him as a metahuman with the inborn ability to manipulate and generate electricity. Tony Isabella, an experienced writer having done work for the Luke Cage character at Marvel Comics, was signed on to develop DC's first starring black character. He pitched the idea for Black Lightning and it was developed though only 11 issues were published in the first series due to the 1978 DC Implosion. However, the character continued to make appearances in other titles over the years, including a Justice League of America storyline in which Pierce is offered but turns down a position with the group. Elements of Black Lightning were controversial when the character debuted. In the character's early days, Black Lightning was depicted wearing a combined Afro wig/mask and affecting an exaggerated Harlem jive vernacular as part of his efforts to conceal his identity as highly educated school professional Jefferson Pierce. Black Lightning later becomes one of the founding members of the Batman-helmed Outsiders superhero team. In the 2000s, DC Comics introduced Black Lightning's daughters, who inherited metahuman abilities from their father. His eldest daughter Anissa, known as Thunder, can alter her density, rendering her almost indestructible, and create shockwaves by stomping the ground. Pierce's younger child Jennifer, also a superhero known as Lightning, has powers almost identical to her father though she is still inexperienced and not in full control of them. Black Lightning was ranked 85th overall on IGN's \\"Top 100 Comic Books Heroes\\" list in 2011. Along with his presence in comics, the character has made various appearances in DC-related animated television series, video games, and comic strips. He made his live action debut in The CW's eponymous series, portrayed by Cress Williams. The character also appeared in the \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\" crossover event with the other series of the Arrowverse. Publication history Black Lighting made his deput on Black Lightning #1 (April 1977). Art by Rich Buckler and Frank Springe. The original candidate for DC Comics' first headlining black superhero was a character called the Black Bomber, a white racist who would turn into a black superhero under stress.The Hembeck Files Comics historian Don Markstein later described the character as \\"an insult to practically everybody with any point of view at all\\". When the editor who had approved the Black Bomber left the company before the character had seen print, Tony Isabella (whose previous writing experience included Luke Cage, a black Marvel Comics superhero with his own title) was asked to salvage the character. Isabella convinced editors to instead use his Black Lightning character, which he had been developing for some time. Isabella wrote the first 10 issues of Black Lightning before handing it over to Dennis O'Neil. Only one issue scripted by O'Neil came out before the series was canceled in 1978 as part of a general large-scale pruning of the company's superhero titles known as the DC Implosion. Issue #12 was published in Cancelled Comic Cavalcade and World's Finest Comics #260. Black Lightning made a number of guest appearances in various titles over the next few years, including a string of issues of World's Finest Comics written by O'Neil, then shifted to Detective Comics and a two-part story in Justice League of America in which he declined an offer of membership. In 1983, with his powers restored, he regularly appeared again as a member of Batman's spinoff superhero team, the Outsiders. When The Outsiders ended, he returned to making occasional guest appearances. In 1995, a new Black Lightning series began with art by Eddy Newell and again written by Tony Isabella,Manning, Matthew K. \\"1990s\\" in Dolan, p. 269: \\"Writer Tony Isabella returned to his prized character, Black Lightning, in an ongoing series with artist Eddy Newell.\\" who was fired after the eighth issue and replaced with Australian writer Dave de Vries. The series was canceled five issues after Isabella left the title, the decision having been made before these issues had seen print. Isabella said he believes the editor replaced him with a newer writer to consolidate his position in the company. A \\"Black Lightning: Year One\\" six-issue limited series, written by Jen Van Meter and illustrated by Cully HamnerDC Nation: #31 DC Comics website, October 18, 2006 saw a bi- weekly release in 2009, and was nominated for two Glyph AwardsNewsarama February 17, 2010 in 2010. As part of the New 52, a revamped version of Black Lightning appeared in DC Universe Presents that was paired with the Blue Devil. Fictional character biography Jefferson Pierce as Black Lighting, as he initially appeared in Black Lighting #1 (April 1977). Art by Trevor von Eeden (penciller), Frank Springer (inker), and Liz Berube (colorist). =Year One= A gold medal-winning Olympic decathlete, Jefferson Pierce, returned to his old neighborhood in the Southside (Suicide Slum) section of the city of Metropolis, with his wife Lynn Stewart and his daughter Anissa to become the principal of Garfield High School. Southside, as it was once known, was where his father‚Äîrenowned journalist Alvin Pierce‚Äîhad been murdered. Guilt over this event was a factor in his decision to leave the city of Metropolis. Suicide Slum was being torn apart by a local organized criminal gang called the 100, shady corporations, and crooked local politicians like Tobias Whale. A family friend and tailor, Peter Gambi, had taught a much younger Jefferson how to suppress his inborn metahuman abilities so that he would not accidentally hurt any of the people he cared about.Black Lightning: Year One #1 (March 2009) Upon his return, Gambi suggested to Jefferson that he should use his powers to help the neighborhood, and refers him to a plaque with the paraphrased Milo Sweetman quote \\"Justice, like lightning, should ever appear to some men hope, to other men fear.\\" (the original text of which was \\"Justice, like lightning, ever should appear to few men's ruin, but to all men's fear. Of mortal justice if thou scorn the rod, believe and tremble, thou art judged of God.\\") Appalled by the public murder of Earl Clifford, one of his more promising students, Pierce tried to intervene on behalf of the schoolchildren, but quickly learned that the 100 objected violently to any interference. Pierce adopts the costumed identity \\"Black Lightning\\" where he had the costume, mask, and wig made by his tailor Peter Gambi.As seen in Black Lightning: Year One #1 (March 2009) Years later, he would tell fellow African American superhero Mister Terrific that he chose the name Black Lightning because he \\"was the only one of us around\\" at the time, and he \\"wanted to make sure everyone knew who they were dealing with.\\"Infinite Crisis #6 (May 2006) =Outsiders= After his own series was cancelled, Black Lightning lost his electrical powers, but continued fighting without them. The loss eventually turned out to be psychosomatic, a symptom of a crisis of confidence resulting from the accidental death of a female bystander named Trina Shelton during an altercation between Black Lightning and some gun-wielding thugs.DC Comics Presents #16 (December 1979) Batman, wanting to recruit him to rescue Lucius Fox in Markovia, helped him regain his powers; this eventually led him to join the Batman's team the Outsiders. During his time with the Outsiders, a group of villains called the Masters of Disaster captured Black Lightning at the behest of the parents of Trina Shelton to avenge the death of their daughter;Adventures of the Outsiders #34 (June 1986) however, upon learning that he still regretted what happened and was willing to be executed by them, they risked their lives to save him. During the Invasion! crossover event, the Dominators detonated a Gene-Bomb that wreaked havoc with anyone possessing the metagene by making them lose control of their powers.Invasion! #1 (January 1989) After the breakup of the Outsiders, Black Lightning moved to Brick City to continue his solo career.Black Lightning (vol. 2) #1 (February 1995) =Secretary of Education= When Lex Luthor was elected President of the United States in 2000, he appointed Jefferson Pierce as Secretary of Education, Pierce accepting as he concluded that he could do more good working within the system than outside it. He resigned amidst controversy over his \\"worst-kept secret in Washington\\" identity as Black Lightning, and his alleged inadvertent killing of a criminally-minded corporate CEO, for which President Pete Ross (who had since succeeded Luthor) then pardoned him. Making frequent guest appearances in several DC series, Pierce has appeared in Green Arrow (who had a one-night stand with his niece, a successful attorney named Joanna Pierce). Pierce helped Green Arrow track down Dr. Light in the Green Arrow \\"Heading into the Light\\" story arc. He also appeared in the new Outsiders, of which his daughter, Anissa (using the alias Thunder), is a member. He came to fight the new Sabbac and help his daughter alongside Captain Marvel Jr. and the Outsiders. He had on an outfit that mixed his second outfit with the colors of the first. After teaming up with the Outsiders, incoming President Pete Ross asked him to resign as Secretary of Education and he did. At some point prior to his resignation, Pierce used his pull in Washington to deny the powerful metahuman gangster known as Holocaust a permit to build a casino on Paris Island in Dakota. This would come back to haunt Pierce sometime later when the enraged Holocaust attacked him while he was giving the graduation speech at Ernest Hemingway High School.Brave and the Bold (vol. 3) #24 =Infinite Crisis= Black Lightning, cover detail, Final Crisis: Submit #1 (Dec. 2008). Art by Matthew Clark. In issue #5 of the Infinite Crisis storyline, it was shown that Black Lightning was one of the eight people Batman had considered to aid him in destroying the Brother Eye satellite, which controlled the OMACs. Booster Gold, who was not on the list of eight, but knew about the candidates from his knowledge of the future, contacted Lightning before Batman did, as historical data from the future had shown who had aided Batman. Lightning accepted, arriving at the Batcave to await orders. He then forged an uneasy yet effective alliance with Mister Terrific, combining their powers of electrical manipulation and invisibility technology to strike the villainous AI from the inside. After the third Secret Society of Super Villains was formed, Black Lightning (as a member of Brad Meltzer's new Justice League) began using his status as Lex Luthor's former Secretary of Education to gain information from supervillains.Justice League of America (vol. 2) #2 (November 2006) =Outsiders redux= In Outsiders (vol. 3) #45, it was revealed that three years have passed since Jefferson's niece Joanna Pierce was murdered, and that upon initially learning of her death, Jefferson went after the corrupt businessman Martin Somers, the man who was responsible. He had intended to wound Somers with his lightning shot, but apparently ended up killing him. Jefferson turned himself in to the authorities. However, it is revealed that Deathstroke was responsible for Somers' death by firing a dart of toxin to Somers moments before Jefferson shot his lightning. Hence, he was dead before he hit the ground. Jason Todd discovered the truth while eavesdropping on the assassin's conversation with Lex Luthor (who was really Alexander Luthor, Jr. in disguise) and contacted Nightwing with this information. When Nightwing and Anissa told Jefferson of this in prison, he disbelieved it and intended to pay for Somers' death. Anissa herself intended to break her father out of Iron Heights Prison. Upon learning from Todd that other inmates were about to carry out a contract hit on Pierce (whose identity as an inmate had leaked to unknown parties), the Outsiders resolved to assist her. They freed him from jail and, with the audio recording of Deathstroke's conversation, cleared his name. =Justice League of America= Years ago, Green Arrow brought Black Lightning to the attention of the Justice League of America, who extended an offer of membership to the protector of Suicide Slum. He turned down the offer, preferring to work as a loner and focus on street- level crime, though he did offer to become a reservist.Justice League of America #173-174 (December 1979 ‚Äì January 1980) Years later, when all of the JLA reservists were called in to fight a newly revived Amazo, Black Lighting was one of the heroes called, confirming that the League had accepted his offer. Most recently, however, Black Lightning has joined the JLA, once again appearing with a modified costume. He appears to be primarily based in Washington, D.C. again. Black Lightning assists the JLA with intelligence gathered from the criminal community. Many supervillains still believe he is 'in' with Lex Luthor and are willing to cooperate. Jefferson also helps the team in a battle against Amazo. He was the first member of the League to respond to the recent attacks made by the Amazons of Themyscira, and he also saved the President of the United States in this event. Black Lightning was the focus of the one-shot Final Crisis: Submit, in which he helped the new Tattooed Man and his family escape at the cost of his own freedom. He is subsequently shown in issue #4 of Final Crisis under Darkseid's thrall. =Outsiders= Recently, Black Lightning was recruited by Alfred Pennyworth to join a new version of the Outsiders following an attack by Doctor Hurt which left Thunder comatose. Unlike previous iterations of the team, these Outsiders must live \\"off the grid\\" and stay out of contact with friends and family for months at a time. It is confirmed that, due to this new commitment, Black Lightning has left the Justice League.Justice League of America (vol. 2) #31 =The New 52= In DC's 2011 reboot of its continuity, The New 52, Black Lightning comes into conflict with Blue Devil, over their confrontation of Tobias Whale's crime wave.DC Universe Presents #13. DC Comics. He later made an appearance as a possible recruit for the Justice League.Justice League #17. DC Comics. =Black Lightning: Cold Dead Hands= Black Lightning appeared in DC Rebirth in Detective Comics, and from there spun out into the series Batman & The Outsiders. Tony Isabella, the creator of Black Lightning, rebooted the character in a new six part series that began in November, 2017. The series, which takes place in Cleveland, \\"forgets\\" much of the previous history of the character. Tony Isabella says that this will not be an \\"origin\\" story, but one may follow. Powers and abilities Originally,Black Lightning #1 (April 1977) he was described as having no innate powers, using a belt that allowed him to generate a force field and project electrical bolts.

Live-action Cress Williams as Black Lightning The CW TV series Black Lightning * A live-action television series based on the character debuted on The CW on January 16, 2018. The series is developed by Mara Brock Akil and Salim Akil, who also executive produce along with Greg Berlanti and Sarah Schechter, for Akil Productions and Berlanti Productions, alongside Warner Bros. Television. Fox gave the series a \\"pilot production commitment\\" in September 2016. In January 2017, Berlanti stated the series, if ordered, would not crossover with his other DC Comics television properties on The CW nor would it exist in their established universe. The following month, Fox passed on the series after deciding it was \\"not a good fit into its already crowded genre drama space.\\" Shortly thereafter, it was picked up by The CW with a pilot order. The pilot episode was directed by Salim Akil. Cress Williams plays Black Lightning. In May 2017, The CW officially ordered the project to series. In the series, Black Lightning operates in Freeland while his civilian persona Jefferson Pierce is the principal of Garfield High School where his family has Inspector Henderson as a family friend. In the past, Jefferson witnessed his father Alvin getting killed by gangster Tobias Whale and his men which led to Jefferson getting taken in by Alvin's friend Peter Gambi. During the first season, Jefferson resurfaces as Black Lightning and fights Tobias and the 100, as well as A.S.A. agents led by Martin Proctor. His daughters Anissa and Jennifer start to develop their own metahuman abilities. In the second season, Jefferson loses his position as principal due to him not being there when the 100 attacked the school which caused a new principal named Mike Lowry to be installed. In addition, Henderson figures out that Black Lightning and Jefferson are one and the same which briefly strains their friendship until Tobias Whale kills a cop that was on his side. By the end of the season, the Pierce family is approached by A.S.A. agent Odell who voices his knowledge of their identities and wants them to help the A.S.A. when the Markovians turn Freeland into a war zone. In the third season, Jefferson has been placed in the Pit, where Tobias is also held, for 37 days where he is experimented on. In the third season mid-season finale, Jefferson is recruited by Pariah to help the heroes stop the anti-matter cannon in the 2019-2020 Arrowverse crossover Crisis on Infinite Earths. The Anti-Monitor erases Jefferson's Earth but is later bought back to life after Oliver Queen's sacrifice to reboot the universe. This include's Jefferson's Earth being merged with the others, now called \\"Earth-Prime\\", and becomes a member of a league of heroes lead by Barry Allen in memory of Queen. =Film= * LeVar Burton provides the voice of Black Lightning in his single speaking line in the animated movie Superman/Batman: Public Enemies.

Description Local swimming hole on Obion River in West Tennessee, February 2012 CSX railroad bridge crossing Middle Fork of Obion River northwest of Gleason, February 2012 The Obion has four major forks, the North Fork, Middle Fork, South Fork and Rutherford Fork (which is named after the town of Rutherford). The confluences of these forks are a few miles above the mouth of the Obion's discharge into the Mississippi River. For the greater parts of their lengths, the forks exist as separate streams. In the mid-20th century, the Obion system was largely channelized for agricultural purposes, under the auspices of the Obion-Forked Deer Basin Authority, a Tennessee state agency that coordinated this work with the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Some of the adverse effects of channelization included increasing erosion of land, loss of wildlife habitat, and increased flooding downstream. But with the restoration of wetlands along the river in the 21st century, this process has now been halted and - in a few places - somewhat reversed. The origin of the name \\"Obion\\" is obscure. Some say that it is derived from a Native American word and others that it represents a corruption of the name of an Irish fur trapper, O'Bion or, perhaps, O'Brien. Obion County, Tennessee, is named after the Obion River. After the 1818 Chickasaw cession of West Tennessee (known in Kentucky as Jackson Purchase), explorer Davy Crockett moved to the South Fork Obion River. He later moved to Texas.

Benjamin Harris Brewster (October 13, 1816 ‚Äì April 4, 1888) was an attorney and politician from New Jersey, who served as United States Attorney General from 1881 to 1885. Biography =Early life= He was born on October 13, 1816 in Salem, New Jersey, and grew up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was the son of Maria Hampton, a daughter of Dr. John Thomas Hampton, a soldier of the American Revolutionary War and a close friend of Thomas Jefferson. His grandmother, Mercy Harris-Hampton, was the daughter of Benjamin Harris, the \\"fighting Quaker\\" of the American Revolutionary War. Benjamin Harris Brewster was named after him. Benjamin's father was Francis Enoch Brewster, a descendant of William Brewster, a passenger on the Mayflower. The elder Brewster was a successful and well-known attorney in Philadelphia who had abandoned Benjamin's mother, Maria Hampton, for her companion Isabella Anderson, by whom he had two children out of wedlock. His step-brothers were Frederick Carroll Brewster (1825‚Äì1898), who became Attorney General of Pennsylvania, and Enoch Carroll Brewster (1828‚Äì1863). Benjamin's sister, Anne Hampton Brewster (1818‚Äì1892), was one of America's first female foreign correspondents, publishing primarily in Philadelphia, New York and Boston newspapers. She was a \\"social outlaw\\" (as a friend described her) by refusing to marry, by converting to Catholicism, by moving out of her older brother Benjamin's house in order to live alone, by moving to Rome, and, foremost, by continuing to write through it all, first as a dilettante and then as a self- supporting professional. In their father's will he had named his two sons Frederick and Enoch Carroll Brewster as his sole beneficiaries. Benjamin fought on behalf of his sister for her share of the estate and for the destruction of the will, which he eventually won. =Education= He graduated from Princeton College in 1834 and was conferred upon the degrees of A.B., A.M., and LL.D. He studied law in the office of Eli Kirk Price, a noted Philadelphia lawyer and legal reformer and who was head of the Philadelphia Bar, and he was admitted to practice on January 5, 1838.. =Marriages= In 1857, he married as his first wife, Elizabeth von Myerbach de Reinfeldts, the widow of Dr. Shulte of Paris, France. Elizabeth died in 1868; however, Benjamin continued to spend many vacations with his wife's parents in Germany near Cologne. There were no children from his first marriage. He was remarried on July 12, 1870. His second wife, Mary Walker, was born in Mississippi on December 13, 1839, and died on March 9, 1886, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She was the daughter of Robert John Walker, Secretary of the Treasury under President James Knox Polk and Mary Blechenden Bache. Mary Bache was the daughter of Sophia Durrell Dallas and Richard Bache, Jr., who served in the Republic of Texas Navy and was elected as a Representative to the Second Texas Legislature in 1847. Sophia was the daughter of Arabella Maria Smith and Alexander J. Dallas an American statesman who served as the U.S. Treasury Secretary under President James Madison. She was a great-granddaughter of Sarah Franklin Bache and Richard Bache, and a great-great-granddaughter of Benjamin Franklin. In addition she was a niece of George Mifflin Dallas, the 11th Vice President of the United States, who served under James K. Polk. Mary Walker had married as her first husband, on May 25, 1858, Adrian Deslonde, the son of Andr√© Deslonde, a sugar planter from St. James Parish, Louisiana. His sister, Caroline Deslonde, married P.G.T. Beauregard, the Louisiana-born author, civil servant, politician, inventor, and the first prominent general for the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. Through his sister, Mathilde, he was a brother-in-law of John Slidell, a U.S. senator from Louisiana and later a Confederate diplomat. John's sister, Jane Slidell, was married to Matthew C. Perry. Commodore Perry of the U.S. Navy compelled the opening of Japan to the West with the Convention of Kanagawa in 1854. =Family= Benjamin and Mary had one child, Benjamin Harris Brewster, Jr., born on October 22, 1872, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Benjamin, Sr.'s great-grandson was Daniel Baugh Brewster (November 23, 1923 ‚Äì August 19, 2007), a Democratic member of the United States Senate, who represented the State of Maryland from 1963 until 1969. He was also a member of the Maryland House of Delegates from 1950 to 1958, and a representative from the 2nd congressional district of Maryland in the United States House of Representatives from 1959 to 1963. Career In 1846 Brewster was appointed commissioner by President James K. Polk to adjudicate the claims of the Cherokee against the U.S. federal government. He was appointed Attorney General of Pennsylvania in 1867 by Governor John W. Geary. He was chief prosecutor in the case of the U.S. Postal Service's Star Route Frauds. In 1881, Chester A. Arthur appointed Brewster Attorney General of the United States, an office he held for the duration of Arthur's term. Death He died on April 4, 1888, at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he is buried in Woodlands Cemetery.

Berry in the novel Kung Fu Master, Richard Dragon: Dragon's Fists (1974) under the pseudonym \\"Jim Dennis\\". O'Neil later adapted the character for DC Comics in the comic book Richard Dragon, Kung Fu Fighter. Dragon is a thief who was trained in martial arts and decides to use his abilities for good. Along with Batman, Bronze Tiger, Black Canary, and Lady Shiva, he is considered one of the top martial artists in the DC Universe. In DC's The New 52 continuity, Jeff Lemire introduced a new villanous character going by the name Richard Dragon, who was later revealed to be Ricardo Diaz, Jr., and to have been mentored by and killed the original heroic Richard Dragon. This later version of the character was subsequently adapted for the live-action TV series Arrow, portrayed by Kirk Acevedo and going by the name the \\"Dragon\\". Fictional character biography =Original history= As a teenage sneak thief in Japan, young Richard Dragon broke into a dojo outside of Kyoto to steal a priceless jade Buddha. Before he could get away, Dragon was caught and beaten by the dojo's teenage student, Ben Turner. O-Sensei, the dojo's master, saw something worth nurturing in Richard, and for the next seven years taught Ben and Richard, side by side, mastery of the martial arts. Richard came to find an inner peace, only using his skill when absolutely necessary. Once he felt there was nothing more he could teach them, the O-Sensei left the two. Turner and Dragon were recruited by Barney Ling, head of the law-keeping espionage agency known as G.O.O.D. (Global Organization of Organized Defense), to join the organization. Together Ben and Richard would defeat the corrupt businessman Guano Cravat, foiling his plans to instigate a war for his own benefit. Ben and Richard founded a martial arts dojo in Manhattan, and Richard would go on to battle international threats such as Telegram Sam, the Preying Mantis, the League of Assassins, and his former superior, Barney Ling. Thirsty for revenge, Cravat would arrange for the murder of Carolyn Wu-San, one of O-Sensei's god-daughters. Aided by Barney Ling, Cravat tricked Carolyn's sister, Sandra Wu-San, into believing Dragon was the murderer. Consumed with a need for revenge, Sandra trained to the peak of human capability, mastering martial arts to defeat Dragon. When the two masters finally met in battle, however, Dragon was able to show Sandra that Cravat had deceived her. Without Dragon's death as a goal, Sandra no longer had a need for her martial arts mastery. Sensing she needed guidance, Dragon helped her to explore the spiritual side of martial arts. Ultimately deciding that she was Sandra no more she rechristened herself \\"Shiva\\". She fought crime with Dragon and Ben Turner until the three parted ways. Turner, brainwashed by the villainous Sensei of the League of Assassins, became the renegade Bronze Tiger. Dragon decided to retire, devoting himself to teaching others. Lady Shiva became one of the world's greatest assassins. Training the Question Richard as he appeared in The Question. After the character's title was canceled, Dragon became a supporting character in the 1980s series, The Question. The title character of that book, Vic Sage, was a masked crime-fighter based in Hub City, who came into conflict with Lady Shiva. After all but killing The Question, Shiva sent him to see Richard Dragon for training. Sage's stubborn streak made him near impossible for most people to teach. However, when he met Dragon he found himself reluctant to challenge his new sensei because Dragon was in a wheelchair. Richard trained The Question both in martial arts and eastern philosophy, forcing him to question his world view and let go of much of his anger. Of note, he loosely quoted Zhuangzi's story \\"The Butterfly Dream\\". Later Richard would start referring to his student as \\"Butterfly\\" because of this. Richard said that Shiva had saved Sage because she saw a passion for combat in him while Richard, on the other hand, thought that Sage's passion was for curiosity. Regardless, Richard realized that for Sage to have a spiritual awakening he had to first let go of the self-destructive behaviors that Hub City brought out in him. Thus Richard sent Sage back home. As he left, Sage met Shiva again, and the two briefly sparred. She explained that this fight had been for her to test her own perceptions. She thought she had seen a \\"warrior's passion\\" in him that was lacking skills, and felt that she had been proved correct since he faced her a second time knowing she had destroyed him the first. Shiva concluded that she had been right about him and Richard wrong, but Sage proposed that maybe he had just been curious what would happen if they fought again, which would make Richard right. Sage adopted the identity of The Question again, futilely trying to save the city. Just as Sage's doomed efforts to save Hub City threatened to destroy him, Dragon arrived to advise his student. Dragon finally convinced Sage that his crusade to save Hub City was no longer doing anything but destroying him. When Sage collapsed from exhaustion and his injuries, Richard revealed that he was capable of using his legs perfectly, and put Sage in the wheelchair. Dragon had realized he would need the chair to make Sage let down his defences - Sage was so \\"full of macho\\" that he would never have listened to him otherwise.\\"The Question\\" #34 (1990) The chair had not been just a charade, however. Richard revealed that he had allowed himself to be handicapped as part of his own learning process, going on to state \\"I was a teacher then. I am about to become something else. So I discard that option\\". The city had truly degenerated by this point all pretense of law and order long lost. Richard, who had thought his studies had put him beyond such things, found himself shocked and horrified by the actions of people in Hub City. For example, a man was using a dead baby to try and beg for 'milk money'. When Richard and the others uncovered this, he tossed the body into a nearby trash can.\\"The Question\\" #35 (1990) Dragon wordlessly met Lady Shiva, who had arrived on the outskirts of Hub City in the helicopter that was to take Sage and Dragon away - she wished to go toward and enjoy the chaos that Sage and Richard were rejecting. Shiva uses force and threats to ensure the pilot would do what she wishes.\\"The Question\\" #36 (1990) Dragon as sensei to Barbara Gordon. Training Oracle Richard would next appear as sensei to Oracle, helping her to see past her own wheelchair-related limitations. Dragon spends months training her in escrima, the Philippine art of stick fighting, a martial art she could use despite her wheelchair. Training Huntress Dragon as Sensei to Helena Bertinelli prior to her of taking her vigilante identity Huntress. Not long after that, the masked heroine The Huntress became the main suspect in a series of murders. Realizing that her headstrong nature would likely mean her death this time, The Question saved her from her many pursuers (including the police and Batman), and took her to Richard Dragon. Seeing many similarities between her and The Question, Dragon helped teach the adventuress to control her anger and \\"slow down\\". After Huntress joined the Birds of Prey, Richard Dragon aided her in fighting the Twelve Brothers in Silk, an Asian martial arts squad that provided protection to a major heroin distributor. =Chuck Dixon Revamp= In 2004, the title was revived and the character revamped by Chuck Dixon and Scott McDaniel, only to be canceled after twelve issues. In this short series, Richard Dragon is a bullied school kid who enrolls in a karate dojo to better himself. Unfortunately, the dojo's instructor was a \\"mail-order\\" black belt, who is later defeated by the Bronze Tiger. The Bronze Tiger then agrees to train young Dragon. He eventually meets and falls in love with Lady Shiva. Although he wins the martial arts tournament she is watching, she chides him for not being able to live up to the powerful name of \\"Dragon.\\" Shiva becomes Dragon's lover and instructor, and the series touches on their now strained relationship. The series begins with the Tiger locating Dragon, who is seeking death by fighting in death matches. He agrees to help Dragon resolve his problems with Shiva if he agrees to stop killing. In tracking Shiva they are confronted by Nightwing and the new Green Arrow, Connor Hawke. Nightwing alludes to Dragon training him, as Dragon trained Bruce Wayne, who passed that training on to Nightwing. At the end of the series, Dragon and Shiva are pitted in combat. Dragon gains the upper hand in the fight, and as he begins to deliver his death blow, Shiva's devout followers rush to save her, knocking Dragon away. Unhappy at this disturbance, Shiva attacks and possibly kills her followers before returning to kill Dragon with her signature move, the Leopard Claw. Dragon is, however, resurrected by the demonic Neron who wants Dragon to kill Shiva. Dragon refuses and walks away from Neron, saying that both had held up their parts of the agreement. =52= Richard Dragon appears starting in Week 26 of the comic book 52, in the mystic city of Nanda Parbat, where he starts to train former Gotham Detective Renee Montoya. His appearance matches that of the Richard Dragon seen before the Dixon reboot (albeit with a full head of long hair, as when training Question and Oracle, rather than balding when training Huntress). In this story Dragon makes references to a conversation he had with The Question in the Question series, contradicting at least some of Chuck Dixon's Richard Dragon series. The 52 series is also where Richard's former student, Vic Sage, dies from cancer.\\"52\\" Week Thirty-Eight (2006) =The New 52= Ricardo Diaz, Jr. as a villainous version of Richard Dragon in Green Arrow #23 (October 2013 DC Comics).

A character identifying himself as Richard Dragon first appears in Green Arrow #23 (2013).Green Arrow Vol. 5 #23 In Green Arrow #31, he appears leading a team of Green Arrow's enemies, referred to as the Longbow Hunters.Green Arrow Vol. 5 #31 In Green Arrow #32 the character identifies himself as Ricardo Diaz, Jr., the namesake son of a drug kingpin who had been killed by John Diggle (posing as Green Arrow).Green Arrow Vol. 5 #32 He revealed that after his father's death and the fall of his criminal empire he sought out and found the League of Assassins where his sensei taught him to become a living weapon. He claims that when his sensei also taught him patience and compassion, which he perceived to be a weakness, he killed his sensei and took his name. Diaz/Dragon places a 30-million-dollar bounty on Green Arrow, which three members of the Longbow Hunters (Brick, Killer Moth, and Red Dart) intend to split. Green Arrow is able to defeat all of them with the help of his young half-sister, Emiko. Green Arrow is then reunited with his old partner, John Diggle, after Dragon attempts to kill Diggle by defenestration. In a fight against both Arrow and Diggle, Dragon is able to significantly injure both of them, but is ultimately defeated.Green Arrow Vol. 5 #36 Students of Richard Dragon The following have been trained by Richard Dragon: * The Question * Huntress * Oracle * Renee Montoya * Lady Shiva In the 2004 series, flashbacks indicated that Richard had trained several others, including Dick Grayson, Bruce Wayne, and Connor Hawke. Given that the version of Richard Dragon seen in 52 appeared to be the version seen prior to the 2004 retcon, the canonical nature of these students is unclear. In the New 52, the Green Arrow villain who takes the name Richard Dragon (Ricardo Diaz, Jr.) is revealed to have killed the original man by that name, who had been his sensei, explaining the original Richard Dragon's absence from the New 52. Powers and abilities Richard Dragon possesses no superhuman or metahuman powers, but is a superb athlete and a master martial artist. He is also a master of philosophy and specifically as it concerns a heroic lifestyle and he has guided those such as the Huntress or Wonder Woman in the past as to the correct path they need to live. When he focuses his inner energies (usually by touching the jade claw pendant the O-Sensei gave him), his spirit and body become (metaphorically) like unrelenting granite. He is considered one of the top martial artists in the DC Universe, mastering styles such as Aikido, Judo, Jujutsu, Karate, Kung Fu, Muay Thai, and Silat. Other versions Richard Dragon appears in comic continuation of Young Justice. Appearing in issue #0, Richard Dragon is a fighter of some sort. Wally West had a signed poster of Richard Dragon in his room. In other media =Television= Ricardo Diaz appears on the sixth season of the TV series Arrow, portrayed primarily by Kirk Acevedo with Max Archibald playing him as a child. He uses the alias \\"Dragon\\", alluding to the name adopted by his comic counterpart, as well as his internal hatred/passion for arson. As with the Lemire character, Diaz is a grounded crime lord with no costume, but a skilled fighter with dragon tattoos (in this case on his neck and left shoulder). Initially a drug dealer working under Cayden James and his Quadrant, he is eventually revealed as the mastermind behind the scheme, which sees him effectively take over Star City with its judges, politicians and police officers on his payroll. At the end of the season, Oliver Queen exposes and captures everyone on Diaz's payroll, forcing him to go into hiding. In season seven, Diaz looks for revenge on Queen by targeting not only him, but also his wife Felicity Smoak and son William. Having hired the Longbow Hunters to aid him, Diaz also obtains a drug, which grants him super-strength. Eventually, he is captured by Emiko Queen and Team Arrow. Initially incarcerated at Slabside Maximum Security Prison, Diaz is eventually made part of the Ghost Initiative, with which A.R.G.U.S. is trying to locate Ninth Circle financier Dante, through whom Diaz had hired the Longbow Hunters. Diaz initially plays along, but betrays the operation and helps Dante escape. Taken back to Slabside for violating the deal made to him, he is then burned to death in his cell by Emiko Queen, who is later revealed as the leader of the Ninth Circle, in order to prevent Diaz from revealing more about the Ninth Circle. =Film= Richard Dragon will appear in the animated film Batman: Soul of the Dragon voiced by Mark Dacascos. Unlike the comics, this version of Dragon is depicted as Asian and bears a strong resemblance to Bruce Lee.https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/batman-soul-dragon-sets- voice-cast-1306722 =Video games= Richard Dragon is mentioned in Batman: Arkham Origins.

It is a tributary of the Tellico River. Just before it empties into the Tellico, the river falls over a large waterfall, Bald River Falls, which is variously reported as being between 80 and 100 feet (25 and 30 m) high. The river then flows under a bridge on Forest Service Road 210 (the falls and the river mouth are both very readily visible from the bridge). The falls is regarded as the most impressive and scenic waterfall in East Tennessee. The river is short in length but powerful as it flows through a steep, densely wooded valley and it is constantly replenished by the area's frequent rains. It rises just north of the North Carolina state line near the crest of the Unicoi Mountains and flows northeast for a short distance before turning to the northwest. The forests of the Bald River basin and the Tellico River basin were almost completely logged by the Babcock Lumber Company during the early 20th century, from their local base of operation at Tellico Plains. The present road up the Tellico River was built on the old logging railroad bed built by Babcock.

Publication history Brainiac 8 first appeared in Titans/Young Justice: Graduation Day #1 and was created by Judd Winick and Al√© Garza. Fictional character biography Indigo is a gynoid and a member of the Outsiders. Born in a distant future era, she comes to the 21st century badly damaged, and desperately looks for a cybernetic or mechanical organism capable of repairing her. In the process, she tries to install her self- repairing routines into the Metal Men, but they are incapable of assisting her in maintenance. Then she turns to Cyborg, but in the process, she damages him. Attacked by the combined forces of Young Justice and the Titans, she retreats and switches into an offensive mode. Although the combined forces of the young superheroes best her, adding further damage, she is able to activate a dormant Superman robot before shutting down for repairs. Yet when the android comes after the young heroes (killing Lilith Clay and Donna Troy), Red Arrow (then going by the name \\"Arsenal\\") briefly reactivates the young female droid and sends her to stop the Superman Android before shutting down again. When Red Arrow (still calling himself Arsenal at the time) reforms the Outsiders, he claims the female droid, now called Indigo, as a teammate. Her memory was supposedly damaged in the aftermath of her dramatic appearance; any remainder was wiped out by S.T.A.R. Labs. Indigo displays a very naive personality, guilelessly taking pleasure in the simple things in life, like doing laundry for friends, bowling, and silent movies. She often struggles to learn how to behave in society, and takes her cues from those she lives with. As she grows more integrated in her quest to earn the acceptance and forgiveness of Nightwing and her teammates, she even manages to find love with Shift. It was revealed in Teen Titans (vol. 3) #24 that Indigo is actually Brainiac 8, and every bit the ruthless, inhuman villain that previous Brainiacs were. Indigo as the Outsiders knew her is essentially a subprogram, designed by Brainiac 8's \\"grandfather\\", Brainiac 6, to endear her to the superhero community. Brainiac 8 had been sent back in time to kill Donna Troy, because a living Donna would negate Coluan domination over the \\"organics\\" after the \\"Infinite Crisis\\" events. After a beating by the combined forces of Teen Titans and Outsiders, in Outsiders (vol. 3) #25, the Indigo persona wrests control from Brainiac 8, and reveals herself to be a genuine personality. Weeping, she begs Shift to kill her before the Brainac 8 persona could harm the people she loves. Shift, in tears, transforms her molecular structure into flesh, killing her in the process. The Origins and Omens back-up story in Titans #10 indicated that Indigo might soon return, but writer Judd Winick left the book before this plot thread could be followed up on. Indigo eventually returns in Teen Titans (vol. 3) #98 as part of Superboy-Prime's Legion of Doom. She now sports a cybernetic arm and eye, the origins of which are unexplained. During Teen Titans (vol. 3) #100, she is once again destroyed by Red Robin and Robin. Powers and abilities A unique inorganic being, Indigo possesses an analytical computer mind, can fly, and can project force fields and energy blasts from her eyes and hands. She is also able to interact with and control machines and robots. Other characters with the name Indigo * Indigo was also the name of a character in DP 7, one of the titles of Marvel Comics' short-lived New Universe imprint. * Indigo was another name used by the DC superhero Deep Blue. * Indigo was also the name of a member of Sovereign Seven. * Indigo-1 was also the name of the leader of the Indigo Tribe in The Blackest Night crossover event in 2009. She and her tribe derived their power from compassion. In other media =Television= Indigo appears in Supergirl, portrayed by Laura Vandervoort (who portrayed Supergirl on the TV show Smallville). She debuts in the episode \\"Solitude\\". It is mentioned that she was previously known as Brainiac-8, is a Coluan and a possible descendant of original Brainiac. Indigo initially appears as a blonde human on video monitors, but attains a form closer to that of her comics counterpart when in the real world. Eventually crossing paths with Supergirl, Indigo hacks a secret military base and also teams up with Supergirl's uncle and enemy Non. She reveals to Supergirl as she dies that she was the reason Fort Rozz and Supergirl escaped the Phantom Zone. Her plan is to destroy National City with a nuclear weapon, but she is killed by Winn Schott, Jr. when he downloads a virus into her. However, Non later reanimates her. Indigo reappears in \\"Myriad\\", now working with Non conducting Project Myriad. In the season finale \\"Better Angels\\", she and Non try to kill all of the people in National City using Myriad. Indigo is killed for good during a final confrontation with the Martian Manhunter and Supergirl when the former rips her body in half. Before she dies, she reveals that she has locked the system to activate Myriad, so Kara and J'onn will have no choice but to watch everyone on Earth die. Indigo is ultimately defeated in death when Supergirl saves the world by flying Fort Rozz into space, pushing herself to her limits to push it out of the earth's orbit, saving the world. =Video games= Indigo appears as a playable character in the DC TV Super-Villains DLC pack in Lego DC Super-Villains.

Rainbow trout are stocked in many streams and rivers. Brook trout and brown trout are also present. Bass, bluegill and crappie are found in the forest's lakes, which are also open to wind surfing, water skiing and boating. Trails criss-cross the forest. In addition to the Appalachian Trail, these include the John Muir Recreation trail, other hiking trails, and some trails designed for equestrian use. Bicycle trails are being developed. Camping is available in RV campgrounds and tent-only camping areas, and primitive tent camping is allowed throughout much of the forest.

Born Anissa Pierce the eldest daughter of superhero Black Lightning, she is a metahuman in the DC Universe. She is capable of increasing her physical density, rendering herself bulletproof, and creating massive shockwaves when stomping upon the ground. Pierce is also the older sister of Jennifer, herself a superhero operating under the alias Lightning. Against her parents' wishes, Anissa chooses to utilize her abilities to fight crime. She is invited and accepts a position with the superhero team the Outsiders. Pierce is involved in a relationship with her teammate Grace Choi. Along with her presence in various comic books Thunder has made appearances on a number of television shows and appears in the live action series Black Lightning where she is portrayed by Nafessa Williams. Fictional character biography =Daughter of Black Lightning= Although it is not clear but one assumes she got her powers genetically from her father who is also a metahuman. Her father Jefferson Pierce (Black Lightning) and her mother Lynn Stewart did not want her following in his footsteps, and he struck a bargain with her: she would graduate from college before considering a career in crimefighting. She did, and the same night of her graduation she donned a costume and became Thunder.Outsiders vol. 3 #1 (August 2002)Teen Titans/Outsiders Secret Files and Origins #1 (December 2003) She is also the older sister of Lightning. =Outsiders= Shortly after Thunder had started her solo career, she was approached by Arsenal, who offered her a spot on the new team of Outsiders. Reasoning that she could best learn the superhero trade with a team, she agreed to this offer and became an Outsider. Although she got along with most of her teammates, she seemed to come into conflict with Grace, a tough promiscuous bouncer, constantly. They were however quite effective as a team, and the two slowly came to a grudging respect between them; later on they became lovers.Outsiders #41 (December 2006) Eventually her father appeared at the Outsiders headquarters, demanding her resignation from the team.Outsiders #9 (April 2004) Naturally, she refused and when the danger of Sabbac arose again, her father even decided to accompany the Outsiders.Outsiders #10 (May 2004) During that adventure, the two came to respect each other's abilities, neither having seen the other in action before, and Thunder was allowed to remain an Outsider. The extent of her invulnerability was tested during a fight with the re-formed Fearsome Five. The matter transmuter Shimmer converted the air in her lungs to water, which caused an inflammation so great that she had pulmonary edema and Acute respiratory distress syndrome, which nearly killed her.Outsiders #14 (September 2004) She recovered and continued to serve with the Outsiders. =\\"One Year Later\\"= OYL, Anissa remains a member of the Outsiders (a team that was currently believed to be dead), and has been involved in the attempted toppling of the regime of Mali. Her role has been instrumental in the mission, having gone undercover amongst the government, a role that has required her to pretend she was having a sexual relationship with the country's ruler Ratun Bennin; in actuality Metamorpho used a hallucinogenic compound to fool the dictator. She compromised the team's mission when she revealed her cover and attacked Mali's army, who were going to slaughter a village.Outsiders #34 (May 2006) It was revealed that Thunder has been in a romantic relationship with her teammate Grace, making her one of a handful of LGBT people of color in the DC roster. Thunder was recently kicked off The Outsiders upon Batman's reorganization of the team, being replaced by the Martian Manhunter.Outsiders: Five of a Kind - Thunder and Martian Manhunter #1 (October 2007) She rejoined the team, when Grace invited her on a mission, without Batman's approval.Batman and The Outsiders #1 (December 2007) During the Batman R.I.P. events an assembly of the Outsiders, including Anissa, receives a message from the missing Batman, asking them to feed a secret code in the cybernetic mind of the ReMAC, allowing him to track the Caped Crusader and the Black Glove and help him into his fight. As they reluctantly comply, due to Batgirl, the code reveals itself as a cybernetic boobytrap set by Doctor Hurt, the mastermind behind Batman's downfall, and ReMAC explodes. Several Outsiders are wounded, and Anissa sustains brain injuries severe enough to knock her in a seemingly irreversible coma.Batman and The Outsiders #12 (December 2008) However her in-costume appearance in the \\"Final Crisis: Submit\\" story suggest she recovered afterwards, as the Final Crisis storyline occurs after the events in R.I.P.,Final Crisis: Submit (December 2008) though Thunder is still shown in a coma during the Batman and the Outsiders Special, where her father ultimately joins up with a new roster of Outsiders to take her place. Thunder eventually reappears many months later, now living with Grace in a state of semi- retirement. The inconsistencies regarding her coma are briefly touched upon when it is explained that Anissa had been \\"in and out of hospitals\\" for a prolonged period after her initial injuries. Following a botched mission, Black Lightning arrives at Anissa and Grace's apartment with several other fugitive members of the new Outsiders, telling Anissa that he simply wishes to see his children again after spending months without any contact with his family. He briefly expresses discomfort over his daughter's sexual orientation, but Anissa tells him off by stating that Grace was there for her when he wasn't. When the Justice Society of America attacks the apartment in order to bring the Outsiders into custody, Anissa chooses to side with her father and fight off the attacking heroes, which ultimately leads to a confrontation with her younger sister, Lightning, whom she claims was always thought of as the \\"favorite\\". After the fight is broken up by Doctor Fate, Anissa and Grace choose to rejoin the Outsiders on a mission to Markovia, where they have been tasked by Amanda Waller with capturing Geo- Force.Outsiders (vol. 4) #36 Powers and abilities Thunder has the ability to increase her body's mass while preserving volume, which effectively increases her density. In this state she is near-immovable, almost completely invulnerable. A mob enforcer once suffered a compound fracture after trying to punch Thunder in the face.

Nippon Yacht Co, Ltd On July 31, 1967, the Nippon Yacht Corporation was established to handle the real estate of ships. On December 6, 1982, Nippon Yacht Co, Ltd was renamed \\"Tehkan Electronics Corporation\\". =Merger of Tecmo and Tehkan Electronics Corporation. Focus on console video games= On April 1, 1987, Tecmo Co., Ltd merged with its sister company Tehkan Electronics Corporation. The former's name was retained for the merger but the latter was the actual surviving company. By the turn of the decade, Tecmo was firmly in the camp of video game consoles. Though still involved in the arcade industry, much of the success was achieved on the Nintendo Entertainment System with titles such as Ninja Gaiden, Tecmo Bowl and the Japan-only Tsuppari ≈åzum≈ç. When Sony released its PlayStation in the 1990s, Tecmo joined the endeavor which set the tone for series such as Dead or Alive, Monster Rancher, Deception and Gallop Racer. On July 18, 2006, Tecmo's founder and chairman Yoshihito Kakihara died of interstitial pneumonia at the age of 67. Tecmo entered the second section of Tokyo Stock Exchange in March 2000 and transitioned to the first section in March 2001. It delisted on March 26, 2009 right before the merger with Koei took effect. =Lawsuit= On the June 3, 2008 Team Ninja head Tomonobu Itagaki resigned from the company and filed a 145 million yen ($1.4 million) lawsuit for \\"unpaid completion bonuses\\" and \\"emotional distress\\". This was followed by another lawsuit filed on the 16th of June by two plaintiffs on behalf of Tecmo's 300 employees for unpaid wages amounting to ¬•8.3 million. =Merger with Koei= On August 29, 2008 Square Enix made plans for a friendly takeover of Tecmo by purchasing shares at a 30 percent premium with a total bid of ¬•22.3 billion. On September 4, 2008 Tecmo officially declined the takeover proposal. Tecmo subsequently engaged in talks with Koei about a possible merger between the two companies, and agreed in November 2008 to merge on April 1, 2009 to form Tecmo Koei Holdings. On January 26, 2009 the two companies officially announced the merger, and the holding company formed on April 1, 2009 as planned. Tecmo initially continued to be operated as a subsidiary and brandname of Tecmo Koei Holdings. In January 2010, the United States subsidiaries of Tecmo Inc. and Koei America merged to create Tecmo Koei America Corporation. Tecmo was effectively declared disbanded in Japan on April 1, 2010, as part of a major international reorganization within Tecmo Koei Holdings. Relevant intellectual properties were slated to be further managed by Koei Tecmo Games. On March 15, 2010, and roughly two weeks before Tecmo was dissolved, its internal development studio was spun off as a separate company under the name of \\"Tecmo Co, Ltd.\\", a wholly owned subsidiary of Koei Tecmo Games. This new company was initially called \\"Tehkan\\" to avoid confusion with the other company that was still operating for another two weeks. When Tecmo disbanded on April 1, 2010, Tekhan was renamed Tecmo. This was short-lived as the new Tecmo along with the new Koei video game developers were both dissolved and merged into Koei Tecmo Games a year later, on April 1, 2011. Despite having been dissolved twice as a legal entity, Tecmo continued to appear as a label on video games by Koei Tecmo Games until another corporate reorganization in 2016 abandoned the brand name for good. Video games by Koei Tecmo Games marketed with the Tecmo logotype included Dead or Alive 5, Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge and Deception IV: The Nightmare Princess.

It stretches from the northeast edge of the city to the crestline of the Sandia MountainsThe upper station of the tramway is at a point on the main crest of the Sandia Mountains at elevation , about south of Sandia Crest, the high point of the range. The operators of the Tramway term this point \\"Sandia Peak\\", but this is a misnomer, as this is not an official name, and it is not a \\"peak\\" in the sense of having any topographic prominence. and has the world's third longest single span. It is the longest aerial tram in the Americas. History The Sandia Peak Ski Company was cofounded by Ben Abruzzo and Robert Nordhaus (father of Nobel-prize-winning economist William Nordhaus), and Nordhaus was inspired to build a tram to the ski slope after seeing other trams during a trip to Europe.http://sandiapeak.com/index.php?page=history-technology Bell Engineering of Lucerne, Switzerland, constructed the tramway. Entering service on May 7, 1966, the tram makes 10,500 trips per year. The tram is a type known as a \\"double reversible jigback aerial tramway,\\" where \\"jigback\\" implies that when one tram car is ascending, the other is descending. Its two cars are capable of carrying 50 passengers each and have numerous safety and backup systems, such as multiple emergency braking systems and a grounding system that ensures the safety of passengers in the event of a lightning strike. New tram cars were installed in 1986, and new track cables in 2009. New tram cars were again installed in May 2016. Description The tramway ascends the steep western side of the highest portion of the Sandia Mountains, from a base elevation of to a top elevation of . A trip up the mountain takes fifteen minutes to ascend , and the normal operating speed of the tram is . Approximately four \\"flights\\" leave every hour from the base and top departure stations. The view from the tram includes all of Albuquerque and roughly 11,000 square miles (28,000 square kilometers) of the New Mexico countryside. An overview of the tramway and a view of metropolitan Albuquerque from the upper station. The tramway has only two support towers. The first tower, which is tall, is situated at an elevation of above sea level and built as an inclined tower with an inclination angle of 18 degrees. The second, just tall, is situated at the end of a major spur of the mountains at an elevation of and was built by helicopter aid. The longest span is between the second tower and the top terminal. This span is the third longest clear tramway span in the world, at a length of . Mid-span, the cables are above the mountainside. This span passes over Domingo Baca Canyon, part of which is referred to as TWA Canyon. This is the site of the crash of TWA Flight 260 on February 19, 1955, in which the lives of all 16 passengers and crew were lost. While much of the wreckage was removed during construction of the tramway, some still remains on the canyon floor and may be visible to riders of the tram. Activities on top Sandia Peak Ski Area At the top of Sandia Peak there are many year-round recreational options. The restaurant, 103, is directly adjacent to the top tram terminal and offers scenic views to the west. Many Forest Service trails offer recreational hiking, backpacking and nature hikes to visitors. Additionally, the tram terminal is located at the top of Sandia Peak Ski Area which is on the opposite side of the mountain from the tramway and the city. Skiing is available in the wintertime, and during the summer over of mountain biking trails are available. Bikes cannot be brought on tram cars. There is no public transportation in this area of Albuquerque; the tram is accessible only by car, bicycle, or foot.

With a length of , it is a major tributary of the Little Tennessee River, and is one of the primary streams draining the Unicoi Mountains. The Tellico River and its main tributaries are renowned for their brook, brown, and rainbow trout fishing. Upstream from Tellico Lake, above Tellico Plains, Tennessee, the Tellico is a premier trout stream. It meanders through a mountain gorge before reaching the broad plains downstream of Tellico Plains. Hydrography The Tellico River rises in the Unicoi Mountains (a subrange of the Blue Ridge Mountains) near the Cherokee County/Graham County line, in North Carolina's Nantahala National Forest. The North Carolina side includes the Upper Tellico Off-highway vehicle area. The lower Tellico River, near the Sequoyah Birthplace Museum After the river crosses into Tennessee and enters the Cherokee National Forest, it is joined by its major tributaries, the Bald and North rivers. After exiting the mountains, the river enters Tellico Plains, a relatively flat and isolated area carved out by the river and several tributaries, namely Morgan Creek and Smoky Run. A stretch of the river above Tellico Plains runs parallel to the Cherohala Skyway. Beyond Tellico Plains, the river winds its way northward through rural Monroe County, Tennessee, before entering the slack waters of Tellico Lake. This lower section of the river absorbs several major streams, including Ballplay Creek and Notchy Creek. Fort Loudoun, a reconstructed 18th-century fort that is now the focus of a state park, stands on an island at the Tellico River's confluence with the Little Tennessee River. History The Tellico River basin was logged by the Babcock Lumber Company in the early 20th century. The present-day road up the Tellico River from Tellico Plains was built on the old Babcock logging railroad bed. After the Tellico River basin forests were cut, Babock sold the land to the United States Forest Service. The Tellico River's rocky descent provides class III-IV whitewater recreation. The runs are especially popular during the spring because of higher water levels. The narrow extreme rapids on the Tellico River are well suited for kayaks, canoes - C1's and duckies, but not for larger rafts. There is continuous access to the river from the road, but these runs are popular: * Trout Hatchery to Bridge above the Bald River confluence, class II-III * The Ledges - from the Bridge above the Bald River confluence to bridge below Jared's Knee, class III-IV * Bridge below Jared's Knee to Ranger Station, class II-III * Ranger Station to Tellico Plains, class I-III Etymology According to the United States Geological Survey, variant names of the Tellico River include Delaquay River, Talequo River, Terrique River, and Tellequo River. The word \\"Tellico\\" was the name of several Cherokee towns, the largest of which was Great Tellico, located on the Tellico River near present-day Tellico Plains, Tennessee. In Cherokee the word is more properly written \\"Talikwa\\". According to James Mooney, the Cherokee meaning of the word was lost.Mooney, James Myths of the Cherokee (1900, repr. 1995). The origin of the word is believed to be Muskogee (Creek). A Muskogean town named Taliko was thriving on the Tellico River when Spanish explorers visited in area in the mid-16th century. Taliko means \\"bean\\" in Muskogee.

This is the infective form of the fungus occurring in nature Septate hyphae of Coccidioides immitis with 90 degree branching and thick walled barrel shaped arthroconidia alternating with empty cells Coccidioides immitis is a pathogenic fungus that resides in the soil in certain parts of the southwestern United States, northern Mexico, and a few other areas in the Western Hemisphere. Epidemiology C. immitis, along with its relative C. posadasii, is most commonly seen in the desert regions of the southwestern United States, including certain areas of Arizona, California, New Mexico, Nevada, Texas, and Utah; and in Central and South America in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Paraguay, and Venezuela. =Precise location= C. immitis is largely found in California, but also Baja California and Arizona, while C. posadasii is regularly found in Texas, northern Mexico and in Central and South America. Both C. immitis and C. posadasii are present in Arizona.Hospenthal, Duane R., and Michael G. Rinaldi. Diagnosis and Treatment of Human Mycoses. Totowa, N.J.: Humana Press, 2007, p. 296-297. C. immitis is more common west of the Tehachapi mountains, while posadasii east of it.http://www.mdpi.com/2309-608X/2/4/34/pdf Coccidioides spp. are found in alkaline, sandy soils from semi-desert regions with hot summers, gentle winters, and annual rainfall between 10 and 50 cm. These fungi are usually found 10 to 30 cm beneath the surface. Clinical manifestation C. immitis can cause a disease called coccidioidomycosis (valley fever).https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/coccidioidomycosis/symptoms.html Its incubation period varies from 7 to 21 days. Coccidioidomycosis is not easily diagnosed on the basis of vital signs and symptoms, which are usually vague and nonspecific. Even a chest X-ray or CT scan cannot reliably distinguish it from other lung diseases, including lung cancer. Blood or urine tests are administered, which aim to discover Coccidioides antigens. However, because the Coccidioides creates a mass that can mimic a lung tumor, the correct diagnosis may require a tissue sample (biopsy). A Gomori methenamine silver stain can then confirm the presence of the Coccidioides organism's characteristic spherules within the tissue. The C. immitis fungus can be cultured from a patient sample, but the culture can take weeks to grow and requires special precautions on a part of the laboratory staff while handling it (screw cap vials and sterile transfer hoods are recommended). It is reported as the tenth-most often acquired infection in the laboratory conditions with two documented deaths. Until October 2012, C. immitis had been listed as a select agent by both the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and was considered a biosafety level 3 pathogen.  Treatment  * Most Coccidioides infections have an incubation period from one to four weeks and resolve without specific therapy; few clinical trials have assessed outcomes in less-severe disease. * Commonly used indicators to judge the severity of illness include: ** Continuous fever for longer than 1 month ** Body-weight loss of more than 10% ** Intense night sweats that persist for more than 3 weeks ** Infiltrates that involve more than half of one lung or portions of both lungs ** Prominent or persistent hilar adenopathy ** Anticoccidioidal complement fixation IgG titers of 1:16 or higher ** Absence of dermal hypersensitivity to coccidioidal antigens ** Inability to work ** Symptoms that persist for more than 2 months * Risk factors for dissemination (for which treatment should be initiated): ** Primary infection during infancy ** Primary infection during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester or immediately post partum ** Immunosuppression (e.g., patients with HIV/AIDS, transplant recipients, patients receiving high-dose corticosteroids, those receiving antitumor necrosis factor medications) ** Chronic debilitation or underlying disease, including diabetes mellitus or preexisting cardiopulmonary disease ** High inoculum exposures ** Certain ethnicities, such as Filipino, Black, or Hispanic ** Age greater than 55 years = Azoles = The introduction of azoles revolutionized treatment for coccidioidomycosis, and these agents are usually the first line of therapy. However, none of these azoles are safe to use in pregnancy and lactation because they have shown teratogenicity in animal studies. Of the azoles, ketoconazole is the only one approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of coccidioidomycosis. Nevertheless, although it was initially used in the long-term treatment of nonmeningeal extrapulmonary disease, more-potent, less-toxic triazoles (fluconazole and itraconazole) have replaced it. Itraconazole (400 mg/day) appears to have efficacy equal to that of fluconazole in the treatment of nonmeningeal infection and have the same relapse rate after therapy is discontinued. However, itraconazole seems to perform better in skeletal lesions, whereas fluconazole performs better in pulmonary and soft tissue infection. Serum levels of itraconazole are commonly obtained at the onset of long-term therapy because its absorption is sometimes erratic and unpredictable. Complications can include hepatic dysfunction. For patients who are unresponsive to fluconazole, options are limited. Several case reports have studied the efficacy of three newer antifungal agents in the treatment of disease that is refractory to first-line therapy: posaconazole and voriconazole (triazole compounds similar in structure to fluconazole) and caspofungin (glucan synthesis inhibitor of the echinocandin structural class). However, these drugs have not been FDA approved, and clinical trials are lacking. Susceptibility testing of Coccidioides species in one report revealed uniform susceptibility to most antifungal agents, including these newer drugs. In very severe cases, combination therapy with amphotericin B and an azole have been postulated, although no trials have been conducted. Caspofungin in combination with fluconazole has been cited as beneficial in a case report of a 31-year-old Asian patient with coccidioidal pneumonia. In a case report of a 23-year-old Black male with HIV and coccidioidal meningitis, combination therapy of amphotericin B and posaconazole led to clinical improvement. Posaconazole has been approved by the European Commission as a salvage therapy for refractory coccidioidomycosis. Clinical trials are now ongoing for further evaluation. Voriconazole is also being studied in salvage therapy for refractory cases. A case report indicated that voriconazole in combination with amphotericin B as salvage therapy for disseminated coccidioidomycosis was successful. Several case reports have studied caspofungin, with differing results. Caspofungin 50 mg/day following administration of amphotericin B in a patient with acute pulmonary coccidioidomycosis who had undergone transplantation showed promising results. In a patient with disseminated coccidioidomycosis, first-line therapy with amphotericin B and caspofungin alone failed to elicit a response, but the patient was then given caspofungin combined with fluconazole, with good results. A published report described a patient with disseminated and meningeal coccidioidomycosis in whom conventional therapy with fluconazole, voriconazole, and amphotericin B failed; caspofungin 50 mg/day after a loading dose of 70 mg intravenously was also unsuccessful. = Amphotericin = Amphotericin B, introduced in 1957, remains the treatment of choice for severe infections. It is usually reserved for worsening disease or lesions located in vital organs such as the spine. It can be administered either in the classic amphotericin B deoxycholate formulation or as a lipid formulation. No studies have directly compared amphotericin B with azole therapy. Complications include renal toxicity, bone marrow toxicity, and local systemic effects (fever, rigors). = Duration of therapy and costs = The objectives of treatment are resolution of infection, decrease of antibody titers, return of function of involved organs, and prevention of relapse. The duration of therapy is dictated by the clinical course of the illness, but it should be at least 6 months in all patients and often a year or longer in others. Therapy is tailored based on a combination of resolution of symptoms, regression of radiographic abnormalities, and changes in CF IgG titers. Immunocompromised patients and patients with a history of meningeal involvement require lifelong treatment. The cost of antifungal therapy is high, from $5,000 to $20,000 per year. These costs increase for critical patients in need of intensive care. Arizona spent an average of $33,762 per patient with coccidioidomycosis between 1998 and 2001. HHS select agents listing Along with C. posadasii, C. immitis was featured on the select agents and toxins list compiled by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), as evident from the Code of Federal Regulations (42 CFR 73). However, on October 5, 2012 due to advances in medical research and development of a number of licensed treatments, both pathogens were removed from the HHS select agents listing.

A family friend, Mrs Ransom, gave evidence that Chamberlain had always wanted a girl., National Museum of Australia, 2001. Accessed 2012-6-02. Chamberlain's first daughter, Azaria, was born 11 June 1980. Her second daughter and fourth child, Kahlia, was born in November 1982 . According to the findings of the third inquest, the evidence for some aspects of Chamberlain's mothering was undisputed: She was described as being \\"an exemplary mother\\". * She had no mental illness. * She was never violent with her children. * She had given no indication of being irritated with Azaria. * She gave no indication of being stressed when she took Azaria and indicated that she was putting her to bed. Azaria's disappearance When Azaria was two months old, the family went on a camping trip to Uluru, arriving on 16 August 1980. On the night of 17 August, Chamberlain reported that the child had been taken from their tent by a dingo.Winterman, Denise, Dingoes: How dangerous are they?, BBC News, 2012-02-25. A massive search was organised; Azaria was not found but the jumpsuit she had been wearing was discovered about a week later about 4km (2.5 miles) from the tent, bloodstained about the neck, indicating the probable death of the missing child. A matinee jacket the child had been wearing was not found at the time.Lewis, Roger, , Deakin University, 2001. Accessed 2012-2-26. From the day Azaria went missing, Lindy and Michael Chamberlain maintained a dingo took their child. Early on in the case, the facts showed that for the two years before Azaria went missing, Uluru chief ranger Derek Roff had been writing to the government urging a dingo cull and warning of imminent human tragedy. Roff noted that dingoes in the area were becoming increasingly aggressive, approaching and sometimes biting people.Toohey, Paul, , The Australian, 2000-7-15. Accessed 2012-2-25. Conviction, imprisonment and release The initial inquiry, held in Alice Springs, Northern Territory, by Alice Springs magistrate and coroner Dennis Barritt in December 1980 and January 1981, supported the Chamberlains' account of Azaria's disappearance, finding a dingo took the child. The Supreme Court quashed the findings of the initial inquest and ordered a second inquest in December 1981, with the taking of evidence concluded in February 1982. By an indictment presented to the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory in September 1982, Chamberlain was charged with Azaria's murder. Michael Chamberlain was charged with being an accessory after the fact. On 29 October 1982 the Chamberlains were both found guilty as charged. =Second inquest= In committing the Chamberlains for trial, the coroner who performed the second inquest and recorded findings as to the cause and manner of Azaria's death, stated that although the evidence was, to a large degree, circumstantial, a jury properly instructed could arrive at a verdict; with regard to the clothing evidence, he surmised that the Chamberlains knew dingoes were in the area, attempted to simulate a dingo attack, recovered Azaria's buried body, removed her clothing, damaged it by cutting, rubbed it in vegetation, and deposited the clothes for later recovery. On this basis and that of blood evidence of unknown origin found in the Chamberlains' car, the Chamberlains were prosecuted and convicted for the murder of their 2-month-old baby, with Lindy sentenced to life imprisonment without parole and Michael Chamberlain suspended for three years as an accessory to murder. The stain believed to have been blood that was found in the Chamberlains' car was later determined to be most likely a sound-deadening compound from a manufacturing overspray. =Prosecution claims= The prosecution's theory was that, in a five - to ten-minute absence from the camp fire, Lindy returned to her tent, did whatever was necessary to stop her young son Aidan from following her, changed into tracksuit pants, took Azaria to her car, obtained and used scissors to cut Azaria's throat, waited for Azaria to die (options were carotid arteries or jugular ‚Äì all experts said there was an absence of evidence of arterial bleeding on the jumpsuit blood stains and it would take up to 20 minutes if the death was from cutting the jugular), hid the body in a camera case in the car, cleaned up blood on everything including the outside of the camera case, removed the tracksuit pants, obtained baked beans for her son from the car, returned to the tent, did something to leave blood splashes there and brought her son Aidan back to the campfire without ever attracting the attention of other campers except for camper Greg Lowe who gave evidence that he observed her to go to the tent with Azaria and Aidan and then walk to the car with her left arm around Aidan and her right arm unimpeded. She also counted on her son not noticing she had taken Azaria and returned without her and asking her publicly where she had taken Azaria. She then later returned to the tent and immediately claimed that she saw a dingo taking her baby with evidence implicating a dingo being purely coincidental. No-one noticing alleged blood on Mrs Chamberlain's clothes in the hours after the disappearance was purely fortunate. Mrs Chamberlain opening the car where the body was allegedly hidden to give a dog the scent of Azaria from the clothes in the car was a daring act. She also must have somehow done it without her husband's knowledge or he was also incredibly daring given that he left his children in her care afterward and he told the police that he had given them the wrong camera case and then gave them the one that was allegedly used to conceal the body.Reference Under S.433A of the Criminal Code by the Attorney-General for the Northern Territory of Australia of Convictions of Alice Lynne Chamberlain and Michael Leigh Chamberlain, Supreme Court of the Northern Territory of Australia, No. CA2, 1988. (Acquittal decision.) In the second inquest, concerning the clothing evidence alone: 1\\\\. The clothing of the deceased child had been buried prior to its finding and probably contained the body of the child when buried. 2\\\\. Soil type of a PH found on the clothing is consistent with the PH of the soil at the camp and also with the consistency of the soil in clothing and at the site and is inconsistent with the type of soil and PH in the area in which the clothing was found. 3\\\\. There is no evidence on the clothing of dragging or catching nor the presence of saliva. It was argued that the absence of saliva was not remarkable as a witness gave evidence of heavy rain in the area. The clothing was not subjected to heavy rain as there is evidence that such heavy rain would have adversely affected the bloodstaining on the clothing and this is not the case. This lack of presence of saliva and dragging is inconsistent with a dingo carrying the body a distance of some four kilometres. 4\\\\. The jumpsuit was completely done up by studs to the neck which remained closed while the child was bleeding. 5\\\\. After the blood had dried the two top studs were undone prior to the clothing being buried whilst containing the body of the child. 6\\\\. There is evidence provided by fluorescent examination to suggest the presence of a palm print of a small adult right hand and some evidence of the presence of a left hand caused by a person holding the child when that person‚Äôs hands were contaminated with wet blood. 7\\\\. Single holes or indentations which appear in the clothing could be consistent with teeth marks of an animal but the absence of tissue stains in conjunction with those holes make it inconsistent with an animal holding the body of the child. The evidence clearly establishes that the clothing has been cut and in places torn by a person or persons and in particular the cut on the collar was made after the bloodstaining had occurred, It was argued that one area of damage in the general area of the elbow may be consistent with an animal tearing, but the evidence is very strong that such a tearing by an animal would be inconsistent because of the lack of evidence of the presence of tissue staining which would inevitably be involved if an animal had caused the damage to the clothing. 8\\\\. Vegetation contamination on the clothing is inconsistent with vegetation found at the scene and inconsistent with the likely contamination which would have occurred if the clothing with a body in it had been carried by an animal. This supports the view that the vegetation contamination was caused by human intervention. 9\\\\. The clothes as found were not strewn around the area and this is inconsistent with an animal being responsible for their placement. 10\\\\. The clothing was found adjacent to a path near the base of a rock and adjacent to a dingo‚Äôs lair. 11\\\\. Scissors were found in the Chamberlain‚Äôs car on which there was present human foetal blood staining on the cutting edge and on the hinge areas. There is evidence to support that when comparable scissors are used to cut through blood that blood would be deposited on the cutting edge. An inference can be drawn that these scissors were used to cut the deceased‚Äôs clothing. There is no weight to the argument that the subject scissors were unable to cut clothing as this was after the stud had been removed from the scissors to enable certain tests. From this evidence it was concluded that both Mr and Mrs Chamberlain were implicated in covering their crime. The prosecution's expert testimony for forensic evidence included that of James Cameron, a scientist who had also given crucial evidence in a case in England which was later overturned when his expert evidence was proved wrong. With regard to the timing of the baby's cry and Mrs. Chamberlain's whereabouts, the prosecution also claimed that the Chamberlains convinced fellow camper and witness Sally Lowe to say that she heard Azaria cry after Mrs. Chamberlain returned to the camp fire. =Evidence that a dingo took Azaria Chamberlain= Camper Sally Lowe and Lindy's husband Michael gave evidence that they heard a baby cry at a time when Chamberlain was with them at the barbecue area and Azaria was believed to be in the family tent. Witness Judith West, who was camped 30 metres (98 feet) away, testified to hearing a dog's low, throaty growl coming from that direction, a sound that she associated with growls her husband's dogs made when he was slaughtering sheep. Chamberlain gave evidence that, in response to others hearing Azaria cry, she went to the tent. Half way to the tent she thought she saw a dingo emerging from the tent having difficulty getting out of the tent and shaking its head vigorously. Her view of its nose was obscured. She cried \\"Michael, Michael, the dingo's got my baby!\\" and ran into the tent to check on her children. Azaria was missing. She chased in the direction she thought it had gone, and called out to her husband for a torch. Police Detective Sergeant John Lincoln gave evidence that he took photographs of large paw prints a few centimetres from Azaria's cot and found what was probably blood outside the tent. He collected samples but they were not tested. Camper Sally Lowe gave evidence that she had brought Chamberlain's son Reagan out of the tent after the occurrence. When she was in the tent she observed a pool of blood in the tent about 15 cm by 10 cm (6 by 4 inches). However, the amount of blood was disputed. Another witness who entered the tent that night, police Constable Frank Morris, gave evidence that there were only a few drops of blood on a couple of blankets and a sleeping bag in the tent. A scientific witness located blood on the wall of the tent. Scientist Dr. Andrew Scott agreed that the spray mark of blood was consistent with a dingo carrying a bleeding baby. However he did not believe that it was human blood. Canine hairs were located in the tent and on Azaria's jumpsuit. The Chamberlains did not own a dog. Les Harris, then President of the Dingo Foundation, gave evidence that his opinion based on years of studying dingoes is that a dingo could have enveloped the head of a baby in its mouth and carried the weight of a baby over long distances. He produced photographs of dingoes enveloping the head of a baby- sized doll in its jaws. However, forensic expert Professor James Cameron gave evidence that, based on studying plaster casts of dingo jaws, it was impossible for a dingo to open its jaws wide enough to encompass a child's head. Tourist Max Whittacker gave evidence that he attended a search later on the night of the disappearance with people including the head ranger and an Aboriginal tracker. He claimed to have been called by the ranger Derek Roff to help him and the Aboriginal tracker to follow dingo paw prints and scrape marks in the sand in a westerly direction. He was led to believe they were following the trail of a dingo carrying a heavy object believed to be Azaria's body. \\"I now know that the Aboriginal's account of following these tracks west that night has been denied by rangers and the Aboriginal's account of this incident has not been accepted.\\" Although expert opinion varied as to whether the clothes damage could have been caused by a dingo some took the view that it could have been. Further, marks on nappy fragments were similar to marks resulting from a dingo on another nappy that was used for testing purposes. Azaria's clothing was found only 30 metres (98 feet) from a dingo's den, although no-one, including the chief ranger and his deputy, was aware of the den at the time. =Claims of human interference with clothes= Some evidence indicates human intervention between the time of discovery of Azaria's clothes and the time that the police photographed it. Camper Wallace Goodwin, who was the first to discover the jumpsuit, singlet and nappy, gave evidence that the whole of the jumpsuit was undone, that the clothes were lying on the ground naturally not artificially, and that he believed the singlet was beside the jumpsuit not inside it. However, police Constable Frank Morris, the first police officer to examine the clothes after Goodwin located them, gave evidence that only the top four buttons were undone and the singlet was inside it. He stated that he picked up the clothes to check the inside for human remains and then returned it to the ground and photographed it. The singlet that had been placed back in the jumpsuit was inside out. Mrs Chamberlain gave evidence that she always ensured that singlets were not inside out. =Post- conviction= Shortly after her conviction, Chamberlain was escorted from Berrimah Prison under guard to give birth to her fourth child, Kahlia, on 17 November 1982, in Darwin Hospital, and was returned thereafter to prison. An appeal to the Federal Court against conviction was subsequently dismissed. Another appeal against her conviction was rejected by the High Court in February 1984. =Release on new evidence= Richard Morecroft introducing an ABC news report on the day of Lindy Chamberlain's release. New evidence emerged on 2 February 1986 when Azaria's matinee jacket, which the police had maintained did not exist, was found partially buried adjacent to a dingo lair in an isolated location near Uluru. Five days later, on 7 February 1986, with the discovery of Azaria's missing jacket supporting the Chamberlains' defence case, Lindy Chamberlain was released from prison, and her life sentence was remitted by the Northern Territory Government. In 1987, a Royal Commission began investigating the matter further. =Morling Royal Commission= The purpose of the royal commission was to enquire into and report on the correctness of the Chamberlain convictions. In reaching the conclusion that there was a reasonable doubt as to the Chamberlains' guilt, Commissioner Trevor Morling concluded that the hypothesis that Chamberlain murdered Azaria had not been proven beyond reasonable doubt. Although the commission was of the opinion that the evidence afforded considerable support for the dingo hypothesis, it did not examine the evidence to see whether it had been proved that a dingo took the baby. To do so would, in the words of Commissioner Morling, involve a \\"fundamental error of reversing the onus of proof and requiring Mrs Chamberlain to prove her innocence\\" (at p. 339 of the report).Royal Commission of Inquiry into Chamberlain Convictions, Report, Commonwealth Parliamentary Papers (1987), volume 15, paper 192. Acquittal In acquitting the Chamberlains in 1988, the Supreme Court found that the alleged \\"baby blood\\" found in the Chamberlains' car, upon which the prosecution so heavily relied, could have been any substance, but was likely that of a sound deadening compound from a manufacturing overspray (which contained no blood). This finding underscored inconsistencies in the earlier blood testing, which, along with the later-recovered matinee jacket from a dingo lair area, had given rise to the Morling Royal Commission's doubts about the propriety of her conviction. The court also noted that as DNA testing was not advanced in the early 1980s, the expert testimony given by the prosecution at trial and relied on by the jurors was reasonable evidence at the time, even though it was ultimately found to be faulty. =Third inquest= After the Chamberlains were acquitted by the Supreme Court in September 1988 and their convictions overturned, a third inquest in 1995 took place, with the coroner's report stating that it was a \\"paper inquest\\" rather than a full inquest since there was little new evidence and the second inquest was never fully completed. The coroner considered the Morling Royal Commission's report enquiring into the correctness of the convictions against Lindy Chamberlain along with submissions made on behalf of the Chamberlains, and returned an open verdict in Azaria's cause of death, or, insufficient evidence by the prosecution that failed to meet the required standard of proof for conviction. Specifically, he wrote \\"After examining all the evidence I am unable to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Azaria Chamberlain died at the hands of Alice Lynne Chamberlain. It automatically follows that I am also unable to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Michael Leigh Chamberlain had any involvement in the death.\\" He also wrote that because the evidence for the death-by-dingo hypothesis was never developed \\"I am unable to be reasonably satisfied that Azaria Chamberlain died accidentally as a result of being taken by a dingo.\\" He noted that \\"Indeed, the evidence affords considerable support for the view that a dingo may have taken her. To examine the evidence to see whether it has been proved that a dingo took Azaria would be to make the fundamental error of reversing the onus of proof and requiring Mrs Chamberlain to prove her innocence.\\" =2012 inquest= Lindy Chamberlain- Creighton and Michael Chamberlain continued to push for a resolution to the investigation into the death of Azaria as being caused by one or more dingoes without human interference.Murdoch, Lindsay, Not over: Chamberlain seeks justice from hearts of stone, Sydney Morning Herald, 2010-10-11.

Coroner Elizabeth Morris said that the new evidence in relation to dingo attacks on infants and young children had helped convince her to reopen the investigation. After 32 years of intense media interest and public excoriation, the Chamberlains stated they remained unsatisfied with bare acquittal and presumed innocence, and were keen to finally, and definitively, determine how their daughter died.Rule, Andrew, New inquest must declare innocence, Herald Sun, 20 December 2011. On 12 June 2012, an Australian coroner made a final ruling that a dingo dog took baby Azaria Chamberlain from a campsite in 1980 and caused her death. Coroner Elizabeth Morris apologised to the Chamberlain family while an amended death certificate was immediately made available to them.

Film and other adaptations In the 1983 Australian television movie about the case, Who Killed Baby Azaria?, Chamberlain was played by Elaine Hudson; the movie aired on Network Ten. In the 1988 film Evil Angels (released as A Cry in the Dark outside Australia and New Zealand) the role was played by Meryl Streep, whose performance received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress in 1989. Miranda Otto played Chamberlain in the 2004 Australian television mini-series Through My Eyes: The Lindy Chamberlain Story, which aired on the Seven Network. Australian composer Moya Henderson wrote the opera Lindy to a libretto by Judith Rodriguez. In 1990, the Rank Strangers' recording of their song \\"Uluru\\", which supported the Chamberlains and called for compensation to be paid to them, finished in the final five of the Australian Country Music Awards in Tamworth, New South Wales.

The following characterizations (definitions) are most common. This article discusses why each characterization makes sense, and why the characterizations are independent of and equivalent to each other. As a special case of these considerations, it will be demonstrated that the three most common definitions given for the mathematical constant e are equivalent to each other.  Characterizations  The six most common definitions of the exponential function for real are: : 1. Define by the limit ::: e^x = \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\left(1+\\\\frac x n \\\\right)^n. : 2. Define as the value of the infinite series ::: e^x = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty {x^n \\\\over n!} = 1 + x + \\\\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\\\frac{x^3}{3!} + \\\\frac{x^4}{4!} + \\\\cdots :: (Here denotes the factorial of . One proof that is irrational uses this representation.) : 3. Define to be the unique number such that ::: \\\\int_1^y \\\\frac{dt}{t} = x. :: This is as the inverse of the natural logarithm function, which is defined by this integral. : 4. Define to be the unique solution to the initial value problem ::: y' = y,\\\\quad y(0) = 1. :: (Here, denotes the derivative of .) : 5. The exponential function is the unique Lebesgue-measurable function with that satisfies ::: f(x + y) = f(x) f(y) \\\\text{ for all } x \\\\text{ and } y :: (Hewitt and Stromberg, 1965, exercise 18.46). :: Alternatively, it is the unique anywhere- continuous function with these properties (Rudin, 1976, chapter 8, exercise 6). The term \\"anywhere-continuous\\" means that there exists at least a single point at which is continuous. As shown below, if for all and , and is continuous at any single point , then is necessarily continuous everywhere. :: (As a counterexample, if one does not assume continuity or measurability, it is possible to prove the existence of an everywhere-discontinuous, non- measurable function with this property by using a Hamel basis for the real numbers over the rationals, as described in Hewitt and Stromberg.) :: Because is guaranteed for rational by the above properties (see below), one could also use monotonicity or other properties to enforce the choice of for irrational , but such alternatives appear to be uncommon. :: One could also replace the conditions that and that be Lebesgue-measurable or anywhere-continuous with the single condition that . : 6. Let be the unique real number satisfying ::: \\\\lim_{h \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{e^h - 1}{h} = 1. :: This limit can be shown to exist. This definition is particularly suited to computing the derivative of the exponential function. Then define to be the exponential function with this base.  Larger domains  One way of defining the exponential function for domains larger than the domain of real numbers is to first define it for the domain of real numbers using one of the above characterizations and then extend it to larger domains in a way which would work for any analytic function. It is also possible to use the characterisations directly for the larger domain, though some problems may arise. (1), (2), and (4) all make sense for arbitrary Banach algebras. (3) presents a problem for complex numbers, because there are non-equivalent paths along which one could integrate, and (5) is not sufficient. For example, the function f defined (for x and y real) as : f(x + iy) = e^x(\\\\cos(2y) + i\\\\sin(2y)) = e^{x + 2iy} satisfies the conditions in (5) without being the exponential function of x + iy. To make (5) sufficient for the domain of complex numbers, one may either stipulate that there exists a point at which f is a conformal map or else stipulate that : f(i) = \\\\cos(1) + i\\\\sin(1). In particular, the alternate condition in (5) that f'(0)=1 is sufficient since it implicitly stipulates that f be conformal.  Proof that each characterization makes sense  Some of these definitions require justification to demonstrate that they are well- defined. For example, when the value of the function is defined as the result of a limiting process (i.e. an infinite sequence or series), it must be demonstrated that such a limit always exists. = Characterization 2 = Since : \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\left\\\\frac{x^{n+1}/(n+1)!}{x^n/n!}\\\\right = \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\left\\\\frac{x}{n+1}\\\\right = 0 < 1. it follows from the ratio test that \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{x^n}{n!} converges for all x. = Characterization 3 = Since the integrand is an integrable function of t, the integral expression is well-defined. It must be shown that the function from \\\\mathbb{R}^+ to \\\\mathbb{R} defined by : \\\\int_1^{(\\\\cdot)} \\\\frac{dt}{t} is a bijection. As t^{-1} is positive for positive t, this function is monotone increasing, hence one-to-one. If the two integrals : \\\\begin{align} \\\\int_1^\\\\infty \\\\frac{dt} t & = \\\\infty \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] \\\\int_1^0 \\\\frac{dt} t & = -\\\\infty \\\\end{align} hold, then it is clearly onto as well. Indeed, these integrals do hold; they follow from the integral test and the divergence of the harmonic series.  Equivalence of the characterizations  The following proof demonstrates the equivalence of the first three characterizations given for e above. The proof consists of two parts. First, the equivalence of characterizations 1 and 2 is established, and then the equivalence of characterizations 1 and 3 is established. Arguments linking the other characterizations are also given. =Equivalence of characterizations 1 and 2= The following argument is adapted from a proof in Rudin, theorem 3.31, p. 63‚Äì65. Let x\\\\geq0 be a fixed non-negative real number. Define :s_n = \\\\sum_{k=0}^n\\\\frac{x^k}{k!},\\\\ t_n=\\\\left(1+\\\\frac x n \\\\right)^n. By the binomial theorem, : \\\\begin{align} t_n & =\\\\sum_{k=0}^n{n \\\\choose k}\\\\frac{x^k}{n^k}=1+x+\\\\sum_{k=2}^n\\\\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)\\\\cdots(n-(k-1))x^k}{k!\\\\,n^k} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] & = 1+x+\\\\frac{x^2}{2!}\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\right)+\\\\frac{x^3}{3!}\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\right)\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{2}{n}\\\\right)+\\\\cdots \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] & {}\\\\qquad \\\\cdots +\\\\frac{x^n}{n!}\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\right)\\\\cdots\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{n-1}{n}\\\\right)\\\\le s_n \\\\end{align} (using x ‚â• 0 to obtain the final inequality) so that :\\\\limsup_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}t_n \\\\le \\\\limsup_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}s_n = e^x where ex is in the sense of definition 2\\\\. Here, limsups must be used, because it is not known if tn converges. For the other direction, by the above expression of tn, if 2 ‚â§ m ‚â§ n, :1+x+\\\\frac{x^2}{2!}\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\right)+\\\\cdots+\\\\frac{x^m}{m!}\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\right)\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{2}{n}\\\\right)\\\\cdots\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{m-1}{n}\\\\right)\\\\le t_n. Fix m, and let n approach infinity. Then :s_m = 1+x+\\\\frac{x^2}{2!}+\\\\cdots+\\\\frac{x^m}{m!} \\\\le \\\\liminf_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}t_n (again, liminf's must be used because it is not known if tn converges). Now, taking the above inequality, letting m approach infinity, and putting it together with the other inequality, this becomes :\\\\limsup_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}t_n \\\\le e^x \\\\le \\\\liminf_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}t_n so that :\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}t_n = e^x. This equivalence can be extended to the negative real numbers by noting \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac r n \\\\right)^n \\\\left(1+\\\\frac{r}{n}\\\\right)^n = \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{r^2}{n^2}\\\\right)^n and taking the limit as n goes to infinity. The error term of this limit-expression is described by :\\\\left(1+\\\\frac x n \\\\right)^n=e^x \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{x^2}{2n}+\\\\frac{x^3(8+3x)}{24n^2}+\\\\cdots \\\\right), where the polynomial's degree (in x) in the term with denominator nk is 2k. =Equivalence of characterizations 1 and 3= Here, the natural logarithm function is defined in terms of a definite integral as above. By the first part of fundamental theorem of calculus, : \\\\frac d {dx}\\\\ln x=\\\\frac{d}{dx} \\\\int_1^x \\\\frac1 t \\\\,dt = \\\\frac 1 x. Besides, \\\\ln 1 = \\\\int_1^1 \\\\frac{1}{t}\\\\,dt = 0 Now, let x be any fixed real number, and let : y=\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\left(1+\\\\frac{x}{n}\\\\right)^n. Ln(y) = x, which implies that y = ex, where ex is in the sense of definition 3. We have : \\\\ln y=\\\\ln\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\left(1+\\\\frac{x}{n} \\\\right)^n = \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\ln\\\\left(1+\\\\frac{x}{n}\\\\right)^n. Here, the continuity of ln(y) is used, which follows from the continuity of 1/t: : \\\\ln y=\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}n\\\\ln \\\\left(1+\\\\frac{x}{n} \\\\right) = \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\frac{x\\\\ln\\\\left(1+(x/n)\\\\right)}{(x/n)}. Here, the result lnan = nlna has been used. This result can be established for n a natural number by induction, or using integration by substitution. (The extension to real powers must wait until ln and exp have been established as inverses of each other, so that ab can be defined for real b as eb lna.) : =x\\\\cdot\\\\lim_{h\\\\to 0}\\\\frac{\\\\ln\\\\left(1+h\\\\right)}{h} \\\\quad \\\\text{ where } h = \\\\frac{x}{n} : =x\\\\cdot\\\\lim_{h\\\\to 0}\\\\frac{\\\\ln\\\\left(1+h\\\\right)-\\\\ln 1}{h} : =x\\\\cdot\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\ln t \\\\Bigg_{t=1} : \\\\\\\\!\\\\, = x. =Equivalence of characterizations 3 and 4= Characterisation 3 involves defining the natural logarithm before the exponential function is defined. First, : \\\\log x:=\\\\int_{1}^{x}\\\\frac{1}{t}dt This means that the natural logarithm of x equals the (signed) area under the graph of 1/t between t=1 and t=x. If x<1, then this area is taken to be negative. Then, \\\\exp is defined as the inverse of \\\\log, meaning that : \\\\exp(\\\\log(x))=x \\\\text{ and } \\\\log(\\\\exp(x))=x by the definition of an inverse function. If a is a positive real number then a^x is defined as \\\\exp(x\\\\log(a)). Finally, e is defined as the number a such that \\\\log(a)=1. It can then be shown that e^x=\\\\exp(x): : e^x=\\\\exp(x\\\\log(e))=\\\\exp(x) By the fundamental theorem of calculus, the derivative of \\\\log x = \\\\frac{1}{x}. We are now in a position to prove that \\\\frac{d(e^x)}{dx}=e^x, satisfying the first part of the initial value problem given in characterisation 4: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\text{Let }y&=e^x=\\\\exp(x) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\log(y)&=\\\\log(\\\\exp(x))=x \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{y}\\\\frac{dy}{dx}&=1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{dy}{dx}&=y=e^x \\\\end{align} Then, we merely have to note that e^0=\\\\exp(0)=1, and we are done. Of course, it is much easier to show that characterisation 4 implies characterisation 3. If e^x is the unique function f:\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R} satisfying f'(x)=e^x, and f(0)=1, then \\\\log can be defined as its inverse. The derivative of \\\\log can be found in the following way: : y = \\\\log x \\\\implies x=e^y If we differentiate both sides with respect to y, we get : \\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{dx}{dy} &= e^y \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{dy}{dx} &= \\\\frac{1}{e^y} = \\\\frac{1}{x} \\\\end{align} Therefore, : \\\\int_{1}^{x}\\\\frac{1}{t}dt=\\\\left[\\\\log t\\\\right]_{1}^{x} = \\\\log x - \\\\log 1 = \\\\log x - 0 = \\\\log x =Equivalence of characterizations 2 and 4= Let n be a non- negative integer. In the sense of definition 4 and by induction, \\\\frac{d^ny}{dx^n}=y. Therefore \\\\frac{d^ny}{dx^n}\\\\Bigg_{x=0}=y(0)=1. Using Taylor series, y= \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac {f^{(n)}(0)}{n!} \\\\, x^n = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac {1}{n!} \\\\, x^n = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac {x^n}{n!}. This shows that definition 4 implies definition 2. In the sense of definition 2, : \\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{d}{dx}e^x & = \\\\frac{d}{dx} \\\\left(1+\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac {x^n}{n!} \\\\right) = \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac {nx^{n-1}}{n!} =\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac {x^{n-1}}{(n-1)!} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & =\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac {x^k}{k!}, \\\\text{ where } k=n-1 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & =e^x \\\\end{align} Besides, e^0=1+0+\\\\frac{0^2}{2!}+\\\\frac{0^3}{3!}+\\\\cdots=1. This shows that definition 2 implies definition 4\\\\. =Equivalence of characterizations 1 and 5= The following proof is a simplified version of the one in Hewitt and Stromberg, exercise 18.46. First, one proves that measurability (or here, Lebesgue- integrability) implies continuity for a non-zero function f(x) satisfying f(x+y)=f(x)f(y), and then one proves that continuity implies f(x) = e^{kx} for some k, and finally f(1)=e implies k=1. First, a few elementary properties from f(x) satisfying f(x+y)=f(x)f(y) are proven, and the assumption that f(x) is not identically zero: * If f(x) is nonzero anywhere (say at x=y), then it is non-zero everywhere. Proof: f(y) = f(x) f(y - x) eq 0 implies f(x) eq 0. * f(0)=1. Proof: f(x)= f(x+0) = f(x) f(0) and f(x) is non-zero. * f(-x)=1/f(x). Proof: 1 = f(0)= f(x-x) = f(x) f(-x). * If f(x) is continuous anywhere (say at x = y), then it is continuous everywhere. Proof: f(x+\\\\delta)-f(x) = f(x-y) [ f(y+\\\\delta) - f(y)] \\\\rightarrow 0 as \\\\delta\\\\rightarrow 0 by continuity at y. The second and third properties mean that it is sufficient to prove f(x)=e^x for positive x. If f(x) is a Lebesgue- integrable function, then :g(x) = \\\\int_0^x f(x')\\\\, dx'. It then follows that :g(x+y)-g(x) = \\\\int_x^{x+y} f(x')\\\\, dx' = \\\\int_0^y f(x+x')\\\\, dx' = f(x) g(y). Since f(x) is nonzero, some y can be chosen such that g(y) eq 0 and solve for f(x) in the above expression. Therefore: : \\\\begin{align} f(x+\\\\delta)-f(x) & = \\\\frac{[g(x+\\\\delta+y)-g(x+\\\\delta)]-[g(x+y)-g(x)]}{g(y)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & =\\\\frac{[g(x+y+\\\\delta)-g(x+y)]-[g(x+\\\\delta)-g(x)]}{g(y)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & =\\\\frac{f(x+y)g(\\\\delta)-f(x)g(\\\\delta)}{g(y)}=g(\\\\delta)\\\\frac{f(x+y)-f(x)}{g(y)}. \\\\end{align} The final expression must go to zero as \\\\delta\\\\rightarrow 0 since g(0)=0 and g(x) is continuous. It follows that f(x) is continuous. Now, f(q) = e^{kq} can be proven, for some k, for all positive rational numbers q. Let q=n/m for positive integers n and m. Then :f\\\\left(\\\\frac{n}{m}\\\\right)=f\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{m}+\\\\cdots+\\\\frac{1}{m} \\\\right)=f\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\right)^n by elementary induction on n. Therefore, f(1/m)^m = f(1) and thus :f\\\\left(\\\\frac{n}{m}\\\\right)=f(1)^{n/m}=e^{k(n/m)}. for k = \\\\ln [f(1)]. If restricted to real-valued f(x), then f(x) = f(x/2)^2 is everywhere positive and so k is real. Finally, by continuity, since f(x) = e^{kx} for all rational x, it must be true for all real x since the closure of the rationals is the reals (that is, any real x can be written as the limit of a sequence of rationals). If f(1) = e then k = 1. This is equivalent to characterization 1 (or 2, or 3), depending on which equivalent definition of e one uses. =Characterization 2 implies characterization 6= In the sense of definition 2, ::\\\\lim_{h\\\\to 0} \\\\frac{e^h-1}{h} :=\\\\lim_{h\\\\to 0} \\\\frac{1}{h} \\\\left (\\\\left (1+h+ \\\\frac{h^2}{2!}+\\\\frac{h^3}{3!}+\\\\frac{h^4}{4!}+\\\\cdots \\\\right) -1 \\\\right) :=\\\\lim_{h\\\\to 0} \\\\left(1+ \\\\frac{h}{2!}+\\\\frac{h^2}{3!}+\\\\frac{h^3}{4!}+\\\\cdots \\\\right) :=1 =Characterization 5 implies characterization 4= ::The conditions and imply both conditions in characterization 4.

Early life Gregory was born in Crawfordsville, Mississippi. He graduated from the Webb School (Bell Buckle, Tennessee) in 1881, Southwestern Presbyterian University in 1883, and he was a special student at the University of Virginia. Gregory entered the University of Texas at Austin in 1884 and graduated a year later with a degree in law. He began the practice of law in Austin, in 1885. He served as a regent of the University of Texas for eight years. Gregory Gymnasium was named in honor of his efforts to provide an adequate exercise facility for the students and faculty of the University. He declined appointment as assistant attorney general of Texas in 1892 and an appointment to the state bench in 1896 but \\"gained experience as a trust prosecutor as a special counsel for the state of Texas.\\" While embracing the progressive rhetoric of the early 20th century with his condemnations of \\"plutocratic power,\\" \\"predatory wealth,\\" and \\"the greed of the party spoilsmen,\\" Gregory participated in Edward M. House's Democratic coalition. Gregory was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention at St. Louis and at state delegate at-large at the Baltimore convention.

Gregory Golfing in 1920 In 1914, President Woodrow Wilson appointed him Attorney General of the United States, and he held that office until 1919. Despite a continuing commitment to progressive reform, Gregory's performance as attorney general provoked enormous controversy because of his collaboration with Postmaster General Albert S. Burleson and others in orchestrating a campaign to crush domestic dissent during World War I. Gregory helped frame the Espionage and Sedition Acts, which compromised the constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and press, and he lobbied for their passage. He encouraged extralegal surveillance by the American Protective League and directed the federal prosecutions of more than 2,000 opponents of the war: \\"By 1918 the Attorney General was able to declare, 'It is safe to say that never in its history has this country been so thoroughly policed.'\\" Thomas Watt Gregory (front) in 1920 In 1916, Wilson wanted to appoint Gregory to the US Supreme Court, but the attorney general declined the offer because of his impaired hearing, his eagerness to participate in Wilson's re-election campaign, and his belief that he lacked the necessary temperament to be a judge. Gregory was a member of Wilson's Second Industrial Conference in 1919 and 1920. During a trip to New York to confer with Franklin Roosevelt, Gregory contracted pneumonia and died. He is buried in Austin. His portrait was painted in 1917 by the Swiss-born American artist Adolfo M√ºller-Ury (1862‚Äì1947); it hangs in the Department of Justice in Washington, DC.

The company was originally formed as \\"227 Plus One\\" in the late 1980s by Ed Hart and is based in Louisville, Kentucky. Themeparks' first park was Kentucky Kingdom, which it bought in 1988 and sold to Premier Parks (now Six Flags) in 1997. Themeparks subsequently operated Magic Springs Theme Park in Hot Springs, Arkansas from 2000 to 2008 before selling it to PARC Management. Themeparks LLC repurchased Kentucky Kingdom in 2013 and has been operating the theme park since May 2014. History =The first decade (1989‚Äì2008)= In early April 1989, businessman Ed Hart bought the then-bankrupt Kentucky Kingdom amusement park's operating rights in a contract with the Kentucky State Fair Board. Hart then turned the park around and reopened it for the 1989 season. During this time, Hart founded Themeparks LLC specifically for the project. On September 26, 1997, Themeparks LLC announced that Kentucky Kingdom would be sold to Premier Parks for $64 million, the deal was finalized on November 7. In 1998, Premier Parks purchased Six Flags Theme Parks from Time Warner, Kentucky Kingdom became Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom on June 21, 1998. In the late 1990s, Hart was approached by Fitraco, a Belgian company, to reopen Magic Springs amusement park in Arkansas. Hart then reassembled and restarted Themeparks LLC, only one year after it dissolved after the sale of Kentucky Kingdom to Premier Parks (now Six Flags). Hart and Themeparks LLC then reopened the park on May 27, 2000, after five years being closed. During Themeparks LLC's operations at Magic Springs, attendance grew to new highs, after the additions of Crystal Falls Water Park and the Timberwood Amphitheater. In October 2002, the company made a bid for VisionLand, a theme park in Bessemer, Alabama, but the price was too high. Themeparks LLC sold Magic Springs and Crystal Falls to PARC Management in June 2008. Themeparks LLC then dissolved for a second time afterwards. =Return to Kentucky Kingdom (2010‚Äìpresent)= In 2010, Themeparks LLC temporarily renamed itself to KK Redevelopment LLC to buy back Kentucky Kingdom from the state of Kentucky. In late 2011, The Kentucky State Fair Board ended their plans with KK Redevelopment LLC to reopen Kentucky Kingdom, after they failed to reach a lease agreement by a September 30 deadline. On October 19, 2012, KK Redevelopment LLC submitted a new proposal to reopen the park, the proposal included $50 million in startup funding and $70 million over the term of a lease with the state. On January 24, 2013, The Fair Board approved the proposal from KK Redevelopment LLC and Ed Hart to reopen Kentucky Kingdom. The park (along with Hurricane Bay) was set to reopen on May 24, 2014 with new thrill rides and a bigger water park. Kentucky Kingdom and Hurricane Bay is now open with Themeparks LLC as the new operators. They spent over 50 million dollars to bring back Kentucky Kingdom and during the first year of operation. Theme Park LLC added a $7 million roller coaster named Lightning Run and doubled the size of the water park. Though Themeparks LLC does operate Kentucky Kingdom, the company is commonly referred to as Kentucky Kingdom LLLP when relating to Kentucky Kingdom. =Proposed Amusement Parks= After selling Kentucky Kingdom to Premier Parks in 1997, Hart began planning to build a brand new amusement park near Seattle, Washington, which was to be called \\"The Great Northwest Theme Park\\". The park was to be 100 acres and be located in the town of Lakewood. It was planned to open in the Spring of 2002. However, the project was scrapped for unknown reasons. In the early 2000s, Hart and Themeparks LLC began developing a new theme and water park, which was to be called Thrillopolis, and to be located in Nashville, Tennessee. Nashville's only amusement park, Opryland USA, had previously closed permanently several years prior in 1997 and was replaced by a shopping mall in 2000. The closest amusement park to Nashville at this time was Dollywood in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. On June 17, 2002, Hart announced that Thrillopolis would not be built in Nashville, due to funding issues with the local government. In late 2002, Themeparks LLC did try to find property for Thrillopolis in Wilson County, Tennessee, even signing an exclusivity agreement with Wilson County on October 15, 2002. However, by the mid-2000s, plans to open Thrillopolis had been canceled.

History The Sears retail chain marketed vehicles made by the Lincoln Motor Car Works under the name \\"Sears Motor Buggy\\" between 1908 and 1912. These horseless carriages were of the \\"high-wheeler\\" variety with large wagon-type wheels. Their high ground clearance was well-suited to muddy, wagon-rutted country roads. Customers were accustomed to mail-ordering through the Sears catalog, and the Sears Motor Buggy could be delivered to the nearest railroad siding. Development The Allstate was the brainchild of Henry J. Kaiser, who saw Sears as another means to mass-market his slow-selling \\"Henry J\\" two-door sedan, introduced in 1950. The Allstate was essentially a Henry J, but with a number of differences that included Allstate badges on the hood and rear deck, a more upscale interior of Saran plaid or occasionally leather or smooth vinyl, special hubcaps/wheel covers, horn buttons and instrument bezels, a locking glove box and trunk lid, special engine color (blue), custom armrests and sunvisors, revised door locks and keys, and special parking and taillamp assemblies. Most notably, the Allstate featured a unique two-bar grille and jet-plane hood ornament designed by Alex Tremulis, who had come to Kaiser-Frazer from the Tucker Corporation. Allstate automobiles were planned to be built on the senior Kaiser platforms, but following three years of negotiations between Kaiser-Frazer and Sears, the production Allstate was announced on November 20, 1951, by Sears merchandising vice president Theodore V. Houser and Kaiser-Frazer administrative vice-president Eugene Trefethen. The three-year delay was due in part to tension from existing Kaiser-Frazer dealerships fearing competition with Sears. Production The Allstate was built by Kaiser-Frazer in Willow Run, Michigan, (and after 1953 by Kaiser- Willys in Toledo, Ohio) and was based on Kaiser's compact Henry J. One body style was offered, a fastback two-door sedan in two lines, the Series 4 and the Series 6. For 1952, the Series 4 came in the Model 111 Standard (the best seller at US1,486) and Model 113 DeLuxe ($1,539) trim versions, and was also available in an austere Model 110 Basic version for $1,395. The Series 6 Basic was priced at $1,594 and the well-trimmed, swift Model 115 DeLuxe was offered at $1,693. (The Standard was never offered in the Series 6.) The cars had a wheelbase. The marketing slogan was \\"Your one brand new car for '52! Allstate!\\" Virtually no appearance changes were made for 1953 but Allstate cars weighed as much as more than their 1952 counterparts. All the Allstate Basic models were dropped and Allstate prices jumped substantially; the entry- level Series 4 Standard Model 210 sold for $1,528 and the DeLuxe Model 213 for $1,589. The Series 6 was now only offered in the upscale DeLuxe Model 215 version at $1,785, and was the most popular Allstate that year. The standard Allstate interior material was made from tightly-twisted strands of paper that were woven together and then coated in plastic, which proved to be unusually durable as well as attractive and eliminated the need for seat covers. Seat covers were popular in the 1950s, and many were made of this same type of material. Unlike early Henry Js, which were built without trunk lids to reduce costs, Allstates offered opening trunk lids. Series 4 cars used an L-head four-cylinder engine, and the Series 6 was powered by a L-head six , both powerplants built by Willys. A three-speed manual transmission was standard, with overdrive available for $104 extra. One mechanical difference between Allstate and Henry J was that Allstates were equipped with Allstate-brand tires, tubes, spark plugs and batteries, all with their own Sears \\"Triple Guarantee\\" warranties. Initially, the Allstate was offered only in the south and southwest United States, with plans to expand distribution as demand for the product grew. Sears locations selling Allstates included Baytown, Texas; Beaumont, Texas; Birmingham, Alabama; Dallas, Texas; Fayetteville, North Carolina; Houston, Texas; Jackson, Mississippi; Knoxville, Tennessee; Little Rock, Arkansas; Lubbock, Texas; Memphis, Tennessee; Norfolk, Virginia; Orlando, Florida; Phoenix, Arizona; Portsmouth, Virginia; Richmond, Virginia; Salt Lake City, Utah; and Waco, Texas. While some Sears outlets tried to stock at least one sample of the car, most were built on demand by Kaiser-Frazer, which made delivery to the store where they were sold. Kaiser-Frazer urged its dealers to service Allstate cars when asked. Many Kaiser-Frazer dealers were displeased to see \\"their cars\\" sold by another outlet, especially since the Allstate carried more standard equipment, yet sold at a lower price than the Henry J. Sears marketed the car as \\"the lowest-priced full-sized sedan on the U.S. market.\\" However, Sears did not accept trade-ins from Allstate buyers, and there may have been reluctance to buy a car through a department store where service was thought to be questionable. (The lack of a trade-in program proved to be a serious impediment to the sale of Graham-Bradley tractors from Graham-Paige Motors Corp. by Sears in the late 1930s.) Only 2,363 Allstates were sold in two model years before the marque was discontinued; 1,566 during 1952 and 797 in 1953. Kaiser soon discontinued the Henry J as well.

In Western esotericism the Left-Hand Path and Right-Hand Path are the dichotomy between two opposing approaches to magic. This terminology is used in various groups involved in the occult and ceremonial magic. In some definitions, the Left-Hand Path is equated with malicious black magic or black shamanism, while the Right-Hand Path with benevolent white magic. Other occultists have criticised this definition, believing that the Left‚ÄìRight dichotomy refers merely to different kinds of working and does not necessarily connote good or bad magical actions. In more recent definitions, which base themselves on the terms' origins in Indian Tantra, the Right-Hand Path, or RHP, is seen as a definition for those magical groups that follow specific ethical codes and adopt social convention, while the Left-Hand Path adopts the opposite attitude, espousing the breaking of taboo and the abandoning of set morality. Some contemporary occultists, such as Peter J. Carroll, have stressed that both paths can be followed by a magical practitioner, as essentially they have the same goals. Another distinguishing characteristic separating the two is based upon the aim of the practitioner. Right-handed path practitioners tend to work towards ascending their soul towards ultimate union (or reunion) with the divine source, returning to heaven, allegorically alluded to as restoration or climbing back up the ladder after the \\"great fall\\". In Solomon's lesser key, they embrace the light and try to annihilate anything they regard as \\"dark\\" or \\"evil\\". On the other hand, left-handed path practitioners do not see this as the ultimate aim but a step towards their goal. Left-handed path practitioners embrace the dark as well as the light in order to invoke the alchemical formula solve et coagula (\\"dissolve and precipitate\\"), confronting the negative in order to transmute it into desirable qualities. Left-handed path practitioners descend towards union with the divine to obtain Godhood status, with God-like powers of their own, having reunited with the ultimate divine source-energy; then once there, taking one more step separating from that divinity, out of this creation into a new creation of their own making, with themselves as the sole divinity of the new universe, apart from the previous creation. This is represented by the eleventh qliphoth on the Tree of Knowledge, whereas the right-handed path Tree of Life only has ten sephiroth.  Terminology  = Right-Hand Path = The Right-Hand Path is commonly thought to refer to magical or religious groups which adhere to a certain set of characteristics: * They divide the concepts of mind, body and spirit into three separate, albeit interrelated, entities.Hine, Phil, quoted in Evans, Dave (2007). The History of British Magick after Crowley. Hidden Publishing. p. 204. * They adhere to a specific moral code and a belief in some form of judgement, such as karma or the Threefold Law. The occultist Dion Fortune considered Abrahamic religions to be RHP. = Left-Hand Path = The historian Dave Evans studied self-professed followers of the Left-Hand Path in the early 21st century, making several observations about their practices: *They often reject societal convention and the status quo, which some suggest is in a search for spiritual freedom. As a part of this, LHP followers embrace magical techniques that would traditionally be viewed as taboo, for instance using sex magic or embracing Satanic imagery. As Mogg Morgan wrote, the \\"breaking of taboos makes magic more potent and can lead to reintegration and liberation, [for example] the eating of meat in a vegetarian community can have the same liberating effect as anal intercourse in a sexually inhibited straight society.\\"Shual. Sexual Magic. p. 31. * They often question religious or moral dogma, instead adhering to forms of personal anarchism. * They often embrace sexuality and incorporate it into magical ritual. = Criticism = Criticism of both terms has come from various occultists. The Magister of the Cultus Sabbati, Andrew D. Chumbley, stated that they were simply \\"theoretical constructs\\" that were \\"without definitive objectivity\\", and that nonetheless, both forms could be employed by the magician. He used the analogy of a person having two hands, a right and a left, both of which served the same master.Chumbley, Andrew, quoted in Evans, Dave (2007). The History of British Magick after Crowley. Hidden Publishing. pp. 212-213. Similar sentiments were expressed by the Wiccan High Priest John Belham-Payne, who stated that \\"For me, magic is magic.\\"Chumbley, Andrew, quoted in Evans, Dave (2007). The History of British Magick after Crowley. Hidden Publishing. p. 214.  History of the terms  = Vamachara = VƒÅmƒÅcƒÅra is a Sanskrit term meaning \\"left-handed attainment\\" and is synonymous with Left-Hand Path or Left-path (Sanskrit: VƒÅmamƒÅrga).Bhattacharya, N. N. History of the Tantric Religion pp. 81, 447. (1999) Tantra, Vamamarga (The Left Handed Path: Kaula sadhana) It is used to describe a particular mode of worship or spiritual practice (Sanskrit: sadhana) that is not only heterodox (Sanskrit: NƒÅstika) to standard Vedic injunction, but extreme in comparison to prevailing cultural norms. These practices are often generally considered to be Tantric in orientation. The converse term to VƒÅmƒÅcƒÅra is Dakshinachara (glossed \\"Right-Hand Path\\") which is used to refer not only to orthodox (ƒÄstika) sects but to modes of spirituality that engage in spiritual practices that not only accord with Vedic injunction but are generally agreeable to prevailing cultural norms. That said, left-handed and right-handed modes of practice may be evident in both orthodox and heterodox schools of Dharmic religions such as Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism and Buddhism and are a matter of taste, culture, proclivity, initiation, sadhana and dharmic lineage (parampara). = Tantra and Madame Blavatsky = The Western use of the terms Left-Hand Path and Right Hand-Path originated with Madame Blavatsky, a 19th-century occultist who founded the Theosophical Society. She had travelled across parts of southern Asia and claimed to have met with many mystics and magical practitioners in India and Tibet. She developed the term Left-Hand Path as a translation of the term Vamachara, an Indian Tantric practice that emphasised the breaking of Hindu societal taboos by having sexual intercourse in ritual, drinking alcohol, eating meat and assembling in graveyards, as a part of the spiritual practice. The term Vamachara literally meant \\"the left-hand way\\" in Sanskrit, and it was from this that Blavatsky first coined the term. Returning to Europe, Blavatsky began using the term. It was relatively easy for her to associate left with evil in many European countries, where it already had an association with many negative things; as the historian Dave Evans noted, homosexuals were referred to as \\"left-handed\\", and while in Protestant nations Roman Catholics were called \\"left-footers\\". = Adoption into the western esoteric tradition = In New York, Madame Blavatsky founded the Theosophical Society with several other people in 1875. She set about writing several books, including Isis Unveiled (1877) in which she introduced the terms Left-Hand Path and Right-Hand Path, firmly stating that she herself followed the RHP, and that followers of the LHP were practitioners of Black Magic who were a threat to society. The occult community soon picked up on her newly introduced duality, which, according to historian Dave Evans, \\"had not been known before\\" in the Western Esoteric Tradition. For instance, Dion Fortune, the founder of an esoteric magical group (the Society of the Inner Light) also took the side of the RHP, making the claim that \\"black magicians\\", or followers of the LHP, were homosexuals and that Indian servants might use malicious magical rites devoted to the goddess Kali against their European masters. Aleister Crowley further altered and popularized the term in certain occult circles, referring to a \\"Brother of the Left-Hand Path\\", or a \\"Black Brother\\", as one who failed to attain the grade of Magister Templi in Crowley's system of ceremonial magic.Magick Without Tears Crowley also referred to the Left-Hand Path when describing the point at which the Adeptus Exemptus (such as his old Christian mentor, Macgregor Mathers) chooses to cross the Abyss, which is the location of Choronzon and the illusory eleventh Sephira, which is Da'ath or Knowledge. In this example, the adept must surrender all, including the guidance of his Holy Guardian Angel, and leap into the Abyss. If his accumulated Karma is sufficient, and if he has been utterly thorough in his own self-destruction, he becomes a \\"babe of the abyss\\", arising as a Star in the Crowleyan system. On the other hand, if he retains some fragment of ego, or if he fears to cross, he then becomes encysted. The layers of his self, which he could have shed in the Abyss, ossify around him. He is then titled a \\"Brother of the Left-Hand Path\\", who will eventually be broken up and disintegrated against his will, since he failed to choose voluntary disintegration. Crowley associated all this with \\"Mary, a blasphemy against BABALON\\", and with the celibacy of Christian clergy. Another of those figures that Fortune considered to be a follower of the LHP was Arthur Edward Waite, who did not recognise these terms, and acknowledged that they were newly introduced and that in any case he believed the terms LHP and RHP to be distinct from black and white magic. However, despite Waite's attempts to distinguish the two, the equation of the LHP with Black Magic was propagated more widely in the fiction of Dennis Wheatley; Wheatley also conflated the two with Satanism and also the political ideology of communism, which he viewed as a threat to traditional British society. In one of his novels, Strange Conflict (1941), he stated that: > {  :The Order of the Left-Hand Path... has its adepts... the Way of > Darkness is perpetuated in the horrible Voodoo cult which had its origins in > Madagascar and has held Africa, the Dark Continent, in its grip for > centuries.Wheatley, Dennis (1941). Strange Conflict.  } =Later 20th and 21st centuries= In the latter half of the 20th century various groups arose that self-professedly described themselves as LHP, but did not consider themselves as following Black Magic. In 1975, Kenneth Grant, a student of Aleister Crowley, explained in Cults of the Shadow that he and his group, the Typhonian Order, practiced the LHP. Grant's usage takes meaning from its roots in eastern Tantra; Grant states that it is about challenging taboos, but that it should be used in conjunction with the RHP to achieve balance. When Anton Szandor LaVey was developing his form of LaVeyan Satanism during the 1960s, he emphasised the rejection of traditional Christian morality and as such labelled his new philosophy to be a form of the Left-Hand Path. In his The Satanic Bible, he wrote that \\"Satanism is not a white light religion; it is a religion of the flesh, the mundane, the carnal‚Äîall of which are ruled by Satan, the personification of the Left-Hand Path.\\"LaVey, Anton Szandor.

Flowers Ph.D. pg.4  Usage in Tantra  Tantra is a set of esoteric Indian traditions with roots in Hinduism and Buddhism. Tantra is often divided by its practitioners into two different paths: dakshinachara and vamachara, translated as Right-Hand Path and Left-Hand Path respectively. Dakshinachara consists of traditional Hindu practices such as asceticism and meditation, while vamachara also includes ritual practices that conflict with mainstream Hinduism, such as sexual rituals, consumption of alcohol and other intoxicants. The two paths are viewed by Tantrists as equally valid approaches to enlightenment. Vamachara, however, is often considered to be the fasterp. 265 Shakti: Realm of the Divine Mother, Vanamali, Inner Traditions.

Buswell, Ed., Macmillan USA, New York, NY, 2004. . and more dangerous of the two paths, and is not suitable for all practitioners. The usage of the terms Left-Hand Path and Right-Hand Path is still current in modern Indian and Buddhist Tantra. =Left-Hand Path relation to Tantra in Buddhism= Robert Be√©r's Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs clarifies widespread taboos and deprecation that associate the left hand as dark, female, inferior and 'not right': > \\"In Buddhist tantra, the right hand symbolises the male aspect of compassion > or skilful means, and the left hand represents the female aspect of wisdom > or emptiness. Ritual hand-held attributes, such as the vajra and bell, vajra > and lotus, damaru and bell, damaru and khatvanga, arrow and bow, curved > knife and skull-cup, sword and shield, hook and rope snare, etc., placed in > the right and left hands respectively, symbolise the union of the active > male aspect of skilful means with the contemplative female aspect of wisdom. > In both Hinduism and Buddhism the goddess is always placed on the left side > of the male deity, where she 'sits on his left thigh, while her lord places > his left arm over her left shoulder and dallies with her left breast'. > In representations of the Buddha image, the right hand often makes an active > mudra of skilful means‚Äîthe earth-touching, protection, fearlessness, wish- > granting or teaching mudra; while the left hand often remains in the passive > mudra of meditative equipoise, resting in the lap and symbolising meditation > on emptiness or wisdom.\\"Be√©r, Robert; The encyclopedia of Tibetan symbols > and motifs, Serindia Publications, Inc., 2004 Be√©r's preceding explanations correspond to Yab-Yum (father-mother) symbolism and contemplation on or practice of sexual rituals associated with Vajrayogini and Anuttarayoga Tantra. Yab-yum is generally understood to represent the primordial (or mystical) union of wisdom and compassion. The metaphorical union of bliss and emptiness is commonly represented within Thangka paintings of the Cakrasa·πÉvara Tantra depicting the sexual union of the deity Sa·πÉvara and his consort Dorje Pakmo.

He is the leader and a founding member of DAM, the first Palestinian hip hop group. Born in Lod, Israel.  Early life  Nafar was born to Fawzi Nafar and Nadia Awadi. He grew up in poverty in Lod, a mixed Arab-Israeli city in Israel, which was a major hub for drug smuggling and crime. Tamer discovered hip-hop at age 17, when he began learning English by listening to Tupac and translating his lyrics to Arabic using an English-Arabic dictionary.  Career  Tamer recorded his first single \\"Untouchable\\", a reference to The Untouchables movie. In 1998, Tamer released his first EP Stop Selling Drugs, featuring his younger brother Suhell. = DAM = In 2000, their friend Mahmood Jreri joined the Nafar brothers to establish DAM, the first Palestinian hip-hop group. The trio named themselves Da Arab MCs to create the acronyms DAM, a word that means lasting or persisting in Arabic and blood in Hebrew (◊ì◊ù). In an interview for Democracy Now (2008), Tamer said that the group‚Äôs name suggested ‚Äúeternal blood, like we will stay here forever,‚Äù evoking a politics of resilience and survival (or ÿØÿßŸÖ - sumood, in Arabic). The group members are the grandchildren of those who experienced the Nakba and the children of those who mobilized the Arab minority in Israel in the 1970s and 1980s. This generation is challenging the insults to Palestinian identity and advocates Palestinian self-determination while objecting to racism and inequality. DAM is notable for their ability to rap in English, Arabic and Hebrew. The group first rapped in English and then in Hebrew as the words flowed better this way. DAM understood that their potential for meaningful social impact depends on their ability to express their message in Arabic, Hebrew and English, drawing upon vernacular phrases, slang, obscenities and indigenous references to each cultural frame. In this way, DAM is able to reach disparate audiences. On September 3, 2000, Tamer's friend Booba (Hussam Abu Gazazae) was killed during a drive-by shooting, an incident that drove Tamer to record his first protest song with a political reference, despite the fact that his friend had been killed by an Arab. A cover of Abd al Majeed Abdalla's song \\"Ya Tayeb al Galb\\", the song was called \\"Booba\\" and featured Ibrahim Sakallah on the hook. In the outbreak of the Second Intifada in October 2000, Tamer and Mahmood decided to write their first direct political song \\"Posheem Hapim me Peshaa\\" (Innocent Criminals). It was recorded over an instrumental of \\"Hail Mary\\" by Tupac and featured inciting lines such as \\"when Jews protest, the cops use clubs / when Arabs protest, the cops take their souls\\" and \\"if it is a democracy how come I'm not mentioned in your anthem\\" followed by the chorus \\"before you judge me, before you understand me, walk in my shoes, and you will hurt your feet, because we are criminals, innocent criminals.\\" The song created controversy in the Israeli media and put DAM in conflict with some of their fellow Israeli rappers such as Subliminal. Much of the subsequent fall- out was recorded in the documentary Channels of Rage. Despite the controversy, the song was later remixed by Israeli rock musician Aviv Geffen and American- Israeli director Udi Aloni made a music video for the song in 2003. = 2003: Channels of Rage = In 2003 Israeli film director Anat Halachmi released the documentary Channels of Rage, which won the Wolgin Award for best documentary at the 2003 Jerusalem Film Festival. The film follows Tamer Nafar and DAM on one side and the right-wing Zionist rapper Kobi Shimoni (Subliminal and the Shadow) on the other. Meeting in a dark alley in Tel Aviv, the groups nearly come to blows over recent comments made by Tamer and Shimoni. Once collaborative and cherishing, the relationship quickly dissolved as each began to embody a political ideology following the collapse of the 2000 Camp David Summit and the beginning of the Second Intifada. Coming to terms with the violence on the streets of Tel Aviv and Jenin, both artists retreated from their once close relationship, based on a mutual love of hip-hop, into nationalism. = 2004: The Born Here campaign = Tamer uses music and art as a tool for activism. In 2004, DAM was invited by the Shateel organization to produce songs discussing discrimination and poverty in mixed Arab-Israeli cities, commenting on Israeli demolition of Palestinian houses and the dangerous entrance into Lod, which required residents to cross eight train tracks to reach the city. DAM collaborated with a local R&B; singer and created the song \\"Born Here\\" as a reference to a popular Israeli song by the duo Dats and Datsa whose chorus' lyrics begin \\"I was born here, my children were born here, and this is where I built my house with my two hands\\". DAM changed this to \\"I was born here, my grandparents were born here, and this is where you destroyed our houses with your hands\\". Due to the campaign's success, the Israeli government built a bridge above the train tracks for safer crossing and allowed DAM to tour Israel discussing their cause. = 2006: Debut album Ihda = After touring the world and releasing number one singles on Arab charts, DAM became the first Palestinian hip hop group to release an album with a major label after signing with EMI Arabia. The album, Ihda, was released in 2006. DAM also signed with the French booking agency 3D Family to tour music festivals around the world promoting the album, visiting the Sundance film festival, Womad, Doha DIFF (Doha International film festival), Dubai Film Festival, Trinity International Hip Hop Festival USA, Vine Rock, Taybeh Beer Festival Palestine, and Casa Festival Morocco, where they shared the stage with internationally known artists including GZA of the Wutang Clan, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Dead Prez, Chuck D of Public Enemy, Pharaoh Monch, Rachid Taha, Ahmad al Khoury, Immortal Technique, and others. The album included 15 tracks, including some number one hits. Though mainly about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the album was also notable for being the first Arab rap album to discuss women's rights. The album's song \\"Hurriyet Unta\\" (freedom for my sisters), features Safa' Hathoot, the first female Palestinian rapper, criticizes the oppression of women along with the oppression of the Palestinians. = 2008: Slingshot Hip-Hop = In 2008 Slingshot Hip Hop ‚Äì a film about Palestinian Hip Hop by Jackie Salloum was released. Slingshot Hip- Hop is a performative type of documentary that stresses subjective experience and emotional response to the world. It talks about personal stories that might be considered unconventional, although perhaps poetic and experimental. Slingshot Hip Hop braids together the stories of young Palestinians living in Gaza, the West Bank and inside Israel as they discover hip hop and employ it as a tool to surmount divisions imposed by occupation and poverty. Following the debut in the Sundance film festival, the film got a lot of attention and won many prizes, and featured guest appearances by international artists such as Chuck D from Public Enemy and Afrika Bambaataa. = 2012: Second album: Dabke on the Moon = In 2012, DAM released their second official album, Dabke on the Moon. The main producer was Tamer and Suhell‚Äôs cousin, Nabil Nafar, a Danish-Palestinian producer who came to Lod and worked with them on six tracks. In the track \\"A letter from the cell\\", DAM worked with the classical oud players Trio Joubran and Lebanese percussionist Bachar Khalife (the son of legendary composer and oud player Marcel Khalife). The result is a melancholic, non-traditional hip-hop song heavily influenced by classical Arabic composition and instruments. = 2013: Room No. 4 = In 2013, Tamer Nafar directed the photography campaign Room No. 4 illustrated the reality faced by the children when arrested and detained and is based on the children‚Äôs testimonies in the report. Room No. 4 is an interrogation room in the Russian Compound‚Äìthe main Israeli police office in Jerusalem‚Äìwhere Palestinian residents of Jerusalem, including children, are interrogated. to protest child arrests in east Jerusalem. The campaign = 2014: \\"#Who_U_R\\" = In 2014, Tamer Nafar and DAM released the music video \\"#Who_U_R\\". The video was directed by Oscar-nominated Palestinian filmmaker Scandar Copti. \\"#Who_U_R\\" was written in response to the rape of a 16-year-old Texan teenager Jada, whose assault was recorded, shared, and mocked on social media in 2014. Tamer stated about the video that, ‚ÄúWomen's struggle is beyond the Middle East. It‚Äôs an international struggle.‚Äù He discusses how the concept was to ‚Äútake the social part of my individual progress and to take my social issues to the international stage.‚Äù The song generated a Twitter campaign throughout the Middle East. The hashtag #Who_You_R encouraged men to send in photos of themselves doing housework as a way to break gender norms and support women. = 2016: Junction 48 = Tamer starred in the feature film Junction 48 directed by Udi Aloni and written by Nafar and Oren Moverman. Nafar‚Äôs youth and early years as a rapper formed the basis for the semi-autobiographical movie. The film won the Audience Award at the Berlin International Film Festival, Best International Film at the Tribeca Film Festival and 2 awards at the Slovakia Art Film Festival for Best Film and Best Male Actor (Tamer). As an actor and a writer, Tamer‚Äôs work has appeared in numerous stage plays in Israel/Palestine and Europe. He has performed alongside veteran Palestinian directors Norman Issa and Nizar Zoabi in Anton Chekhov‚Äôs plays and was recently featured in Aunti Adipos - A Memorial for Shulamit by Udi Aloni at the National Theatre of Mannheim alongside Israeli actor Itay Tiran and Slovenian philosopher Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek.  Controversial statements  Nafar performed at a joint conference between the University of North Carolina and Duke University known as Conflict Over Gaza: People, Politics, and Possibilities. During Nafar's performance he said ‚ÄúI know it might sound [like] R&B; stuff, but don‚Äôt think of Rihanna when you sing it, don‚Äôt think of Beyonc√©. Think of Mel Gibson. Go that anti-Semitic. Let‚Äôs try it together because I need your help. I cannot be anti-Semitic alone.‚Äù Gibson is an actor and filmmaker who has said \\"the Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world.\\" UNC's Interim Chancellor, Kevin Guskiewicz, condemned the \\"disturbing\\" language in Nafar's performance, while members of the audience said that Nafar's comment was a sarcastic remark meant to mock the idea that people fighting for Palestinian liberation must be anti-Semitic.

It also refers specifically to the server program which is part of the project. Icecast was created in December 1998/January 1999 by Jack Moffitt and Barath Raghavan to provide an open-source audio streaming server that anyone could modify, use, and tinker with. Version 2, a ground-up rewrite aimed at multi-format support (initially targeting Ogg Vorbis) and scalability, was started in 2001 and released in January 2004. History Icecast was originally developed by Moffitt in 1998 for SMU's radio station. At the time, the station was constantly losing its FCC license and was at the time only able to reach listeners in the same building. Given that all of the dorms throughout campus had Ethernet connectivity, using streaming audio to broadcast was a natural solution, but currently available audio streaming software, such as RealAudio, was too expensive. Moffitt created Icecast, allowing the station to easily reach everwhere on campus without the necessity of FCC licensing or a transmitter upgrade. Initially developed to support mp3's, Vorbis support was added shortly after. Technical details The Icecast server is capable of streaming audio content as Opus or Vorbis over standard HTTP, video as WebM or Theora over HTTP, and MP3, AAC, and NSV over the SHOUTcast protocol. Theora, AAC, and NSV are only supported in version 2.2.0 and newer. Icecast requires external programs, called \\"source clients\\", to originate the streams, and the Icecast project includes a source client program known as IceS. The source runs typically in the place where the audio is generated (e.g., a studio) and the Icecast server where a high-bandwidth connection is available (e.g., a colocation centre). Since version 2.4.0 source clients can use plain HTTP standard PUT requests instead of the custom SOURCE method.

The film traces the relationship between Tamer and Subliminal, as the events of the Second Intifada unfold, and lets the viewer draw conclusions from the souring relations between the two as an individual representation of the polarization process which took place during these years of bloody conflict.

The factory employed 70 workers and new Alpena Flyers began shipping to customers in 1911. Prices ranged from $1,450 to $1,600. Later models would include small variations and different engine choices. The Alpena Motor Car Co. produced a light and inexpensive car. In 1911 the Alpena Flyer was known as ‚ÄúThe Greatest, Biggest and Most Sensational Actual Values In The Automobile World For $1450.00.\\" The Alpena Flyer was an assembled car produced as a standard Touring Car for 4 or 5 passengers, a four door 5 passenger Touring Car and a Roadster. Prices for the 1911 Alpena Flyer standard Touring Car was $1450.00, four door 5 passenger Touring $1600.00 and the Roadster was 1450.00. The Alpena Flyer was designed for speed using unit engine/gearbox construction with three-point suspension. Specifications of the 1911 Alpena Flyer included a four cylinder engine made by Northway or Rutenber. It had almost 40 horsepower, disc clutch, water cooled, a Splitdorf magneto, Schebler carburetor, sliding gear transmission with three speeds and reverse, 112 inch wheel base, 34 inch wheels and 24 inch x 3 1/2 inch tires, Torque tube drive, weight 2250 pounds and a color of only Dark Royal Blue.

Everest Disaster is a 1997 bestselling non-fiction book written by Jon Krakauer. It details Krakauer's experience in the 1996 Mount Everest disaster, in which eight climbers were killed and several others were stranded by a storm. Krakauer's expedition was led by guide Rob Hall. Other groups were trying to summit on the same day, including one led by Scott Fischer, whose guiding agency, Mountain Madness, was perceived as a competitor to Hall's agency, Adventure Consultants. Summary Krakauer describes the events leading up to his eventual decision to participate in an Everest expedition in May 1996, despite having mostly given up mountain climbing years before. The 1996 expedition season recorded eight deaths, including that of Krakauer's guide Rob Hall. This was the third- highest recorded number of deaths on the mountain in a single day; the April 2015 Nepal earthquake caused the most at 21. Krakauer, a journalist for the adventure magazine Outside, said initially his intention to climb Everest was purely professional. The original magazine story was to have Krakauer climb only to base camp, and report on the commercialization of the mountain. However, the idea of Everest reawakened his childhood desire to climb the mountain. Krakauer asked his editor to put off the story for a year so that he could train for a climb to the summit. From there, the book moves between events that take place on the mountain, and the unfolding tragedy, which takes place during the push to the summit. In the book, Krakauer alleges that essential safety methods adopted over the years by experienced guides on Everest are sometimes compromised by the competition between rival guiding agencies, in order to get their clients to the summit. Controversy Krakauer's recounting of certain aspects of the climb has generated criticism, both from some of the climb's participants and from renowned mountaineers such as Galen Rowell. Much of the disputed material centers on Krakauer's accounting of the actions of Russian climber and guide Anatoli Boukreev. An experienced high-altitude climber and guide for Scott Fischer, Boukreev descended the summit prior to his clients, ostensibly out of concern for their safety and in preparation for potential rescue efforts. Boukreev later mounted repeated solo rescue efforts, saving several lives. In his book, Krakauer acknowledged Boukreev's heroism in saving two climbers' lives, but questions his judgment, his decision to descend before clients, not using supplementary oxygen, his choices of gear on the mountain, and his interaction with clients. Boukreev provides a rebuttal to these allegations in his 1997 book The Climb. Galen Rowell criticized Krakauer's account, citing numerous inconsistencies in his narrative while observing that Krakauer was sleeping in his tent while Boukreev was rescuing other climbers. Rowell argued that Boukreev's actions were nothing short of heroic, and his judgment prescient: \\"[Boukreev] foresaw problems with clients nearing camp, noted five other guides on the peak [Everest], and positioned himself to be rested and hydrated enough to respond to an emergency. His heroism was not a fluke.\\" The account has also been criticized for not informing the reader that the team members were receiving accurate daily weather forecasts and knew about the storm in advance. In Krakauer's 1999 paperback edition of Into Thin Air, he addresses some of the criticism in a lengthy postscript. Adaptation Film rights for Into Thin Air were purchased by Sony almost immediately after the book's publication. The book was adapted into the TV movie Into Thin Air: Death on Everest (1997), starring Peter Horton as Scott Fischer and Christopher McDonald as Jon Krakauer. The book and the film both contain the same strong editorial viewpoint regarding the fundamental causes of the tragedy, although the film differs sharply from the book in details regarding responsibility. The 2015 film Everest, by director Baltasar Korm√°kur, depicts the same events as the book, with actor Michael Kelly portraying Krakauer. According to Korm√°kur, it is not based on Krakauer's book.

It was one of Joplin's early works, and became the model for ragtime compositions by subsequent composers. It is one of the most famous of all ragtime pieces. As a result, Joplin became dubbed the \\"King of Ragtime\\" by his contemporaries. The piece gave Joplin a steady if unspectacular income for the rest of his life. Despite ragtime's decline after Joplin's death in 1917, the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" continued to be recorded by many well-known artists. The ragtime revival of the 1970s brought it back to mainstream public notice once again.  Background  The \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" is associated with the city of Sedalia, Missouri, although there is no record of Joplin having a permanent residence there before 1904. Joplin arrived in Sedalia in 1894 as a touring musician and stayed with the family of Arthur Marshall, who later became one of Joplin's students and a ragtime composer in his own right. Joplin played as a solo musician at dances and at the major black clubs in Sedalia, among them the \\"Maple Leaf Club\\". It is possible that the rag was named after the Maple Leaf Club, although there is no direct evidence to prove the link, and there were probably many other possible sources for the name in and around Sedalia at the time. Although there were hundreds of rags in print by the time of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag's\\" publication, Joplin was not far behind. His first published rag was \\"Original Rags\\" (March 1899). The \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" was already known in Sedalia prior to its publication in 1899; composer and pianist Brun Campbell claimed to have seen the manuscript of the work in or around 1898. Prior to its publication, Joplin anticipated that the piece would be a success‚Äîhe told Arthur Marshall that \\"The Maple Leaf will make me the king of ragtime composers\\". Front cover of the third edition of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" sheet music The exact circumstances which led to publication of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" are unknown, and there are versions of the event which contradict each other. After approaching several publishers, Joplin signed a contract with John Stillwell Stark on August 10, 1899 for a $0.01 royalty on all sales of the rag, with a minimum sales price of $0.25. The \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" was published between August 10 and September 20, 1899, when the United States Copyright Office received two copies of the score. The rag was reissued in 1900 or 1901 with a new cover showing a green maple leaf and a photograph of Joplin. In 1903, Stark issued a \\"Maple Leaf Rag Song\\", an arrangement of Joplin's music with words by Sydney Brown.  Structure  :AA BB A CC DD \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" is a multi-strain ragtime march with athletic bass lines and offbeat melodies. Each of the four parts features a recurring theme and a striding bass line with copious seventh chords. The piece may be considered the \\"archetypal rag\\" due to its influence on the genre; its structure was the basis for many other rags, including \\"Sensation\\" by Joseph Lamb. It is more carefully constructed than almost all the previous rags, and the syncopations, especially in the transition between the first and second strain, were novel at the time. Generally, the piece is considered difficult; one must have very good coordination in the left hand to perform the piece successfully, particularly for the trio, which involves leaps of two octaves. When it was first published, it was considered significantly more difficult than the average Tin Pan Alley and early ragtime sheet music common at the time. \\"Gladiolus Rag\\", a later composition by Joplin, is a developed variant of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" showcasing Joplin's increasing musical sophistication, and is usually played at a somewhat slower tempo. In addition, the first strain of Joplin's \\"The Cascades\\", \\"Leola\\", and \\"Sugar Cane\\" are modeled on the structure used in the composition. The composition starts in the key of A-flat major and changes to D-flat major during the first part of the trio, then modulates back to A-flat major. Lyrics In 1903 Stark issued a \\"Maple Leaf Rag Song\\", an arrangement of Joplin's music with words by Sydney Brown. Brown's lyrics tell the story of a poor man from Accomack County, Virginia, who stumbles into a ballroom where, in spite of his anxiety over the state of his appearance he manages to wow the crowd with the Maple Leaf Rag. While the men are jealous of his dancing abilities and draw their razors, the women love him, and the \\"finest belle\\" sends for a carriage and the two of them ride away.http://www.perfessorbill.com/lyrics/lymaple.htm Modern ragtime composer Ron O'Dell has commented that the song has characteristics in common with rap, such as the lyrical themes, the lyrics being written in the African American Vernacular English of the time, and the fact that the lyrics are sung over the least melodic strain of the music.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HgTVPUUBRI  Popularity and legacy  There have been many claims about the sales of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\", for example that 1 million copies of the sheet music were sold in the composer's lifetime, making Scott Joplin the first musician to sell 1 million copies of a piece of instrumental music. Joplin's first biographer Rudi Blesh wrote that during its first six months the piece sold 75,000 copies, and became \\"the first great instrumental sheet music hit in America\\". However, research by Joplin's later biographer Edward A. Berlin demonstrated that this was not the case; the initial print-run of 400 took one year to sell, and under the terms of Joplin's contract with a $0.01 royalty would have given Joplin an income of $4, or approximately $ in current value. Later sales were steady and would have given Joplin an income which would have covered his expenses; in 1909 estimated sales would have given him an income of $600 annually (approximately $ in current prices). In addition to sales of sheet music, it was also popular in orchestrations for dance bands and brass bands for years. Joplin failed to repeat the success of Maple Leaf Rag, with none of his other famous rags (such as \\"The Entertainer\\") garnering as much popularity as the Maple Leaf Rag did. The royalties earned by the sheet music sales did provide Joplin with a steady income for the rest of his life, however. Soon after the publication of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\", the earliest recordings of the rag took place; band leader Wilbur Sweatman recorded it onto Phonograph cylinder a year later, but there are no known copies which have survived. The first surviving record of the rag comes from the second known recording of the rag by the United States Military Band from 1906. While Joplin never made an audio recording, his playing is preserved on seven piano rolls for use in mechanical player pianos. All seven were made in 1916. Berlin theorizes that by the time Joplin made these recordings he may have been experiencing discoordination of the fingers, tremors and an inability to speak clearly, symptoms of syphilis, the disease that took his life in 1917.Berlin (1996) pp. 237 & 239. The recording of \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\", on the Aeolian Uni- Record label from June 1916 was described by biographer Blesh as \\"shocking ... disorganized and completely distressing to hear\\". Berlin notes that the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" roll was \\"painfully bad\\" and likely to be the truest record of Joplin's playing at the time. The roll, however, does not reflect his abilities earlier in life. The song was a selection in the White Star Line songbook in the early 1900s, and could have possibly been played aboard the RMS Titanic during its ill-fated maiden voyage in 1912. The tune continued to be in the repertoire of jazz bands decades later, with artists such as the New Orleans Rhythm Kings in the 1920s, and Sidney Bechet in the 1930s giving it up-to-date adaptations, maintaining a timeless quality to it. As an indication of its persistent popularity and recognition, it was performed on phonograph records six times in each of the three decades after its first publication. In 1930, it was featured in the gangster movie classic, The Public Enemy. \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" was the Joplin piece found most often on 78 rpm records. In November 1970, Joshua Rifkin released a recording called Scott Joplin: Piano Rags on the classical label Nonesuch, which featured as its first track the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\". It sold 100,000 copies in its first year and eventually became Nonesuch's first million-selling record. The Billboard \\"Best-Selling Classical LPs\\" chart for September 28, 1974 has the record at number 5, with the follow- up \\"Volume 2\\" at number 4, and a combined set of both volumes at number 3. Separately both volumes had been on the chart for 64 weeks. The album was nominated in 1971 for two Grammy Award categories: Best Album Notes and Best Instrumental Soloist Performance (without orchestra), but at the ceremony on March 14, 1972, Rifkin did not win in any category. In 1979 Alan Rich in the New York Magazine wrote that by giving artists like Rifkin the opportunity to put Joplin's music on disk Nonesuch Records \\"created, almost alone, the Scott Joplin revival.\\" The \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" is still a favorite of ragtime pianists, and has been described as an \\"American institution... still in print and still popular\\". As the copyright has expired, the composition is in the public domain. It appears in the soundtracks of hundreds of films, cartoons, commercials, and video games. In 2004 Canadian radio listeners voted it the 39th greatest song of all time. In Joplin's will, he requested that \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" be played at his funeral. When preparations were being made, however, his wife did not allow it because she did not think it was a proper funeral song. She later admitted regretting that decision her whole life.

Process calculi provide a tool for the high-level description of interactions, communications, and synchronizations between a collection of independent agents or processes. They also provide algebraic laws that allow process descriptions to be manipulated and analyzed, and permit formal reasoning about equivalences between processes (e.g., using bisimulation). Leading examples of process calculi include CSP, CCS, ACP, and LOTOS. More recent additions to the family include the œÄ-calculus, the ambient calculus, PEPA, the fusion calculus and the join-calculus.  Essential features  While the variety of existing process calculi is very large (including variants that incorporate stochastic behaviour, timing information, and specializations for studying molecular interactions), there are several features that all process calculi have in common: * Representing interactions between independent processes as communication (message-passing), rather than as modification of shared variables. * Describing processes and systems using a small collection of primitives, and operators for combining those primitives. * Defining algebraic laws for the process operators, which allow process expressions to be manipulated using equational reasoning.  Mathematics of processes  To define a process calculus, one starts with a set of names (or channels) whose purpose is to provide means of communication. In many implementations, channels have rich internal structure to improve efficiency, but this is abstracted away in most theoretic models. In addition to names, one needs a means to form new processes from old ones. The basic operators, always present in some form or other, allow: * parallel composition of processes * specification of which channels to use for sending and receiving data * sequentialization of interactions * hiding of interaction points * recursion or process replication = Parallel composition = Parallel composition of two processes \\\\mathit{P} and \\\\mathit{Q}, usually written P \\\\vert Q, is the key primitive distinguishing the process calculi from sequential models of computation. Parallel composition allows computation in \\\\mathit{P} and \\\\mathit{Q} to proceed simultaneously and independently. But it also allows interaction, that is synchronisation and flow of information from \\\\mathit{P} to \\\\mathit{Q} (or vice versa) on a channel shared by both. Crucially, an agent or process can be connected to more than one channel at a time. Channels may be synchronous or asynchronous. In the case of a synchronous channel, the agent sending a message waits until another agent has received the message. Asynchronous channels do not require any such synchronization. In some process calculi (notably the œÄ-calculus) channels themselves can be sent in messages through (other) channels, allowing the topology of process interconnections to change. Some process calculi also allow channels to be created during the execution of a computation. = Communication = Interaction can be (but isn't always) a directed flow of information. That is, input and output can be distinguished as dual interaction primitives. Process calculi that make such distinctions typically define an input operator (e.g. x(v)) and an output operator (e.g. x\\\\langle y\\\\rangle), both of which name an interaction point (here \\\\mathit{x}) that is used to synchronise with a dual interaction primitive. Should information be exchanged, it will flow from the outputting to the inputting process. The output primitive will specify the data to be sent. In x\\\\langle y\\\\rangle, this data is y. Similarly, if an input expects to receive data, one or more bound variables will act as place-holders to be substituted by data, when it arrives. In x(v), v plays that role. The choice of the kind of data that can be exchanged in an interaction is one of the key features that distinguishes different process calculi. = Sequential composition = Sometimes interactions must be temporally ordered. For example, it might be desirable to specify algorithms such as: first receive some data on \\\\mathit{x} and then send that data on \\\\mathit{y}. Sequential composition can be used for such purposes. It is well known from other models of computation. In process calculi, the sequentialisation operator is usually integrated with input or output, or both. For example, the process x(v)\\\\cdot P will wait for an input on \\\\mathit{x}. Only when this input has occurred will the process \\\\mathit{P} be activated, with the received data through \\\\mathit{x} substituted for identifier \\\\mathit{v}. = Reduction semantics = The key operational reduction rule, containing the computational essence of process calculi, can be given solely in terms of parallel composition, sequentialization, input, and output. The details of this reduction vary among the calculi, but the essence remains roughly the same. The reduction rule is: : x\\\\langle y\\\\rangle \\\\cdot P \\\\; \\\\vert \\\\; x(v)\\\\cdot Q \\\\longrightarrow P \\\\; \\\\vert \\\\; Q[^y\\\\\\\\!/\\\\\\\\!_v] The interpretation to this reduction rule is: # The process x\\\\langle y\\\\rangle \\\\cdot P sends a message, here \\\\mathit{y}, along the channel \\\\mathit{x}. Dually, the process x(v)\\\\cdot Q receives that message on channel \\\\mathit{x}. # Once the message has been sent, x\\\\langle y\\\\rangle \\\\cdot P becomes the process \\\\mathit{P}, while x(v)\\\\cdot Q becomes the process Q[^y\\\\\\\\!/\\\\\\\\!_v], which is \\\\mathit{Q} with the place-holder \\\\mathit{v} substituted by \\\\mathit{y}, the data received on \\\\mathit{x}. The class of processes that \\\\mathit{P} is allowed to range over as the continuation of the output operation substantially influences the properties of the calculus. = Hiding = Processes do not limit the number of connections that can be made at a given interaction point. But interaction points allow interference (i.e. interaction). For the synthesis of compact, minimal and compositional systems, the ability to restrict interference is crucial. Hiding operations allow control of the connections made between interaction points when composing agents in parallel. Hiding can be denoted in a variety of ways. For example, in the œÄ-calculus the hiding of a name \\\\mathit{x} in \\\\mathit{P} can be expressed as ( u\\\\; x)P, while in CSP it might be written as P \\\\setminus \\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\}. = Recursion and replication = The operations presented so far describe only finite interaction and are consequently insufficient for full computability, which includes non-terminating behaviour. Recursion and replication are operations that allow finite descriptions of infinite behaviour. Recursion is well known from the sequential world. Replication !P can be understood as abbreviating the parallel composition of a countably infinite number of \\\\mathit{P} processes: : !P = P \\\\mid !P = Null process = Process calculi generally also include a null process (variously denoted as \\\\mathit{nil}, 0, \\\\mathit{STOP}, \\\\delta, or some other appropriate symbol) which has no interaction points. It is utterly inactive and its sole purpose is to act as the inductive anchor on top of which more interesting processes can be generated. Discrete and continuous process algebra Process algebra has been studied for discrete time and continuous time (real time or dense time).  History  In the first half of the 20th century, various formalisms were proposed to capture the informal concept of a computable function, with Œº-recursive functions, Turing machines and the lambda calculus possibly being the best-known examples today. The surprising fact that they are essentially equivalent, in the sense that they are all encodable into each other, supports the Church-Turing thesis. Another shared feature is more rarely commented on: they all are most readily understood as models of sequential computation. The subsequent consolidation of computer science required a more subtle formulation of the notion of computation, in particular explicit representations of concurrency and communication. Models of concurrency such as the process calculi, Petri nets in 1962, and the actor model in 1973 emerged from this line of inquiry. Research on process calculi began in earnest with Robin Milner's seminal work on the Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS) during the period from 1973 to 1980. C.A.R. Hoare's Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) first appeared in 1978, and was subsequently developed into a full-fledged process calculus during the early 1980s. There was much cross-fertilization of ideas between CCS and CSP as they developed. In 1982 Jan Bergstra and Jan Willem Klop began work on what came to be known as the Algebra of Communicating Processes (ACP), and introduced the term process algebra to describe their work. CCS, CSP, and ACP constitute the three major branches of the process calculi family: the majority of the other process calculi can trace their roots to one of these three calculi.  Current research  Various process calculi have been studied and not all of them fit the paradigm sketched here. The most prominent example may be the ambient calculus. This is to be expected as process calculi are an active field of study. Currently research on process calculi focuses on the following problems. * Developing new process calculi for better modeling of computational phenomena. * Finding well-behaved subcalculi of a given process calculus. This is valuable because (1) most calculi are fairly wild in the sense that they are rather general and not much can be said about arbitrary processes; and (2) computational applications rarely exhaust the whole of a calculus. Rather they use only processes that are very constrained in form. Constraining the shape of processes is mostly studied by way of type systems. * Logics for processes that allow one to reason about (essentially) arbitrary properties of processes, following the ideas of Hoare logic. * Behavioural theory: what does it mean for two processes to be the same? How can we decide whether two processes are different or not? Can we find representatives for equivalence classes of processes? Generally, processes are considered to be the same if no context, that is other processes running in parallel, can detect a difference. Unfortunately, making this intuition precise is subtle and mostly yields unwieldy characterisations of equality (which in most cases must also be undecidable, as a consequence of the halting problem). Bisimulations are a technical tool that aids reasoning about process equivalences. * Expressivity of calculi. Programming experience shows that certain problems are easier to solve in some languages than in others. This phenomenon calls for a more precise characterisation of the expressivity of calculi modeling computation than that afforded by the Church-Turing thesis. One way of doing this is to consider encodings between two formalisms and see what properties encodings can potentially preserve. The more properties can be preserved, the more expressive the target of the encoding is said to be. For process calculi, the celebrated results are that the synchronous œÄ-calculus is more expressive than its asynchronous variant, has the same expressive power as the higher-order œÄ-calculus, but is less than the ambient calculus. * Using process calculus to model biological systems (stochastic œÄ-calculus, BioAmbients, Beta Binders, BioPEPA, Brane calculus). It is thought by some that the compositionality offered by process-theoretic tools can help biologists to organise their knowledge more formally.  Software implementations  The ideas behind process algebra have given rise to several tools including: * CADP * Concurrency Workbench * mCRL2 toolset  Relationship to other models of concurrency  The history monoid is the free object that is generically able to represent the histories of individual communicating processes. A process calculus is then a formal language imposed on a history monoid in a consistent fashion. That is, a history monoid can only record a sequence of events, with synchronization, but does not specify the allowed state transitions. Thus, a process calculus is to a history monoid what a formal language is to a free monoid (a formal language is a subset of the set of all possible finite-length strings of an alphabet generated by the Kleene star). The use of channels for communication is one of the features distinguishing the process calculi from other models of concurrency, such as Petri nets and the actor model (see Actor model and process calculi). One of the fundamental motivations for including channels in the process calculi was to enable certain algebraic techniques, thereby making it easier to reason about processes algebraically.

After Malina's death in 2015, her responsibilities were taken over by the anarchist company. The Living Theatre and its founders were the subject of the 1983 documentary Signals Through the Flames.  History  In the 1950s, the group was among the first in the U.S. to produce the work of influential European playwrights such as Bertolt Brecht (In The Jungle of Cities in New York, 1960) and Jean Cocteau, as well as modernist poets such as T. S. Eliot and Gertrude Stein. One of their first major productions was Pablo Picasso's Desire Caught By the Tail; other early productions were Many Loves by William Carlos Williams and Luigi Pirandello's Tonight We Improvise.Botting, Gary, \\"The Living Theatre\\", in The Theatre of Protest in America (Edmonton: Harden House, 1972), 18. Based in a variety of small New York locations which were frequently closed due to financial problems or conflicts with city authorities, they helped to originate off-off- Broadway and off-Broadway as significant forces in U.S. theater. Their work during this period shared some aspects of style and content with Beat generation writers. Also during the 1950s, the American composer Alan Hovhaness worked closely with the Living Theatre, composing music for its productions. In 1959, their production of The Connection attracted national attention for its harsh portrayal of drug addiction and its equally harsh language. In the early 1960s the Living Theatre was host to avant-garde minimalist performances by artists including Simone Forti and Robert Morris. The Brig (1963), an anti-authoritarian look at conditions in a Marine prison, was their last major production in New York before a tax dispute led to the closure of the theatre space and the brief imprisonment of Beck and Malina. Judith defended Julian at the IRS hearing dressed like Portia from The Merchant of Venice. For the rest of the 1960s, the group toured chiefly in Europe. They produced more politically and formally radical work carrying an anarchist and pacifist message, with the company members creating plays collectively and often living together. Major works from this period included the adaptations Antigone, Frankenstein, and Paradise Now, which became their best-known play. Paradise Now, a semi-improvisational piece involving audience participation, was notorious for a scene in which actors recited a list of social taboos that included nudity, while disrobing; this led to multiple arrests for indecent exposure. The group returned to the U.S. in 1968 to tour Paradise Now, Antigone, Mysteries and Smaller Pieces, and Frankenstein. \\"That madman who inspires us all, Artaud, does have some advice,\\" Beck said in an informal address at Yale University after his return, \\"and I think he is the philosopher, for those of us who work in theatre, whom we can reach toward most quickly, of whom we can say, yes, here is one man since Rousseau who does uphold the idea of the non-civilized man.\\"Cited in Botting, \\"The Living Theatre\\" (1972), 18‚Äì19. He added: \\"Our work had always striven to stress the sacredness of life.\\"Botting, \\"The Living Theatre\\" (1972), 19. In 1971 they toured in Brazil, where they were imprisoned for several months, then deported. The Living Theatre has toured extensively throughout the world, often in non-traditional venues such as streets and prisons. It has greatly influenced other American experimental theatre companies, notably The Open Theater (founded by former Living Theatre member Joseph Chaikin) and Bread and Puppet Theater.Botting, \\"Bread and Puppet Theatre\\", in The Theatre of Protest in America (Edmonton: Harden House, 1972), 20‚Äì24. The Living Theatre's productions have won four Obie Awards: The Connection (1959), The Brig (1963 and 2007), and Frankenstein (1968). Though its prominence and resources have diminished considerably in recent decades, The Living Theatre continues to produce new plays in New York City, many with anti-war themes. Actors rehearsing at The Living Theatre In 2006, The Living Theatre signed a 10-year lease on the basement of a new residential building under construction at 21 Clinton Street, between Houston and Stanton Streets on Manhattan's Lower East Side. The Clinton Street theater is the company's first permanent home since the closing of The Living Theatre on Third Street at Avenue C in 1993. The company moved into the completed space in early 2007 and opened in April 2007 with a revival of The Brig by Kenneth H. Brown,\\"A conversation with playwright Kenneth Brown\\", Cultural Compass, April 2010. first presented at The Living Theatre at 14th Street and Sixth Avenue in 1963. The re-staging, directed by Judith Malina, won Obie Awards for Direction and Ensemble Performance. In October 2006, the company opened a revival of Mysteries and Smaller Pieces, the 1964 collective creation that defined the interactive and Artaudian style for which the company became famous. In late 2007 / early 2008 the company founder Judith Malina performed in Maudie and Jane, a stage adaptation, directed by Reznikov, of the Doris Lessing novel, The Diary of Jane Somers. In April 2008 Hanon Reznikov suffered a stroke. He died on May 3, 2008. In 2010, the company presented Red Noir, adapted and directed by Judith Malina. In 2011, the company presented Korach, by Malina, and a revival of Seven Meditations on Political Sado-Masochism, directed by Malina and Tom Walker. Also in 2011, the company created The Plot Is The Revolution, starring Malina and Silvia Calderoni, a co-production with the Italian group Motus. In 2012, the company presented The History of the World, written and directed by Malina. In 2013, the company presented Here We Are, written and directed by Malina. The company also vacated its Clinton Street space. In 2014, Judith Malina's play No Place to Hide premiered at the Clemente Soto Velez Center on the Lower East Side. The production later took to the streets of New York for Underground Zero Festival, and traveled to Burning Man in a legendary theatre festival. No Place to Hide is the current production that is being performed. Malina was writing Venus and Mars when she died in April 2015. A production of Venus in Mars is in the works.  Goals and influences  From its conception, The Living Theatre was dedicated to transforming the organization of power within society from a competitive, hierarchical structure to cooperative and communal expression. The troupe attempts to do so by counteracting complacency in the audience through direct spectacle. They oppose the commercial orientation of Broadway productions and have contributed to the off-Broadway theater movement in New York City, staging poetic dramas. The primary text for The Living Theatre is The Theatre and its Double, an anthology of essays written by Antonin Artaud, the French playwright. It was published in France in 1937 and by the Grove Press in the U.S. in 1958. This work deeply influenced Julian Beck, a bisexual painter of abstract expressionist works. The troupe reflects Artaud's influence by staging multimedia plays designed to exhibit his metaphysical Theatre of Cruelty. In these performances, the actors attempt to dissolve the \\"fourth wall\\" between them and the spectators.

Activities included music, drama, spoken word, exhibitions, visual arts, comedy and dance. History The Drum occupied the site of the former Aston Hippodrome, which was a major variety theatre between 1908 and 1960. The Aston Hippodrome hosted performances by the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy, Judy Garland and Morecambe and Wise. The building was demolished in 1980, but in 1991 Birmingham City Council set up a project to create a new cultural facility on the site, specifically to reflect the highly diverse culture of the surrounding area. The Drum started hosting events in 1994, the first being an exhibition called 'Negritude'. In 1996, the singer Cleo Laine accepted a cheque from the National Lottery on behalf of The Drum. The Drum was fully opened in 1998. In October 2013, during Black History Month, The Drum was visited by then British Prime Minister David Cameron, who was shown around the venue by its CEO Charles Small. In 2014, poet Benjamin Zephaniah and musician Courtney Pine were made patrons of The Drum, using their influence to help raise funds for a refit of the venue. In 2015, the establishment was approved for its first major renovation and extension since it first opened. In March 2016, however, the decision was taken liquidate, amid financial troubles. The announcement to close was caused outrage among community representatives and residents. Birmingham musician Laura Mvula described the news as \\"terrible\\". An online community petition to save the venue from closure was signed by 3,294 people but was unsuccessful in its campaign. The Drum Arts Centre permanently closed its doors on 30 June 2016. Facilities The Drum had two auditoria, the 350 seat main auditorium and a 120-seat Andy Hamilton Studio, named after saxophonist Andy Hamilton. It also had an exhibition space, a cafe-bar, a business suite and a multimedia production suite. The venue was also available for private hire. The Drum was located at 144 Potters Lane, Aston, Birmingham B6 4UU.

Origin tells the story of the superhero Wolverine, best known as a member of the X-Men. Since the character first appeared in the early 1970s his history had often been shrouded in mystery, with bits of information revealed piecemeal over time (notably in Weapon X), but this series was the first to reveal Wolverine's early days and his original background. In their introductions, some of those who worked on the series express their reluctance to reveal the actual origins of one of the comic world's most popular and mysterious characters. Even Wolverine himself has few recollections of where he came from, and this was considered an essential part of his appeal. Plot The series reveals that Wolverine was born James Howlett, the son of rich plantation owners in late-19th-century Canada. He is a sickly child who suffers from allergies, so his loving father, John Howlett, Jr., brings an orphaned girl named Rose up from the town to be his companion. The two children also often play with Dog Logan, son of the Howletts' cruel groundskeeper, Thomas Logan (who looks a lot like the fully-grown Wolverine). Readers are led to believe that Dog was the young Wolverine, but this is later revealed to be not the case. The children's friendship is spoiled by the tension between the boys' fathers centering on James' mother, Elizabeth, who went mad after her first son, John, died under mysterious circumstances years earlier. Rose later stumbles upon Elizabeth changing, and sees that she has three parallel scars along her ribs, hinting that John Howlett III had claws. James Howlett first uses his claws in Origin #2.As a result of beatings and alcohol, Dog, over the next few years, becomes increasingly like his father, and his misdeeds, including an attempted assault on Rose and the killing of James' dog, become so violent that he and his father are expelled from the manor. Thomas returns for the purpose of robbing the Howlett estate and to convince Elizabeth to leave with him (it is implied that they had an affair and that Thomas may be the biological father of Elizabeth's sons). John Howlett enters the bedroom after hearing noises. Thomas kills John Howlett with a shotgun blast in front of all three children and Elizabeth. The horror of his father's death causes James' powers to manifest for the first time, and he uses his claws to kill Thomas and injure Dog, before lapsing into shock. Elizabeth tells James \\"Not you too\\" (implying that something similar had happened to his deceased brother), rejecting him with disgust. James escapes and Rose follows him. Meanwhile, Elizabeth, surprisingly, cradles the body of Thomas Logan rather than that of her husband. After a few moments, with her shallow grip on reality shattered, she picks up Thomas' shotgun and kills herself in front of Dog. Questioned by the police, Dog accuses Rose of the killings and the fact that she fled the scene with James appears to confirm this. James is still in shock and appears to have no recollection of what happened. This loss of memory is due to Wolverine's/James' healing factor which, in effect, \\"healed\\" (by putting up a mental block) the mentally devastating traumas of witnessing his father's death, the confusion at his mother's anger towards him and the pain and surprise caused by the sudden manifestation of his claws. Rose seeks help from her aunt, her only relative, who rejects her, and even James' grandfather drives them both from the house due to the manifestation of James' powers, mentioning he has had to deal with this sort of thing before. They are given some money and take the train from Alberta to British Columbia, where they are given work in a stone quarry by the foreman, Smitty. Rose claims that her male companion is her cousin and, since they are on the run, calls him Logan to conceal his identity; though why she should choose the name of their enemy remains unexplained. Over several years James/Logan strengthens physically, to the point where he no longer resembles the sickly child he had been, although his memory is still shattered. He often goes into the woods to hunt game, typically among a pack of wolves. He quickly becomes the head of the pack, and begins using his claws to hunt. He turns down Rose's offers to tell him about his past, and reacts angrily when the subject comes up. She therefore keeps detailed notes in her diary. James becomes close to the foreman, Smitty, who, in turn, develops romantic feelings toward Rose, which she returns. He courts her with books, including poetry by William Blake and a history of the samurai (warriors whom Wolverine of the X-Men would later model himself after). Logan's public identity as her cousin makes it impossible for him to declare his own feelings for her. He seems to deal with his feelings by working hard at the quarry, and is given the nickname Wolverine by the local population, who compare his intense digging to a wolverine going after a root. He also develops a deep resentment of the camp's obese cook, \\"Cookie\\" Malone, who goes out of his way to cause trouble for Logan from the time he and Rose arrive. After years of enduring Malone's abuses, Logan eventually gives him a beating after the cook provokes an explosion in the quarry. Smitty eventually asks Rose to marry him, which she accepts, and Smitty informs her that the cage fights are a fast and easy way to earn some extra money. He asks her to leave with him, which she is reluctant to do because of Logan. Logan sees Rose kissing Smitty and, feeling betrayed, later confronts her and confesses his feelings to her, though she rejects him for Smitty after he turns down her offer for him to go with them. Just before the couple leaves to be wed, Dog comes to the bar, originally sent by Old Man Howlett, on his deathbed, to find his heir. Logan works out his violence in a series of cage fights, and confronts Smitty at the last cage fight after venting his fury on Malone, and quickly has him at his mercy. Despite mixed feelings, Logan wishes Rose to be happy and allows Smitty to defeat him purposely. After the last cage fight, Dog confronts Logan. Dog blames Logan for the events that led to his father's death and is actually there for revenge. In the ensuing fight, Logan gives Dog a beating, but as he is about to kill him, Rose is accidentally impaled on Logan's claws. Logan goes mad with grief (his healing factor throwing up another mental block due to accidentally killing his first love) and runs into the woods, where he stays for an as yet unknown amount of time, living like a wild animal. Smitty attempts to find him during this period and bring him back to humanity, but fails as Logan no longer wishes to be found. Logan would not let Rose tell him about his past, which he had forgotten anyway. Malone steals Rose's few belongings, and contemptuously burns her diary which contains the truth of Logan's past. Production For decades, Wolverine's origins had been a mystery. After the success of the first X-Men film, it was decided if the character's origin wasn't told in the comic, it would be told on the film. Paul Jenkins wanted certain characters, artwise and relationship-wise, to resonate with those knowledgeable about Wolverine's character history. Smitty was supposed to look somewhat like Cyclops, and his relationship with Jean Grey lookalike Rose to be what sparks Wolverine's jealousy in his fictional future. Similarly, Dog was to be a representation of Sabretooth, Wolverine's greatest nemesis.Origin (Deluxe Hardcover only) When an interviewer asked Jenkins whether the character Dog Logan was Sabretooth, Jenkins replied that he had not intended it to be him, but said he wouldn't have a problem with another writer doing it later. In April 2009, Marvel Comics released a one- shot specialty comic entitled X-Men Origins: Sabretooth, which was part of a series of origin stories for a number of other X-Men characters. The comic chronicled some of Sabretooth's earliest childhood experiences. Within the comic, it is revealed that Sabretooth's childhood and early life, with the exception of being in an abusive family, differs distinctly from the life of Dog as shown in the Origin mini-series. Sales The final issue #6 of Origin was ranked second in sales for the January 2002 period with pre-order sales of 166,997. Sequel At 2013 San Diego Comic-Con International, Marvel announced a sequel to the original limited series titled Origin II. Written by Kieron Gillen with art by Adam Kubert, brother of original artist Andy Kubert, the first issue was released in December 2013. In other media The film X-Men Origins: Wolverine, partially inspired by Origin, wherein James Howlett in 19th-century Canada discovers his mutant powers and Victor Creed is Logan's half brother.

The company was organized on January 26, 1914, by Guy Hamilton, F.M. Woodward, and other local residents. Construction of the factory started in the spring of 1914. Soon after, they started production of the Alter designed by Clarence Alter of Manitowoc, Wisconsin. The car was made from component parts shipped to Plymouth by rail and then assembled at the Farmer Street factory. At its peak, the factory employed 100 people, and produced 25 vehicles a day. January 1917, the company went into receivership, and closed. The factory building still stands on Farmer Street near downtown Plymouth, across from the Cultural Center. In 2000 it was restored and, as of October 2007, is home to the C.D. Sparling Co., a small manufacturing company. The 1914 model was a five-passenger touring car. A roadster was later introduced. The 1916 Alter model was described as \\"the classy look and finish of the higher priced cars\\", by the Plymouth Mail (local newspaper) on March 3, 1916. The 1916 model had a 27 horsepower 4-cylinder engine, fuel tank under the cowl, with a wheelbase of . The 1916 Alter sold for $685. Rarity Only one Alter model is still known to exist, car No. 75, a 1915 model Alter. In 1959, Mr. & Mrs Dale Blair from Upper Sandusky, Ohio, drove to Plymouth to see the factory where the vehicle was built. He later displayed the vehicle in the Old Car Festival at Greenfield Village in Dearborn, Michigan. Clarence Moore, a charter member of the Plymouth Historical Society eventually bought the car.

Biography Kateb Yacine was officially born on August 6, 1929 in Constantine, though it is likely that his birth occurred four days earlier. Although his birth name is Yacine Kateb, he once said that he was so used to hearing his teachers calling out names with the last name first that he adopted Kateb Yacine as a pen name. He was born into a scholarly maraboutic Chaoui Berber family from the modern Sedrata, in wilaya of Souk Ahras (in the Aur√®s region). His maternal grandfather was the 'bach adel', or deputy judge of the qadi in Cond√© Smendou (Zirout Youcef). His father was a lawyer, and the family followed him through his various assignments in different parts of the country. Young Kateb (which means 'writer'), attended the Sedrata Quran school in 1937, then in 1938 the French school in Lafayette (Bougaa) in Little Kabylie, where the family had moved. In 1941 he enrolled in the colonial 'coll√®ge' (secondary school) of Setif as a boarder. Kateb Yacine was in his third year of coll√®ge when the demonstrations of May 8, 1945 occurred. He participated in these demonstrations that ended with the massacre of between six and eight (according to nationalists forty-five) thousand Algerians by the French army and police in the S√©tif and Guelma massacre. Three days later he was placed under arrest and imprisoned for two months. From that point on he became a partisan for the nationalist cause. Expelled from secondary school, watching his mother's psychological health decline, passing through a period of dejection and immersed in the writings of Lautr√©amont and Baudelaire, his father sent him to the high school in B√¥ne (Annaba). There he met 'Nedjma' ('the star'), an 'already married cousin' with whom he lived for 'maybe eight months', as he later acknowledged. While living with Nedjma he published his first collection of poetry in 1946. He had already become 'politicized' and started giving lectures under the auspices of the Algerian People's Party, 'the great nationalist party of the masses'. Yacine went to Paris in 1947, \\"into the lion's den\\" as he put it. In May 1947 he joined the Algerian Communist Party and gave a lecture in the 'Salle des Soci√©t√©s savantes' on emir Abd al-Qadir. During a second visit to France the following year he published 'Nedjma ou le Po√®me du Couteau' (a hint of what was to follow) in the revue 'Le Mercure de France'. He was a journalist at the daily 'Alger R√©publicain' between 1949 and 1951. After his father's death in 1950 Yacine worked as a longshoreman in Algiers. He returned to Paris where he would stay until 1959. During this period in Paris he worked with Malek Haddad, developed a relationship with M'hamed Issiakhem, and in 1954, spoke extensively with Bertold Brecht. In 1954, the revue Esprit published Yacine's play 'Le cadavre encercl√©', which was staged by Jean-Marie Serreau but was banned in France. 'Nedjma' was published in 1956 (and Kateb would not forget the editor's comment: \\"This is too complicated. In Algeria you've got such pretty sheep, why don't you talk about your sheep?\\"). During the Algerian War of Independence, Yacine was forced to travel abroad for a long time due to the harassment he faced from the DST. He lived in numerous places, subsisting as a guest writer or working various odd jobs in France, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Yugoslavia and the USSR. After a stay in Cairo, Yacine returned again to Algeria in 1962, shortly after the independence celebrations. He resumed writing for 'Alger R√©publicain' but traveled frequently between 1963 and 1967 to Moscow, France and Germany. 'La Femme sauvage', which he had written between 1954 and 1959, was performed in Paris in 1963. 'Les Anc√™tres redoublent de f√©rocit√©' was staged in 1967. 'La Poudre d'intelligence' was also staged in Paris in 1967 and an Algerian Arabic version in Algiers in 1969. In 1964 Yacine published six essays on 'our brothers the Indians' in 'Alger R√©publicain' and recounted his meeting with Jean-Paul Sartre while his mother was being committed to the psychiatric hospital in Blida ('La Rose de Blida', in 'R√©volution Africaine', July 1965). He left for Vietnam in 1967, completely abandoning the novel and wrote 'L'Homme aux sandales de caoutchouc', a play celebrating Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnamese struggle against imperialism, that was published, performed and translated into Arabic in 1970. The same year Yacine returned to make a more permanent home in Algeria. During this period he had a significant change in philosophy: he refused to continue writing in French, and instead began working on popular theatre, epics and satires, performed in dialectal Arabic. Beginning this work with the theatre company 'Th√©atre de la Mer' from Bab El Oued in 1971, sponsored by the Minist√®re du Travail et des Affaires Sociales, Kateb traveled all over Algeria for five years, putting on plays for an audience of workers, farmers and students. The Kateb family, with Yacine setting in the front between his two sisters Between 1972 and 1975 Kateb went with on tour performing the plays 'Mohamed prends ta valise' and 'La Guerre de deux mille ans' to France and to the German Democratic Republic. The Algerian government in Sidi-Bel-Abbes more or less sentenced him to direct the city's regional theatre as a kind of exile. Having been forbidden to appear on television, Yacine staged his plays in schools or businesses. He was often criticized for his emphasis on Berber tradition and the 'Tamazight' language, as well as for his liberal positions on issues of gender equality such as his position against women being required to wear a headscarf. In 1986 Kateb Yacine circulated an excerpt of a play about Nelson Mandela, and in 1987 he received the Grand prix national des Lettres in France. In 1988 the Avignon Festival staged 'Le Bourgeois sans culotte ou le spectre du parc Monceau', a play about Robespierre that Yacine wrote at the request of the Arras Cultural Center for the bicentennial commemoration of the French Revolution. Yacine settled in Verscheny in Dr√¥me, traveled often to the United States and continued to make frequent trips to Algeria. At his death he left an unfinished work on the Algerian riots of October 1988. In 2003 his works were admitted to the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise. Taught in the language of the colonizer, Kateb Yacine considered the French language the Algerians' spoil of the war for independence. He declared in 1966 that \\"La Francophonie is a neocolonial political machine, which only perpetuates our alienation, but the usage of the French language does not mean that one is an agent of a foreign power, and I write in French to tell the French that I am not French\\". Trilingual, Kateb Yacine also wrote and supervised the translation of his texts into the Berber language. His work manifests his multicultural country's search for identity and the aspirations of its people. Kateb Yacine is the father of three children, Hans, Nadia and Amazigh Kateb, singer for the band Gnawa Diffusion.

City documents have also used New York City census tract 70 (from 29th to 34th Streets, First to Third Avenues) as an approximation for Kips Bay, and referred to tract 66, immediately below it, as \\"Bellevue South.\\"Stuyvesant Cove 197-a Plan, spring 1997See also NYC NEIGHBORHOODS for \\"Kips Bay\\" and \\"Bellevue Area\\"See also Draft Scoping Document for an Environmental Impact Statement for DSNY East 25th Street Manhattan Districts 6/6A/8 Garage for \\"Bellevue area\\" The American Guide Series defines the combined Kip's Bay‚ÄìTurtle Bay area as running from 27th Street north 59th Street, and from Third Avenue to the East River, excluding the neighborhoods of Beekman Place and Sutton Place. For its entry on Kips Bay, the American Institute of Architects' AIA Guide to New York City uses the area from 23rd Street north to roughly 38th Street, and from the East River west to just past Second Avenue. In AIA Guide, Kips Bay is adjacent to Tudor City and the United Nations/Turtle Bay area on the north, Murray Hill and Rose Hill on the west, and the Stuyvesant Square area and Peter Cooper Village on the south. Other popular definitions of the neighborhood, such as that by The New York Times, include 23rd Street to the south, 34th Street to the north, Lexington Avenue to the west, and the East River to the east. To the north is Murray Hill; to the west is Madison Square, NoMad, and/or Rose Hill; and to the south is the Bellevue area or the Gramercy Park neighborhood and Peter Cooper Village.  History  =Colonial settlement= A 1781 British map depicting Manhattan; Kip's Bay is labeled as \\"Kepps Bay\\" Kips Bay was an inlet of the East River running from what is now 32nd Street to 37th Street. The bay extended into Manhattan Island to just west of what is now First Avenue and had two streams that ran from it. The bay was named after New Netherland Dutch settler Jacobus Hendrickson Kip (1631‚Äì1690), son of Hendrick Hendricksen Kip, whose farm ran north of present-day 30th Street along the East River. The bay became reclaimed land, yet \\"Kips Bay\\" remains the name of the area. Kip built a large brick and stone house, near the modern intersection of Second Avenue and East 35th Street. The house stood from 1655 to 1851, expanded more than once, and when it was demolished was the last farmhouse from New Amsterdam remaining in Manhattan.http://wyckoffmuseum.org/about/history/ Iron figures fixed into the gable-end brickwork commemorated the year of its first construction. Its orchard was famous, and, when first President George Washington was presented with a sip of its Rosa gallica during his first administration (1789-1793), when New York was serving as the first national capital city, it was claimed to have been the first garden to have grown it in the Thirteen Colonies. Kips Bay was the site of the Landing at Kip's Bay, an episode of the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783) and part of the New York and New Jersey campaign. About 4,000 British Army troops under General William Howe landed at Kips Bay on September 15, 1776, near what is now the foot of East 33rd Street off the East River from a Royal Navy fleet which had first landed earlier on Staten Island, then Long Island for the pivotal Battle of Brooklyn (also known as the Battle of Long Island) the previous month. Howe's forces defeated about 500 American militiamen stationed at Kips Bay by Washington and commanded by Colonel William Douglas. The American forces immediately retreated, and the British occupied New York Town at the south point of the island soon afterward forcing General Washington to retreat northward to the Harlem River. Wood frame house and brick carriage house of uncertain age at 203 East 29th Street A single survivor of the late 18th or early 19th century in the neighborhood is the simple vernacular white clapboard house, much rebuilt, at 203 East 29th Street. The house, standing gable-end to the street, is one of a mere handful of wooden houses that remain on Manhattan Island. Its date of construction is unknown but has been variously dated from around 1790 to as late as 1870; currently listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the house is privately owned and not open to the public. South of the Kips Bay Farm stood the substantial Federal- style villa erected facing the East River by Henry A. Coster,The engraved illustration in Mrs Martha Joanna Lamb and Mrs Burton Harrison, History of the City of New York: its origin, rise and progress, vol. 3 p. 522, though called \\"more of a Grecian type of architecture\\", shows characteristic Federal architecture in its balustraded roofline, its half-oval fanlight in the central pediment, and the widely spaced slender columns of the portico; see also Eliza Greatorex drawing (New York Public Library). in the thirty-acre estate\\"Early New York: Panorama of ancient East River homes\\" 1893. that was purchased in 1835 by Anson Greene Phelps; towards the city, the Bull's Head cattle market fronting the Boston Post Road extended southwards from 27th Street to 23rd Street, affording a distinctly less rural aspect;\\"After leaving Twenty-seventh Street and Third Avenue the traveller was in the country. There was no other settlement until Yorkville was reached, nearly two miles beyond. Scattered farm-houses, distant villas, green fields, and bits of woodland made up the landscape.\\" recalled the writer of \\"Old Days In Yorkville and Harlem\\", 1893, recalling the route up Third Avenue in the 1850s the villa was removed to make way for row houses in the 1860s and the cattle market was moved farther out of town, to 42nd Street. = Later development = Broadway Alley is nowhere near Broadway, and the origin of the name is unknown., p. 31 The neighborhood has been rebuilt in patches, featuring both new high-rise structures often set back from the street, and a multitude of exposed party walls that were never meant to be seen in public. A nearly forgotten feature is the private alley called Broadway Alley, between 26th and 27th Streets, halfway between Lexington and Third Avenues, reputedly the last unpaved street in Manhattan; it is not known what this alley is named after, since it is not near the main Broadway. In the 1960s and later, four Henry Phipps high-rise apartment complexes were constructed mainly on East 29th Street between First and Second Avenues, and south to East 27th Street. Historically, Phipps had been a partner of steel industrialist Andrew Carnegie. Much earlier in time, by 1940, the Madison Square Boys (and later Girls) Club, which had been located on East 30th Street just east of Second Avenue, built its own facilities on East 29th Street (back-to-back with its older facility). In the 1990s, the Club sold its facility to the Churchill School and Center, and moved its office in the Empire State Building. The North Building of the Kips Bay Towers (I. M. Pei, architect) There are two large apartment buildings in the neighborhood named Kips Bay Towers, which are part of a 1,112-unit complex completed in 1963 and designed by architect I. M. Pei. Built on a pier above the East River between East 25th and East 28th Streets is Waterside Plaza, which includes residential towers and the United Nations International School. There were plans to build additional above-water apartments, offices, and a hotel in the 1980s, but environmental concerns and community opposition doomed the project. Today, the waterfront south of Waterside Plaza is Stuyvesant Cove Park. The park includes a small man-made land mass extending out into the East River, which was created from excess cement dumped into the river.

Thaton lies along the National Highway 8 and is also connected by the National Road 85. It is 230 km south east of Yangon and 70 km north of Mawlamyine. Thaton was the capital of Thaton Kingdom from at least the 4th century BC to the middle of the 11th century AD. Etymology Thaton is the Burmese name of Sadhuim (·Äû·Äì·ÄÆ·ÄØ) in Mon, which in turn is from Sudhammapura () in Pali, after Sudharma, the moot hall of the gods. History Thaton was the capital of the Thaton Kingdom, a Mon Kingdom which ruled present day Lower Burma between the 4th and 11th centuries. Like the Burmans and the Thais, some modern Mons have tried to identify their ethnicity and, specifically this kingdom at Thaton, with the semi-historical kingdom of Suwarnabhumi (\\"The Golden Land\\"); today, this claim is contested by many different ethnicities in south-east Asia, and contradicted by scholars. Historical scholarship indicates that the early usage of the term (as found in the edicts of Ashoka of India, who sent Buddhist missionaries there in the 3rd century BC) indicated a location in southern India, and not in south-east Asia. In the kingdom of Dvaravati, Thaton was an important seaport on the Gulf of Martaban, for trade with India and Sri Lanka. Shin Arahan, also called Dhammadassi, a monk born in Thaton and raised and educated in Nakhon Pathom, an old capital of the Mon kingdom of Dvaravadi, now in Thailand, took Theravada Buddhism north to the Burmese kingdom of Bagan. In 1057, King Anawrahta of Bagan conquered Thaton. Geography Silting has resulted in the coastline moving away from Thaton, which is now a sleepy town on the rail line from Bago to Mawlamyine (Moulmein).

Career =UK work= Cover of Amazing Heroes #85 (Dec 1985) by Alan Davis Davis began his career in comics on an English fanzine. His first professional work was a strip called The Crusader in Frantic Magazine for Dez Skinn's revamped Marvel UK line. Davis's big break was drawing the revamped Captain Britain story in Marvel Superheroes. At the time, he was working full-time in a warehouse in Corby doing work that included loading trucks. He initially had no interest in pursuing a career in comics, as he considered drawing to be a hobby.Davis, Alan (w). \\"Stick with it, it gets better!\\", X-Men Archives Featuring Captain Britain #1 (July 1995), Marvel Comics (New York City), p. 4. Due to his inexperience, Davis did not leave enough room for word balloons in the five- page first installment, so it had to be recut to six pages. Afterwards, Alan Moore took over writing duties on Captain Britain. He drew 14 issues of the monthly Captain Britain title, which was later reprinted in trade paperback. Davis and Moore formed a close working partnership as creators; they also created D.R. and Quinch for 2000AD. Later, Davis replaced Garry Leach on Marvelman in Warrior and yet again worked with Moore. He also drew the story \\"Harry Twenty on the High Rock\\" in 2000AD. =American work= In 1985 Davis received his big break in the United States when he was hired by DC Comics to draw Batman and the Outsiders, written by Mike W. Barr. Davis took over from Jim Aparo, who launch the direct market version of the title. His work proved popular enough for him to be assigned artistic duties on DC's flagship title Detective Comics in 1986, again with Barr writing. During the \\"Batman: Year Two\\" storyline, however, Davis encountered difficulties with his editor and left after the first issue of the four-issue storyline. The remaining three issues were illustrated by Todd McFarlane. In the story, which featured Joe Chill, the murderer of Batman's parents, Barr wanted Chill to have a large gun. He asked Davis to draw him with a Mauser with an extended barrel, similar to the one used by the Paul Kirk version of Manhunter. However, after Davis rendered Chill with this firearm throughout Detective Comics #575 and on its cover, he obtained copies of the pages for Batman #404 by Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli, which was scheduled to be released months before the \\"Year Two\\" storyline, and saw that Chill was depicted using a smaller handgun without the extended barrel. When asked by editorial to redraw the gun in his artwork, Davis refused. Dick Giordano redrew the gun in the artwork. Davis accepted an offer by Uncanny X-Men writer Chris Claremont to work on Marvel Comics' X-Men books. With Claremont, Davis drew two New Mutants Annuals and three issues for Uncanny X-Men. In 1987 the duo launched the monthly series Excalibur, which featured a team consisting of Captain Britain and Meggan together with former X-Men members Kitty Pryde, Nightcrawler and Rachel Summers. The stories, set in England, saw appearances by many characters from Moore's and Davis' Captain Britain stories of the early 1980s, including the Crazy Gang and the Technet. Davis' pencils were inked by Paul Neary and, later, Mark Farmer. Davis left with issue 24 due to deadline pressures, but returned with issue 42, this time also as writer. During this second run, according to Davis, \\"[Editor] Terry Kavanagh spoiled me, gave me near total freedom, and encouraged me to experiment.\\" Among the new characters he created for his second run on the title were Feron, Cerise, Micromax and Kylun. The ClanDestine, created by Davis for Marvel in 1994 In 1994 Davis created a new series of original characters called the ClanDestine, which featured the Destines, a family of long-lived, magically-powered British superhumans. Davis wrote and penciled the title for the first eight issues. He departed after issue 8, and the series was canceled with issue 12. In 1996 Davis wrote and drew the two issue crossover miniseries X-Men and The ClanDestine. In 1991, Davis reunited with writer Barr to draw the sequel to \\"Year Two\\", the one-shot Batman: Full Circle. During much of the 1990s Davis drew many of Marvel and DC Comics major characters and titles, including JLA: The Nail and The Avengers. He was also commissioned to write both main X-Men series in 1999 (providing art for X-Men as well), but he left the following year. Starting in October 2002 he wrote and drew for Marvel Killraven, a six-issues miniseries revamping the title character of the 1970s. After a return to Uncanny X-Men, working again with Claremont, Davis wrote and drew in 2006‚Äì2007 a six-issue Fantastic Four: The End limited series for Marvel (not to be confused with a similar one-shot written by Stan Lee and drawn by John Romita Jr). In February 2008, Davis wrote and pencilled a five-part ClanDestine miniseries and the one-shot Thor: Truth of History for Marvel. Davis most recent work has been in Totally Awesome Hulk (#7-8, 2016), the Thanos Trilogy (2018-2019) and a reunion with Roy Thomas in 2019 for two issues of The Savage Sword of Conan (#10-11, volume 2).

He is best known for his graphic novel series, The Spider Garden and Tranceptor, which combine elements of pan-sexual fetishism and BDSM culture with complex characters in science fiction and fantasy settings. He is also active in the supernatural horror and fantasy genres, drawing adaptations of the work of authors such as H.P. Lovecraft, Edgar Allan Poe, and Alexandre Dumas for the Graphic Classics comics anthology series, as well as illustrating an anachronistic version of the German folk epic, The Nibelungen. Biography =Early career= Manning was born in Flushing in the New York City borough of Queens and raised in Beverly, Massachusetts where he exhibited an early interest in drawing and writing. Exposure to Japanese animation, fairy-tale book illustration, American and European comics, and the mythology of many cultures all contributed to the formation of his emerging style. 1980s Manning went on to study film and animation at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. He began self-publishing art and comics in 1987 while working at Olive Jar Animation in Brookline, MA as an animator and director of short films, commercials, and music videos. Self-published titles such as Shunga, Ukiyo-X and Z/Xero brought his work to the attention of comic book artists John Bergin and James O'Barr (creator of The Crow) who in turn showed his work to Kevin Eastman of Tundra Publishing. This led to the inclusion of two of Manning's short pieces (one of which was a collaboration with Red Spider White Web author Misha Nogha) in Tundra's Bone Saw anthology - Manning's first professional comics publication. 1990s A move to San Francisco in 1991 coincided with Manning's decision to focus on comic books and erotic illustration full-time. Manning continued to self-publish and produce work for the Bay Area's emerging BDSM/sex-zine community while his artwork and stage/costume design for multi-media performances appeared regularly at local music venues, fetish events, and art galleries. Much of his graphic work from this period was subsequently collected and published in the art collection Lumenagerie (1996) and the anthology Cathexis (1997). He also wrote and drew four volumes of the Spider Garden series and in collaboration with artist Patrick Conlon the first installment of the Tranceptor series. 2000s A second collection, Inamorata: The Erotic Art of Michael Manning, was published by Last Gasp in 2005 just after Manning moved to Los Angeles. The second volume in the Tranceptor series, Iron Gauge, was published in 2007. Manning's artwork has been exhibited in galleries in San Francisco, New York, Chicago, Boston, Omaha, Miami, Los Angeles, Tokyo, and Milan. In 2002, mural- sized reproductions of panels from his In A Metal Web graphic novel were featured as part of a special installation at San Francisco's Yerba Buena Center for the Arts comic book-themed exhibition Fantastic! Comics and the Art of Illusion, =The Spider Garden Series= The Spider Garden graphic novel series, written and drawn by Manning, currently consists of four volumes in the following order: The Spider Garden (1995), Hydrophidian (1996), In A Metal Web (2004), and In A Metal Web II (2004). Publication History The first volume of the Spider Garden series was originally produced under contract for Kevin Eastman's Tundra Publishing line. After Manning was released from his contract with Tundra in 1994, The Spider Garden became the inaugural book in NBM Publishing's Amerotica line with the three subsequent volumes in the series also appearing under the NBM/Amerotica imprint. An Italian language edition of the first volume was published by Phoenix Erotica in 1999, followed by French and Italian language editions from BD √ârog√©ne in 2000. Plot Set in a futuristic, matriarchal world of warring clans which vaguely recalls feudal-era Japanese culture, the action centers on the eponymous Spider Garden, a palace-fortress populated by concubines, human pets, and the spider- like automatons who give the Garden its name. The Garden's ruler is Shaalis the Sacred Androgyne, a seemingly immortal hermaphrodite who is referred to by the pronouns 'Hir' and 'S/He' (pronounced as \\"her\\" and \\"she\\" respectively) to denote Hir multi-gendered status. The main plot follows the socio-political intrigues between Shaalis' Metal Spider Clan and the Serpentine Sisters, Squamata and Lichurna - incestuous twins who command the rival Water Serpent Clan which is based in an aquatic palace, Hydrophidian. Caught in the middle are former lovers Sasaya Nijan, a female courtesan who enters service in the Spider Garden in order to settle a gambling debt, and Lord Verio, head of the Double Ibis Clan who, following a failed assassination attempt on the Sacred Androgyne, finds himself deposed and forced into an alliance with the Serpentine Sisters. Also appearing in the story are the Tengu, a non-human race of horse-like bipeds. Inspired by but not identical to the tengu of Japanese legend, it is implied that these creatures once held humanity in bondage in the distant past.

Experimental theatre (also known as avant-garde theatre) began in Western theatre in the late 19th century with Alfred Jarry and his Ubu plays as a rejection of both the age in particular and, in general, the dominant ways of writing and producing plays. The term has shifted over time as the mainstream theatre world has adopted many forms that were once considered radical. Like other forms of the avant- garde, it was created as a response to a perceived general cultural crisis. Despite different political and formal approaches, all avant-garde theatre opposes bourgeois theatre. It tries to introduce a different use of language and the body to change the mode of perceptionErika Fischer-Lichte \\"Einleitung Wahrnehmung-K√∂rper-Sprache\\" in: Erika Fischer-Lichte et al.: TheaterAvantgarde, T√ºbingen 1995, pp. 1‚Äì15 and to create a new, more active relation with the audience. Relationships to audience Famed experimental theatre director and playwright Peter Brook describes his task as building \\"‚Ä¶ a necessary theatre, one in which there is only a practical difference between actor and audience, not a fundamental one.\\" Traditionally audiences are seen as passive observers. Many practitioners of experimental theatre have wanted to challenge this. For example, Bertolt Brecht wanted to mobilise his audiences by having a character in a play break through the invisible \\"fourth wall,\\" directly ask the audience questions, not giving them answers, thereby getting them to think for themselves; Augusto Boal wanted his audiences to react directly to the action; and Antonin Artaud wanted to affect them directly on a subconscious level. Peter Brook has identified a triangle of relationships within a performance: the performers' internal relationships, the performers' relationships to each other on stage, and their relationship with the audience. The British experimental theatre group Welfare State International has spoken of a ceremonial circle during performance, the cast providing one half, the audience providing another, and the energy in the middle. Aside from ideological implications of the role of the audience, theatres and performances have addressed or involved the audience in a variety of ways. The proscenium arch has been called into question, with performances venturing into non-theatrical spaces. Audiences have been engaged differently, often as active participants in the action on a highly practical level. When a proscenium arch has been used, its usual use has often been subverted. Audience participation can range from asking for volunteers to go onstage to having actors scream in audience members' faces. By using audience participation, the performer invites the audience to feel a certain way and by doing so they may change their attitudes, values and beliefs in regard to the performance's topic. For example, in a performance on bullying the character may approach an audience member, size them up and challenge them to a fight on the spot. The terrified look on the audience member's face will strongly embody the message of bullying to the member and the rest of the audience. Physically, theatre spaces took on different shapes, and practitioners re- explored different ways of staging performance and a lot of research was done into Elizabethan and Greek theatre spaces. This was integrated into the mainstream, the National Theatre in London, for example, has a highly flexible, somewhat Elizabethan traverse space (the Dorfman), a proscenium space (the Lyttelton) and an amphitheatre space (the Olivier) and the directors and architects consciously wanted to break away from the primacy of the proscenium arch. Jacques Copeau was an important figure in terms of stage design, and was very keen to break away from the excesses of naturalism to get to a more pared down, representational way of looking at the stage. Social contexts The increase of the production of experimental theaters during the 1950s through the 1960s has prompted some to cite the connection between theater groups and the socio-political contexts in which they operated. Some groups have been prominent in changing the social face of theatre, rather than its stylistic appearance. Performers have used their skills to engage in a form of cultural activism. This may be in the form of didactic agit-prop theatre, or some (such as Welfare State International) see a performance environment as being one in which a micro-society can emerge and can lead a way of life alternative to that of the broader society in which they are placed. For instance, in a study of South American theatrical developments during the 1960s, the Nuevo Teatro Popular materialized amid the change and innovations entailed in the social and political developments of the period. This theatrical initiative was organized around groups or collective driven by specific events and performed themes tied to class and cultural identity that empowered their audience and help create movements that spanned national and cultural borders. These included Utopian projects, which sought to reconstruct social and cultural production, including their objectives. Augusto Boal used the Legislative Theatre on the people of Rio to find out what they wanted to change about their community, and he used the audience reaction to change legislation in his role as a councillor. In the United States, the tumultuous 1960s saw experimental theater emerging as a reaction to the state's policies on issues like nuclear armament, racial social injustice, homophobia, sexism and military‚Äìindustrial complex. The mainstream theater was increasingly seen from as a purveyor of lies, hence, theatrical performances were often seen as a means to expose what is real and this entails a focus on hypocrisy, inequality, discrimination, and repression. This is demonstrated in the case of Grotowski, who rejected the lies and contradictions of mainstream theater and pushed for what he called as truthful acting in the performances of his Poor Theater as well as his lectures and workshops. Experimental theatre encourages directors to make society, or our audience at least, change their attitudes, values, and beliefs on an issue and to do something about it. The distinction was explained in the conceptualization of experimentation that \\"goes much deeper and much beyond than merely a new form/or novel content\\" but \\"a light that illuminates one's work from within. And this light in the spirit of quest ‚Äì not only aesthetic quest ‚Äì it is an amalgam of so many quests ‚Äì intellectual, aesthetic, but most of all, spiritual quest.\\" Methods of creation Traditionally, there is a highly hierarchical method of creating theatre - a writer identifies a problem, a writer writes a script, a director interprets it for the stage together with the actors, the performers perform the director and writer's collective vision. Various practitioners started challenging this and started seeing the performers more and more as creative artists in their own right. This started with giving them more and more interpretive freedom and devised theatre eventually emerged. This direction was aided by the advent of ensemble improvisational theater, as part of the experimental theatre movement, which did not need a writer to develop the material for a show or \\"theater piece.\\" In this form the lines were devised by the actors or performers. Within this many different structures and possibilities exist for performance makers, and a large variety of different models are used by performers today. The primacy of the director and writer has been challenged directly, and the directors role can exist as an outside eye or a facilitator rather than the supreme authority figure they once would have been able to assume. As well as hierarchies being challenged, performers have been challenging their individual roles. An inter-disciplinary approach becomes more and more common as performers have become less willing to be shoe-horned into specialist technical roles. Simultaneous to this, other disciplines have started breaking down their barriers. Dance, music, video art, visual art, new media art and writing become blurred in many cases, and artists with completely separate trainings and backgrounds collaborate very comfortably. Physical effects Experimental theatre alters traditional conventions of space (black box theater), theme, movement, mood, tension, language, symbolism, conventional rules and other elements.

It is part of the Queensland Rail City network. Grovely railway station, 2012 History Cutting of the ribbon at the opening of the railway to Samford, 1919 Ad for the opening of the line to Dayboro, 1920 Train passing through the level crossing in Wardell Street, Enoggera ~1950 Based on initial surveys, in 1885 the Queensland Government planned to construct a railway line to Samford with the intention of extending it to Gympie. However, no immediate action was taken and further surveys resulted in the decision to construct the line to Gympie via the Mayne railway station (Bowen Hills) which created the North Coast railway line. The relocation of Brisbane's cattle sales yard from Normanby to Newmarket created a need to provide a railway to Newmarket. With financial guarantees provided by the Windsor Shire Council and the Enoggera Divisional Board, the Queensland Railways built a branch line from Mayne railway station (Bowen Hills) to Newmarket railway station to service the cattle yards and beyond to Enoggera railway station for suburban passenger services. This line opened on 5 February 1899. The suburban service to Enoggera was not very profitable and the Queensland Government resisted any efforts to extend the Brisbane tramway services to Enoggera to avoid further competition. With the financial assistance of the Australi Defence Department, the line was extended to Rifle Range railway station (now called Gaythorne railway station) on 16 February 1916. The line was extended to Mitchelton railway station on 2 March 1918. The line was extended to Samford railway station on 1 July 1918, to Samsonvale railway station (3 March 1919), to Kobble railway station (3 November 1919) and finally to Dayboro railway station on 25 September 1920. The additional traffic on the line led to its duplication to Newmarket in 1921. The sales yards were moved to Cannon Hill in 1931. On 5 May 1947, a packed excursion train derailed at Camp Mountain, after Ferny Grove railway station, in what is Queensland's worst rail tragedy, the Camp Mountain train disaster. The line was duplicated to Mitchelton in 1953, and the first automatic level crossing boom gates in Queensland were installed at Wilston Road, Newmarket in 1954.Kerr, J. 'Brunswick St, Bowen Hills & Beyond' ARHS 1988 The line was closed beyond Ferny Grove in 1955 after the freight traffic was lost to road transport. Ferny Grove was initially known as Ferny Flats, but the railway department changed the name of the railway station because of a Ferny Flats in New South Wales; the surrounding area followed suit. Recent upgrades Between 2008-12 the remaining single track section between Mitchelton and Ferny Grove was duplicated, including an upgraded Ferny Grove station, an additional 1000 car parking spaces and construction of a new bus interchange. Line guide, frequency and services Typical service frequency on the Ferny Grove Line is four trains per hour (every 15 minutes) on weekdays and two trains per hour (every 30 minutes) at night and on weekends, increasing to 8 trains per hour (every 7.5 minutes) during weekday peak times for faster travel times for commuters working in the Brisbane central business district. Most services stop at all stations to Roma Street railway station. The typical travel time between Ferny Grove and Brisbane City is approximately 27 minutes (to Central). Ferny Grove line services typically continue as Beenleigh line services. Passengers for and from the Airport, Caboolture, Doomben, Nambour and Gympie North and Shorncliffe lines change at Bowen Hills, and all other lines at Roma Street.

Romita is the father of John Romita Jr., also a comic book artist and husband of Virginia Romita, for many years Marvel's traffic manager.Cohen, Lynn E. \\"Bullpen Bulletins,\\" Marvel comics cover-dated January 1984. Career =Early life and career= Romita was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York City, the son of Marie and Victor Romita, a baker,Romita interview, Alter Ego #9, p. 4 with three sisters and a brother.Romita interview, Alter Ego #9, p. 6 He is of Italian descent. He graduated from Manhattan's School of Industrial Art in 1947, having attended for three years after spending ninth grade at a Brooklyn junior high school.Spurlock, J. David, and John Romita. John Romita Sketchbook. Vanguard Productions: Lebanon, New Jersey 2002 , pp. 8‚Äì9 Among his instructors were book illustrator Howard Simon and magazine illustrator Ben Clements,Spurlock, p. 9 and his influences included comics artists Noel Sickles, Roy Crane, Milton Caniff,Romita interview, Alter Ego #9, p. 7 and later, Alex Toth and Carmine Infantino, as well as commercial illustrators Jon Whitcomb, Coby Whitmore, and Al Parker.Spurlock, p. 16 Romita entered the comics industry in 1949 on the series Famous Funnies. \\"Steven Douglas up there was a benefactor to all young artists\\", Romita recalled. \\"The first story he gave me was a love story. It was terrible. All the women looked like emaciated men and he bought it, never criticized, and told me to keep working. He paid me two hundred dollars for it and never published it ‚Äî and rightfully so\\". Romita was working at the New York City company Forbes Lithograph in 1949, earning $30 a week, when comic-book inker Lester Zakarin,Spurlock, p. 10 a friend from high school whom he ran into on a subway train, offered him either $17Spurlock, pp. 10‚Äì11 or $20 a page to pencil a 10-page story for him as uncredited ghost artist. \\"I thought, this is ridiculous! In two pages I can make more money than I usually make all week! So I ghosted it and then kept on ghosting for him\\", Romita recalled. \\"I think it was a 1920s mobster crime story\\".Spurlock, p. 11 The work was for Marvel's 1940s forerunner, Timely Comics, which helped give Romita an opportunity to meet editor-in-chief and art director Stan Lee. Romita ghost-penciled for Zakarin on Trojan Comics' Crime-Smashers and other titles, eventually signing some \\"Zakarin and Romita\\". =Atlas Comics= Captain America #78 (Sept. 1954). Cover art by Romita. The collaboration ended in early 1951, when Romita was drafted into the U.S. Army.Romita interview, Alter Ego #9, p. 10; appears in print version only Taking the initiative prior to induction, he showed art samples to the base art director on Governors Island in New York Bay, who arranged for him to be stationed there to do layouts for recruitment posters once Romita had completed basic training at Fort Dix, New Jersey. Romita was promoted to corporal after seven or eight months; now allowed to live off the post, he rented an apartment in Brooklyn.Romita interview, Alter Ego #9, p. 11; appears in print version only When not on duty, Romita could leave the base and go into Manhattan. In mid- to late 1951, he recalled in 2002, \\"I went uptown one day for lunch. I stopped over at Stan Lee's [office in the Empire State Building, where Timely Comics had by now evolved into Atlas Comics], and his secretary came out ... and I said, 'Stan doesn't know my name but I've worked for him for over a year'. I was in uniform! She must've told him this GI ... wants to do some comics. She said, 'Stan said here's a four-page science fiction story'. I penciled it and struggled with my first inking. That was the first story I did on my own. I did Westerns and war stories then\\".The collection Marvel Visionaries: John Romita Sr. (Marvel Comics, 2005) , and former Marvel editor-in-chief Roy Thomas, in an interview with Romita in Alter Ego 9, each identify that four- page science fiction story as \\"It!\\", about a murderous alien in the guise of a baby. That story saw print in Strange Tales #4 (Dec. 1951), although the Grand Comics Database lists Romita's first identified published comic-book work as penciler and inker of the six-page story \\"The Bradshaw Boys\\" in Atlas' Western Outlaws #1 (Feb. 1951) ‚Äî published nearly a year earlier. This may refer to a ghosted Zakarin story. The Atlas Tales database lists both \\"It!\\" and the six- page \\"Out Of My Mind\\", in Astonishing #7 (also Dec. 1951), as Romita's first full penciling and inking ‚Äî although \\"It!\\" carries a later job number (9118) than the other tale (8964). Romita went on to draw a wide variety of horror comics, war comics, romance comics and other genres for Atlas. His most prominent work for the company was the short-lived 1950s revival of Timely's hit character Captain America, in Young Men #24‚Äì28 (Dec. 1953 ‚Äì July 1954) and Captain America #76‚Äì78 (May‚ÄìSept. 1954). and Additionally, Romita would render one of his first original characters, M-11 the Human Robot, in a five- page standalone science-fiction story in Menace #11 (May 1954). While not envisioned as an ongoing character, M-11 was resurrected decades later as a member of the super-hero team Agents of Atlas. He was the primary artist for one of the first series with a black star, \\"Waku, Prince of the Bantu\\" ‚Äî created by writer Don Rico and artist Ogden Whitney in the omnibus title Jungle Tales #1 (Sept. 1954). The ongoing short feature starred an African chieftain in Africa, with no regularly featured Caucasian characters. Romita succeeded Whitney with issue #2 (Nov. 1954). =DC Comics romance-comics artist= In the mid-1950s, while continuing to freelance for Atlas, Romita did uncredited work for DC Comics before transitioning to work for DC exclusively in 1958. His first known work for the company is the tentatively identified penciling credit for the cover of romance comic Secret Hearts #58 (Oct. 1959), and, confirmably, pencils for the seven-page story \\"I Know My Love\\", inked by Bernard Sachs, in Heart Throbs #63 (Jan. 1960). Other titles to which he contributed include Falling in Love, Girls' Love Stories, Girls' Romances, and Young Love. \\"I was following the DC [house] style\\", he recalled in 2002. \\"Frequently they had another artist do the first page of my stories. Eventually I became their romance cover artist\\". He would \\"swipe\\"‚Äîan artists' term for using existing work as models, a common practice among novices‚Äîfrom movie stills and from the Milton Caniff comic strip Terry and the Pirates. Bernard Sachs and Sy Barry inked some of Romita's romance work, but \\"by the late '50s and early '60s, I was inking my own stuff\\". Shortly afterward, however, romance comics began declining in popularity, and by 1965, DC had \\"stopped buying any new [romance] art\\", Romita recalled. \\"They had a large inventory of stories and continued with that and reprints. The other departments just never used me. I didn't go push myself in their face, either\\".Spurlock, p. 18 Romita's last known DC story work was the six-page \\"My Heart Tricked Me\\", inked by Sachs, in Girls' Romances #121 (Dec. 1966), though his spot illustrations, some or all of it reprints of earlier work, continued to appear on one-page \\"beauty tip\\" and other filler pages, as well as on letters pages, through early 1970, as did the occasional reprinted story. =Joining Marvel Comics= Even before his final original DC story was published, Romita had already returned to freelance for what had now become Marvel Comics. His first work for Marvel was inking Jack Kirby's cover and Don Heck's interior pencils on the superhero-team comic The Avengers #23 (Dec. 1965). Romita directed most of his efforts, however, toward finding advertising storyboard work. He obtained a position at the large ad agency BBDO through his friend Al Normandia, one of the firm's art directors. \\"They were going to pay me $250 a week. I'd made just over $200 a week with the romance [comics] but only by killing myself\\" with long hours of work. \\"It had become very hard for me to come up with new ideas. ... So I said, 'If I do any comics ... I'll do inking only. ... \\"Spurlock, p. 19 Marvel editor Stan Lee, however, had heard of Romita's leaving DC, and asked to see him. At \\"a three- hour lunch\\", Romita recalled, Lee promised to match the agency salary if Romita would come work for Marvel, and to give him flexibility to work at home or at the office on any given day at Romita's discretion.Spurlock, pp. 20‚Äì22 Though Romita felt he no longer wanted to pencil, in favor of being solely an inker, Lee soon enticed him otherwise: Romita began a brief stint on Daredevil beginning with issue #12 (Jan. 1966), initially penciling over Jack Kirby's dynamic layouts as a means of learning Marvel's storytelling house style. Sales perked; while the title had a smaller print run than Marvel flagships The Amazing Spider-Man and Fantastic Four, it briefly had the company's highest percentage of sales compared to print-run. It also proved to be a stepping-stone for Romita's signature, years-long penciling run on The Amazing Spider-Man. \\"What Stan Lee wanted was for me to do a two-part Daredevil story [issues #16‚Äì17, May‚ÄìJune 1966] with Spider-Man as a guest star, to see how I handled the character\\". =Spider-Man= The reason for the tryout was the growing estrangement between Spider-Man co-creators Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. When Ditko abruptly left Marvel after completing The Amazing Spider-Man #38 (July 1966), Lee gave Romita the assignment. This followed Romita's eight- issue Daredevil run, the cover of the subsequent issue #20 (Sept. 1966), and an incidental Hulk and two Captain America stories (in Tales to Astonish #77, March 1966, and Tales of Suspense #76‚Äì77, April‚ÄìMay 1966, respectively). While Romita's depiction of Spider-Man would eventually become the company mascot and the definitive look to the general public, the artist had trepidations: Lee later commented that this transition in Romita's style actually worked out for the benefit of the series, as it gradually weaned readers off of the Ditko look while ultimately allowing Romita to work in the style he most excelled at. Romita took over The Amazing Spider-Man with issue #39 (Aug. 1966).Manning \\"1960s\\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 36 His first inker on what would become Marvel's flagship series was Mike Esposito, who initially used the pseudonym \\"Mickey Demeo\\" to conceal from his regular employer, rival DC Comics, that he was moonlighting at Marvel. After three issues, Romita inked himself for issues #43‚Äì48 (Nov. 1966 ‚Äì May 1967), before Esposito returned ‚Äî uncredited for issue #49 (June 1967),The Amazing Spider-Man #49 (June 1967) at the Grand Comics Database then as Mickey Demeo until finally taking credit under his own name with issue #56 (Jan. 1968). Except for one issue (#65) inked by his successor, Jim Mooney, the Romita-Esposito team continued through issue #66 (Nov. 1968), establishing the new look of Spider-Man. The Amazing Spider-Man had been Marvel's second-best-selling title at the time Romita began drawing it. Within a year, it overtook Fantastic Four to become the company's top seller. Romita designed the look of Mary Jane Watson, a supporting character in the Spider- Man series who would later become the lead character's romantic interest.Manning \\"1960s\\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 37: A beautiful, fun-loving 'swinger', Mary Jane Watson wandered into Peter Parker's life, changing it forever and capturing more than her fair share of attention.\\" Romita has stated that in designing Mary Jane, he \\"used Ann-Margret from the movie Bye Bye Birdie as a guide, using her coloring, the shape of her face, her red hair and her form-fitting short skirts.\\" Mary Jane Watson made her first full appearance in The Amazing Spider-Man #42 (Nov. 1966), although she first appeared in #25 (June 1965) with her face obscured and had been mentioned since #15 (Aug. 1964). Peter David wrote in 2010 that Romita \\"made the definitive statement of his arrival by pulling Mary Jane out from behind the oversized potted plant [that blocked the readers' view of her face in issue #25] and placing her on panel in what would instantly become an iconic moment.\\" Other characters that debuted in the Lee-Romita era include the Rhino in #41 (Oct. 1966),DeFalco \\"1960s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 119: \\"The first original super-villain produced by the new Spider-Man team of Stan Lee and John Romita was the Rhino.\\" the Shocker in #46 (March 1967),DeFalco \\"1960s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 121 and the Kingpin in #50 (June 1967).DeFalco \\"1960s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 122: \\"Stan Lee wanted to create a new kind of crime boss. Someone who treated crime as if it were a business ... He pitched this idea to artist John Romita and it was Wilson Fisk who emerged in The Amazing Spider- Man #50.\\" Lee and Romita's stories focused as much on the social and college lives of the characters as they did on Spider-Man's adventures.Manning \\"1960s\\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 37: \\"[Stan Lee] knew that most readers tuned in every month for a glimpse of that side of Spider-Man's life as much as they did to see the wall-crawler battle the latest supervillain.\\" The stories became more topical, addressing issues such as the Vietnam War,Manning \\"1960s\\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 39: The Amazing Spider-Man #47 (April 1967) \\"Kraven's latest rematch with Spidey was set during a going-away party for Flash Thompson, who was facing the very real issue of the Vietnam War draft.\\" political elections,Manning \\"1960s\\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 43: The Spectacular Spider-Man #1 (July 1968) \\"Drawn by Romita and Jim Mooney, the mammoth 52-page lead story focused on corrupt politician Richard Raleigh's plot to terrorize the city.\\" and student activism.Manning \\"1960s\\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 46: The Amazing Spider-Man #68 (Jan. 1969) \\"Stan Lee tackled the issues of the day again when, with artists John Romita and Jim Mooney, he dealt with social unrest at Empire State University.\\" Romita, increasingly called upon to do art corrections and touch-ups, and to interface with artists for ever-busy editor Lee, became Marvel's de facto art director. Cutting back on his Spider-Man workload, Romita began doing only layouts, with finished pencils by Don Heck or Jim Mooney for nearly every issue for a year-and-a-half (#57‚Äì75, Feb. 1968 ‚Äì Aug. 1969). Romita then stepped back for six issues, drawing only covers while John Buscema laid out issues #76‚Äì81 (Sept. 1969 ‚Äì Feb. 1970) for others to finish.The Amazing Spider-Man (Marvel, 1963 series) at the Grand Comics Database These steps at reducing Romita's Spider-Man workload had mixed results, Romita recalled in 2001, saying, \\"Stan was always trying to speed me up. He had Don Heck pencil over my breakdowns for a while. ... Then, when Don had finished the pencils, [Lee would] call me in to fix up anything ... that he didn't like. Even after it was inked, he'd have me changing what the inker had done. I told him, 'This was supposed to save me time, but it isn't!' \\".Romita interview, Alter Ego #9, p. 30 Romita's initial run on the title, abetted by the three other artists, lasted through issue #95 (April 1971). Gil Kane succeeded him as Spider-Man's regular penciler through issue #105 (Feb. 1972). Romita then began a second stint, doing full pencils for issues #105‚Äì115 and #119 (Feb.-Dec. 1972, April 1974), and providing occasional inking and most of the cover art through issue #168 (May 1977). Romita suggested to writer Gerry Conway that supporting character Gwen Stacy should die at the hands of the Green Goblin in \\"The Night Gwen Stacy Died\\" in issue #121 (June 1973).Sanderson, Peter \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 159: \\"In June [1973], Marvel embarked on a story that would have far-reaching effects. The Amazing Spider-Man artist John Romita, Sr. suggested killing off Spider-Man's beloved Gwen Stacy in order to shake up the book's status quo.\\"Manning \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 68: \\"This story by writer Gerry Conway and penciler Gil Kane would go down in history as one of the most memorable events of Spider- Man's life.\\"David and Greenberger p. 49: \\"The idea of beloved supporting characters meeting their deaths may be standard operating procedure now but in 1973 it was unprecedented ... Gwen's death took villainy and victimhood to an entirely new level.\\" Her demise and the Goblin's apparent death one issue later formed a story arc widely considered as the most defining in the history of Spider-Man.Saffel \\"Death and the Spider\\", p. 65: \\"Death struck again, with repercussions that would ripple through comics from that day forward.\\" In his original run on The Amazing Spider-Man, Romita contributed a string of over 50 covers and an almost unbroken run of story layouts or full pencil-art for 56 issues as well as a 21-page story in The Amazing Spider-Man Annual #3 (Nov. 1966), the covers of Annuals #5‚Äì7, and the covers and stories for the two issues of the magazine-format title The Spectacular Spider-Man (July and Nov. 1968) that themselves totaled 110 story pages, the equivalent of five-and-a- half issues. Comics-art historian Daniel Herman assessed of Romita's Spider- Man work, Romita was the artist for the Spider-Man newspaper comic strip from its launch on January 3, 1977Saffel, \\"An Adventure Each Day\\", p. 116: \\"On Monday January 3, 1977, The Amazing Spider-Man comic strip made its debut in newspapers nationwide, reuniting writer Stan Lee and artist John Romita.\\" through late 1980. He continued in his role as Marvel's art director during this time, suspecting that the strip would not last. =Marvel Comics art director= After editor-in-chief and art director Stan Lee assumed the positions of publisher and president in 1972, he promoted Romita to the position of art director in July 1973 after Romita had been in that position unofficially but on staff since 1972. In that capacity through at least the late 1980s, Romita played a major role in defining the look of Marvel Comics and in designing new characters. Among the characters he designed or helped design are the Punisher,John Romita Sr., in Wolverine, Luke Cage,Sanderson \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 155: \\"In the early 1970s there was a wave of movies about African-American adventure heroes. Marvel responded to this with Luke Cage, Hero for Hire by writer Archie Goodwin and artist John Romita, Sr.\\" Bullseye, Tigra, and Brother Voodoo. In 1976, Romita did uncredited art corrections on the large-format, first DC/Marvel intercompany crossover, Superman vs. the Amazing Spider-Man, over the pencils of Ross Andru. Later that same year, Romita inked Jack Kirby's pencil work on Captain America's Bicentennial Battles, a one-shot story published in an oversized treasury format.

He drew an alternate-universe version of the Spider-Man characters in the one-shot Spidey: A Universe X Special (2001), and penciled the final four pages of the 38-page story in the milestone The Amazing Spider-Man #500 (Dec. 2003). Romita drew one of four covers to the April 27 ‚Äì May 3, 2002 issue of TV Guide. Additionally, Romita contributed to multi-artist jams in commemorative issues. He did a panel in Captain America vol. 3, #50 (Feb. 2002), starring the first Marvel superhero he had drawn; a portion of Iron Man vol. 3, #40 (May 2001), although the hero was not one of the artist's signature characters; a panel for Daredevil vol. 2, #50 (Oct. 2003); and a few pages featuring Karen Page in Daredevil vol. 2, #100 (Oct. 2007), done in the style of the romance comics he had drawn decades earlier. Romita both penciled and inked the cover of Daredevil vol. 2, #94 (Feb. 2007) in that same romance comics style. The following year he drew a variant cover of his signature series, for The Amazing Spider-Man #568 (Oct. 2008), doing so again with #642 (Nov. 2010).

He is the son of award-winning artist John Romita Sr. Early life John Romita Jr. is the son of Virginia (Bruno) and comic-book artist John Romita Sr., one of the signature Spider-Man artists since the 1960s.Ross, Alex, Introduction, in He studied advertising art and design at Farmingdale State College in East Farmingdale, New York, graduating in 1976. Career John Romita Jr.'s first contribution to Marvel Comics was at the age of 13 with the creation of the Prowler in The Amazing Spider-Man #78 (Nov. 1969). Romita Jr. began his career at Marvel UK, doing sketches for covers of reprints. His American debut was with a six-page story entitled \\"Chaos at the Coffee Bean!\\" in The Amazing Spider-Man Annual #11 (1977). Romita's early popularity began with his run on Iron Man with writer David Michelinie and artist Bob Layton which began in 1978. The creative team introduced several supporting characters, including Tony Stark's bodyguard girlfriend Bethany CabeSanderson, Peter \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 187: \\"In December [1978], co-plotters David Michelinie and Bob Layton, and penciler John Romita Jr....came up with Bethany Cabe, a highly capable professional bodyguard and a different sort of leading lady.\\" and rival industrialist Justin Hammer.Sanderson \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 189: \\"Tony Stark's billionaire nemesis Justin Hammer made his first appearance in The Invincible Iron Man #120 by writer David Michelinie and artist John Romita Jr. and Bob Layton. \\" In the early 1980s, he had his first regular run on the series The Amazing Spider-Man and also was the artist for the launch of the Dazzler series. He and writer Dennis O'Neil introduced Madame Web in The Amazing Spider-Man #210 (Nov. 1980) and Hydro-Man in issue #212 (Jan. 1981).Manning \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 118: \\"In this issue, award-winning writer Denny O'Neil, with collaborator John Romita Jr., introduced Hydro-Man.\\" In 1982, Romita Jr. drew Marvel Super Hero Contest of ChampionsDeFalco \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 208: \\"Plotted by Mark Gruenwald, Steven Grant, and Bill Mantlo, and penciled by John Romita Jr., Contest of Champions eventually saw print in June 1982\\" the first limited series published by Marvel Comics. Working with writer Roger Stern on The Amazing Spider-Man, he co-created the character Hobgoblin.Manning \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 133: \\"Writer Roger Stern and artists John Romita Jr. and John Romita Sr. introduced a new ‚Äì and frighteningly sane ‚Äì version of the [Green Goblin] concept with the debut of the Hobgoblin.\\" From 1983 to 1986 he had a run on the Uncanny X-Men with Dan Green and author Chris Claremont and co-created Forge.DeFalco \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 218: \\"A brilliant weapons inventor Forge was the man the government hired when Tony Stark stopped building munitions.\\" Romita has downplayed the significance of his run, saying that few of the characters introduced during this time were co-created by him and that his style has had no discernible influence on succeeding X-Men artists. His relationship with Claremont was rather cool at the time, as Claremont did not like his work as much as the artists he had previously worked with. He would return for a second run on Uncanny X-Men in 1993, which he said he liked better \\"because of getting to work with [writer] Scott Lobdell. Promotional art for The Amazing Spider-Man vol. 2, #43 (April 2003), by John Romita Jr. and Scott Hanna From 1988 to 1990, Romita had an extended stint on Daredevil with writer Ann Nocenti and inker Al Williamson, which included the creation of long-running Daredevil nemesis Typhoid Mary.DeFalco \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 237: \\"Mary was first introduced in Daredevil #254 by [writer] Ann Nocenti and artist John Romita Jr.\\" For Romita himself, his stint on Daredevil was most significant for being both the first time he was allowed to do full pencils instead of just breakdowns, and the first time he had a working relationship with the writer on a series. He later remarked that \\"I finally felt like I was part of the creation process for the first time while I was on DD.\\" After Daredevil #282, Romita left the series to pursue other projects. Stan Lee interviewed Romita and his father in Episode 8 of the 1991‚Äì1992 documentary series The Comic Book Greats. He worked on a host of Marvel titles during the 1990s, including a return to Iron Man for the second \\"Armor Wars\\" story arc, written by John Byrne; The Punisher War Zone;Manning, Matthew K. \\"1990s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 258: \\"The third ongoing series to star vigilante Frank Castle was The Punisher: War Zone, written by Chuck Dixon and with art by John Romita Jr. and Klaus Janson.\\" the Cable miniseries;Manning \\"1990s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 260 and the Punisher/Batman crossover.

Romita had to draw new transitional pages as the story changed formats from a 64-page graphic novel to a 144-page graphic novel to a five-issue limited series. Dan Jurgens and Romita Jr. relaunched the Thor series in July 1998Manning \\"1990s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 289: \\"Thor thundered into his new ongoing series by writer Dan Jurgens and artist John Romita Jr.\\" while a January 1999 reboot of Peter Parker: Spider-Man was handled by Howard Mackie and Romita Jr.Cowsill, Alan \\"1990s\\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 246: The second new Spidey title of the month featured a tale written by Howard Mackie and drawn by John Romita Jr.\\" In 2001, Romita returned to Spider-Man for a collaboration with writer J.

Michael Straczynski and artist John Romita Jr. took the helm in this issue to create some of the best Spider-Man stories of the decade.\\" The creative team produced a story for issue #36 (Dec. 2001) that served as memorial to the victims of the September 11 attacks.Cowsill \\"2000s\\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 265: \\"The most powerful Spider-Man comic of the year was Straczynski and Romita Jr.'s response to the horrific events of 9‚Äì11...Spider-Man's 9-11 story was a highly charged, beautifully produced tribute to the heroes and victims of the attack.\\" He drew Marvel's Wolverine with author Mark Millar. In 2004, Romita's creator-owned project The Gray Area was published by Image Comics. Romita's art has since appeared in Black Panther, The Sentry and \\"Ultimate Vision\\", a backup feature in the Ultimate Marvel line, written by Mark Millar. In 2006, Romita collaborated with writer Neil Gaiman on a seven-issue miniseries reinterpretation of Jack Kirby's characters the Eternals. Romita worked with Greg Pak on the five-issue central miniseries of Marvel's 2007 crossover storyline, \\"World War Hulk\\".Manning \\"2000s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 336: \\"Writer Greg Pak teamed up with legendary artists John Romita Jr. and Klaus Janson for the largest crossover event of 2007, World War Hulk.\\" In 2008, Romita again returned to The Amazing Spider-Man.Cowsill \\"2000s\\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 314 He also collaborated once more with Millar, for a creator-owned series, Kick- Ass, published by Marvel's Icon imprint. This was later adapted into the 2010 film Kick-Ass. Romita, one of the producers, directed an animated flashback sequence in the film. On April 9, 2011, Romita was one of 62 comics creators who appeared at the IGN stage at the Kapow! convention in London to set two Guinness World Records, the \\"Fastest Production of a Comic Book\\" and \\"Most Contributors to a Comic Book\\". With Guinness officials on hand to monitor their progress, writer Millar began work at 9 a.m. scripting a 20-page black- and-white comic book of his character Superior, with Romita and the other artists appearing on stage throughout the day to work on the pencils, inks, and lettering, each drawing a panel. The book was completed in 11 hours, 19 minutes, and 38 seconds, and was published through Icon on November 23, 2011, with all royalties being donated to Yorkhill Children's Foundation. On May 4, 2012, Romita set out to break his own record for continuous cartooning, to support the charity Candlelighters Childhood Cancer Foundation of Nevada. He attempted to continuously sketch characters and sign comics for 50 hours straight. In 2014 Romita Jr. became the penciller of the DC Comics flagship title Superman, starting with issue #32, in collaboration with writer Geoff Johns. Romita Jr.'s Superman pencils have been inked by Klaus Janson. In 2016, Romita Jr. and writer Scott Snyder collaborated on the All-Star Batman series as part of the DC Rebirth relaunch. Romita Jr. and writer Dan Abnett created The Silencer series as part of DC's \\"Dark Metal\\" line. In addition, Romita is working with Frank Miller on a Superman: Year One project. In 2020 Romita drew Kelly Sue DeConnick's story \\"Fore\\" for Detective Comics 1027th issue. =Influences and techniques = Romita's art influences include his father John Romita Sr., as well as comics artists Jack Kirby and John Buscema, the Wyeth family of painters, and illustrator Charles Dana Gibson. Having illustrated both gritty street-level stories of characters such as Spider-Man and Daredevil and cosmic stories such as those starring Thor, Romita says he prefers the former, because \\"that is where I grew up. I use the same approach to each of the different story types ‚Äì the story tells me what to do.\\" He prefers to work in the Marvel Method. He considers The Man Without Fear to be his best work, due to the strong storytelling and the quality of the story. Awards John Romita Jr. received an Inkpot Award in 1994. With writer J. Michael Straczynski and inker Scott Hanna, Romita Jr. won a 2002 Eisner Award for Best Serialized Story: The Amazing Spider-Man #30-35: ‚ÄúComing Home\\".

Lieber (; born October 26, 1931) (Scroll down) is an American comic book artist and writer best known as co-creator of the Marvel Comics superheroes Iron Man, Thor, and Ant-Man; for his long stint both writing and drawing the Marvel Western Rawhide Kid; and for illustrating the newspaper comic strip The Amazing Spider-Man from 1986 to September 2018. From 1974 to 1975, he was editor of Atlas/Seaboard Comics. Lieber is the younger brother of Marvel Comics writer, editor, and publisher Stan Lee.  Early life Larry Lieber was born in Manhattan, New York City, New York, the second child of Romanian-Jewish immigrant parents Celia (Solomon; 1898-1947) and Jack Lieber (1893-1964), and the brother of Stanley Martin Lieber, later known as Marvel Comics editor and impresario Stan Lee. When he was six months old, the family moved to The Bronx,Alter Ego interview, p. 19 of print version settling at 1720 University Avenue, which Lee described as a one-bedroom, \\"third-floor apartment facing out back\\", with him and Larry sharing a bedroom and his parents using a foldout couch. At \\"about ten-and-a-half\\", with his brother in the U.S. Army, Lieber and his parents returned to Manhattan, moving to the Washington Heights neighborhood. Already interested in art and drawing by this time, he attended George Washington High School there. Lee wrote in his autobiography that when Larry was a teenager, the boys' mother died and Lieber went to live with his brother and his sister-in-law, Joan, prompting the trio's move to Woodmere, New York, on Long Island.Lee, Mair, p. 71 Lee elsewhere described that move to a two-story, three-bedroom home at 1084 West Broadway as occurring in 1949, when Larry would have been 17 or 18. As Lieber recalled it to comics historian Daniel Best, \\"My mother died when I was 16. My brother was back from the Service, he was just married and he moved out outside of New York to Long Island. I lived with him for a while and it didn't work out so well. I wanted to leave, so I left. I was very young and I had a couple of jobs.\\"Lieber in At 17, Lieber became a messenger for The New York Times and also found work at the Times Square studio of Sam Furber, a letterer whose work included movie posters. For roughly a year and a half, he lived in the since-defunct Hotel Manhattan Towers, a residence hotel at Broadway and West 76th Street in Manhattan.Lieber, in the Alter Ego interview, p. 19, recalls the company name as Magazine Management, under which it was known by at least 1953, though the year of the company's incorporation is uncertain. Career =Early work= In 1941, Lee was made the editor of Timely Comics, the future Marvel Comics, then a division of a publishing company owned by a relative, Martin Goodman. Lieber began working for Goodman as an art assistant on the magazine side, \\"doing paste-ups. ... I was working during the day and I went to [the Pratt Institute art school, in Brooklyn, in] the evening.\\"Alter Ego interview, pp. 19-20 of print version There Lieber began illustrating comic books; his first known credit is penciling and inking the four-page story crime comics story \\"Cop on the Beat\\", by an unknown writer, in All True Crime #44 (cover-dated May 1951). In 1951, he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force, beginning four years of military service. Serving during the Korean War, he spent two of those years stationed at Okinawa, after having done his boot-camp training at the since-defunct Sampson Air Force Base, near the Finger Lakes region of New York State. = 1950s = After returning from the service, Lieber attended Manhattan's Art Students League. \\"I still wanted to be an artist and do comics, but I had in mind to eventually become an illustrator,\\" he said in 1999. \\"I was drawing, but I was slow.\\"Alter Ego interview, p. 20 of print version He again drew for his brother, editor Stan Lee, at the 1950s forerunner of Marvel Comics, known generally as Atlas Comics, though whether on staff or freelance is uncertain. Regardless, his next confirmed credit is penciling and inking the three-page story \\"A World to Conquer\\" in Journey into Unknown Worlds #52 (Dec. 1956), followed by stories in such Atlas romance comics as Love Romances, Love Tales, Stories of Romance, True Tales of Love and The Romances of Nurse Helen Grant in issues cover-dated April to August 1957 and July 1958. Because it was not standard industry practice during this time to give writer and artist credits, Lieber may have supplied more. He recalled in 1999 he had written some or all of these stories himself, \\"because I remember Stan was saying to me, 'You write romances really well.'\\"Alter Ego interview, print version only, p. 20 In 1958, following an economic downturn for the publisher and the firing of virtually all the comics staffers save Lee, \\"Stan said he wanted somebody to help him write, and he had nobody then; he was doing it all himself. I said, 'I'm not really a writer.' He said, 'Oh, I've read your letters.'\\" Lieber, by now living in the Tudor City apartment complex in Manhattan, began freelancing regularly for the nascent Marvel Comics, \\"writing stories for Jack [Kirby] to draw\\", referring to the artist who had co-created Captain America for the company in 1940 and had recently returned for a long, exclusive stint in which Kirby would co-create many signature Marvel characters in the Silver Age of Comics. At this point in the late 1950s, Kirby was drawing science fiction / fantasy stories followed by giant-monster tales in what collectors and historians call \\"pre-superhero Marvel\\" comics, primarily Journey into Mystery, Strange Tales, Tales of Suspense and Tales to Astonish. As Lieber recalled of those creature features, Lieber's earliest, tentatively confirmed pre-superhero Marvel script is for the six-page Don Heck-illustrated \\"I Am the Beast-Man\\" in Strange Tales #77 (Oct. 1960), and his first confirmed is the 13-page \\"I Led the Strange Search for Manoo\\", penciled by Kirby and inked by Dick Ayers, in Amazing Adventures #2 (July 1961).Official Index to the Marvel Universe #14 (Feb. 2010), via the Grand Comics Database =Marvel superheroes and the Rawhide Kid= Under Stan Lee plots, Lieber would go on to script the debut origin stories and other early appearances of the superheroes Thor (co-created with artist Jack Kirby) in Journey into Mystery, Iron Man (co-created with Kirby and Don Heck) in Tales of Suspense, and Ant-Man (co-created with Kirby) in Tales to Astonish. This included creating the names of their respective alter egos: Don Blake, Tony Stark, and Henry Pym. His first superhero work, the first appearance of Marvel's Thor in Journey into Mystery #83 (Aug. 1962), introduced one of the mainstays of the Marvel Universe, the mystical metal \\"uru\\", of which Thor's hammer Mjolnir is made. As Lieber recalled, \\"I kind of liked it; it was short. It's easy on the letterer; they're going to be using it all the time. I don't know where the hell I came up with it. I used to get names out of the back of the dictionary, from the biographical section where you have foreign names, Russian, this and that. I used to go to it and gets parts of names to put together.\\"Alter Ego interview, pp. 21-22 of print version As Stan Lee recalled, in his trademark jocular style, in 1974, Lieber in 1999 remembered circumstances less hyperbolically: \\"Thor was just another story. I didn't think about it at all. Stan said, 'I'm trying to make up a character,' and he gave me the plot, and he said, 'Why don't you write the story?'\\"Alter Ego interview, p. 22 of print version Under Lee's plotting, Lieber's eight Thor stories also introduced the Marvel characters Loki, Odin, and Balder, from the pantheon of Norse mythological gods; their home, Asgard; and Bifrost the Rainbow Bridge, which connected that realm to Earth. For another series, starring the Human Torch from the Fantastic Four, Lieber co-created the longstanding supervillain the Wizard in Strange Tales #102 (Nov. 1962). After the debut Iron Man story in Tales of Suspense #39 (March 1963), however, Lee replaced Lieber with Robert Bernstein, writing as \\"R. Berns\\", for the next seven issues before Lee took over the reins himself for a few stories. Don Rico, writing as \\"N. Korok\\", followed for a two-issue stint. Lee then took over as regular writer for the next few years.Tales of Suspense (I) (1959-1968) at The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators. . Lieber wrote the first nine Ant-Man stories (following the character's non-costumed introduction months earlier) in Tales to Astonish #35-43 (Sept. 1962 - May 1963) before veteran Ernie Hart did five issues, followed by Lee taking over. As Lieber explained, Lee Lieber, who credits Lee as a good editor, writer and writing teacher, said his brother made very few editorial changes to Lieber's scripts. \\"He would go over it and ... if it were in the early years, he might correct or change a line or two. But he always used it. ... I never had to, you know, go home and do it again. He was very easy, he was showing me ... and he'd make some little corrections. And as time went on, he had fewer to make.\\" Lieber largely left superheroes to write and pencil what would be his signature series, the Marvel Western Rawhide Kid, beginning with issue #41 (Aug. 1964) and continuing through 1973 (after which it became a reprint title). Lieber recalled, Lieber also penciled The Amazing Spider-Man Annual #4-5 (1967-1968), the latter introducing in flashback the late parents of protagonist Peter Parker; co-wrote and co-penciled the first solo Doctor Doom feature story, in Marvel Super-Heroes #20 (May 1969); and did occasional other work including, for Magazine Management's men's magazines, several stories of the bawdy \\"nudie-cutie\\" comedy feature \\"Pussycat\\".Per artist and Marvel mainstay Jim Mooney in With the end of his run on Rawhide Kid, Lieber found little further Marvel work. He scripted and occasionally also drew the odd Western or Sgt. Fury war-comics story or a standalone tale in one of the Marvel line of black-and-white magazines such as Vampire Tales or Haunt of Horror. \\"It wasn't a very easy period,\\" he said in 1999. \\"They needed superhero-reprint covers, and I could do them somewhat in Kirby's style.\\"Alter Ego interview, p. 27 of print version He considered seeking work at rival DC Comics, as some other Marvel writers and artists did, but found, \\"I was the only one who could never do that because that was the price for Stan being my brother. So I could never do that. ... They would have thought Stan Lee is sending over a spy or something you know. I would see what they're doing and go back or whatever the hell it was. So I couldn't do that, I couldn't work.\\" =Atlas/Seaboard and return to Marvel= In 1974, Lieber left Marvel to take on an editorship at Atlas/Seaboard Comics, the term comic book historians and collectors use to refer to the \\"Atlas Comics\\" line published by Seaboard Periodicals, to differentiate it from the 1950s Marvel Comics predecessor Atlas Comics. Marvel Comics founder and longtime publisher Martin Goodman had left Marvel in 1972, having sold the company in 1968, and launched this new company in June 1974 to go head-to-head with Marvel and DC Comics. He hired Lieber to be editor of the Atlas black-and-white comics-magazines, and additionally hired Warren Publishing veteran Jeff Rovin to edit the color comic-book line, which soon fell under Lieber's editorship.Alter Ego interview, pp. 27-28 of print version As Lieber, in a 1999 interview, described his experience as editor: When Atlas went under in late 1975, Lieber received six months severance pay and spent time trying to devise a newspaper comic strip for syndication.Alter Ego interview, p. 28 of print version Lee then offered him the editorship of Marvel UK, the New York City-based imprint that produced black-and-white reprint comics for the UK market, as well as new stories of the superhero Captain Britain.Captain Britain (Marvel UK, Marvel Comics International Ltd. imprint, 1976 Series) at the Grand Comics Database With co-scripter Gary Friedrich primarily, Lieber wrote the hero's seven-page lead feature in the weekly Captain Britain #24-37 (March 23 - June 22, 1977), and, with co-writer Jim Lawrence, Captain Britain adventures in Marvel UK's Super Spider-Man #233-246 (July 27-Oct. 26, 1977). Lieber also wrote and penciled two Spider-Man stories, in Web of Spider-Man #21 and 25 (Dec. 1986, April 1987). =Hulk and Spider-Man comic strips= In 1978, Lieber began penciling and sometimes inking the new daily and Sunday comic strip The Incredible Hulk, written by Lee and syndicated by the Register and Tribune Syndicate. He additionally began writing it in early 1979. Though he gave up the role of regular artist in Spring 1979 and the role of regular writer in mid-1982, he would still write and draw the occasional installment until the strip's end in September 1982. Lieber said Lee gave a rare compliment on the Hulk strip, telling his brother, \\"[I]t's very good. Also I think it's even more dramatic than [the] Spider-Man [comic strip]\\". In 1980 and 1981, concurrent with the Hulk strip, Lieber contributed some degree of penciling on the daily and Sunday comic strip The Amazing Spider Man until Fred Kida took over as regular penciler. Lieber then succeeded Kida on the daily strip in 1986. Lieber also penciled the Sunday page again from 1990 through at least 1995. Lieber recalled in 2007, In a 2010 interview Lieber described how he collaborates with Lee on The Amazing Spider-Man strip: \\"I get a full script. I can make certain changes, if I wish, and all that, but it's a full script, which I welcome. ... I call him every week. I reduce the pencils and I fax them. I try to finish it, but sometimes I can't, so he just sees roughs, but that is good enough for him to get the idea if I captured the scene right. Then he goes over it, and usually he will change things in the writing, and sometimes in the artwork. When he has made corrections, I have fortunately agreed with it.\\" He retired from pencilling the strip in July 2018. His final strip ran September 8, 2018. Awards Lieber was a recipient of the San Diego Comic-Con International's 2003 Inkpot Awards. In 2008, he was one of two recipients of that year's Bill Finger Award, which annually honors one living and one deceased comics creator. The award was presented July 25, 2008, during the 2008 Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards ceremony at Comic-Con International.  References   External links  *Larry Lieber at the Lambiek Comiclopedia.

It was caused by commercial rivalry. Each side attacked the other's commercial and colonial interests in various ways such as privateering and naval expeditions. In 1655, an English amphibious expedition invaded Spanish territory in the Caribbean. In 1657, England formed an alliance with France, merging the Anglo‚ÄìSpanish war with the larger Franco-Spanish War resulting in major land actions that took place in the Spanish Netherlands. Although the war was terminated after The Restoration of King Charles II of England in 1660, tensions in the Caribbean kept the conflict going intermittently for over ten years. The war officially ended with two peace treaties which were signed at Madrid in 1667 and 1670. Background When the First Anglo-Dutch War came to an end, Cromwell turned his attention to the conflict between France and Spain, both traditional rivals of England. France and Spain were both of the Roman Catholic faith, anathema to Cromwell, who believed it God's will that Protestantism should prevail in Europe. However, he considered Spain to be the greater threat to the Protestant cause, and thus pragmatically allied his nation with France. By going to war with Spain, he also sought a return to a policy of commercial opportunism pursued in the days of Elizabeth I and subsequently abandoned by her Stuart successors. Cromwell's attack on Spanish trade and treasure routes immediately recalled the exploits of Francis Drake and Walter Raleigh; and it is not by accident that printed accounts of their activities began to circulate in England at this time. There was, however, one important difference: alongside silver and gold a new treasure was becoming ever more important ‚Äì sugar. This meant occupation of territory, a step beyond the piracy pursued in Elizabethan days. During the first year of the Protectorate, Cromwell conducted negotiations with the French statesman Cardinal Mazarin, resulting in the drafting of an Anglo-French alliance against Spain in October 1655. The alliance had an added benefit: France, which was currently offering refuge to the Stuarts, would now be disinclined to assist them in reclaiming the English throne. War = Western Design = Oliver Cromwell Philip IV Meanwhile, Cromwell had already launched the Western Design against Spain's colonies in the Spanish West Indies. The fleet left Portsmouth in late December 1654 and arrived in the West Indies in January. In May 1655, an English amphibious expedition led by General at Sea William Penn, father of the founder of Pennsylvania, and General Robert Venables invaded Spanish territory in the West Indies with the objective of capturing Hispaniola. It was one of the strongest ever to sail from England, with some 3,000 marines under the command of General Robert Venables, further reinforced in Barbados, Montserrat, St. Kitts and Nevis. Although Cromwell had previously been interested in the possible acquisition of Hispaniola island, the expedition's commanders were given the freedom to determine their own priorities in the circumstances they faced on arrival. Several options were considered, including a landing on the coast of Guatemala or on Cuba. Both were discounted, as Penn and Venables decided to attempt to repeat Drake's attack on Santo Domingo on Hispaniola. However, the 1655 Siege of Santo Domingo failed because the Spanish had improved their defences in the face of Dutch attacks earlier in the century. Cromwell, on the other hand, saw the Hispaniola defeat as God's judgement. Despite various subsequent successes, the defeat made the whole operation against the Spanish West Indies a general failure. Venables and Penn were imprisoned therefore in the Tower of London on their arrival on England. Jamaica was the casus belli that resulted in the actual Anglo-Spanish War in 1655. Weakened by fever, the English force then sailed west for the Colony of Santiago (present day Jamaica), the only Spanish West Indies island that did not have new defensive works. They landed in May 1655 at a place called Santiago de la Vega, now Spanish Town. They came, and they stayed, in the face of prolonged local resistance that was reinforced by troops sent from Spain and New Spain (M√©xico). In 1657 the English Governor invited the Buccaneers to base themselves at Port Royal on Santiago, to deter the Spanish from recapturing the island. For England, Jamaica was to be the \\"dagger pointed at the heart of the Spanish Empire\\", although in fact it was a possession of little value then. Cromwell, despite all difficulties, was determined that the presence should remain, sending reinforcements and supplies. New Spanish troops, sailing from Cuba, lost the Battle of Ocho Rios in 1657 and the Battle of Rio Nuevo in 1658, failing in their attempts to retake Jamaica. Nevertheless, the fear of another invasion meant that the English Governor of Jamaica Edward D'Oyley felt his new duty was to organize the defence of the island against the Spanish. By using the tactic of attacking instead of defending, he sent out Christopher Myngs to raid Spanish colonial cities and bases. Tol√∫ and Santa Marta were among them in 1658 and the following year Cumana, Puerto Caballos and Coro were plundered and devastated and Myngs returned to Jamaica with a vast amount of plunder and treasure. =Naval War= Admiral Robert Blake In April 1656 English Admiral Robert Blake with a fleet of around forty warships, fireships and supply vessels sailed to blockade the Spanish port of Cadiz which continued throughout the summer. The Spanish remained on the defensive and took no aggressive action against the English fleet. In mid-June, Captain Edward Blagg sailed with eight ships to raid ports in northern Spain. On 24 June, Blagg raided Vigo, where a number of ships in the harbour were destroyed. While Blake replenished his water supplies on the African coast, a detachment of five frigates under a Captain Smith raided Malaga in southern Spain on 19 July. Smith sank nine Spanish ships, spiked the harbour guns and bombarded the town. A similar raid on Alicante was unsuccessful, but the threat of attack disrupted trade all along the coasts of Spain. On the evening of 8 September, one of Blake's captains, Richard Stayner, intercepted a Spanish treasure fleet and captured or sank all but two of its ships. The loss of the cargoes of the ships captured or sunk by the English was a serious blow to the economy of Spain with an estimated loss of ¬£2,000,000. For the first time in naval history, Blake kept the fleet at sea throughout an entire winter in order to maintain the blockade against Spain. In February 1657, Blake received intelligence that the plate fleet from New Spain was on its way across the Atlantic. Leaving two ships to watch Cadiz, Blake sailed from there to attack the plate fleet, which had docked at Santa Cruz on Tenerife in the Canary Islands to await an escort to Spain. In April in the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Blake completely destroyed the Spanish merchant convoy‚Äîthe West Indian Fleet‚Äîhowever, the fleet had landed the bullion before the battle. Blake was unable to seize it, but it was also unavailable to the government in Madrid. The short term effect of Blake's blockade of Spain and his victory at Santa Cruz was the disruption of the Spanish economy, which depended upon silver and gold from the Americas and thereby damaged Spain's capacity for waging war.Holberton p. 134Manganiello p. 481 The English lost 1,500 to 2,000 merchant ships to Spanish privateers and instead of using captured English ships to replace their destroyed convoys, the Spanish government placed the care of Spanish trade in the hands of neutral Dutch merchantmen.Barratt pp. 187‚Äì88 =Flanders= An Anglo-French alliance against Spain was established when the Treaty of Paris was signed in March 1657. Based on the terms of the treaty, the English would join with France in her continuing war against Spain in Flanders. France would contribute an army of 20,000 men, England would contribute both 6,000 troops and the English fleet in a campaign against the Flemish coastal fortresses of Gravelines, Dunkirk and Mardyck. It was agreed that Gravelines would be ceded to France, Dunkirk and Mardyck to England. Dunkirk, in particular, was on the Commonwealth's mind mainly because of the privateers that were causing damage to the mercantile fleet. For Cromwell and the Commonwealth, the question of possession of Dunkirk thus passed from regional diplomatic possibility to urgent political necessity. Map showing the siege of Dunkirk and the Battle of the Dunes in 1658. Also present are the blockading British fleet The combined Anglo-French army for the invasion of Flanders was commanded by the great French Marshal Turenne. The Spanish Army of Flanders was commanded by Don Juan-Jos√©, an illegitimate son of the Spanish King Philip. The Spanish army of 15,000 troops was augmented by a force of 3,000 English Royalists‚Äîformed as the nucleus of potential army for the invasion of England by Charles II, with Charles's brother James, Duke of York, among its commanders. The Commonwealth fleet blockaded Flemish ports but, to Cromwell's annoyance, the military campaign started late in the year and was subject to many delays. Marshal Turenne spent the summer of 1657 campaigning against the Spanish in Luxembourg and made no move to attack Flanders until September. Mardyck was captured on 22 September and garrisoned by Commonwealth troops. Dunkirk was besieged in May 1658. A Spanish relief force attempted to lift the siege but was defeated on 4 June at the Battle of the Dunes. The Commonwealth contingent in Turenne's army fought with distinction and impressed their French allies with a successful assault up a strongly defended sandhill 150 feet high during the battle. When Dunkirk surrendered to Turenne on 14 June, Cardinal Mazarin honoured the terms of the treaty with Cromwell and handed the port over to the Commonwealth, despite the protests of Louis XIV. The Commonwealth also honoured its obligations in respecting the rights of the Catholic populations of Mardyck and Dunkirk. A contingent of Commonwealth troops remained with Turenne's army and were instrumental in the capture of Gravelines and other Flemish towns by the French. With the privateering threat of Dunkirk out of the way, England's mercantile fleet suffered far fewer losses; not only because the Dunkirkers had lost their largest base but also because English trade had already been largely lost to the Dutch.Rommelse 2006, p. 21 =Restoration= The war between France and Spain ended with the signing of the Peace of the Pyrenees on 28 October 1659. Cromwell's death in 1658 left England in political turmoil that would result in the return of the Stuarts to the throne of England. After the Restoration of Charles II, the Anglo-Spanish War was formally terminated in September 1660 but no treaty was signed between the two nations. Charles had been allied to Spain through the Treaty of Brussels.Davenport pp. 57-59 Aftermath Portrait of King Charles II from 1665 - Charles led a covert war against Spain seeking a favourable peace England and Spain had both suffered heavy economic losses; the latter suffered mainly from Blake's blockade of Cadiz. The effect of this, particularly with the action off Cadiz and at Santa Cruz, was the disruption of the Spanish economy, which depended upon silver and gold from the Americas. This added to the difficulties of Philip's IV's overstretched armies, who for years had been campaigning simultaneously in Italy, the Pyrenees, Flanders and Portugal. The Spanish answered with a privateering campaign that all but wiped out English shipping trade.\\"Commerce was depressed because of the armed conflicts and the burden became too heavy to bear\\" .\\"The main effect of the war was to disrupt what remained of English commerce\\" . Consequently, the Dutch enjoyed a recovery from the losses they had suffered in the first Anglo-Dutch war and took much trade from the English.\\"About 1,000 English ships were lost as against some 400 captured by the English.\\" Nevertheless, with the victory of the first Anglo-Dutch war and the successes in the war against Spain, England had done enough to establish itself as one of Europe's leading naval powers. Spain demanded the return of possessions taken by Cromwell's republic, which Charles had been willing to agree to. This soon changed however as Charles had become frustrated with Philip's failure to aid in his restoration. Only a week after war had ended Charles annulled the Brussels treaty and allowed English parliament to annex England's holdings (Jamaica, Dunkirk and Mardyck) despite Spanish protests. At the same time Charles sought a treaty with Spain so that England's holdings could be recognised but the terms for Spain were too harsh and there was hope that the latter would recapture Jamaica in a military campaign. In order to increase his finances Charles sold Dunkirk to Louis XIV of France in November 1662 ‚Äì though less than ¬£300,000 of the promised half million was ever paid. =Anglo-Portuguese alliance= In 1662, Charles made a dynastic marriage with Catharine of Braganza; Tangier and Bombay were ceded to the British Crown and a military alliance was agreed to help Portugal who had been fighting to regain her independence since 1640. British troops under Frederick Schomberg were raised to serve to help fight the Spanish. Within a year the Spanish army attempted to overrun Portugal but at the crucial battle of Ameixial the Portuguese and British inflicted a crushing defeat.McMurdo pp 419-20 In 1664 England through Sir Richard Fanshawe sought to adjust a peace between the Portuguese and Spanish crowns and then between England and Spain but to no avail. At the Battle of Montes Claros a year later another Spanish invasion was decisively defeated so much so that it ended major combat operations during the war which definitively secured Portuguese independence from Spain. =Caribbean Privateers= Privateer Henry Morgan destroys the Spanish fleet on Lake Maracaibo in 1669 The war's Caribbean component raged on much longer.Pestana p. 185 With Jamaica annexed the purpose of the Western Design (although failed in its primary objective of capturing the island of Hispaniola\\"He advocated the capture of Hispaniola and Cuba as a first step, and after that, the conquest of Central America, which he considered would be completed in two years\\" .) survived the Protectorate itself, later to be revived in the raids ordered under the behest of the Jamaican governor Thomas Modyford.\\"the newly acquired Caribbean island of Jamaica would later become one of the United Kingdom's most valuable possessions for more than 150 years\\" . Modyford's pretexts for licensing the buccaneers was his suspicion that Jamaica would never be secure until the Spanish government acknowledged England's possession of Jamaica and the Cayman Islands and having it named in a treaty. The resulting privateer raids on the Spanish Main over the next ten years were devastating. Christopher Myngs raided Santiago de Cuba in 1662 and Campeche the following year. Henry Morgan later took over - his most notable attacks were on Portobello in 1668 and the defeat of a Spanish squadron on Lake Maracaibo the following year. The Spanish meanwhile could do little to protect themselves.Pestana p. 182 In response Mariana, the Queen Regent of Spain, issued letters of marque for privateer attacks on English shipping in the Caribbean. One of these privateers was the famed Portuguese pirate Manuel Ribeiro Pardal. Charles II ordered the same - so Modyford commissioned Morgan once again to raid the Spanish main in order to preserve Jamaica once and for all. In December 1670 Morgan seized the islands of Old Providence and Santa Catalina forcing the garrisons to surrender. From there his fleet sailed to Chagres and seized the fort there too - Morgan hoped to cross the Isthmus of Panama but at this time he was unaware of events in Europe. =Madrid Treaties= Spain during this time was politically, economically and militarily weak after years of war and infighting. Charles II saw ideal opportunities for two eventual peace treaties signed at Madrid, both of which were favourable to England.Davenport & Paulin pp. 98‚Äì99, 188‚Äì89 Firstly the 1667 treaty was received with great satisfaction by English statesmen and merchants in terms of trade. With Portugal's restoration secure the British Brigade was subsequently disbanded but England's holdings in the Caribbean were left unsettled. Nevertheless, it was a big step for peace between the two kingdoms.Andrien and Kuethe pp. 50‚Äì52 Three years later at the next Madrid treaty, Spain finally ceded Jamaica and the Cayman Islands to Britain which was a major concession and a humiliation for Spain. English ships were also able to roam the Caribbean Sea without hindrance and for the first time were not seen in the West Indies as intruders or as pirates. Controversially the news did not arrive in time to prevent Henry Morgan from plundering and burning Panama in 1671.

Nijinsky danced the main part himself. The music is Claude Debussy's symphonic poem Pr√©lude √† l'apr√®s-midi d'un faune. Both the music and the ballet were inspired by the poem L'Apr√®s-midi d'un faune by St√©phane Mallarm√©. The costumes and sets were designed by the painter L√©on Bakst. The style of the 12-minute ballet, in which a young faun meets several nymphs and proceeds to flirt with and chase them, was deliberately archaic. In the original scenography designed by L√©on Bakst, the dancers were presented as part of a large tableau, a staging reminiscent of an ancient Greek vase painting. They often moved across the stage in profile as if on a bas relief. The ballet was presented in bare feet and rejected classical formalism. The work had an overtly erotic subtext beneath its fa√ßade of Greek antiquity and ended with a scene of graphic sexual desire. This led to a controversial reception from both audience and critics, and the quality of the ballet was debated widely through multiple news reviews. The piece also led to the dissolution of a partnership between Nijinsky and Michel Fokine, another prominent choreographer for the Ballets Russes, due to the extensive amount of time required to train the dancers in what was then an unconventional style of dance. L'Apr√®s-midi d'un Faune is considered one of the first modern ballets and proved to be as controversial as Nijinsky's Jeux (1913) and Le Sacre du printemps (1913). Creation =Conception= The ballet was developed as a possible new production for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. Michel Fokine choreographed most of the dances that the company performed. Fokine had originally worked as a choreographer with the Imperial Russian Ballet. In addition to Fokine, all the different specialists for the new ballet company had also come from the Imperial Russian Ballet company. Initially, the Ballets Russes took advantage of the 3 months summer break when the Imperial ballet closed and its staff were free to do other things. The Ballets Russes used this time to stage their own ballets and operas in Paris. Diaghilev began looking around for an alternative to the style which Fokine customarily delivered before deciding to allow his senior male dancer, Vaslav Nijinsky, to try his hand at choreography. Menelaus intending to strike Helen is struck by her beauty instead. Louvre museum, Campana collection acquired 1861 Diaghilev, Nijinsky, and Bakst developed the original idea for The Afternoon of a Faun. The artwork on ancient Greek vases and Egyptian and Assyrian frescoes, which they viewed in the Louvre museum, was their source of inspiration. Bakst had previously worked with Vsevolod Meyerhold who was an innovative theatre producer and director that had introduced concepts like two-dimensionality, stylized postures, a narrow stage, and pauses and pacing to emphasise significant moments into his productions. Bakst, Nijinsky, and Diaghilev transferred these concepts to a ballet format in Faun.Garafola, pp. 54‚Äì55 Nijinsky's aim was to reproduce the stylised look of the ancient artworks on the stage. In his portrayal of the faun, Nijinsky managed to reproduce exactly the figure of a satyr shown on Greek vases in the Louvre.Jean-Michel Nectoux, L'Apr√®s-midi d'un faune, p. 18Ostwald p.67 =Development= Jean Cocteau, a French poet, explained the Mallarm√© poem to Nijinsky who spoke little French, and helped develop an outline for the ballet's acts. Claude Debussy's symphonic poem, Pr√©lude √† l'apr√®s-midi d'un faune, was used for the orchestral music. After the summer season in Paris, Nijinsky returned to St Petersburg for the new Russian season. There, he began work on the choreography with the help of his sister, Bronislava Nijinska, who was herself a senior dancer. Bronislava would later choreograph her own ballets for the Ballets Russes.Ostwald pp. 55‚Äì56 L√©on Bakst designed the stage setting which was more impressionist than representational. The splashes of muted greys, browns, and greens on the backcloth mirrored the fluid music, suggesting the scene rather than defining it precisely. It was hung at the line of the second wings rather than the back of the stage to deliberately narrow the performance space. The stage floorcloth was black as far back as the mound which the Faun lies upon. From there, it was green to the back of the stage. Baskt organized the lighting to emphasise the flattened look of the dance.Buckle, Nijinsky p. 238 A design by L√©on Bakst for the stage setting The dancers' costumes were designed to stand out against the muted background. Nijinsky wore a cream body suit with brown piebald patches to represent the coat of an animal. His faun costume was completed with the addition of a short tail, a belt of vine leaves, and a cap of woven golden hair surrounding two golden horns which gave the impression of a circlet. Nijinsky's ears were extended with wax to look more pronounced and pointed while his makeup was designed to make his face appear more animal. The nymphs wore white muslin that was tailored into long pleated tunics and decorated with stencilled patterns in blue or rust red. Some tunics had checkered borders and others had wavy lines or leaves. The nymphs had little makeup, except that their eyes were painted in pale pink. They wore tight wigs of golden rope which hung down in long strands. The Faun and senior nymph wore golden sandals while the rest of the dancers had bare white feet with rouged toes. =Difficulties= Vaslav Nijinsky was an exceptional dancer but not an exceptional teacher. Nijinsky's sister notes in her memoir that, throughout the development of all his ballets, he had difficulty explaining to others what he needed them to do and operated through demonstration rather than explanation. Bronislava notes that Nijinsky ignored the gap in ability between the dancers he directed and his artistic vision for the choreography. Nijinsky had difficulty accepting the limitations of others, expecting them to be able to perform as well as he could. Bronislava acted as his guinea-pig, trying out dances and positions. She describes the experience as feeling as though Nijinsky were a sculptor and she the clay which he positioned through each step. Nijinsky and his sister performed the partially developed work for Diaghilev and Bakst in St. Petersburg at the start of 1911. From the beginning, the ballet's development was kept secret until Diaghilev was ready to stage it, because he feared it would offend Fokine. The company was relying on Fokine for other ballets that were also in production, and thought that he might walk out if his position as undisputed choreographer to the company was challenged. The r√©gisseur, Grigoriev, was let into the secret in early 1912. In March of the same year, rehearsals began with other members of the company. Fokine, who now knew about the project, resented the loss of rehearsal time for his own productions. He attacked Nijinsky's incompetence at getting across his own ideas, claimed he only had the job because he was Diaghilev's lover, and announced his intention to resign which confirmed Diaghilev's fears.Parker pp. 119‚Äì121 The 12-minute ballet required 90 rehearsals. This led to the reduction of time Fokine received with the dancers which was the basis for many of his complaints. All the dancers suffered the same difficulties Bronislava had reported in trying to adapt to the strange new movements. Nijinsky's choreography felt completely unnatural to them which lengthened the time they needed for training. By this time, Nijinsky had fully devised what he wanted each dancer to do, so he could focus on training them without having to work on developing the ballet at the same time. The general view amongst the dancers was that he was mad and the ballet was doomed to failure. Even Diaghilev started to have doubts and asked Nijinsky whether there might be changes to the difficult choreography. In response to this, Nijinsky threatened to resign.Parker p. 121 Choreography Much of the movement takes place with groups of dancers passing each other in parallel lines, as if in a moving frieze. As the focus of attention passes from one group to another, dancers take a stylised pose, as might be seen on an ancient vase, and become still. The music is suggestive of a languorous summer's day in an exotic clime, and the dancers move steadily and languorously to match. The Faun locks arms with the nymph The ballet starts with the sound of a flute as the curtain rises to show the faun lying on his mound. The faun is supporting himself with his left arm while his right holds a flute to his lips. He then eats from first one and then another bunch of grapes, holding them to his face. The movements are stylised and angular, but are also suggestive of the movements of an animal. The flute music is then joined by horns and a rippling harp. As the flute tune repeats for the third time, three nymphs walk on from the left of the stage with synchronised, stylised movements. Then, two more nymphs, moving in unison but differently from the first group, join the other dancers onstage. They perform a long arabesque to music from two flutes and a harp. These instruments are joined by strings as the music progresses while a sixth nymph walks to centre stage and holds a pose before joining the pair. The six nymphs freeze when the last nymph enters with a mechanical walk across the stage as she lets her outer veils fall to reveal a short golden garment beneath. The nymphs all begin to move. The tableau on the stage consists of a group of three, a group of two, and a single nymph who either dances with the pair to balance the scene or strikes poses at variance to the pair.Buckle, Nijinsky p. 239 The faun remains motionless as the first six nymphs enter, but then he follows the progress of the last nymph with his eyes. A clarinet starts to play as his head begins to move, and he rises to his feet as a cello joins in. The six nymphs have begun to bathe the new arrival. Accompanied by an oboe, they move in and out, kneeling and rising with their elbows turned out from their sides as they keep their hands pointed at their waists or to the sky. Violins accompany an increase in tempo as the faun descends from his mound. The pair of nymphs depart to the left of the stage carrying one of the discarded veils while the first three nymphs carry off a second veil to the left. The music changes to a soulful clarinet solo. The sixth nymph who has been left isolated centre stage suddenly notices the faun behind her and runs off to the left, hands in air. The faun and the last nymph are alone on stage as the music changes with a new air of excitement from the woodwind section which builds along with the violins and the harp. The faun approaches the nymph with bursts of movement, and the two dance around each other in a standoffish courting display. He executes his only jump in the ballet across an imagined stream issuing from a waterfall shown on the backdrop. The music becomes louder as the nymph becomes more enthusiastic. It subsides again as they link arms, but she breaks away and exits flat footed to the left. The faun watches her go in disappointment before smiling, then he turns back to her discarded veil. To a solo violin backed by horns, flute, and clarinet, the faun throws back his head and bares his teeth. Laughing, he takes the veil. He examines it with great delight as the harp and the flute repeat the opening melody. leftThe woodwind brings in staccato chords as the three nymphs return from stage left to challenge the faun who falls back from their advance. The music changes with an oboe taking up the tune as the nymphs turn back offstage again with their hands in the air. The faun examines the veil, holding it in the air against his head until the cor anglais and flutes accompany the pair of nymphs as they enter from stage left. They again challenge the faun with flapping arms, and are followed by the lagging sixth nymph who dances the same challenge just as the pair turn to leave. The faun falls back, exchanging stares with the nymphs before the last nymph breaks off and she too retires. The faun is now alone. He nods his head over the veil and returns to his mound. A cello and flute carry the tune with the harp continuing in the background. The faun holds the veil to his face before spreading it on the ground and lowering his body onto it with his head tucked in and arms to his sides. Soft horns and a harp accompany a final flute passage as his body tenses and curls back, head rising, before relaxing back onto the veil.Buckle, Nijinsky, pp. 239‚Äì240 Lydia Sokolova, the first English dancer in the Ballets Russes, described Nijinsky's performance as \\"thrilling.\\" She highlighted his powerful, animalistic movements in his handling of the nymph's veil, and lauded his acting during this visceral scene.Dancing for Diaghilev, Lydia Sokolova 1960, p. 41, cited in Parker p. 125 Performances Nijinsky as the faun. Taken by Baron de Meyer who published a book of photographs of the ballet = Premiere and reaction = On 28 May 1912, an invited audience attended the dress rehearsal. There was silence as it finished. Gabriel Astruc, a French impresario who assisted Diaghilev with finance, publicity, and bookings, came on stage and announced that the ballet would be repeated. This time, there was some applause before the audience was presented champagne and caviar in the theatre foyer. The Afternoon of a Faun was premiered on 29 May at the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet in Paris. The faun was danced by Vaslav Nijinsky, senior nymph by Nelidova, and Bronislava Nijinska danced the 6th nymph. The conductor was Pierre Monteux. On the opening night, the ballet was met with a mixture of applause and booing, and again it was repeated. After the repeated performance, the audience applauded, and the sculptor, Auguste Rodin who was in the audience, stood up to cheer.Parker pp. 123‚Äì125 Commedia published a long article by its editor, Gaston de Pawlowski, where he praised the ballet and supported articles by Louis Vuillemain and Louis Schneider.Buckle, Nijinsky pp. 241‚Äì242 Vuillemain wrote that this ballet had the most pleasing acting, dancing, and music he had ever seen before.Commedia, 30 May 1912, p.2 Troisi√®me s√©rie des Ballets Russes quoted in The Ballets Russes and Beyond: Music and Dance in Belle-√âpoque Paris by Davinia Caddy, Cambridge university press pp. 72‚Äì73 Le Th√©√¢tre carried a review by Schneider where he applauded Nijinsky's ability to accurately adapt his choreography to Debussy's composition.Le Th√©√¢tre, 1 June 1912, Les Ballets Russes, pp4-9 quoted in The Ballets Russes and Beyond: Music and Dance in Belle-√âpoque Paris by Davinia Caddy, Cambridge university press pp. 72‚Äì73 A strikingly different response appeared in Le Figaro, where the editor, Gaston Calmette, also carried a front page article on the ballet. Calmette denounced the ballet after declining to publish the favourable report of his normal theatre critic, Robert Brussel.Parker p. 125 Calmette wrote that the ballet was not artful, imaginative, nor meaningful. He then goes on to criticize the choreography of the faun as being \\"filthy\\" and \\"indecent\\", which he argued deservedly incited the booing at the initial showings.Le Figaro, 30 May 1912, Un Faux Pas Gaston Calmette editorial, cited in Buckle, Nijinsky, p.242. Buckle suggests Calmette was seeking to imply Nijinsky was showing bulging genitalia when seen in profile. Calmette was much more complimentary about Nijinsky's other performances that were part of the same evening's schedule as the showing of the Faun. He applauded Nijinsky in Le Spectre de la Rose, which Michel Fokine choreographed, and said that this was the kind of ballet that should be performed for the public. Cartoon by Daniel de Losques published in Le Figaro, 30 May 1912 Diaghilev responded to Calmette by forwarding letters of support to Le Figaro which they published the following day. The painter, Odilon Redon, a friend of Mallarm√©, suggested how much the author of the original poem on which the ballet had been based would have approved: \\"more than anyone, he would have appreciated this wonderful evocation of his thoughts.\\"Le Figaro 31 May 1912, cited in Buckle, Nijinsky, p. 243 In another letter that Diaghilev submitted, Auguste Rodin wrote that Nijinsky's acting and attention to detail over the movements of his body worked wonderfully to convey the character and mind of the faun. Rodin noticed the antique forms of the frescoes and other art in Nijinsky's display. The artist expressed the feeling that Nijinsky was a sculptor's \\"ideal model.\\"Le Figaro, 31 May 1912, letter by Auguste Rodin, cited in Buckle, Nijinsky p. 243 The dispute over the ballet spread, taking on a political tone. Le Figaro was accused of attacking the Ballets Russes because they opposed France's political policy to ally with Russia, and that they represented an opening to smear all things Russian.Buckle, Nijinsky, p. 244 The Russian ambassador became involved, French politicians signed petitions, and the President and Prime Minister asked a government commission to report. The Paris police attended the second night of the ballet because of its alleged obscenity, but took no action after they saw the public's support. The ending of the ballet may have been temporarily amended to be more proper. Tickets to all performances were sold out, and Parisians clamoured to obtain them by any means.Buckle, Nijinsky, pp. 244‚Äì245 Michel Fokine claimed to be shocked by the explicit ending of Faun, despite at the same time suggesting that the idea of the faun lying down in a sexual manner on top of the nymph's veil had been plagiarised from his own ballet Tannh√§user. In this ballet, Fokine choreographed the hero to lay down in a comparable manner upon a woman. However, Fokine found some points to compliment in the ballet, including the use of pauses by the dancers where traditionally there would have been continuous movement, as well as the juxtaposition of angular choreography with the very fluid music.Buckle, Nijinsky, p. 246 Fokine's animosity to Faun is partly explainable by his own difficulties in preparing Daphnis and Chloe, which was to premiere the week following Faun but was not complete. Diaghilev tried to cancel Daphnis; instead it was postponed to 8 June. Daphnis only received two performances even though it was considered a success by critics such as Le Figaro. The company was sharply divided into two factions by the quarrel, some supporting Nijinsky and some Fokine. The final result consisted of Fokine leaving the company on bad terms with Nijinsky regardless of the fact that the partnership between Nijinsky as dancer and Fokine as choreographer had been enormously successful for them both. =Further performances by the Ballets Russes= One of the designs by Bakst for nymph costumes The Ballets Russes chose not to show Faun in the London season immediately following its Paris appearance. Instead, the company premiered L'Oiseau de feu, Narcisse, and Thamar for the first time in London. In the autumn, a German tour began at the Stadt-Theater in Cologne on 30 October before moving to the New Royal opera House in Berlin on 11 December. The Berlin programme included Faun which was performed before the Kaiser, the King of Portugal, and sundry dignitaries. Diaghilev reported to Astruc that this showing was a \\"huge success\\" which resulted in ten encores without protest.Telegram from Diaghilev to Astruc, 12 December 1912, from the Astruc papers held in New York Library, cited in Buckle, Nijinsky p. 267 Serge Gregoriev, who had just resigned from the Mariinsky Theatre to join Diaghilev full-time as stage manager, was more sanguine, reporting that \\"faun fell flat,\\" but he confirmed the overall success of the German tour.Gregoriev p. 76 In spring 1913, the ballet was performed in Vienna, where it again had a cool reception, though not so bad as Petrushka, which the orchestra of the Vienna Opera House initially refused to play because they disliked the music.Grigoriev p.78 The company returned to London, where the response was completely different and both ballets were well-received. During its first performance, there was some hissing in the audience, but the majority favoured it, and it received an encore once again. The Times described Nijinsky's performance as \\"extraordinarily expressive,\\" and complimented the ballet on its ability to appeal to the audience in a way the public had never seen a ballet do before.The Times, 18 Feb 1913, cited in Buckle, Nijinsky p. 275 Writing in the Daily Mail, music critic Richard Capell said, \\"The miracle of the thing lies with Nijinsky ‚Äì the fabulous Nijinsky, the peerless dancer, who as the faun does no dancing.\\"The Daily Mail, Richard Capell, 18 Feb 1913, cited in Buckle, Nijinsky p. 275 Capell goes on to praise his acting as well as the single leap which he deems an \\"illumination\\" of the faun's dichotomy between man and animal.Buckle, Nijinsky pp. 271, 274‚Äì275 =Later performances by other companies= In 1931, shortly after the death of Diaghilev, when some of his dancers settled in London, the Rambert Ballet took L'Apr√®s-midi d'un faune into its repertoire.Ballet Rambert: 50 years on and on. Eds Crisp C, Sainsbury A, Williams P. Scholar Press, 1976 & 1981, p27-28. Leon Woizikovsky, who had danced the faun in the last years of the Diaghilev company and whom Nijinsky taught, reproduced the ballet for Rambert's company.Rambert, Marie. Quicksilver: an autobiography. Papermac (Macmillan Publishers Ltd), London, 1983, pp. 62‚Äì63. Rambert states that she had a film of her company performing the work at that time. Rambert Ballet revived Faun for several years.Drummond, John. Part 3 : The Legacy, 1 Spreading the Word, in: Speaking of Diaghilev. Faber and Faber, London, 1997, p. 314. The reproduction met with criticism from Cyril Beaumont who commented in his book that the ballet becomes ‚Äúmeaningless, if given, as sometimes happens, without the essential nymphs.‚ÄùBeaumont, Cyril W. Complete Book of Ballets. London, Putnam, 1949, p. 798. At the Nureyev Festival at the London Coliseum in July 1983, Rudolf Nureyev danced the faun as part of a Homage to Diaghilev in a mixed bill of ballets.Programme booklet for Nureyev Festival, London Coliseum June 27 to July 23, 1983. Then, in the late 1980s, dance notation specialists Ann Hutchinson Guest and Claudia Jeschke reconstructed the ballet from Nijinsky's own notebooks, his dance notation, and the photographs of the dancers that Baron Adolph de Meyer produced shortly after the original performance of the ballet. This reconstructed version is often presented alongside Nijinsky's other works or repertoire from the Ballets Russes. Other art George Barbier, Nijinsky as the Faun, 1913 Lita Grey Chaplin notes in her memoir that the nymph dance in the dream sequence of the Charlie Chaplin film Sunnyside (1919) was a tribute to the ballet as well as to Nijinsky whom the filmmaker had met two years prior. A pastiche of the ballet forms part of the music video for Queen's 1984 single I Want to Break Free. Freddie Mercury dances the role of the faun, with dancers from the Royal Ballet also performing, including Jeremy Sheffield. This version also proved controversial in the US.

The most outstanding item of the vehicle was its wheel- steering device. A 7-gallon fuel tank was fitted, which would give a driving range of about .

In rabbinical literature, Job is called one of the prophets of the Gentiles. In Islam, Job () is also considered a prophet. Job is presented as a good and prosperous family man who is beset by Satan with God's permission with horrendous disasters that take away all that he holds dear, including his offspring, his health, and his property. He struggles to understand his situation and begins a search for the answers to his difficulties.Job 42  In the Hebrew Book of Job  Job and His Friends by Ilya Repin (1869) The Hebrew Book of Job is part of Ketuvim (\\"Writings\\") of the Jewish Bible. Not much is known about Job based on the Masoretic text of the Jewish Bible. The characters in the Book of Job consist of Job, his wife, his three friends (Bildad, Eliphaz, and Zophar), a man named Elihu, God, and angels (one of whom is named Satan). It begins with an introduction to Job's character‚Äîhe is described as a blessed man who lives righteously in the Land of Uz. The Lord's praise of Job prompts an angel with the title of \\"satan\\" (\\"accuser\\") to suggest that Job served God simply because God protected him. God removes Job's protection and gives permission to the angel to take his wealth, his children, and his physical health (but not his life). Despite his difficult circumstances, he does not curse God, but rather curses the day of his birth. And although he anguishes over his plight, he stops short of accusing God of injustice. Job's miserable earthly condition is simply God's will. In the following, Job debates with three friends concerning his condition. They argue whether it was justified, and they debate solutions to his problems. Job ultimately condemns all their counsel, beliefs, and critiques of him as false. God then appears to Job and his friends out of a whirlwind, not answering Job's central questions. Job, by staying silent before God, stresses the point that he understands that his affliction is God's will even though he despairs at not knowing why. Job appears faithful without direct knowledge of God and without demands for special attention from God, even for a cause that all others would declare to be just. And the text gives an allusion to : \\"And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding\\". God rebukes the three friends and gives them instruction for the remission of sin, followed by Job being restored to an even better condition than his former wealthy state (). Job is blessed to have seven sons, and three daughters named Jemimah (which means \\"dove\\"), Keziah (\\"cinnamon\\"), and Keren-happuch (\\"horn of eye-makeup\\"). His daughters were said to be the most beautiful women in the land.Coogan, Michael B. (2009). Job's Wife and Daughters. Oxford University Press. p. 388. In the Greek Old Testament Book of Job Job Restored to Prosperity by Laurent de La Hyre (1648) The Septuagint, an ancient Greek translation of the Hebrew Old Testament, has a revised and updated final verse that claims Job's genealogy, asserting him to be a grandson of Esau and a ruler of Edom.  In other religious texts  In addition to the Book of Job, Job is mentioned in several religious texts: ;Judaism: * He is mentioned in the Book of Ezekiel. * He is cited as someone \\"who held fast to all the ways of justice\\" in the deuterocanonical Sirach. ;Christianity: * He is praised for his perseverance in the Christian Epistle of James. * He is the protagonist of a pseudepigraphal book called the Testament of Job. ;Mormonism: * He is also mentioned in the Doctrine and Covenants, one of the four sacred texts of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). ;Islam: * He is discussed as a prophet in the Quran. ;Bah√° º√≠: *In the writings of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith: A lengthy tablet was written by Bah√°'u'll√°h, the first part of which is focused on Job. The Tablet is often referred to as the Tablet of Patience or the Tablet of Job. Job in Judaism Scroll of Book of Job, in Hebrew A clear majority of rabbis saw Job as having in fact existed as a historically factual figure. According to a minority view, Job never existed.Babylonian Talmud, Bava Batra 15a In this view, Job was a literary creation by a prophet who used this form of writing to convey a divine message. On the other hand, the Talmud (in Tractate Baba Batra 15a‚Äì16b) goes to great lengths trying to ascertain when Job actually lived, citing many opinions and interpretations by the leading sages. Job is further mentioned in the Talmud as follows: *Job's resignation to his fate.Pesachim 2b *When Job was prosperous, anyone who associated with him even to buy from him or sell to him, was blessed.Pesachim 112a *Job's reward for being generousMegillah 28a *David, Job and Ezekiel described the Torah's length without putting a number to it.Eruvin 21a *Job was in fact one of three advisors that Pharaoh consulted, prior to taking action against the increasingly multiplying Israelites in the Book of Exodus. As described in the Talmud:Sotah 11a Balaam urged Pharaoh to kill the Hebrew new-born boys; Jethro opposed this decree; and Job, though personally opposed to the decree, kept silent and did not protest it. It is for Job's silence that God subsequently punishes him with his bitter afflictions. However, the Book of Job itself contains no indication of this, and to the prophet Ezekiel, Yahweh refers to Job as a righteous man of the same calibre as Noah and Daniel.Ezekiel 14:14 Christian views Christianity accepts the Book of Job as canon in its Old Testament. In addition, Job is mentioned in the New Testament of the Christian Bible: the Epistle of James () paraphrases Job as an example of patience in suffering. Job's declaration, \\"I know that my redeemer liveth\\" (), is considered by some Christians to be a proto-Christian reference to Christ as the Redeemer, and is the basis of several Christian hymns, as well as the opening scene of Part III of Handel's Messiah. However, Jewish bible commentators and scholars point out that Job \\"insists on a divine hearing in his lifetime\\" (cf. Job 16:19‚Äì22).Cf. \\"But I know that my Vindicator lives; In the end He will testify on earth ‚Äì this , after my skin will have been peeled off.\\" (Job, 19:25 ‚Äì Vindicator, Hebrew \\"go'el\\", a person, usually a relative, who stood up for his kinsman's rights; also used of God in his relationship with Israel. He is commemorated by the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod in their Calendar of Saints on May 9, by the Roman Catholic Church on May 10, and by the Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic churches on May 6. He is also commemorated by the Armenian Apostolic Church on May 6 and December 26, and by the Coptic Orthodox Church on April 27 and August 29. Islamic views and Quranic account In the Qur'an, Job () is considered a prophet in Islam.Abdullah Yusuf Ali, The Holy Qur'an: Text, Translation and Commentary, note 2739: \\"Job (Ayub) was a prosperous man, with faith in Allah, living somewhere in the north-east corner of Arabia. He suffers from a number of calamities: his cattle are destroyed, his servants slain by the sword, and his family crushed under his roof. But he holds fast to his faith in Allah. As a further calamity he is covered with loathsome sores from head to foot. He loses his peace of mind, and he curses the day he was born. His false friends come and attribute his afflictions to sin. These \\"Job's comforters\\" are no comforters at all, and he further loses his balance of mind, but Allah recalls to him all His mercies, and he resumes his humility and gives up self- justification. He is restored to prosperity, with twice as much as he had before; his brethren and friends come back to him; he had a new family of seven sons and three fair daughters. He lived to a good old age, and saw four generations of descendants. All this is recorded in the Book of Job in the Old Testament. Of all the Hebrew writings, the Hebrew of this Book comes nearest to Arabic.\\" The narrative frame of Job's story in Islam is similar to the Hebrew Bible story but, in Islam, the emphasis is paid to Job remaining steadfast to God and there is no record of his bitterness or defiance, or mention of lengthy discussions with friends. Some Muslim commentators also spoke of Job as being the ancestor of the Romans.Brandon M. Wheeler, Historical Dictionary of Prophets in Islam and Judaism, Job, p. 171 Muslim literature also comments on Job's time and place of prophecy, saying that he came after Joseph in the prophetic series and that he preached to his own people rather than being sent to a specified community. Tradition further recounts that Job will be the leader of the group of \\"those who patiently endured\\" in Heaven.Encyclopedia of Islam, A. Jefferey, Ayyub Philip K. Hitti asserted that the subject was an Arab and the setting was Northern Arabia.Hitti, Philip K. (1970). History of the Arabs: From the earliest time to the present. London: Macmillan Education LTD, 10th edition. pp. 42-43. ISBN 0-333-06152-7 Internet Archives website The Qur'an mentions Job's narrative in a concise manner. Similar to the Hebrew Bible narrative, Islamic tradition mentions that Satan heard the angels of God speak of Job as being the most faithful man of his generation.Ibn Kathir, Stories of the Prophets, The Story of the Prophet Job Job, being a chosen prophet of God, would remain committed in daily prayer and would frequently call to God, thanking God for blessing him with abundant wealth and a large family. But Satan planned to turn the God-fearing Job away from God and wanted Job to fall into disbelief and corruption. Therefore, God allowed Satan to afflict Job with distress and intense illness and suffering, as God knew that Job would never turn away from his Lord. The Qur'an describes Job as a righteous servant of Allah (God), who was afflicted by suffering for a lengthy period of time. However, it clearly states that Job never lost faith in God and forever called to God in prayer, asking him to remove his affliction: The narrative goes on to state that after many years of suffering, God ordered Job to \\"Strike with thy foot!\\". At once, Job struck the ground with his foot and God caused a cool spring of water to gush forth from the Earth, from which Job could replenish himself. The Qur'an says that it was then that God removed his pain and suffering and He returned Job's family to him, blessed him with many generations of descendants and granted him great wealth. In addition to the brief descriptions of Job's narrative, the Qur'an further mentions Job twice in the lists of those whom God had given special guidance, wisdom and inspiration (IV: 163) and as one of the men who received authority, the Book and the gift of prophethood (VI:84). Local traditions regarding Job An outer view of the Druze shrine of Prophet Job in Lebanon The tomb of Job, outside Salalah, Oman There are at least two locations that claim to be the place of Job's ordeal, and at least three that claim to have his tomb. The Ey√ºp Sultan Mosque in Istanbul, Turkey, holds the tomb of Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, a companion of Muhammad, not the Biblical/Qur'anic Job (Ayyub in Arabic, Ey√ºp in Turkish), though some locals tend to conflate the two. =Israel and Palestine= In Palestinian folk tradition, Job's place of trial is Al-Jura, or Al-Joura, a village outside the town of Al-Majdal (today's Ashkelon, Israel). It was there God rewarded him with a fountain of youth that removed whatever illnesses he had, and gave him back his youth. To the northwest of the depopulated Palestinian village of Dayr Ayyub is an area which, according to the village belief, contained the tomb of the prophet Ayyub, the Biblical Job.W. Khalidi, 1992, \\"All that remains\\", p. 376 In the area of Tabgha (Greek: Heptapegon), on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, a few sites are associated by local tradition with the life of Ayyub. A small grotto near the base of what is known to Christians as the Mount of Beatitudes, or Mount Eremos, is known as Mghraret Ayub (\\"Job's Cave\\"). Two of the towers built in the Byzantine period to collect the water of the Heptapegon springs are named in Arabic Tannur Ayub (\\"Job's Kiln\\") and Hammam Ayyub (\\"Job's Bath\\").[Stefano De Luca, Capernaum, paragraph on Tabgha, in The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Bible and Archaeology, vol. 1, p. 179, New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 2013] Hammam Ayyub was initially called \\"the Leper's Bath\\", but the leper was later identified with Job; the nearby spring, now a waterfall, is known as Ain Ayub, \\"Job's Spring\\".Bargil Pixner OSB, [www.hagia- maria-sion.net/gemeinschaft/rundbr/rundbr21/rb21barg.html Arch√§ologie: Das Bad des Auss√§tzigen in Tabgha] (Archaeology: the Leper's Bath in Tabgha), Dormition Abbey, 21st newsletter, January 2002 (in German)Eretz Magazine, Sermon Valley, accessed 10 December 2018 =Hauran, Syria= The town of al- Shaykh Saad in the Hauran region in Syria has been associated with Job since at least the 4th-century AD. Karnein was mentioned in Eusebius' Onomasticon as a town of Bashan that was said to be the location of the house of Job. Egeria the pilgrim relates that a church was built over the place in March or February 384 AD, and that the place was known as the \\"town of Job\\", or \\"civitas Job.\\" According to Egeria's account the body of Job was laid in a stone coffin below the altar.Pringle, 1998, p. 239. According to tradition, Hammam Ayyub is a fountain in the town where Job washed himself when he was sick, and is reputed to have healing powers.Schumacher; Oliphant; le Strange, 1886, p. 194. Another holy artifact in the town is the \\"Rock of Job,\\" known in local folklore as the place where he sat when he was afflicted with the disease.Schumacher; Oliphant; le Strange, 1886, p. 191. =Adma', Upper Mesopotamia= The city of Urfa (ancient Adma', later Edessa) in the ≈ûanlƒ±urfa Province, or Harran region of southeastern Turkey, also claims to be the location at which Job underwent his ordeal in a cave. The location boasts an Ottoman-style mosque and madrasa that runs as shops today. A well exists within the complex, said to be the one formed when he struck the ground with his foot as described in the Quran. The water is considered to be miraculously curing.

The group was formed around 1965. Adams disbanded the group for a time, and they reformed in 1967. It is known for its live performances, containing a high degree of spontaneity and levity, and blending rock, pop, jazz, blues and Tin Pan Alley styles. Its current membership comprises the quartet of pianist Adams, bassist Casey McDonough, guitarist Scott Ligon, and drummer John Perrin. Some of the more notable members in the band's long history are singer, writer and bassist Joey Spampinato, guitarists Al Anderson and Johnny Spampinato; drummers Tom Staley and Tom Ardolino; and vocalist Frank Gadler. The abbreviation \\"NRBQ\\" stands for New Rhythm and Blues Quartet (originally Quintet). History NRBQ began in late 1965 as a rehearsal band in the Shively, Kentucky home of brothers Terry and Donn Adams, and appeared on stage for the first time in 1966. Along with drummer Charlie Craig, they made home tapes of their experiments. The first known reference to the band's name can be heard on one of these home tapes, with Donn announcing, \\"Here they are, the New Rhythm and Blues Quintet!\\" as though presenting them to a live audience. In late spring of 1966, guitarist Steve Ferguson was invited to join NRBQ after he quit Mersey- Beats USA (no relation to the Liverpool group who recorded \\"I Stand Accused\\"). He'd met Adams when the latter briefly joined Mersey-Beats USA to fill in for the regular keyboard player. After playing a few live dates in Louisville, Jimmy Orten (Soul Inc) was recruited on bass and vocals and the band left for Florida in late 1966. In Miami, early January 1967, NRBQ played six nights at The Cheetah. Soon after, Orten and Ferguson returned to Louisville. Adams stayed behind and joined The Seven of Us, a band that was playing the same club. By August, the NRBQ was Adams (keyboards), Ferguson (guitar), Spampinato (bass) and Frank Gadler (vocals) from The Seven of Us, and Tom Staley (drums). In December 1968, they began recording with Eddie Kramer at the Record Plant and by early 1969 were signed to a two-record deal with Columbia Records. Their self-titled debut album was released that year, with songs by both Eddie Cochran and Sun Ra, and a number of similarly wide-ranging original songs. The following year, the group collaborated with rockabilly legend Carl Perkins on an album titled Boppin' the Blues. Over the next three years, the band experienced personnel shifts, with the departure of Ferguson (replaced for one year by Ken Sheehan), Gadler, and Staley, and the arrival of two new members: guitarist/singer Al Anderson formerly of The Wildweeds, known for the Connecticut and Massachusetts regional hit \\"No Good To Cry\\", and drummer Tom Ardolino. The Adams/Spampinato/Anderson/Ardolino quartet stayed together longer than any other incarnation of the band (20 years, from 1974 until 1994), and was often augmented by the Whole Wheat Horns (Donn Adams, Keith Spring and others). Starting in September of 1989 NRBQ opened for R.E.M. on the \\"Acronym Tour\\" with the first concert taking place on the 27th at the University of Dayton Arena. The last stop on the tour was at the Shoreline Amphitheater at Mountain View in Mountain View, CA on October 21st. Rolling Stone's Sam Freedman noted that the NRBQ played what would be a compressed to 30 minute club show. He also reported that both Mike Mills and Peter Buck of R.E.M. watched each of the NRBQ's opening sets during their portion of the tour from the edge of the stage \\"as if to endorse NRBQ for their fans\\". In 1994 Anderson departed the group to become an award-winning Nashville songwriter for many country-western acts. He was replaced in NRBQ by Joey Spampinato's younger brother, Johnny Spampinato, who was (and still is) a member of power-pop band The Incredible Casuals. On April 30 and May 1 of 2004, the group celebrated its 35th anniversary with concerts at the Calvin Theater in Northampton, Massachusetts. The shows featured every former and current member of the band, as Ferguson, Gadler, Staley, Sheehan and Anderson came back for a NRBQ reunion. Hiatus and return NRBQ at Jim Porter's Good Time Emporium, Louisville, KY, October 24, 2014 Left to right: Bobby Lloyd Hicks, Terry Adams, Casey McDonough and Scott Ligon After the Halloween engagement at Shank Hall in Milwaukee in 2004, NRBQ went on hiatus. Adams had developed stage 4 throat cancer. During this time, Ardolino and the Spampinato brothers started playing shows as a trio, under the name \\"Baby Macaroni\\" and as the \\"Spaminato Bros.\\". After a number of months, Adams recovered well enough to tour with former drummer Staley and Japanese rockabilly group the Hot Shots. In June 2006, Adams and Ferguson released the album Louisville Sluggers (with Ardolino on drums, Pete Toigo on bass and other supporting musicians), and this album's lineup performed some live shows in the U.S. and Japan as \\"The Terry Adams - Steve Ferguson Quartet\\" and \\"Rock & Roll Summit Meeting.\\" Also in September 2006 came the release of a SpongeBob SquarePants album, The Best Day Ever, which included backing music by all four NRBQ members, as well as Anderson. The album, a collection of '60s-influenced pop/rock produced by Andy Paley, and co-written by Paley and the voice of SpongeBob, Tom Kenny, also included such musical luminaries as Brian Wilson, Tommy Ramone, James Burton, Flaco Jim√©nez and Philadelphia DJ Jerry \\"The Geator\\" Blavat. At some point in November 2007, Adams formed \\"The Terry Adams Rock & Roll Quartet\\" with Scott Ligon on guitar and vocals, Pete Donnelly (of The Figgs) on bass and Conrad Choucroun and Ardolino on drums. In March 2011, Adams posted an open letter to fans announcing that with the release of the upcoming album \\"Keep This Love Goin\\", this lineup would take on the NRBQ name. He also explained that while he did have tendonitis, the real reason for the hiatus was his treatment for cancer. In May 2012, the group released a live album, We Travel the Spaceways, on Clang! records. During September 2012, bassist Donnelly was replaced by Casey McDonough. In July 2013, NRBQ toured with drummer Joe Camarillo of The Waco Brothers and Hushdrops, where he recorded two songs on the Brass Tacks album: \\"Greetings from Delaware\\" and \\"I'm Not Here\\". Bobby Lloyd Hicks became the drummer from 2013 to 2015. He played on \\"Love In Outer Space\\" and \\"Let Go\\" from the 5 CD box set High Noon. John Perrin became the drummer in 2015. Reunion shows On April 27 and 28 of 2007, NRBQ gave a pair of \\"38th Anniversary\\" performances in Northampton, Massachusetts, the first public NRBQ shows since 2004. Both Anderson and Johnny Spampinato appeared in the lineup, along with \\"Whole Wheat Horns\\" Donn Adams and Jim Bob Hoke, and unannounced guest appearances by John Sebastian, original NRBQ drummer Staley and the band's former road manager Klem Klimek on saxophone. Gadler, former lead vocalist, also appeared. Style and influence The band's music is a blend of styles from rockabilly to Beatles-influenced pop to Thelonious Monk-inspired jazz. They have attracted fans as diverse as Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney, Elvis Costello, Keith Richards, The Replacements, John Sebastian, Dave Edmunds, Ira Kaplan and Penn & Teller.. NRBQ songs have been performed by Bonnie Raitt, Los Lobos, and Dave Edmunds among others. Also, the group served as the unofficial \\"house band\\" for The Simpsons for the season 10-12 period in which NRBQ fan Mike Scully was head writer and executive producer. NRBQ allowed several of their songs to be used on The Simpsons, including \\"Mayonnaise and Marmalade\\", written specifically for the show. The band also appeared in animated form and on camera during the end credits to perform the show's theme song during the episode \\"Take My Wife, Sleaze\\" and to perform Edmunds's cover of \\"Me & The Boys\\". The band also recorded a song entitled \\"Birdman\\" for an episode of Space Ghost Coast to Coast entitled \\"Pilot\\". The group appeared in feature films, including Day of the Dead, Shakes the Clown, and 28 Days. Their cover version of \\"Down in My Heart\\" appeared in the series finale of Wilfred. NRBQ has a following from years of live shows. The band has been known to perform without a set list which makes the band, in the words of AllMusic's Mark Deming, \\"a stellar and wildly unpredictable live act.\\" In addition to its own compositions, the band performs a broad range of cover material and audience requests. In their nearly 50-year history, NRBQ's records have been released by many record companies, including Columbia Records, Kama Sutra Records, Mercury Records, Virgin Records, Rhino Entertainment, Rounder Records, and more. Their song \\"Get That Gasoline Blues\\" (on Kama Sutra) reached No. 70 in 1974 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Over the years, the group played sets while wearing pajamas, hired professional wrestler \\"Captain\\" Lou Albano as its manager (for whom they penned a song in tribute), and exploded Cabbage Patch Dolls on stage.  Deaths  Steve Ferguson died of cancer on October 7, 2009. Tom Ardolino died on January 6, 2012, following a long illness. Bobby Lloyd Hicks died of bronchiectasis on February 20, 2017.

Sussex is located in south central New Brunswick, between the province's three largest cities, Saint John, Moncton, and Fredericton. Sussex straddles the Kennebecasis River, northeast of Saint John, and is a major dairy product producer in the province. It is home to Atlantic Canada's largest hot air balloon festival. Sussex is also known as Cow Town, Suss Town, Dairy Town and the Mural Capital of Atlantic Canada. History In 1857 the European and North American Railway was opened, connecting the farming communities of the Kennebecasis River valley with Saint John and Moncton. Sussex was incorporated in accordance with Chapter 44 of the Town Incorporation Act of 1896 and was officially established as a Town on June 2, 1904. The settlers were for the most part British Loyalists who had fled the American Revolution in 1776, with many Irish refugees of the Great Famine from the mid-19th century settling in the nearby farming communities. In 1885, the Sussex Military Camp was established on the eastern edge of the town. The facility was closed following the Second World War and the town purchased the land to expand the municipal boundaries. Today the agricultural exhibition and some areas remain as open land on the former site of Camp Sussex. Sussex underwent several changes in the post-war period. In the early 1960s, several local roads were upgraded as part of the Trans-Canada Highway project which saw Route 2 pass immediately north of the town between Fredericton and Moncton. At the same time, a series of local roads in the Kennebecasis River valley were designated as Route 1, running from an interchange with the Trans- Canada at Sussex, southwest to Saint John. The creation of Sussex as a highway interchange in this post-war period led to some transportation planners in New Brunswick calling for the consolidation or closure of the Fredericton, Saint John and Moncton airports to be replaced by a single airport located in Sussex to serve all three population centres of southern New Brunswick; this being in the late 1950s/early 1960s before these facilities underwent considerable expansion. Sussex is still considered the best strategically located town, being in the centre of what has been called New Brunswick's \\"Golden Triangle\\". Potash was subsequently discovered in large quantities in the area surrounding Sussex, with the deposit being the second largest in the world after an area in Saskatchewan. Three mines were built near the town, two at Penobsquis, to the east, and another at Cassidy Lake (no longer operational), to the southwest. CN Rail built track to serve both mines, which employed hundreds from the surrounding area. Since 2003, natural gas has been produced from the McCully field near Sussex.Corridor Resources Inc., McCully Field, Accessed 11-Aug-2010. Recent drops of the potash market combined with underground structural issues caused the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan to close its Penobsquis/Picadilly mining operation in 2018. The former CN rail station in Sussex now houses the 8th Canadian Hussars Museum and Sullys ice cream parlor. Sussex also began to see a growing tourism trade, with many flocking to see the collection of wood-constructed covered bridges throughout the central area of Kings County. As the heart of Kings County with its 16 covered bridges, Sussex is known as the Covered Bridge Capital of Atlantic Canada. Eight of these wooden structures are within a ten-minute drive of town hall. An agricultural fair draws visitors each August (marking 113 years in 2008), as well as the establishment of southern New Brunswick's only alpine ski hill in the Caledonia Mountains southeast of the town at Poley Mountain. 26 murals were created during the summers of 2006 and 2007, establishing its reputation as the Mural Capital of Atlantic Canada. An international hot air balloon festival is held every September, and Canada's largest outdoor flea market each August. The town entered economic difficulty during the late 1990s after the Cassidy Lake potash mine flooded, resulting in hundreds of lay-offs. Another significant blow came in October 2002 with a realignment of the Trans- Canada Highway (Route 2) between Fredericton and Moncton which no longer passed through Sussex, instead carrying the province's east-west interprovincial traffic north of the town. At the same time, Route 1 was extended east on the old Trans-Canada alignment to an interchange at River Glade near Petitcodiac and Route 10 was extended on the old Trans-Canada from an interchange with the new Route 2 alignment at Young's Cove Road south to Sussex. Today, Sussex is primarily a regional service centre for the surrounding agricultural communities of the upper Kennebecasis River valley, as well as a highway service centre on Route 1, the primary highway between Moncton and Saint John, as well as being the most heavily travelled route in the Maritimes to the United States. Sussex is also home to Kingswood University (formerly Bethany Bible College), the only college in Canada owned by the Wesleyan Church. The town is home to Sussex Golden Ginger Ale, a maritime beverage. Sussex claims to be the birthplace of the ice cream cone. Sussex titles itself as the Dairy Capital of New Brunswick. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II visited the town as part of her Golden Jubilee tour of Canada. On October 12, 2002, she attended the opening of a new wing of Sussex Elementary School, unveiling a commemorative plaque at the event. She then visited Princess Louise Park for an agricultural exhibition. While there, it was announced that the community hall would be renamed Jubilee Hall in her honour. Both appearances drew thousands of visitors from Sussex and beyond.Government of New Brunswick.

On the weekend after Labour Day, Sussex hosts up to 35,000 visitors who come to watch 40 hot air balloons. Along with the twice-daily flights, the event includes a giant craft fair, a free outdoor concert and an amusement park. the festival has been held since 1985.Town of Sussex Some residents of Sussex wake up early to get a look at the balloons, with some going \\"balloon chasing\\" and assisting in the taking down of balloons. Princess Louise Park Show Centre The Princess Louise Park Show Centre is Eastern Canada's premier Agricultural Exhibition Center. Located in Sussex, this facility is the host of many shows that include equine, dogs, livestock, sales and exhibitions as well as 4H and youth group activities. It is known as the heart of Canada's picture province (New Brunswick). Princess Louise Park Show Centre is a board owned and operated exhibition ground that was founded in 1985. It hosts shows attracting people from all over the county, province, and country. There are many owners and sponsors of this facility, a summer staff and a year-round general manager. There is also an alternate purpose for the facility during the winter months; it doubles as a storage facility for RVs and trailers. The centre has five barns with stalls, three riding rings, and electrical and sewage hookups. The facility is one of the most advanced exhibition grounds in Atlantic Canada. Sussex Regional High School Sussex Regional High School is a Canadian secondary school that offers classes from grades 9 through 12 to the greater Sussex region and its surrounding municipalities. The school has a capacity of over 1,000 students and houses industrial, science and business labs, as well as a first-class theatrical complex and a library, gymnasium and soccer pitch. Demography Most people in Sussex have some Scottish, French, English, or Irish ancestry. There are smaller groups of German and Dutch lineage. The town is almost universally anglophone, being in the heart of English-speaking southern New Brunswick.

He is considered the father of medical neurology, and he discovered causalgia (complex regional pain syndrome) and erythromelalgia, and pioneered the rest cure. Biography Silas Weir Mitchell was born on February 15, 1829, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to John Kearsley Mitchell and Sarah Henry Mitchell. He studied at Philadelphia's renowned University of Pennsylvania and later earned the degree of MD at the city's Jefferson Medical College in 1850. During the Civil War, he was director of treatment of nervous injuries and maladies at Turners Lane Hospital, Philadelphia, and at the close of the war became a specialist in neurology. In this field Mitchell pioneered the rest cure for diseases now termed \\"psychiatric\\", particularly neurasthenia and hysteria, subsequently taken up by the medical world. The treatment consisted primarily in isolation, confinement to bed, dieting, electrotherapy and massage; and was popularly known as 'Dr Diet and Dr Quiet'. Mitchell advocated a high-fat diet to his patients.Morris, David B. (1991). The Culture of Pain. University of California Press. p. 113. Foxcroft, Louise. (2012). Calories & Corsets: A History of Dieting Over 2, 000 Years. Profile Books. p. 99. He believed that a diet rich in fat would \\"fatten and redden\\" his patients, leading to a cure. To achieve this, large quantities of milk were prescribed. He requested his patients to consume two quarts or more milk a day.Adams, Henry. (2005). Eakins Revealed: The Secret Life of an American Artist. Oxford University Press. p. 460. His medical texts include Injuries of Nerves and Their Consequences (1872) and Fat and Blood (1877). Mitchell's disease (erythromelalgia) is named after him. He also coined the term phantom limb during his study of an amputee. Mitchell discovered and treated causalgia (today known as CRPS/RSD), a condition most often encountered by hand surgeons. Mitchell is considered the father of medical neurology and a pioneer of \\"evidence-based\\" or \\"scientific\\" medicine. He was also a psychiatrist, toxicologist, author, poet, and celebrity in Europe as well as America. His contemporaries considered him a genius no less than Benjamin Franklin. In 1866, he published a short story in the Atlantic Monthly resting upon both somatic and psychological insights entitled \\"The Case of George Dedlow\\". From that point onward, Mitchell divided his attention between scientific and literary pursuits. In the former field, he produced monographs on rattlesnake venom, intellectual hygiene, injuries to the nerves, neurasthenia, nervous diseases of women, the effects of gunshot wounds upon the nervous system, and relations between nurse, physician, and patient; in the latter, he wrote juvenile stories, several volumes of respectable verse (The Hill of Stones and Other Poems was published in 1883 by Houghton, Mifflin and Co.), and prose fiction of varying merit, which earned him a leading place among American authors at the close of the 19th century. His historical novels in particular, notably Hugh Wynne (1897), The Adventures of Fran√ßois (1898), The Youth of Washington (1904), and The Red City (1909), are among the best of their genre. He died on January 4, 1914 in Philadelphia and is interred at The Woodlands Cemetery. Prominent patients He was Charlotte Perkins Gilman's doctor and his use of a rest cure on her provided the idea for \\"The Yellow Wallpaper\\", a short story in which the narrator is driven insane by this treatment. His treatment was also used on Virginia Woolf, who wrote a savage satire of it in her novel Mrs. Dalloway (1925): \\"you invoke proportion; order rest in bed; rest in solitude; silence and rest; rest without friends, without books, without messages; six months rest; until a man who went in weighing seven stone six comes out weighing twelve\\". =Influence on Freud= Sigmund Freud reviewed Mitchell's book on The Treatment of Certain Forms of Neurasthenia and Hysteria in 1887; and used electrotherapy in his work into the 1890s. Freud also adopted Mitchell's use of physical relaxation as an adjunct to therapy, which arguably led to the institutionalization of the psychoanalytic couch.Ellenberger, p. 518. Honors and recognition Mitchell's eminence in science and letters was recognized by honorary degrees conferred upon him by several universities at home and abroad and by membership, honorary or active, in many American and foreign learned societies. In 1887 he was president of the Association of American Physicians and in 1908‚Äì09 president of the American Neurological Association. The American Academy of Neurology award for young researchers, the S. Weir Mitchell Award, is named for him.American Academy of Neurology: S. Weir Mitchell award Crotalus mitchellii, the speckled rattlesnake, was named after Mitchell.

Art patron He was a friend and patron of the artist Thomas Eakins, and owned the painting Whistling for Plover. The Philadelphia Chippendale chairs seen in several Eakins paintings ‚Äì such as William Rush Carving his Allegorical Figure of Schuylkill River (1877) and the bas-relief Knitting (1883) ‚Äì were borrowed from Mitchell. Following Eakins's 1886 forced resignation from the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Mitchell may have recommended the artist's trip to the Badlands of South Dakota. The artist John Singer Sargent painted two portraits of Mitchell: one is in the collection of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia; the other, commissioned by the Mutual Assurance Company of Philadelphia in 1902, was recently sold (see External Links, below). The sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens modeled an 1884 bronze portrait plaque of Mitchell.Silas Weir Mitchell by Saint-Gaudens from Smithsonian Institution. Mitchell commissioned Saint- Gaudens to create a monument to his deceased daughter Maria: The Angel of Purity, a white marble version of the sculptor's Amor Caritas. Originally installed in Saint Stephen's Church, Philadelphia, it is now at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

Ghost story Some time during the late 1800s, a ghost story was published about Dr. Mitchell that he was never able to lay to rest. The story tells how a very young girl in rags and threadbare shawl came to his door in bad weather and begged him to come take care of her sick mother. The girl guided Mitchell to the sick woman, who turned out to be a former house servant of his who was suffering from pneumonia. Mitchell helped the woman, then congratulated her on having such a fine daughter, but the woman told him her daughter died a month earlier. In a cupboard, Mitchell found the shawl the girl had been wearing; it had not been worn out that night. A 2011 study determined that the ghost story was likely originally told by Mitchell himself as entertainment at a medical meeting, then took on a life of its own. In his 1910 book \\"Characteristics,\\" Mitchell wrote about a man who told a story \\"about a little dead child who rang up a doctor one night, and took him to see her dying mother;\\" the man was then constantly bothered by believers and disbelievers, and unable to stop the story. In context, it seems that Mitchell was referring to himself.Dr. S. Weir Mitchell's Strange Encounter by Garth Haslam, from the Anomalies website. \\"The Yellow Wallpaper\\" Charlotte Perkins Gilman claimed her short story \\"The Yellow Wallpaper\\" was directed at Mitchell that he might reconsider the rest cure.

This change also coincided with a reorganization of the company. Originally the company manufactured a two-stroke four-cylinder 50hp model, later upsized to 6.8 liters and still rated at 50 hp. In 1910, three open-roof models and two enclosed models were offered, costing up to $5,400; the newly introduced 30/50 hp Toy Tonneau, a long, sleek four-door touring car, sold for $4,300. The Amplex's most distinctive feature was its valveless motor, which the company claimed would offer more continuous pulling power and greater reliability. The 1910 models also offered self-starting, a feature that would not be available from major competitors, such as Cadillac, for another year or two.Floyd Clymer, Historical Motor Scrapbook Number Four, (1952), p.80 They were expensive cars - large, luxurious and handsomely designed, a limousine being offered at as much as $5,600. Yet the firm kept using the two-stroke engine after it had become obsolete; a four-stroke was offered unsuccessfully in 1913. Gillette Motor Co took over the Amplex manufacturing facilities in 1916, but refused to manufacture conventional engine-valving, persisting with a rotary sleeve valve engine.

It was owned by Foxtel and operates out of their Melbourne based studios. From 2002 - 2006 it was available on Foxtel, Austar, Optus Television, TransTV and Neighbourhood Cable until transmission ceased on 1 October 2006. The channel was revived as Fox Footy for the 2012 AFL season after a new broadcast agreement was reached between Fox Sports and the AFL. History The channel was created in 2002 after News Limited won the television broadcast rights to the AFL for the 2002 to 2006 seasons. It granted free to air rights to the Nine Network and Network Ten and granted the subscription rights to Foxtel. Fox Footy was originally offered by Foxtel for an additional subscription during the first two seasons of the rights agreement; however, it was moved to the Basic package in February 2004, making it available to all Foxtel subscribers without additional charge for the balance of its life.Fox Footy package is free for a price. From The Age online, 4 January 2004. Retrieved 31 October 2007. Due to broadcasting rights, each state had a separate version of the channel to allow free-to-air right holders exclusive live coverage. For example, if Channel Nine or Channel Ten broadcast a match between the Adelaide Crows and Sydney Swans live in Adelaide, Fox Footy would have been prevented from showing the match live, whereas if Nine or Ten didn't broadcast it in Melbourne, Fox Footy would be allowed to show it live there. Fox Footy typically repeated all matches after they were played, although often with the commentary of the free-to-air network that presented it live originally. Fox Footy only broadcast the AFL and not any state football leagues such as SANFL, WAFL or VFL. =End of the channel= The future of the channel was placed in doubt after the Seven Network and Network Ten were awarded the AFL rights from 2007 to 2011. On 23 August 2006, Foxtel announced the Fox Footy Channel would cease broadcasting at the conclusion of the current AFL season and be replaced with Fox Sports 3. Foxtel CEO Kim Williams stated \\"It's not financially viable to continue operating a 24-hour-a-day (Australian rules) football channel when we can only get three live games a week and not on the terms we have sought.\\" The channel ended after a replay of the 2006 AFL Grand Final at 4.00am. Seven and Ten later came to terms with Foxtel and four games per round will be shown on pay- TV through the Fox Sports channels. =Revival= It was announced on 28 April 2011 that the channel will be revived for the 2012 AFL season. The channel returned exclusively on Foxtel and its broadcasting partners, under the proposed new name of Fox Sports AFL, which was later changed back to its original name Fox Footy. The channel relaunched on Friday 17 February 2012 with the first NAB Cup round-robin match between Hawthorn, Richmond and North Melbourne broadcast that night. Fox Footy broadcasts all NAB Challenge games exclusively, all home and away matches and all finals matches (except for the Grand Final which screens exclusively on Seven). All matches are broadcast live to air in both Standard and High Definition with no commercial breaks during play. When two live matches are being played simultaneously, Fox Sports 1 broadcasts one of the matches. Football personalities and commentators who signed or re-signed to be a part of the relaunched channel included Eddie McGuire (who commentates one non-Collingwood match a week and hosts his own talk show), Gerard Healy, Paul Roos, Jason Dunstall, Dwayne Russell, Brad Johnson, Alastair Lynch, Tony Shaw, Liam Pickering, David King, Danny Frawley, Mark Ricciuto, Glen Jakovich, Anthony Hudson and Dermott Brereton.

It was opened in 2001. The line is carried on an elevated prestressed concrete viaduct for its entire 8.5 km (5.3 mi) length after branching off from the Queensland Rail City network at Eagle Junction railway station. Ownership and business The Airtrain service is a private enterprise. The line is owned and operated by Airtrain Citylink Limited, with financial backing from Transfield Services, Macquarie Bank, Colonial First State and ABN AMRO. The first service ran on 5 May 2001. Airtrain Citylink has a licence from Queensland Transport under a BOOT scheme ‚Äì build, own, operate and transfer ‚Äì to build the rail line, to own and operate it, and hand entire infrastructure over to the Queensland Government after 35 years when the company will then cease to exist. The line connects seamlessly with the Queensland Rail City network and services use City network rolling stock in a commercial agreement with QR. While City network rolling stock is used, Airtrain does not form part of the TransLink integrated public transport scheme, and therefore fares are not subsidised by the government.

This practice, which has long been disparaged in the established music industry, was also known as song sharking and was conducted by several businesses throughout the 20th century in North America.  Production and promotion  From the early 20th century, the business of recording song poems was promoted through small display ads in popular magazines, comic books, tabloids, men's adventure journals and similar publications with a headline reading (essentially) Send in Your Poems - Songwriters Make Thousands of Dollars - Free Evaluation. The term lyrics was avoided because it was assumed potential customers would not understand what the term meant. Those who sent their poetry to one of the production companies usually received notice by mail that their work was worthy of recording by professional musicians, along with a proposal to do so in exchange for a fee. The early 20th century versions of this business involved setting the words to music and printing up sheet music from inexpensively engraved plates. In producing the recordings, musicians often recorded dozens of songs per recording session using minimal resources, often in one take. Some of the companies recorded new vocals over pre-recorded music backing tracks, using the same music tracks hundreds of times. The recordings were then duplicated on 45 RPM vinyl singles or on individual cassette tapes, or they were released on compilation LPs with dozens of other songs by amateur lyric writers.

Design  The American Underslung's chassis design and huge wheels gave it a distinctive appearance and it was noticeably lower than other cars from the same era. The chassis was hung below the axles rather than set atop them, with the engine and transmission mass moved closer to the ground lowering the center of gravity and giving sports car appearance and handling. The design mounted the engine and body within the frame rails rather than on the top as with other cars of the era. Developed in collaboration with Harry Stutz, the 1905 Underslung \\"was one of the most significant, if unsung, automobiles of this century's first decade.\\" The automobiles were marketed at the upper price range of the market. Prices for the American Underslung ranged from US$1,250 to $4,000. The cars came with Teetor-Harley straight-4 engines producing , as measured by an old system, and starting in 1908 a with became available. Additionally, a six-cylinder engine was capable of , one of the strongest cars of its time. Versions The American Underslung came in several versions: * A two door sports version, called the \\"Scout Roadster\\". * Around 1909, American introduced a four- passenger Underslung dubbed \\"The Traveler.\\" An example of this car, chassis #1687, is on display at the Simeone Foundation Automotive Museum in Philadelphia, PA, USA. * The car was also available from 1905 to 1908 with a conventional chassis design; this model was called the \\"American Tourist\\". It came in another version, a two door sports version, called the Scout Roadster. Updates: * In 1910, the horsepower rating for the engine was increased to by enlarging the cylinder bore and adding pressurized lubrication. * In 1913, electric starters and lights became available on the Underslungs.  Closure  The American Underslung marketing slogan was \\"The Car For The Discriminating Few\\" and apparently there were few buyers. Although new models were introduced for 1914 and the company continued to boast the American Underslung was \\"America‚Äôs Most Luxurious Car\\", the end came when the firm was put into receivership in November 1913.

The program presented a mixture of music videos, interviews and segments, and depended heavily on imported US content. In its early years it also showed the MTV USA game show Remote Control. The program was discontinued in 1993 when Nine chose not to renew the licence with Viacom. Nine said the axing was due to high production and licensing costs.

It was originally hosted without a domain name by Village Roadshow. It gained a domain name in 1998 as mtv.com.au. The website was very basic and only included information about MTV Unplugged and the American VMAs. In 1999 the website seemed to have been abandoned completely. In 2000 the website simply redirected to the American MTV site before the domain expired and was locked by a holding company. With MTV's expansion in 2003 the site was revived but pointed towards the MTV Asia Awards. A proper MTV Australia website was launched in 2004 and has since gone through several redesigns. Mini sites for TRL Australia and the AVMAs were also set up. The site was redesigned in 2007 and free broadband video channel MTV Overdrive launched on 19 April 2007 to coincide with the MTV Australia Video Music Awards 2007, which the Overdrive Channel is only available throughout the territory.

She then served in the United States Navy during Quasi-War with France. Two French frigates recaptured her on 20 November 1798. The French Navy took her into service as Magicienne. However, captured her on 28 June 1799. She served in the US Navy in the Caribbean briefly, before arriving in Philadelphia in August. She was paid off there and sold on 29 November. Career The U.S. warship Delaware, commanded by Capt. Stephen Decatur Sr., was able to capture the French privateer, Croyable, off Great Egg Harbor Bay, New Jersey, on 7 July 1798. Before her capture, Croyable had been preying upon shipping off the Delaware Capes and had taken a British brigantine and a Philadelphia merchantman, Liberty. She had also boarded and robbed the coaster Alexander Hamilton, whose captain had informed Decatur of Croyables whereabouts. Decatur brought Croyable to Fort Mifflin in the Delaware River. She was the first American capture of the undeclared war.Hamilton (1974), p.537. The U.S. Navy purchased Croyable on 30 July 1798, manned her at Philadelphia, renamed her Retaliation, and placed her under the command of Lt. William Bainbridge. Retaliation departed Norfolk on 28 October 1798 with and and cruised in the West Indies protecting American commerce during the Quasi- War with France. On 20 November, a pair of French frigates, Insurgente and Volontaire, overtook Retaliation while her consorts were away on a chase and forced Bainbridge to surrender the hopelessly out-gunned schooner. However, even as a prisoner, the American officer managed to serve his country. He saved Montezuma and Norfolk by convincing the senior French commander that those American warships were too powerful for his frigates and induced him to abandon the chase. Renamed Magicienne by the French, the schooner again came into American hands on 28 June 1799, when a broadside from USS Merrimack forced her to haul down her colors. She performed convoy duty in the Caribbean before returning to Philadelphia in August. Her crew was then discharged and the schooner was sold on 29 November 1799 to Thomas and Peter Mackie.

It is named for two regicides, Edward Whalley and his son- in-law William Goffe, who signed the death warrant of King Charles I of England. Upon the restoration of Charles II to the throne and the persecution of the regicides, the pair hid in Judges Cave near the south end of the trail in 1660. The Regicides is widely known to be one of the most technical trails within the CT Blue-Blazed trail system. Description Lake Watrous in Woodbridge and Bethany, Connecticut is visible from an overlook on the Regicides Trail, about one mile south of its northern junction with the Quinnipiac Trail. The trail is a narrow footpath marked with blue blazes, sometimes rocky with difficult footing. It is roughly paralleled by Baldwin Drive, a paved road currently closed to motor vehicles, except for maintenance vehicles, named for New Haven native Simeon E. Baldwin, governor of Connecticut from 1911 to 1915. The trail is within the towns of New Haven, Hamden, Woodbridge, and Bethany, and entirely within West Rock Ridge State Park, but is maintained by a private organization, the Connecticut Forest and Park Association, in conjunction with the West Rock Ridge Park Association. At its southern end, the Regicides Trail terminates behind a pavilion at the park's South Overlook, which has a panoramic view of South Central, Conn., including Sleeping Giant State Park, East Rock Park, New Haven Harbor, and the Long Island Sound. At its northern end, the Regicides Trail connects with the Quinnipiac Trail. Both trails are part of the state's system of \\"Blue-Blazed Trails\\" totaling more than . There are two connecting Blue-Blazed Trails to the Regicides Trail. The Westville Feeder, which starts off Blake Street in the Westville section of New Haven and extends for 0.6 miles, terminating with a junction at the Regicides Trail, just south of Judges Cave. The trail is blazed Blue-Yellow. The Sanford Feeder follows an abandoned town road, running from Brooks Road in Bethany to its junction with the Regicides Trail near Baldwin Drive. The Sanford Feeder is 0.6 miles and is blazed Blue-Red. The Regicides Trail also connects to a series of other trails within the park that are not part of the Blue-Blazed system. These trails include the Red Trail that creates a trail loop within the park; the Green Trail, connecting down to the park's main entrance on Wintergreen Avenue; the Orange Trail, connecting to the south end of Lake Wintergreen; the Gold Trail, connecting to the northern end of Lake Wintergreen; the Purple Trail, connecting to Main Street in Hamden, and the Yellow Trail, connecting to Mountain Road in Hamden. The Regicides Trail has a connection to the Woodbridge trail system via the red- blazed North Summit Trail, which intersects the Regicides, just west of Baldwin Drive near a U-shaped overlook. The North Summit Trail extends for 0.8 miles and intersects with the Bishop Estate and Darling House Trails, off Connecticut Route 69 in Woodbridge.

Early life and education thumb Malina was born in Kiel, Germany, the daughter of Polish Jewish parents: her mother, Rosel (n√©e Zamora), was a former actress, and her father, Max Malina, a rabbi in the Conservative denomination. In 1929 at the age of three, she immigrated with her parents to New York City. Her parents helped her see how important political theatre was, as her father was trying to warn people of the Nazi menace and he left Germany with his family largely due to the rise of antisemitism there in the late 1920s. Except for long tours, she lived in New York City until her move to the Lillian Booth Actors Home in Englewood, New Jersey. 1943 till 1945, Malina worked for Valeska Gert at the Beggar Bar. There she observed many of Gert's performances which influenced her later artistic approach.Judith Malina in: A Memoir of Valeska Gert and the Beggar Bar, PAJ: A Journal of Performance and Art, Volume 41, Issue 3, Sep. 2019, p.1-16Valeska Gert in her autobiography I am a Witch, 1968 Interested in acting from an early age, she began attending the New School for Social Research in 1945 to study theatre under Erwin Piscator. Malina was greatly influenced by Piscator's philosophy of theatre which was similar to Bertolt Brecht's principles of \\"epic theatre\\" but went further in departing from traditional narrative forms. Piscator saw theatre as a form of political communication or agitprop (\\"Theatre interests me only when it is a matter of interest to society.\\"Judith Malina: The Piscator Notebook. London: Routledge Chapman & Hall 2012, p. 185); Malina, unlike Piscator, was committed to nonviolence and anarchism.  Career  In 1963 they had to close the Living Theatre because of IRS charges (later proved false) of tax problems, and Malina and Beck were convicted of contempt of court, in part because Judith defended Julian wearing the garb of Portia from The Merchant of Venice ‚Äì and tried to use a similar argument.Gary Botting, \\"The Living Theatre\\" in The Theatre of Protest in America (Edmonton: Harden House, 1972) 18 They received a five-year suspended sentence, and decided to leave the U.S. The company spent the next five years touring in Europe and creating increasingly radical works, culminating in Paradise Now. They returned to the US in 1968 to present their new work. In her book The Enormous Despair (1972), part of her series of published diaries, Malina expressed the sense of danger and unfamiliarity she felt on returning to the U.S. in the midst of the social upheavals of the late 1960s. In 1969 the company decided to divide into three groups. One worked on the pop scene in London, another went to India to study traditional Indian theatre arts, and the third, including Malina and Beck, traveled in 1971 to Brazil to tour. They were imprisoned there on political charges for two months by the military government. Malina doing rehearsals at The Living Theatre After Beck's death from cancer in 1985, company member Hanon Reznikov, who had become Malina's lover (they married in 1988), assumed co-leadership of the Living Theatre company. In 2007 it opened its own theater at 21 Clinton Street in Manhattan. In April 2008 Reznikov suffered a stroke and while hospitalized died of pneumonia on May 3 of the same year at the age of 57.\\"Hanon Reznikov, a Force Behind the Living Theater, Dies at 57, New York Times, May 9, 2008 Malina appeared occasionally in films, beginning in 1975, when she played Al Pacino's mother in Dog Day Afternoon. Using her for the role was Pacino's idea, said its director, Sidney Lumet. Lumet recalls that tracking her down was difficult, as she had moved from New York to Vermont. \\"I had no idea of what to expect,\\" said Lumet. \\"I didn't even know whether she'd want to do a 'commercial' film. Well, let me tell you, she is an actress. Totally professional. She also had no money and we had to pay her fare from Vermont, but she walked in and was perfect.\\"Lumet, Sidney, Rapf, Joanna. Sidney Lumet: Interviews, University Press of Mississippi (2006) p. 68 She also appeared in Pacino's Looking for Richard. Malina's other roles in cinema include Rose in Awakenings (1990) and Grandma Addams in The Addams Family (1991). She had major roles in Household Saints (1993) and the low-budget film, Nothing Really Happens (2003). She appeared in an episode of the TV series The Sopranos in 2006 as a nun, the secret mother of Paulie \\"Walnuts\\" Gualtieri. Malina is the subject of a 2012 documentary by Azad Jafarian titled Love and Politics. The film premiered at the 2012 Tribeca Film Festival. Malina also has a significant supporting role in the well-received film Enemies, A Love Story (1989), in which she acted alongside Lena Olin, Ron Silver and Anjelica Huston. Some of Malina's artistic qualities were described by theater scholar Richard Schechner: Personal life Malina met her long-time collaborator and husband, Julian Beck, in 1943, when she was 17 and he was a student at Yale University. Beck, originally a painter, came to share her interest in political theatre. In 1947 the couple founded The Living Theatre, which they directed together until Beck's death in 1985. Beck and Malina had \\"two offstage children\\", Garrick and Isha. Malina's and Beck's marriage was non- monogamous. The bisexual Beck had a long-term male partner, as did Malina. In 1988 she married her long term partner Hanon Resnikov. They co-directed the Living Theatre's activity in the Middle East, Europe and the United States, until Reznikov's unexpected death in 2008.  Awards and Honors  In 1996, Judith Malina was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters (L.H.D.) degree from Whittier College. Death Judith Malina died in Englewood, New Jersey, on April 10, 2015.\\"Judith Malina, Founder of the Living Theater, Dies at 88\\", The New York Times, April 11, 2015.

The label focused its efforts on local punk rock and new wave music acts of the late 1970s through the late 1980s, including The Offs, The Nuns, The Units, Romeo Void, and Wire Train. Its name, pronounced four-one-five (not four-fifteen), was a play on both the telephone area code for the San Francisco area and the California penal code section for disturbing the peace (indeed, in some promotional material, the phrase \\"disturbing the peace\\" was written underneath the 415 logo). The label had a productive partnership with Columbia Records from 1981 until shortly before it was sold in 1989 to Sandy Pearlman, who retitled the label Popular Metaphysics. History 415 Records was founded in San Francisco in 1978 by entrepreneurs Howie Klein, Chris Knab, and Butch Bridges. Klein was a writer and entertainment promoter, Knab owned an eclectic record store in the Noe Valley section of San Francisco Aquarius Records, and Bridges was a music collector and retailer. Klein and Knab had become friends when Klein did some photography for his friend Harvey Milk, whose camera store was next door to Knab's Aquarius Records on Castro Street. They worked together on various radio shows around the Bay Area, including an alternative radio show on KSAN, and they started recording and promoting local musicians out of Knab's record store. Klein ran the label from a tiny office on 16th Street in the Mission, a district of San Francisco, where he kept a pushpin- covered United States map on his wall, bearing a sign that read, \\"All Bands on Tour All the Time.\\" Klein used his own late-night weekend radio shows to showcase his artist's records and he promoted them all over the country to nightclubs, record stores, and a newly blossoming array of other alternative radio stations. His artists were part of the 1980s San Francisco rock underground, though Klein leaned more toward the accessible, fun, new wave bands than the thrash metal and hard-core punk bands who were also part of that scene. 415 was the first North American record label to focus on punk and new wave music and they featured mostly musicians from the San Francisco region, though the label eventually also included artists from other areas. The British label Stiff Records had done similarly two years earlier; marketing England's emergent 1970s pub rock scene as punk and new wave and releasing their first record in August 1976. 415 Records enjoyed early and sustained support from Bill Graham and from David Rubinson, owner of The Automatt recording studio on Folsom Street. Bill Graham managed many top-name acts through his management and promotion agency, Bill Graham Presents, and from the start of the label he booked 415's artists as opening acts for major headlining bands to help them gain broader exposure. Queenie Taylor, long an employee of Bill Graham Presents, purchased Butch Bridges' share of 415 Records in 1979. Rubinson discounted fees for 415 label bands to record at San Francisco's The Automatt studios; sometimes recording them on speculation, such that the studio would share in the profits from those record sales. David Kahne, operating out of a closet-sized office upstairs at The Automatt, worked as 415's A&R; director, performing artist development and in-house production and engineering there for 415 until 1982, when he left Automatt and went to work in Los Angeles as Vice President of A&R; for Columbia Records. Even so, he continued to produce records for artists on the 415 label. 415's first release was a 1978 single by The Offs, entitled Everyone's a Bigot, with 0¬∞ on the B-side (cat#911-39, 1978). Subsequent early releases included 7\\" EPs by SVT (cat#S0005, 1979), The Nuns (cat#SUB01, 1979), and Pearl Harbor and the Explosions Drivin' (uncatalogued, 1979). Later records included a 7\\" by The Mutants (cat#34859, 1980), an album by The Units (cat#A0003, 1980), a 12\\" 33‚Öì RPM album by Romeo Void (cat# 415A-0007, 1981), a mini-album by New Math (cat#A0008, 1981), and various other releases for many other bands. In 1981, 415 released Romeo Void's successful first LP, It's a Condition and then they built on that success by signing a co-branding contract with Columbia Records that gave Columbia first rights of refusal to produce, manufacture, and promote their artists' recordings. Many other independent labels would form similar alliances with major labels over the coming decades. 415 retained (nearly) full artistic control over which artists to sign, all recording, and the selection of songs and artwork. Columbia co-branded albums for Romeo Void, Translator, Wire Train, Until December and the Red Rockers under this arrangement; while outside the Columbia deal, Monkey Rhythm, the Pop-O-Pies, and The Uptones all recorded albums that were released and promoted independently by 415 Records. Like many other independent labels, 415 had struggled to reach a national market, but by partnering with Columbia's knowledge and its established connections with radio, television, and retailers, they were able to bring their records to a much broader audience. Following Kahne's departure in 1982, local musician and producer Daniel Levitin began working in the A&R; department and in 1984, he became Director of A&R;, serving as staff engineer and handling in-house production as well as development of new artists. In the early 1980s, Queenie Taylor had begun managing Wolfgang's nightclub in San Francisco, and later, in the early 1990s, Slim's nightclub, owned by Boz Scaggs. Christopher Knab sold his share of the label in 1985 and he moved to Seattle, Washington to manage the University of Washington's alternative radio station KCMU, now KEXP 90.3 fm. Klein joined Sire Records in 1987 and he was named General Manager of Reprise Records in 1989. Five artists that Levitin was supervising at 415 were turned down by Columbia for the 415/Columbia partnership: The Stir-Ups, The Big Race, The Scene, The Afflicted and Rhythm Riot. With Howie's blessing, Levitin completed the production for the latter two and sold the distribution rights to a different independent label, San Francisco's Infrasonic Records, where they flourished. In 1989, Howie Klein was named General Manager of Reprise Records in Burbank, California and Levitin stayed to help run the label after Klein left. Three months later, Sandy Pearlman bought 415. By this time, Al Teller, who had been president of Columbia Records when the 415 partnership began, was now president of MCA Records. Pearlman changed the record label's name to Popular Metaphysics and formed a co-branding alliance with MCA, ending the 415 label. Post-closing activities *Howie Klein became President of Reprise and Executive Vice President of Warner Bros. Records in 1995 which he remained until retiring in 2001.

He was sentenced to life in prison and is considered a political prisoner of China. Biography Wang Bingzhang was born on December 30, 1947, in Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China. He graduated from Beijing Medical University and served as a doctor for eight years. In 1979, he was sponsored by the Chinese government to study abroad in McGill University, Canada where he obtained his Ph.D. degree in pathology in 1982.An Introduction Of Dr. Wangbingzhang Wang Bingzhang is the first citizen of the People's Republic of China to get a doctorate degree in North America. In 1982, Wang established China Spring, the first pro-democracy Chinese magazine overseas. The next year, he launched the \\"Union of Chinese Democracy Movement\\", Alliance for Democratic China () publicly denouncing the one-party rule in China. He later traveled back to China and co-founded two opposition parties, the Chinese Freedom Democracy Party and Chinese Democracy Justice Party in 1989 and 1998, respectively. The latter led to his arrest in China. He was expelled from the country, but was not sentenced. In early 2002, Wang was in Thailand where Royal Thai Police investigated him at the request of the Communist Party of China. Finding no evidence against him and fearing for his safety, Dr. Wang was urged to leave the country. In June 2002, Wang went to Vietnam with Yue Wu and Zhang Qi where they were seized by Chinese secret agents. In December 2002, the Chinese government announced his arrest after six months in custody.China: Further information on Possible disappearance/Incommunicado detention/Fear for Safety Press Release from Amnesty International - February 12, 2003 In February 2003, Wang was sentenced to life in prison, on charges of espionage and terrorism. His trial was closed to the public and lasted for one day. He is imprisoned in the Shaoguan Prison. In March 2006, Wang was punished for misbehaving when he went hunger strike to plead for release to pay a final respect to his father at his funeral; but he was handcuffed by and locked with a jail guard in his jail cell. This resulted in prolonged punishment. Visitation rights were restored in November 2006. According to Dr. Bing Wu Wang, Wang's younger brother, his physical health had deteriorated rapidly since the last visitation.

The 20th hijacker, though not present during the actual attacks, is said to have been deeply involved in the preparations. There were many variations of the 9/11 plot, with the number of terrorists fluctuating with available resources and changing circumstances. In the end, there were 19 hijackers: three of the planes were taken over by five members each and the fourth was hijacked by four people. The latter plane, United Airlines Flight 93, was unsuccessful in its mission ‚Äì instead of hitting any targets in Washington, D.C., it crashed into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, due to resistance from passengers. Thus, the idea of a 20th hijacker came to be widely discussed.  Hijackers  Ramzi bin al-Shibh allegedly meant to take part in the attacks and may have served as the hijacker-pilot of American Airlines Flight 77, but he was repeatedly denied a visa for entry into the US. His role as one of the four hijacker-pilots was preceded by Hani Hanjour. Mohammed al-Qahtani, a Saudi Arabian citizen, is often referred to as the 20th hijacker. Jos√© Mel√©ndez-P√©rez, a U.S. Immigration inspector at Orlando International Airport, refused his entry into the U.S. in August 2001. He was later captured in Afghanistan and imprisoned at the U.S. military prison known as Camp X-Ray at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In January 2009, Susan J. Crawford asserted that Qahtani's interrogation at Camp X-Ray amounted to torture. Zacarias Moussaoui, a French citizen of Moroccan origin, has widely been referred to as the 20th hijacker. Moussaoui may have been considered as a replacement for Ziad Jarrah, who at one point threatened to withdraw from the scheme because of tensions amongst the plotters. Plans to include Moussaoui were never finalized, as the al-Qaeda hierarchy had doubts about his reliability. Ultimately, Moussaoui did not play a role in the hijacking scheme. He was arrested about four weeks before the attacks. Moussaoui is now serving a life sentence for his involvement in the 9/11 attacks. He pleaded guilty in 2005 to collaborating with the other hijackers. Moussaoui claimed he and Richard Reid unsuccessfully attempted to hijack a plane on 9/11. According to the BBC, Fawaz al-Nashimi claimed to have been the \\"20th hijacker\\". An al-Qaeda video has been released from a US intelligence organization, showing al-Nashimi justifying attacks on the west. The U.S dismissed al-Nashimi's claims as propaganda. He was also known as Turki bin Fuheid al-Muteiry and took part in a May 29, 2004, attack on oil facilities in Khobar, Saudi Arabia. He was killed in a June 2004 shootout with Saudi Arabian security forces. The other al-Qaeda members who allegedly attempted, but were not able, to take part in the attacks were Saeed al-Ghamdi (not to be confused with the successful hijacker of the same name), Tawfiq bin Attash, Ali Abdul Aziz Ali, Mushabib al-Hamlan, Abderraouf Jdey, Zakariya Essabar, Saeed Ahmad al-Zahrani, Ali Abd al-Rahman al-Faqasi al- Ghamdi, Saeed al-Baluchi, Qutaybah al-Najdi, Zuhair al-Thubaiti, and Saud al- Rashi. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the attack's alleged mastermind, had wanted to remove at least one member ‚Äì Khalid al-Mihdhar ‚Äì from the operation, but he was overruled by Osama bin Laden.  In popular culture  The Saudi Arabian novelist Abdullah Thabit wrote a 2006 novel titled Terrorist Number 20 that became a bestseller. The book recalls his teenage years as a religious extremist and was inspired in part by Ahmed al-Nami, one of the 9/11 hijackers and a fellow resident of Abha who was vaguely familiar to Thabit. In April 2006, three months after the release of the book, Thabit was forced to move from Abha to Jeddah with his family after receiving death threats.

Doomben is the local Aboriginal name for Pinkenba.Kerr, J. 'Brunswick St, Bowen Hills & Beyond' ARHS 1988 The line branches from the North Coast line at Eagle Junction, extending to Pinkenba, situated east-northeast of Brisbane, the state capital of Queensland, Australia. It is part of the Queensland Rail City network. History Doomben railway station The initial section of the line opened on 3 September 1882 to Ascot (then named Racecourse) to serve the Eagle Farm racecourse, though nearby residents successfully lobbied for a regular passenger service.Kerr, J. 'Triumph of Narrow Gauge' Boolarong Publications 1990 The line was extended to Pinkenba railway station in 1897, mainly to serve an industrial area, including wharves on the north side of the Brisbane River. The passenger service was timed to coincide with the starting and finishing times of the workers. During World War I and World War II, with deep berthing available to ships at Pinkenba on the mouth of the Brisbane River, troops camped in the Pinkenba and Meeandah localities. Passenger ships used the Pinkenba wharf, and special trains ran from Brisbane to Pinkenba. Earthworks were undertaken to duplicate the line in the 1950s, hence the double sided, island platform at Clayfield. including regrading the line which eliminated the Sandgate Rd level crossing, but the program was abandoned before the second track was laid. The line was electrified in 1988, but only to Eagle Farm, the next station after current suburban terminus Doomben; only diesel-hauled services could travel the full length of the line, and those were infrequent. All passenger services on the line were suspended in September 1993 as part of a statewide rationalisation of the rail network with the closing or suspending of under-utilised or unprofitable rail lines. Only a few special services were run on the line on days of major race events at adjoining race tracks. Electric passenger services resumed on 27 January 1998, but only as far as Doomben, with bus connections to the stations beyond Doomben. The Doomben to Pinkenba section is used only for freight and occasional special trains, such as heritage services described below. =Heritage services= QR occasionally run special steam trains on the entire Pinkenba line as part of their semi-regular \\"Steam Train Sunday\\" excursion service. This is the only way to travel on the full length of the line. Line guide and services All services stop at all stations to Roma Street railway station. The typical travel time between Doomben and Brisbane City is approximately 18 minutes (to Central). Doomben line services typically terminate at Roma Street or Park Road, and at peak times also at Kuraby and Cleverland as it is the only line that is not paired with another line. No rail services operate on Sundays or public holidays. Passengers for/from the Airport, Caboolture, Nambour and Gympie North and Shorncliffe lines change at Eagle Junction, Ferny Grove at Bowen Hills, and all other lines at Roma Street. {  } References External links *Queensland Rail * Category:Brisbane railway lines Category:Public transport in Brisbane Category:3 ft 6 in gauge railways in Australia ","title":"Doomben railway line"},{"id":"853576","text":"The Marriott World Trade Center was a 22-story, 825-room hotel at 3 World Trade Center within the World Trade Center complex in Manhattan, New York City. Designed by Yamasaki & Associates. It opened in April 1981 as the Vista International Hotel and was the first major hotel to open in Lower Manhattan south of Canal Street since 1836. It was also known as World Trade Center 3 [WTC 3 or 3 WTC], the World Trade Center Hotel, the Vista Hotel, and the Marriott Hotel throughout its history. The hotel was damaged in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. It was destroyed beyond repair as a result of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, due to structural damage caused by the collapse of the Twin Towers. The hotel was not replaced as part of the new World Trade Center complex, but does share its name with the new office tower. Description The building was a 22-story steel-framed structure with 825 rooms and six basement levels (labeled B1 through B6https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-1512-20490-6772/403_ch3.pdf The hotel was connected to the North and South towers via underground entrances at concourse level, and a small pedestrian walkway that extended from the west promenade of the Marriott to the North Tower on plaza level. The hotel had a few establishments including The American Harvest Restaurant, The Greenhouse Caf√©, Tall Ships Bar & Grill, the 'Times Square Gifts' store, The Russia House Restaurant, and a Grayline New York Tour Bus ticket counter. It also housed a gym that was the largest of any hotel in New York at the time, and a hair salon named Olga's. The hotel also had of meeting space on the entire third floor, along with the New Amsterdam Ballroom on the main floor. It was considered a four-diamond hotel by the American Automobile Association (AAA).  History  The hotel was first known as the Vista International Hotel, but also became known as World Trade Center 3 (WTC 3 or 3 WTC), the World Trade Center Hotel, the Vista Hotel and the Marriott Hotel. The building was designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill with construction beginning in March 1979. The hotel opened on April 1, 1981, with 100 of 825 rooms available, and it was completed in July 1981. Shortly before the opening day of the Marriott, a fire broke out on the 7th floor. The Vista International was the first major hotel to open in Lower Manhattan south of Canal Street since 1836. The building was originally owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and KUO Hotels of Korea, with Hilton International acting as management agent. It was sold in 1995 to Host Marriott Corporation, after an extensive renovation following the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The lobby of the Marriott after the 1993 bombing. In 2002, Host Marriott Corporation was offered an opportunity to rebuild the hotel in the same location within the World Trade Center site as its lease which was signed until 2094 had not expired. Marriott rejected the offer, and in October 2003, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey voted on an agreement under which the Host Marriott Corporation would \\"surrender the premises\\" resulting in termination of the lease and thus giving the land to the National September 11 Memorial & Museum. =1993 World Trade Center bombing= On February 26, 1993, the hotel was seriously damaged as a result of the World Trade Center bombing. Terrorists affiliated with al-Qaeda took a Ryder truck loaded with 1,500 pounds (682 kilograms) of explosives and parked it in the North Tower parking garage below the hotel's ballroom. At 12:18 p.m. (EDT), the explosion destroyed or seriously damaged the lower and sub levels of the World Trade Center complex. After extensive repairs, the hotel reopened in November 1994 and was later purchased by Marriott. =September 11, 2001 attacks= The hotel destroyed after the attacks Aerial photograph of the World Trade Center site with markup showing original locations. The hotel was located at 3 World Trade Center. On September 11, 2001, the hotel had 940 registered guests. In addition, the National Association for Business Economics (NABE) was holding its yearly conference at the hotel from September 8 to 11, 2001. When American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the North Tower (1 WTC) at 8:46 a.m. EDT, its landing gear fell on the hotel's roof. Firefighters used the lobby as a staging area, and were also in the hotel to evacuate guests that may have still been inside. Firefighters also reported human remains of entire corpses on the roof from people that had jumped or accidentally fell from the burning towers. The collapse of the South Tower (2 WTC) at 9:59 a.m. EDT essentially split the building in half. The collapse of the North Tower at 10:28 a.m. EDT destroyed the rest of the hotel aside from a small section that was furthest from the North Tower. Fourteen people who had been trying to evacuate the partially destroyed hotel after the first collapse managed to survive the second collapse in this small section. The section of the hotel that had managed to survive the collapse of the Twin Towers had been upgraded after the 1993 bombing. = Aftermath = As a result of the collapse of the Twin Towers, the hotel was destroyed beyond repair. Only a small three-story section of the southernmost part of the building remained standing, all of which was eventually removed. In the remnants of the lobby, picture frames with the pictures inside them were still hanging on the walls. Approximately 40 people died in the hotel, including two hotel employees who had stayed to aid the evacuation and a number of firefighters who had been clearing the hotel and using it as a staging ground. In January 2002, the remnants of the hotel were completely dismantled. The National September 11 Memorial & Museum exists where the hotel once stood. The building and its survivors were featured in the television special documentary film Hotel Ground Zero, which premiered September 11, 2009 on the History Channel.

The asteroid was named after Aten from Egyptian mythology. It was discovered on 7 January 1976, at the Palomar Observatory by American astronomer Eleanor Helin, who was the principal scientist for the NEAT project until her retirement in 2002. The S-type asteroid measures approximately 900 meters in diameter, has a longer- than average rotation period of 44.77 hours, and approaches the orbit Earth to 44.1 lunar distances.  Orbit and classification  Aten orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.8‚Äì1.1 AU once every 11 months (347 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.18 and an inclination of 19¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. A first precovery was taken at the discovering observatory in December 1955, extending the body's observation arc by more than 20 years prior to its official discovery observation. = Namesake of the Aten group = Aten was the first asteroid found to have a semi-major orbital axis of less than one astronomical unit and a period of less than one year. A new category of asteroids was thus created, the Atens. As of 2017, the group consists of more than 1,200 numbered members. Other groups of near-Earth objects (NEOs) are the Apollo and Amor asteroids, which are both significantly larger than the Atens, while the Atira asteroids form the smallest NEO-group by far. = Close approaches = The asteroid has an Earth minimum orbit intersection distance of which corresponds to 44.1 lunar distances.  Physical characteristics  In the Tholen classification, Aten is a common S-type asteroid. In the SMASS taxonomy it is classified as an Sr-type, a subtype which transitions to the R-type asteroids. = Lightcurve = In the 1990s, Italian astronomer Stefano Mottola obtained a rotational lightcurve of Aten during the EUNEASO survey at La Silla, which was a European near-Earth object search and follow-up observation program to determine additional physical parameters. Lightcurve analysis gave a longer-than average rotation period of 40.77 hours with a brightness variation of 0.26 magnitude (). No additional lightcurves have been obtained since. = Diameter and albedo = According to the survey carried out by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Aten measures between 700 and 830 meters in diameter and its surface has a high albedo between 0.39 and 0.52. in 1994, Tom Gehrels published a diameter of 1.1 kilometers and an albedo of 0.26 in his book Hazards Due to Comets and Asteroids. The Warm Spitzer NEO survey (\\"ExploreNEOs\\") gives a diameter of 1.3 kilometers with an albedo of 0.20. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link agrees with a revised thermal model for asteroid diameters and albedos, and adopts an albedo of 0.28 with a diameter of 0.91 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 17.2. However, the Minor Planet Center (MPC) classifies Aten as a larger \\"1+ KM\\" object.  Naming  This minor planet was named from Egyptian mythology after Aten, the ancient Egyptian god of the solar disk, originally an aspect of the god Ra. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 1 August 1978 ().

It resembles a tiny stick of dynamite, both in appearance and construction, although with considerably less explosive power. Squibs consist of two electrical leads, which are separated by a plug of insulating material, a small bridge wire or electrical resistance heater, and a bead of heat- sensitive chemical composition, in which the bridge wire is embedded. Squibs can be used for generating mechanical force or to provide pyrotechnic effects for both film and live theatrics. Squibs can be used for shattering or propelling a variety of materials. A squib generally consists of a small tube filled with an explosive substance, with a detonator running through the length of its core, similar to a stick of dynamite. Also similar to dynamite, the detonator can be a slow-burning fuse, or as is more common today, a wire connected to a remote electronic trigger. ‚ÄúReusable non-pyrotechnic countermeasure dispenser cartridge for aircraft‚Äù. Squibs range in size, anywhere from 0.08\\" up to 0.6\\" (~2 to 15 millimeters) in diameter. In the North American film industry, the term squib is often used to refer variously to electric matches and detonators (used as initiators to trigger larger pyrotechnics). Squibs are generally (but not always) the main explosive element in an effect, and as such are regularly used as ‚Äúbullet hits‚Äù. Conventional squibs fire once, with the exception of eSquibs, which fire 200 or more times before depletion.LDI 2014 Award Winners Announced. Nov 22, 2014, livedesignonline.com, accessed 20 May 2019. Uses Squibs were once used in coal mining to break coal away from rock. In the 1870s, some versions of the device were patented and mass-produced as \\"Miners' Safety Squibs\\". Today, squibs are widely used in the motion picture special effects industry to simulate bullet impacts on inanimate objects. Items such as sand, soil or wood splinters may be attached to the squib to simulate the \\"splash\\" that occurs when bullets pierce different materials. Although squibs were once used even for the simulation of bullet hits on live actors, such use has been largely phased out in favor of more advanced devices that are safer for the actor, such as miniature compressed gas packs. These alternate devices are often still referred to as \\"squibs\\", even though they do not use explosive substances. The devices (whether explosive or not) are coupled with small balloons filled with fake blood (blood squibs) and often other materials to simulate shattered bone and tissue. Squibs are used in emergency mechanisms where gas pressure needs to be generated quickly in confined spaces, while not harming any surrounding persons or mechanical parts. In this form, squibs may be called gas generators. One such mechanism is the inflation of automobile air bags. In military aircraft, squibs are used to deploy countermeasures and are also implemented during ejection to propel the canopy and ejection seat away from a crippled aircraft. They are also used to deploy parachutes. Squibs are also used in automatic fire extinguishers, to pierce seals that retain liquids such as halon, fluorocarbon, or liquid nitrogen. History Squibs were originally made from parchment tubes, or the shaft of a feather, and filled with fine black powder. They were then sealed at the ends with wax. They were sometimes used to ignite the main propellant charge in cannon. = The famous \\"Squib Case\\" = Squibs are mentioned in the prominent tort case from eighteenth-century England, Scott v. Shepherd, 96 Eng. Rep. 525 (K.B. 1773). A lit squib was thrown into a crowded market by Shepherd and landed on the table of a gingerbread merchant. A bystander, to protect himself and the gingerbread, threw the squib across the market, where it landed in the goods of another merchant. The merchant grabbed the squib and tossed it away, accidentally hitting Scott in the face, putting out one of his eyes. = Squibs in film = The first documented use of squibs to simulate bullet impacts in movies was in the 1955 Polish film Pokolenie by Andrzej Wajda, where for the first time audiences were presented with a realistic representation of a bullet impacting on an on-camera human being, complete with blood spatter. The creator of the effect, Kazimierz Kutz, used a condom with fake blood and dynamite. = Origin of the phrase \\"damp squib\\" = While most modern squibs used by professionals are insulated from moisture, older uninsulated squibs needed to be kept dry in order to ignite, thus a \\"damp squib\\" was literally one that failed to perform because it got wet. Often misheard as \\"damp squid\\", the phrase \\"damp squib\\" has since come into general use to mean anything that fails to meet expectations. The word \\"squib\\" has come to take on a similar meaning even when used alone, as a diminutive comparison to a full explosive.

Foundation The Open Theater was founded in New York City by a group of former students of acting teacher Nola Chilton, together with director Joseph Chaikin (formerly of The Living Theatre), Peter Feldman, Megan Terry (often left out of the list of the founders of the Open Theatre due to her being a woman and pioneering in feminist drama, but nonetheless a co-founder of the group), and Sam Shepard. Joseph Chaikin had just left the Living Theater, following the arrest of Julian Beck and Judith Malina for tax evasion. He felt that the Living Theater had become less interested in artistic exploration and experimentation, and more interested in political activism and he felt that actors needed specific training to do the sorts of pieces that the Living Theater did. The group's intent was to continue Chilton's exploration of a \\"post-method\\", post-absurd acting technique, by way of a collaborative and wide-ranging process that included exploration of political, artistic, and social issues, which were felt to be critical to the success of avant-garde theatre. The company, developing work through an improvisational process drawn from Chilton and Viola Spolin, created well-known exercises, such as \\"sound and movement\\" and \\"transformations\\", and originated radical forms and techniques that anticipated or were contemporaneous with Jerzy Grotowski's \\"poor theater\\" in Poland. According to playwright Megan Terry the notion of a minimalist aesthetic was fueled by the company's quest to achieve narrative insight and political accountability through the body of the actor: The Open Theater formed as an offshoot of the Living Theater. The Living Theater initially divided because actor Joseph Chaikin felt that the troupe had become less interested in artistic exploration and experimentation, and more interested in political activism. He felt that actors needed specific training to do the sorts of pieces that the Living Theater did.  Theatrical Explorations  Chaikin's theatrical exploration came from within; he was interested in the personal experience of the actor, and of the actor's relationship to the rest of the community. He developed improvisational exercises designed to help the actor become freer. The technique was initially inspired by method acting, in which the actor draws on his or her own experiences and emotions, but the goal of Chaikin's work was to free the actor from the natural restraints of method acting. He called his technique the ‚Äúsound and movement‚Äù technique. In his book entitled The Presence of the Actor, Chaikin wrote ‚ÄúTraditional acting in America has become a blend of that same kind of synthetic ‚Äòfeeling‚Äô and sentimentality which characterizes the Fourth of July parade, Muzak, church services, and political campaigns.‚Äù This further explains the purpose for the Open Theater and the reasoning behind opening such a space.  Ensemble Work  Chaikin used ensemble casts as a way to explore the relationship between the actor and the outside world. He relied on the performers to interact not as characters in fictional settings, but as real people in real situations. While the Living Theater‚Äôs ensemble was very external and audience oriented, Chaikin‚Äôs was internal and oriented within the troupe itself. In 1963, Chaikin said ‚ÄúWorking together, we teach ourselves.‚Äù The ensemble worked in the \\"poor theater\\" style. There was no need for sets, costumes, props, or any of the other theatrical elements. There were no moving lights, only enough stationary light to be able tosee. There was no music, instead, the actors would use their voices to create the sound effects. There were hardly any aspects of \\"rich\\" theater involved. On his reasons for using ensembles instead of a traditional cast and show, Chaikin said: ‚ÄúI felt a terrific longing for a kind of ensemble. I wanted to play with actors, actors who felt a sensitivity for one another‚Ä¶ In order to come to a vocabulary, we had to teach each other: we had no ambitions other than to meet and play around‚Ä¶ Off-off Broadway‚Äôs impulse was a terrific dissatisfaction with what is possible on Broadway‚Ä¶ Off-off broadway is really an attack on the fourth wall. I want to destroy the fourth-wall business. I have difficulty believing most of what happens on Broadway. Mary Martin‚Äôs like a character in a television commercial: nobody‚Äôs like that.\\"  Location  The ensemble met on Spring Street in New York, in a warehouse.  Disbanding and further works  Chaikin disbanded the Open Theater in 1973, amid fears that it was becoming too institutionalized. He later went to work for the Public Theater. Chaikin continued to create workshops, but he was increasingly working on mainstream projects. Productions During the first two years of its existence, there were no productions performed by the Open Theater. Instead, there were occasional open rehearsals or workshops. The first major production was The Serpent, and it toured both nationally and internationally.The Serpent typifies what is extraordinary about the Open Theater. The production is a perfect example of experimental theatre at the time and how willing the company was to employ unconventional theatre techniques that were based on improvisation in order to created a very pointed piece. According to the playwright Jean Claude Van Itallie, a member of the company, the piece was conceived with the idea that the actors would act as priests and that there would be a sense of one-ness amongst the congregation that they are questioning the same things in which the priest is questioning. Questions such as where does evil come from? What provokes people to commit murder? Is maintaining innocence a possibility within the contaminated world that which we walk upon? Though most of the piece is done in choreographed movement, mime, human sound-effects, hand-held instruments, there is text as well coming directly from the Bible along with a number of speeches written exclusively for the show. The plot of The Serpent takes an extremely non-direct route in order to answer these questions. The play opens with a group of actors onstage where one recites a graphic description of an autopsy while the other members of the group are creating different sound effects and movements that match the text. Then the remaining members of the ensemble join the stage to partake in a stylized reenactment of the John F Kennedy assassination. One actor counts slowly to twelve while the other actors partake in the reenactment in slow motion, moving to a new position and new sound effect per count. This scene is run forward, backwards, and out of order to the point that it becomes so ritualized that there is now an element of comedy in play within this depiction of someone's untimely death. There is a sense of realization of how the horror of the murder rushes over the ensemble as they break free from their rigid formation and become instead a group of individuals fleeing from the evil that has just occurred. The ensemble then moves to the retelling of the banishment of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden. Four actors take the shape of the serpent that convinces Eve to eat the forbidden fruit and are present as Eve then moves to convince Adam to partake of it. After being banished by God from the Garden, the actors then partake in a ritual enactment of the first true discovery of sexual love which takes place alongside a recitation of how the descendants of Adam begat the rest of Mankind. This passionate celebration of sexuality is very much embraced onstage. The ensemble eventually collapses slowly to the floor when, at first, a hum falls over the group which soon turns into song. They eventually rise to their feet and travel down the aisles embracing audience members and smiling until the song is complete. The Serpent aims to remind the audience of the idea that we are all caught in a neverending battle between the fact that we are neither as innocent nor as guilty as we may think we might be, having fallen victim to the at times foul planet that we reside on. The goal of the play was not to find answers the specific questions which were asked, but rather to visualize these inquiries through improvisation and to help the actors, as well as the audience members, to find their own personal truths. Some of the company's best known works include Terry's Viet Rock (1966) with musical compositions by Marianne de Pury, Jean-Claude van Itallie's America Hurrah (1966) and The Serpent (1969). Other works included Endgame, American Hurrah, The Mutation Show, Nightwalk, and Terminal. Members of the theatre simulated an orgy in Death Valley in a scene in the 1970 movie Zabriskie Point. The U.S. Justice Department later investigated the film questioning whether the orgy violated the Mann Act which criminalized the interstate transport of females for \\"immoral purposes\\". However, the movie producers pointed out that no actual sex had taken place and that the actors had not crossed a state line since the town of Zabriskie Point is in California. After the company's dissolution, its members formed The Talking Band, and Medicine Show Theatre Ensemble and Spiderwoman Theater. Chaikin went on to have a celebrated career as a theatre director until his death in 2003.

He was a candidate of the Roman party opposed to Pope Paschal II and is regarded today as an antipope. Prior to his election he was created a cardinal by the antipope Clement III. He was captured by partisans of Paschal II and forced to live out his days as a monk. Cardinal The date of Adalbert's birth is unknown, but he was from the town of Atella in southern Italy.Salvador Miranda, \\"Albertus, O.S.B.\\", The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church, Florida International University. He was an early supporter of Clement III, who rewarded him with the suburbicarian diocese of Silva Candida. He was among the twelve cardinals of Clement III who gathered in the Lateran Palace to underwrite a papal letter on 4 November 1084.Andrea Piazza, \\"Alberto, antipapa\\", Enciclopedia dei Papi (Rome: 2000). Adalbert can be traced at Rome throughout Clement's pontificate. He was by the antipope's side when Clement issued a privilege on 8 January 1089. On 7 August 1098 he was one of a group of prelates who presided over a conciliabulum convoked by Clement. The assembly condemned all the \\"old and new\\" heresies of the monk Hildebrand, that is, Pope Gregory VII. It also issued an summons to the \\"schismatics\\", the followers of Gregory's successor, Urban II, enjoining them to be present in Rome on 1 November. Adalbert's name is atop the list of signatories of this letter, an indication of his importance in the curia of Clement III. When Clement's successor, Theodoric, was captured by his opponents in February 1101, Adalbert was elected to succeed him. Antipope The circumstances of Adalbert's election are difficult to ascertain. It took place in the basilica of Santi Apostoli. According to the German chroniclers Frutolf of Michelsberg and Ekkehard of Aura, the Emperor Henry IV intervened to secure Adalbert's nomination, although sources nearer in space and time to events do not mention the emperor. Although the papal electors believed they were acting in the interests of the empire, Henry IV is not known to have had any contact with Adalbert.I. S. Robinson, Henry IV of Germany 1056‚Äì1106 (Cambridge University Press, 2000), p. 309. The Annales Romani, the richest source of information on Adalbert's pontificate, states simply that he was elected by that part of the clergy and people of Rome who had sided with Clement III. It is clear that Adalbert was elected, consecrated and enthroned within days of Theodoric's capture in February 1101. Modern historians have often erroneously dated his election to 1102. The speed with which he was elected indicates that the pro- Imperial Clementine party in Rome was still well organized at the time. Among his known supporters were Romano, a cardinal who had taken part in the conciliabulum of 1098, and Romano's nephew, Giovanni Oddoline. Adalbert retained his baptismal name as pope. A pallium was made for Adalbert, although it could not be laid on Saint Peter's tomb, because the Clementine faction did not control it.Steven A. Schoenig, Bonds of Wool: The Pallium and Papal Power in the Middle Ages (Catholic University of America Press, 2016), p. 358. Adalbert's first public appearance drew a large crowd and rapidly degenerated into unrest. The situation eventually got so bad that he was forced to take refuge in the basilica of San Marcello al Corso under the protection of Romano and Giovanni Oddoline. Many clergy who tried to reach the church were beaten and stripped naked by the mob. Paschal II then bribed Giovanni to hand the antipope over. Adalbert was stripped of his pallium and handed over to Paschal's forces. His pontificate had lasted 105 days. He was led behind a horse (as a sign of contempt) to the Lateran Palace, where Paschal was residing. He was then imprisoned in a tower. The Annales Romani and the biography of Paschal in the Liber pontificalis agree that the acceptance of the bribe and the antipope's imprisonment took place in the space of one day. Adalbert was eventually sent to the Benedictine monastery of San Lorenzo in Aversa, where he spent the rest of his life. The date of his death and the place of burial are not known. In 1105, the pro-Imperial party elected Maginulf as Sylvester IV in opposition to Paschal, but he was no more successful than his predecessors for he too lacked imperial support.

Early life and education The youngest of five children, Chaikin was born to a poor Jewish family living in the Borough Park residential area of Brooklyn. At the age of six, he was struck with rheumatic fever, and he continued to suffer from resulting heart complications throughout his life. At the age of ten, he was sent to the National Children's Cardiac Hospital in Florida. It was during this period of isolation he began to organize theater games with other children. After two years in Florida, his health improved, and he was returned to his family, who had moved to Des Moines, Iowa, where his father had taken a job teaching. Chaikin briefly attended Drake University in Iowa, and then returned to New York to begin a career in theater, studying with various acting coaches, while struggling to survive working a variety of jobs. He appeared as a figurant at the Metropolitan Opera, and gradually began to be cast in legitimate stage roles, going on to work with The Living Theatre before founding in 1963 The Open Theater a theater co-operative that progressed from a closed experimental laboratory to a performance ensemble. Career Open Theater allowed Chaikin and his colleagues the space to experiment with unconventional and organic drama techniques. They embraced dance and musical performance practices and encouraged actors to be more expressive in the body. When asked in a 1999 interview why he was compelled to start Open Theater, Chaikin responded, \\"I‚Äôm not crazy about naturalism on stage. An actor is an interpretive artist. They can take their talent further. I wanted them to stretch, be creative.\\"Diamond, Liz. \\"Joseph Chaikin\\", Bomb Magazine, Summer, 1998. Retrieved on June 19, 2012. The Open Theatre's most famous and critically acclaimed production, The Serpent, was a unique creation developed largely from the actors' own experiences, using the Bible as text, but incorporating current events, such as the violence that plagued the 1960s. An Open Theatre exercise by Jean- Claude van Itallie, \\"Interview,\\" became part of the play America Hurrah, and Chaikin directed the \\"Interview\\" section when the play opened at the Pocket Theatre in 1966. In 1969 Open Theatre performed Endgame by Samuel Beckett, with Chaikin playing the role of Hamm and Peter Maloney as Clov, at the Cite Universitaire, Paris, and in 1970 at the Grasslands Penitentiary, a fulfillment of Chaikin's desire to experiment with audiences who would be fundamentally and culturally different from cosmopolitan audiences. In 1970-71 Open Theatre performed Terminal by Susan Yankowitz, touring the production internationally‚Äîincluding at the Shiraz Arts Festival in Iran (1971)--as well as to many maximum and minimum security prisons in the eastern U.S. and Canada. The Open Theater operated for about ten years. Chaikin closed the Open Theatre in 1973 because he said it was in danger of becoming an institution. Although it achieved much critical success, Chaikin said: \\"I have rarely known a case where a critic's response to actors, directors or writers has expanded or encouraged their talent- I have known cases where by panning or praising, the critic has crushed or discouraged creative inspiration\\". In 1977, Chaikin formed an experimental workshop company called The Winter Project, whose members included Ronnie Gilbert, Corey Fischer, Robbie McCauley, Mark Samuels, Robert Montgomery, Christopher McCann and Will Patton, as well as core members of the previous Open Theatre, among others. In the Winter Project, Chaikin proposed and participated in explorations of the boundary between life and death, the actor as storyteller, listening, found dialogue and more. His production of The Dybbuk at the Public Theater in 1977-78 was, to some extent, influenced by some of these researches. Chaikin had a close working relationship with Sam Shepard and they cowrote the plays Tongues and Savage/Love, both of which premiered at San Francisco's Magic Theatre. They were commissioned to write When The World Was Green for the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, later collaborating to write War in Heaven. Chaikin was an expert on Samuel Beckett. Chaikin adapted Texts for Nothing with Steven Kent who directed him in a solo show based on the material which performed at the Public Theater in New York, at the Roundhouse Theatre in London, the American Center in Paris, and in Toronto. Chaikin directed a number of Beckett's plays, including Endgame at the Manhattan Theatre Club and Happy Days' at Cherry Lane Theater. Awards and honors * Chaikin received six Obie Awards, including one for Lifetime Achievement, and two Guggenheim Fellowships. * His book, \\"The Presence of The Actor\\" was first published in 1972 by Theatre Communications Group, and a second edition followed in 1991. Based on his experiments with actors, the book includes exemplar notes, photographs, and exercises from Open Theatre productions, and records Chaikin's ideas about theater as a tool for social transformation. * In 2010, he was inducted, posthumously, into the American Theater Hall of Fame.Playbill.com Personal life In 1984, Chaikin suffered a stroke during his third open-heart surgery, which left him with partial aphasia. Following Chaikin's stroke, several writers, including Jean- Claude van Itallie, Susan Yankowitz, and Sam Shepard, wrote plays specifically for Chaikin to perform and direct, most notably The War in Heaven which was directed by Steven Kent. Chaikin performed the piece in San Diego, Atlanta, and Parma, Italy, Samuel Beckett's last poem, \\"What Is the Word?\\", was written for and dedicated to Chaikin. Chaikin was a lifelong teacher of acting and directing, and lived most of his adult life in New York's West Village, at Westbeth Artists Community.

He cannot be linked to the line of antipopes‚ÄîClement III, Theodoric and Adalbert‚Äîwho opposed the Reformist papacy from 1080 to 1101. While the elections of Theodoric and Adalbert were relatively minor affairs, the election of Maginulf signalled a crisis in the pontificate of Pope Paschal II and was widely noted in contemporary chronicles: Annales Ceccanenses, Annales Leodienses, the Annalista Saxo, Ekkehard of Aura, Sigebert of Gembloux. Members of the Roman aristocracy gathered in the Pantheon, then the church of Santa Maria Rotonda, elected Maginulf in opposition to Paschal II in November 1105. The Annales Romani records the noblemen who supported his election: Stefano Oddone and his brothers, Nicola Cencio Baroncio and his son Pietro, Romano di Romano Baroncio and his brothers and nephews, and Enrico di Sant'Eustachio and his sons. This is the earliest record of Stefano Oddone, called the Norman, in the sources. Margrave Werner of Ancona, in a letter to the Emperor Henry IV, describes his election as beginning with some clergy who were dissatisfied with Paschal's simoniacal favoritism of the Colonna and Pierleoni families. This, coupled with the involvement of the Roman aristocracy in his election, suggests that the motivations were less ideological than rooted in local politics. According to Werner, there were meetings in Rome attended by bishops and cardinals, after which Maginulf, a man of learning and upright character, was elected pope. The head of the Roman militia, Berto, was required to force Maginulf to accept the honour. According to Paschal's biography in the Liber pontificalis, Maginulf's election was the work of the Devil. In a letter, Paschal cites his failure to give sufficient \\"gifts\\" to the Romans for the election of Maginulf. Pontificate After his election Maginulf took the papal name of Sylvester IV. This was a deliberate ploy to garner imperial sympathy, since it hearkened back to Pope Sylvester II, the great ally of the Emperor Otto III a hundred years earlier. The conspirators who had elevated the new pope sent word to Margrave Werner, requesting imperial support. Werner marched on Rome with imperial (German) troops and took possession of the Lateran, forcing Paschal II to flee to Tiber Island according to the Annales Romani, although Paschal addressed a letter from Saint Peter's Basilica. Sylvester IV was consecrated in the Lateran Basilica on 18 November 1105. The following day a battle broke out in the streets of Rome. There were two pitched battles: one near the Lateran Basilica and another in the Circus Maximus. Both equites (cavalry) and pedites (infantryman) were involved in the fighting. Sylvester's infantry are said to have chased Paschal's cavalry throughout Santa Maria Nova, leaving over sixty horses dead. Sylvester IV soon ran short on funds to pay his soldiers and left Rome for Tivoli with a bodyguard before finally settling in Osimo under the protection of Margrave Werner. The next fives years are completely unknown. Sylvester only comes again into view in the spring of 1111, when the German king Henry V used him as a pawn in his negotiations with Paschal. Henry, who wanted Paschal to crown him emperor, forced Sylvester to renounce the Papacy on 12 or 13 April 1111. Sylvester was allowed to live out the rest of his life in Osimo under the protection of Werner. According to the Annales Romani, Werner acted out of pity, but there was probably some political calculation involved in willingness to control an ex-pope.

Sometimes thought of as a side-project of iconic Australian singer- songwriter Paul Kelly, the band is in fact its own entity: Kelly is one of the four members (song writing generally shared). The band's name is derived from the 1960s Australian TV character \\"Professor Ratbaggy\\", who was a bumbling but kind-hearted scientist, a comical character, performed by Ernie Carroll on GTV-9 on Melbourne television. Steve Hadley, Bruce Haymes and Peter Luscombe would frequently play as The Casuals, as well as being members of Kelly's regular band. Professor Ratbaggy's songs are often instrumental and purely groove-based with reggae, dub and funk influences. Professor Ratbaggy members and Shane O'Mara provided the original music for Lantana (2001) and are featured on the EMI soundtrack of the same name. The band's song, \\"Love Letter\\" (from their self-titled 1999 album) was used on ABC-TV series Fireflies (2004) together with songs by Paul Kelly (alone and with other bands) and by other artists. With Kelly often busy with his solo career and work in film and TV composition, Professor Ratbaggy's live shows have all but ceased and their recorded output remains low; this is not to say that the concept has died and there remains a strong possibility of further playing and/or recording.

The thick core of Baltica, the East European Craton, is more than three billion years old and formed part of the Rodinia supercontinent at 1 . Tectonic history 1.1 Ga Baltica was located in what is now the South Pacific. (Current location of Australia added for reference.) 550 million years ago Baltica (green) was an isolated continent located near the South Pole. Baltica formed at 2.0‚Äì1.7 Ga by the collision of three Archaean-Proterozoic continental blocks: Fennoscandia (including the exposed Baltic Shield), Sarmatia (Ukrainian Shield and Voronezh Massif), and Volgo-Uralia (covered by younger deposits). Sarmatia and Volgo-Uralia formed a proto-craton (sometimes called \\"Proto-Baltica\\")E.g. at c. 2.0 Ga which collided with Fennoscandia c. 1.8‚Äì1.7 Ga. The sutures between these three blocks were reactivated during the Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic. 750‚Äì600 million years ago, Baltica and Laurentia rotated clockwise together and drifted away from the Equator towards the South Pole where they were affected by the Cryogenian Varanger glaciations. Initial rifting between the two continents is marked by the c. 650 Ma Egersund dike swarm in southern Norway and from 600 Ma they began to rotate up to 180¬∞ relative to each other, thus opening the Iapetus Ocean between them. Laurentia quickly moved northward but Baltica remained an isolated continent in the Southern Hemisphere closer to Gondwana on which endemic trilobites evolved in the Early Ordovician. During the Ordovician, Baltica moved northward approaching Laurentia again allowing trilobites and brachiopods to cross the Iapetus Ocean. In the Silurian, c. 425 Ma, the final collision between Scotland-Greenland and Norway resulted in the Scandian Orogeny. Margins Baltica is a very old continent and its core is a very well-preserved and thick craton. Its current margins, however, are the sutures that are the result of mergers with other, much younger continental blocks. These often deformed sutures do not represent the original, Precambrian‚Äìearly Palaeozoic extent of Baltica; for example, the curved margin north of the Urals running parallel to Novaya Zemlya was probably deformed during the eruption of the End-Permian Siberian Traps. Baltica's western margin is the Caledonide orogen which stretches northward from the Scandinavian Mountains across Barents Sea to Svalbard. Its eastern margin is the Timanide orogen which stretches north to the Novaya Zemlya archipelago. The extent of the Proterozoic continent are defined by the Iapetus Suture to the west; the Trollfjorden-Komagelva Fault Zone in the north; the Variscan-Hercynian suture to the south; the Tornquist Zone to the southwest; and the Ural Mountains to the east. =Northern margin= At c. 555 Ma during the Timanian Orogeny the northern margin became an active margin and Baltica expanded northward with the accretion of a series of continental blocks: the Timan-Pechora Basin, the northernmost Ural Mountains, and the Novaya Zemlya islands. This expansion coincided with the Varanger glaciations, also known as Snowball Earth. Terranes of the North American Cordillera, including Alaska-Chukotka, Alexander, Northern Sierra, and Eastern Klamath, share a rift history with Baltica and most likely were part of Baltica from the Caledonian orogeny to the formation of the Ural Mountains. These terranes can be linked to either northeastern Laurentia, Baltica, or Siberia because of a similar sequence of fossils; detrital zircon from 2‚Äì1 Ga-old sources and evidence of Grenvillian magmatism; and magmatism and island arcs from the Late Neoproterozoic and Ordovician-Silurian. =Southern margin= From at least 1.8 Ga to at least 0.8 Ga the southwestern margin of Baltica was connected to Amazonia while the southeast margin was connected to the West African Craton. Baltica, Amazonia, and West Africa rotated 75¬∞ clockwise relative to Laurentia until Baltica and Amazonia collided with Laurentia in the 1.1‚Äì0.9 Ga Grenville-Sveconorwegian-Suns√°s orogenies to form the supercontinent Rodinia. When the break-up of Rodinia was complete c. 0.6 Ga Baltica became an isolated continent ‚Äî a 200 million year period when Baltica was truly a separate continent. Laurentia and Baltica formed a single continent until 1.265 Ga which broke up some time before 0.99 Ga. After the subsequent closure of the Mirovoi Ocean Laurentia, Baltica and Amazonia remained merged until the opening of the Iapetus Ocean in the Neoproterozoic. =Western Margin= The Western Gneiss Region in northern Norway is composed of 1650‚Äì950 Ma-old gneisses overlain by continental and oceanic allochtons that were transferred from Laurentia to Baltica during the Scandian orogeny. The allochtons were accreted to Baltica during the closure of the Iapetus Ocean c. 430‚Äì410 Ma; Baltica's basement and the allochtons were then subducted to UHP depth c. 425‚Äì400 Ma; and they were finally exhumed to their present location c. 400‚Äì385 Ma. The presence of micro-diamonds in two islands in northern Norway, Otr√∏ya and Flems√∏ya, indicate that this margin of Baltica was buried c. for at least 25 million years around 429 Ma shortly after the Baltica-Laurentia collision. The Baltica-Laurentia-Avalonia triple junction in the North Sea is the southwest corner of Baltica. The Baltica- Laurentia suture stretching northeast from the triple junction was deformed in the Late Cambrian and early Palaeozoic in the Scandinavian Caledonides as well as the Scandian Orogeny in the Silurian. Some Norwegian terranes have faunas distinct from those of either Baltica or Laurentia and were island arcs that originated in the Iapetus Ocean and were accreted to Baltica. The Baltica craton most likely underlies these terranes and the continent-ocean boundary passes several kilometres off Norway, but, since the North Atlantic opened c. 54 Ma were the Iapetus Ocean closed, it is unlikely the craton also reached into Laurentia. The margin stretches north to Novaya Zemlya where early Palaeozoic Baltica faunas have been found, but the sparsity of data makes it difficult to locate the margin in the Arctic. Ordovician faunas indicate that most of Svalbard, including Bj√∏rn√∏ya, was part of Laurentia, but Franz Josef Land and Kvit√∏ya (an eastern island of the Svalbard archipelago) most likely became part of Baltica in the Timanide Orogeny. The Taymyr Peninsula, in contrast, never was part of Baltica: southern Taymyr was part of Siberia whilst northern Taymyr and the Severnaya Zemlya archipelago were part of the independent Kara Terrane in the early Palaeozoic. =Eastern margin= The eastern margin, the Uralide orogen, extends from the Arctic Novaya Zemlya archipelago to the Aral Sea. The orogen contains the record of at least two collisions between Baltica and intra-oceanic island arcs before the final collision between Baltica and Kazakhstania-Siberia during the formation of Pangaea. The Silurian-Devonian island arcs were accreted to Baltica along the Main Uralian Fault, east of which are metamorphosed fragments of volcanic arc mixed with small amounts of Precambrian and Paleozoic continental rocks. However, no rocks unambiguously originating from either Kazakhstania or Siberia have been found in the Urals.; For a model of the arc-continent collision see The basement of the eastern margin is composed of an Archaean craton, metamorphosed rocks at least 1.6 Ga old, which is surrounded by the fold belt of the Timanide orogeny and overlain by Mesoproterozoic sediments. The margin became a passive margin facing the Ural Ocean in the Cambrian‚ÄìOrdovician. The eastern margin stretches south through the Ural Mountains from the northern end of the Novaya Zemlya archipelago. The margin follows the bent shape of Novaya Zemlya which was caused in the Late Permian by the Siberian Traps. It is clear from Baltic endemic fossils in Novaya Zemlya that the islands have been part of Baltica since the Early Palaeozoic, whereas the Taymyr Peninsula farther east was part of the passive margin of Siberia in the Early Palaeozoic. Northern Taymyr, together with Severnaya Zemlya and parts of the crust of the Arctic Ocean, formed the Kara Terrane. The Urals Mountains formed in the mid and late Palaeozoic when Laurussia collided with Kazakhstania, a series of terranes. The eastern margin, however, originally extended farther east to an active margin bordered by island arcs, but those parts have been compressed, fractured, and distorted especially in the eastern Urals. The early Palaeozoic eastern margin is better preserved south of the polar region (65 ¬∞N) where shallow-water sediments can be found in the western Urals whilst the eastern Urals are characterised by deep-water deposits. The oldest known mid-ocean hydrothermal vent in the south-central part of the Urals clearly delimits the eastern extent. The straightness of the mountain chain is the result of continuous strike-slip movements during the Late Carboniferous to Early Permian (300‚Äì290 Ma). Baltic endemic faunas from the Early Ordovician have been found in Kazakhstan near the southern end of the eastern margin, or the triple junction between Baltica, the Mangyshlak Terrane, and the accretionary Altaids. Here the Early Palaeozoic rocks are buried under the Caspian Depression.

Two months earlier he had released his previous studio album, Wanted Man, which includes a track co-produced and co-written with Randy Jacobs (member of Was (Not Was)). For Deeper Water, Kelly and Jacobs co-wrote the title track; and they produced and wrote two further tracks, \\"Extra Mile\\" and \\"I've Been a Fool\\". Kelly used Kerryn Tolhurst (ex-The Dingoes) as producer for \\"Difficult Woman\\" and co-produced with him on \\"Give in to My Love\\". A third co-producer, Simon Polinski (Yothu Yindi), worked on a track, \\"Gathering Storm\\", which Kelly had co-written with Mart Saarelaht (leader of Jex Saarelaht Trio).

Family, early career Tupper was the second son of Sir Charles Tupper, a physician, leading Conservative politician, and Canadian diplomat. The elder Tupper served as premier of Nova Scotia, was a Father of Confederation, and served briefly as prime minister of Canada in 1896. The younger Tupper practised law in Halifax, Nova Scotia, after articling to learn the profession; at the time there was no formal legal education in Atlantic Canada. He formed a successful partnership with Wallace Graham, and the two invited the young Robert Borden, a future prime minister who was one year older than Tupper, to join them in the late 1870s. A decade later, Borden became the firm's senior partner after Graham was appointed a judge and Tupper entered politics. Tupper's younger brother William Johnston Tupper also became a Conservative politician. MP, Cabinet minister He was elected as a Conservative MP in 1882. He was appointed Minister of Marine and Fisheries by Sir John A. Macdonald in 1888, and kept that position in subsequent Conservative cabinets until 1894, under PMs Sir John Abbott and Sir John Sparrow David Thompson. He then became Minister of Justice in the government of Sir Mackenzie Bowell and attempted, unsuccessfully, to resolve the Manitoba Schools Question by drafting a bill to restore Separate School education for Catholics in Manitoba. Tupper resigned in January 1896 to protest Bowell's leadership, which had largely failed on this question, among others. He returned as Solicitor General of Canada in the short-lived government of his father, who became prime minister later in 1896, when Bowell stepped down. Tupper Sr. was defeated in the 1896 Canadian federal election, by Liberal Wilfrid Laurier, who became prime minister. Tupper remained an MP until his retirement from politics in 1904. =Knighted= In 1893, while minister of Marine and Fisheries, he was involved in the Bering Sea Arbitration between the United States and Canada as a representative of the British government, which at that time was responsible for Canadian foreign affairs. He was knighted in recognition for this service, which produced a successful outcome for Canada. Moves to British Columbia In 1897 he moved to Victoria, British Columbia, and then moved to Vancouver in 1898, but continued as the Member of Parliament for Pictou, Nova Scotia, where he was re-elected in 1900. From 1898 he practised law in Vancouver, where he served as a bencher of the Law Society of British Columbia. He represented Japanese-Canadians in a series of cases opposing discriminatory practices of the provincial government. In 1923, he was involved in the creation of the short-lived Provincial Party of British Columbia. Family In September 1879, Charles Hibbert Tupper married Janet McDonald, daughter of the Hon. James McDonald, Chief Justice of Nova Scotia, and his wife, Jane. The couple had four sons and three daughters. The couple lived in Parkside, Vancouver, B.C. Her sister married her brother-in- law, Mr. W. J. Tupper. Another sister married the Rev. L. H. Jordan, B.D., of Chicago.

This service typically delivers milk in bottles or cartons directly to customers' homes. This service is performed by a milkman, milkwoman, or milk deliverer. (In contrast, a cowman or milkmaid tends to cows.) Delivery In some countries, when a lack of good refrigeration meant that milk would quickly spoil, milk was delivered to houses daily. Before milk bottles were available, milkmen took churns on their rounds and filled the customers' jugs by dipping a measure into the churn. Due to improved packaging and the introduction of more refrigerators and cooling appliances in private homes, the need for milk delivery has decreased over the past half-century. These advances contributed to the trade shrink in many localities, from daily deliveries to just three days a week or less in others. Milk deliveries frequently occur in the morning. It is also common for milkmen and milkwomen to deliver products other than milk, including butter, cream, cheese, eggs, meat and vegetables. In some areas, apartments and houses have small milk-delivery doors. These are small wooden cabinets inside the residence, built into the exterior wall, with doors on both sides that are latched but not locked, to allow groceries or milk to be placed inside the box when delivered and when collected by the resident. Vehicles A milk float Horse-drawn vehicles were originally used for local delivery from the inception of the first milk round around 1860. These were still seen in Britain in the 1950s and parts of the United States until the 1960s. Now, motorized vehicles are used. First introduced in 1889, battery vehicles milk floats expanded in 1931 and by 1967 gave Britain the largest electric vehicle fleet in the world. Around the world =Africa= In the Uganda region, an often-used title for \\"king\\" is Omukama, which means \\"superior milkman/milk bringer\\": a title that refers to the role of the leader as a feeder of the people. A historical tradition is that the ancient ruling class of some Ugandan kingdoms were Bahima,http://www.ugandatravelguide.com/ankole- culture.html who were cattle holders. =Americas= In 1963, nearly 29.7 percent of consumers in the US had milk delivered, but by 1975, the number had dropped to 6.9 percent of total sales. In 2005, about 0.4% of consumers in the United States had their milk delivered, and a handful of newer companies had sprung up to offer the service. Some U.S. dairies have been delivering milk for about 100 years, with interest continuing to increase in the 2010s as part of the local food movement. During the 2020 coronavirus outbreak, some remaining milkmen saw demand increase suddenly (similar to other grocery delivery services) due to concerns about the infection risk involved with shopping in stores.https://nj1015.com/the-milkman-is-back-an-old-job-sees-new- life-in--19-crisis/ =Asia= In India, those delivering milk usually use milk churns, a practice that has ceased in western countries. On the road, they are put on any kind of vehicle. In big cities such as Mumbai, milk churns are often transported in luggage compartments in local trains. In the Philippines, the milkman or milkmaid is called lechero. The tradition stemmed from the community production of carabao milk, which the lechero delivers fresh to his or her designated barangay (village). The lechero heritage used to be widely practiced in the country but declined after the introduction of store-bought milk during the American-occupation period. Nowadays, only a few communities have lecheros, notably in Nueva Ecija province, the milk capital of the Philippines. =Australia= In Australia, the delivery vehicle was usually a small petrol or diesel truck with a covered milk-tray. In hotter areas, this tray is usually insulated. =Europe= Dutch milkman in Haarlem, 1956 Milkmen appeared in Britain around 1860, when the first railways allowed fresh milk to arrive in cities from the countryside. By 1880, the milk was delivered in bottles. By 1975, 94% of milk was in glass bottles, but in 1990, supermarkets started offering plastic and carton containers, reducing bottled milk from 94% to 3% by 2016. In the 20th century, milk delivery in urban areas of Europe has been carried out from an electric vehicle called a milk float. Cultural impact The comedy films The Milkman (1950) starring Donald O'Connor, and The Early Bird (1965), starring Norman Wisdom, portrayed the profession in the US and UK respectively. Tevye the Dairyman (Tevye der milkhiker) is the fictional pious Jewish narrator and protagonist of a series of short stories by Sholem Aleichem, and various adaptations of them, the most famous being the stage/film musical Fiddler on the Roof. Stephen King's short story \\"Morning Deliveries (Milkman No. 1)\\" (in the horror anthology Skeleton Crew (1985)), concerns a milkman who kills people by leaving \\"surprises\\" (including poison, toxic gas, and venomous spiders) in their milk cans. The title of the pop hit \\"No Milk Today\\" (1966) by the British band Herman's Hermits refers to a common notice instructing the milkperson not to leave the usual order of milk on a particular day. In the song, this symbolizes the singer's recent breakup with his love interest who has just moved out of his house. The British comedian Benny Hill, himself a former milkman, had a hit novelty song called \\"Ernie (The Fastest Milkman In The West)\\" (1971). Ella Mae Morse had a US top 10 hit with \\"Milkman, Keep Those Bottles Quiet\\", from the film Broadway Rhythm (1944). The (unnamed) milkwoman was an occasional character in British sitcom Open All Hours, the object of Granville's desire.

He was bishop of Halberstadt from 1366 until his death. Life Albert was born at Rickensdorf near Helmstedt, the son of a farmer in a small village; but because of his talent, he was sent to study at the University of Prague and the University of Paris. At Paris, he became a master of arts (a professor), and held this post from 1351 until 1362. He also studied theology at the College of Sorbonne, although without receiving a degree. In 1353, he was rector of the University of Paris. After 1362, Albert went to the court of Pope Urban V in Avignon as an envoy of Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria, in order to negotiate the founding of the University of Vienna. The negotiations were successful, and Albert became the first rector of this University in 1365. In 1366, Albert was elected bishop of Halberstadt (counted as Albert III), Halberstadt being the diocese in which he was born. As Bishop of Halberstadt, he allied himself with Magnus with the Necklace, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg, against Gebhard of Berg, Bishop of Hildesheim, and was taken prisoner by Gebhard in the battle of Dinckler in 1367. He died at Halberstadt in 1390. Philosophy Albert was a pupil of Jean Buridan and was very much influenced by Buridan's teachings on physics and logic. As a natural philosopher, he contributed to the spread of Parisian natural philosophy throughout Italy and central Europe. Similar to Buridan, Albert combined critical analysis of language with epistemological pragmatism. Albert distinguishes, as his teacher did, between what is absolutely impossible or contradictory and what is impossible ‚Äúin the common course of nature‚Äù and considers hypotheses under circumstances that are not naturally possible but imaginable given God's absolute power. Albert refused to extend the reference of a physical term to supernatural, purely imaginary possibilities. Later regarded as one of the principal adherents of nominalism, along with his near contemporaries at Paris, namely Buridan and Marsilius of Inghen, whose works are often so similar as to be confused with each other. The subsequent wide circulation of Albert's work made him a better-known figure in some areas than more important contemporaries like Buridan and Nicole Oresme. Albert's work in logic also shows strong influence by William of Ockham, whose commentaries on the logica vetus (i. e. on Porphyry, and Aristotle's Categoriae and De interpretatione) were made the subject of a series of works called Quaestiones by Albert. Three stage theory of impetus according to Albert von Sachsen Albert of Saxony's teachings on logic and metaphysics were extremely influential. The theory of impetus introduced a third stage to the two stage theory of Avicenna.Michael McCloskey: Impetustheorie und Intuition in der Physik.. In: Newtons Universum. Verlag Spektrum der Wissenschaft: Heidelberg 1990, , p. 18. # Initial stage. Motion is in a straight line in direction of impetus which is dominant while gravity is insignificant # Intermediate stage. Path begins to deviate downwards from straight line as part of a great circle as air resistance slows projectile and gravity recovers. # Last stage. Gravity alone draws projectile downwards vertically as all impetus is spent. This theory was a precursor to the modern theory of inertia. Although Buridan remained the predominant figure in logic, Albert's Perutilis logica (c. 1360) was destined to serve as a popular text because of its systematic nature and also because it takes up and develops essential aspects of the Ockhamist position. Albert accepted Ockham's conception of the nature of a sign. Albert believed that signification rests on a referential relation of the sign to the individual thing, and that the spoken sign depends for its signification on the conceptual sign. Albert followed Ockham in his conception of universals and in his theory of supposition. Specifically, Albert preserved Ockham's notion of simple supposition, understood as the direct reference of a term to the concept on which it depends when it signifies an extra-mental thing. Albert followed Ockham in his theory of categories and contrary to Buridan, refused to treat quantity as a feature of reality in its own right, but rather reduced it to a disposition of substance and quality. Albert established signification through a referential relation to a singular thing defining the relation of the spoken to conceptual signs as a relation of subordination. Albert's treatment of relation was highly original. Although, like Ockham, he refused to construe relations as things distinct from absolute entities, he clearly ascribed them to an act of the soul by which absolute entities are compared and placed in relation to each other. He therefore completely rejected certain propositions Ockham had admitted reasonable, even if he did not construe them in the same way. Albert's voluminous collection of Sophismata (c. 1359) examined various sentences that raise difficulties of interpretation due to the presence of syncategorematic terms such as quantifiers and certain prepositions, which, according to medieval logicians, do not have a proper and determinate signification but rather modify the signification of the other terms in the propositions in which they occur. In his Sophismata, he followed William Heytesbury. In his analysis of epistemic verbs or of infinity, Albert admitted that a proposition has its own signification, which is not that of its terms: just like a syncategorematic term, a proposition signifies a ‚Äúmode of a thing.‚Äù Albert made use of the idea of the distinguishable signification of the proposition in defining truth and in dealing with ‚Äúinsolubles‚Äù or paradoxes of self-reference. In this work he shows that since every proposition, by its very form, signifies that it is true, an insoluble proposition will turn out to be false because it will signify at once both that it is true and that it is false. Albert also authored commentaries on Ars Vetus, a set of twenty-five Quaestiones logicales (c. 1356) that involved semantical problems and the status of logic, and Quaestiones on the Posterior Analytics. Albert explored in a series of disputed questions the status of logic and semantics, as well as the theory of reference and truth. Albert was influenced by English logicians and was influential in the diffusion of terminist logic in central Europe. Albert is considered a major contributor in his theory of consequences, found in his Perutilis Logica. Albert took a major step forward in the medieval theory of logical deduction. But it was his commentary on Aristotle's Physics that was especially widely read. Many manuscripts of it can be found in France and Italy, in Erfurt and Prague. Albert's Physics basically guaranteed the transmission of the Parisian tradition to Italy, where it was authoritative along with the works of Heytesbury and John Dumbleton. His commentary on Aristotle's De caelo was also influential, eventually eclipsing Buridan's commentary on this text. Blasius of Parma read it in Bologna between 1379 and 1382. A little later, it enjoyed a wide audience at Vienna. His Treatise on Proportions was often quoted in Italy where, in addition to the texts of Thomas Bradwardine and Oresme, it influenced the application of the theory of proportions to motion. Albert's commentaries on the Nicomachean Ethics and the Economics also survive (both unedited), as well as several short mathematical texts, most notably Tractatus proportionum (c. 1353). Although Albert studied theology in Paris, no theological writing survived. Albert played an essential role in the diffusion throughout Italy and central Europe of Parisian ideas which bore the mark of Buridan's teachings, but which were also clearly shaped by Albert's own grasp of English innovations. At the same time, Albert was not merely a compiler of the work of others. He knew how to construct proofs of undeniable originality on many topics in logic and physics.

The album title was simply Squeeze in the United Kingdom, but in the United States, Canada, Australia and other countries the album, like the band, was marketed under the name U.K. Squeeze to avoid confusion with similarly-named American and Australian groups. The LP was produced by John Cale, except for \\"Take Me I'm Yours\\" and \\"Bang Bang\\" (also the only singles released from the LP). Those songs were produced by the band.  Writing and recording  According to Glenn Tilbrook the process for making their first album was rewarding but also frustrating: \\"For me, U.K. Squeeze wasn‚Äôt really very representative of what we were doing at the time. When we worked with John Cale in the studio, he threw out all the songs that we had written. When most bands make their first album, they go in and do a lot of stuff that‚Äôs been going down well in their sets; well, that wasn‚Äôt the case with us. He told us to write new songs ‚Äì which we did. He was an inspirational guy to work with, but I felt that it was almost like we were writing for what he wanted rather than what the band itself was. When you‚Äôre in a position to be making a first album, it‚Äôs (A) awe-inspiring to be making an album, and (B) difficult to assert yourself against somebody who knows the ropes.\\" Bud Scoppa with Darryl Morden Music Connection, 25 January 1988 Chris Difford's approach to writing the lyrics for the album was different as well. According to an interview with Bud Scoppa, Difford found the process of working with their producer John Cale to be challenging: \\"I remember, he came up and said, 'Lyrically, you‚Äôre quite soft; have you ever thought about writin‚Äô about musclemen?' I said, 'That‚Äôs never occurred to me, actually.' And he said, 'Well, go away and do it ‚Äì I wanna see songs like that on the album.' So my perception of what the band was at that point was completely different from the way he saw it, obviously. He had us doing some awfully strange things.\\" Bud Scoppa with Darryl Morden Music Connection, 25 January 1988  Release  The initial A&M; Canada and A&M; U.S. LP pressings were released on limited edition red vinyl. In 1997, the CD was released in the UK with two bonus tracks, as part of the Six of One... box set. The set included the band's first six studio albums, each digitally remastered. These CDs were made available for individual purchase in 1998. In 2007, the album was digitally remastered and released in Japan. It contains 4 bonus tracks, one of which is a single edit of Take Me I'm Yours. The other bonus tracks are taken from B-sides from the singles of the album. It also contains the bonus tracks from the 1997 re-release. Critical reception  Village Voice critic Robert Christgau wrote: \\"Musically, the instrumental is the only boring cut on the whole first side, but the record as a whole is a case study in excitingly adequate hard rock craftsmanship spoiled by trashy literature. When a band obviously influenced by Queen, Rock Scene, muscle mags, and boarding-school porn finishes off by advising their postpunk admirers to 'get smart,' it sounds like they want 'em to stop reading Hustler and start reading Oui.\\" The album received a negative retrospective review from Allmusic, who said that producer John Cale forced Squeeze to pursue a musical direction that ran contrary to their inclinations. They singled out the two tracks produced by the band themselves as the only ones which show any sign of the artistic success they would later reach.

She taught and did research at the California State University, Long Beach, until she retired in the late 1990s. While there, she founded the Center for the Educational Applications of Brain Hemisphere Research. Professional life She received a Bachelor's in Art from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA, 1947), a Master's of Art from California State University, Northridge, and a Doctorate in Art, Education, and Psychology from UCLA (1976). Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain has remained the dominant book on its subject, used as a standard text in many art schools, and has been translated and published in many foreign languages, including French, Spanish, German, Polish, Hungarian Chinese and Japanese. Her company, Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, develops special drawing tools, materials, and videos to help individuals learn to draw. An artist and painter, she taught at high school level in the Los Angeles public school district (Venice High School), then at community college, and from 1978 until her retirement in 1991, in the Art Department at California State University, Long Beach. All of her teaching experience has been in art: drawing, painting, art history, art-teacher training, and color theory. In addition to teaching drawing workshops around the world, she has also done business consulting with major national and international corporations to enhance creative problem solving. =Theories on drawing and brain function= Edwards's method of drawing and teaching was revolutionary when she published it in 1979. It received an immediate positive response, and is now widely accepted by artists, teachers, and others around the world. Underlying the method is the notion that the brain has two ways of perceiving and processing reality ‚Äì one verbal and analytic, the other visual and perceptual. Edwards' method advocates suppressing the former in favor of the latter. It focuses on disregarding preconceived notions of what the drawn object should look like, and on individually \\"seeing\\". Drawing, says Edwards, has five component skills of perception and drawing:Edwards, p. xviii‚Äìxix, 96, 117, 163 * Edges and lines (includes copying drawings and contour drawing exercises) * Negative space (i.e. space between items) * Relationships (i.e. perspective and proportion between things) * Light and shadows (shading) * The whole: gestalt which emerges as the first four are taught Edwards, p. xix} Then there are two additional skills, numbers 6 and 7:Edwards, p. 250‚Äì252} * Drawing from memory * Drawing from imagination Edwards's early work was based in part on her understanding of neuroscience, especially the cerebral hemisphere research which suggested that the two hemispheres of the brain have different functions. To avoid the so-called \\"location controversy\\" (how the two major cognitive functions are distributed in the individual brain depending on handedness and other factors), she termed the modes \\"L-mode\\" and \\"R-mode.\\" These designations appeared in the original 1979 edition of \\"Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\\" She described L-mode as basically a verbal, analytic, sequential mode of thinking, and R-mode as basically visual, perceptual, and global.

It was issued on Mushroom Records in Australia and was Kelly's first solo studio album after disbanding his previous group, The Messengers. Tracks 1‚Äì10 were recorded at three Los Angeles studios while tracks 11‚Äì13 were recorded in Melbourne. It was produced by Kelly, Randy Jacobs and David Bridie. The cover art for Wanted Man is a colophon rendering of Australia's legendary outlaw Ned Kelly (no relation) as a guitarist and was painted by David Band. The album peaked at No. 11 on the ARIA Albums Chart and resulted in Kelly being nominated for 'Best Male Artist' at the ARIA Music Awards of 1995. Three singles were issued from the album, \\"Song from the Sixteenth Floor\\", \\"Love Never Runs on Time\\" and \\"God's Hotel\\" (co-written with Nick Cave) ‚Äì but none reached the ARIA Singles Chart. Background Paul Kelly's first solo studio album after disbanding Paul Kelly & The Messengers was Wanted Man. The group had given their last performance in August 1991, and Kelly resumed his solo career. He justified his decision: \\"We forged a style together. But I felt if we had kept going it would have got formulaic and that's why I broke it up. I wanted to try and start moving into other areas, start mixing things up\\". Kelly's first post-Messengers solo release was the live double CD Live, May 1992, released in November 1992. Kelly had already relocated to Los Angeles and signed with Vanguard Records to tour the US as a solo artist. While in Los Angeles he produced fellow Australian Ren√©e Geyer's album Difficult Woman (1994). Recording and composition In late 1992, when living in Los Angeles, Kelly recorded ten tracks for his next album, Wanted Man, at three studios: Stagg St, Clearlake and O'Henry. Kelly returned to Australia in 1993 and had a book collection of lyrics published, aptly titled Lyrics. In Melbourne he recorded three more tracks at the Metropolis Studio. The album was produced by Kelly, Randy Jacobs (member of Was (Not Was)) and David Bridie (produced My Friend the Chocolate Cake's 1991 self-titled album). Jacobs and Kelly co-wrote \\"Ball and Chain\\". The first track, \\"Summer Rain\\", deals with a man's yearning for his girlfriend, Kelly thought the sentiment would translate well but found a curious Belgian interviewer asked, \\"But why would anybody long for rain in summer? ... We get enough rain in winter. We don't want the summer rain. We want the sunshine\\". The lead single, \\"Songs from the Sixteenth Floor\\" was written by Kelly with John Clifforth of Deckchairs Overboard. The next single, \\"Love Never Runs on Time\\" was written by Kelly. The lyrics describe a truck driver struggling to meet his commitments to work and family. Kelly uses the same protagonist from \\"To Her Door\\" on 1987's Under the Sun and then again in 1996's \\"How to Make Gravy\\" from the extended play How to Make Gravy. In the first song, the man moves from being newly married to having children and problems with a drug addiction and undergoing rehab to returning to the family home. By the time of \\"How to Make Gravy\\", the man is in prison for assault and is writing a letter to his brother for Christmas. In 2002 Debbie Kruger of Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) interviewed Kelly and found, \\"Kelly‚Äôs attraction to the theatrical, however unconscious, has meant occasionally a song‚Äôs character will pop up again, sometimes unintentionally\\". Kelly conceded the three songs were linked, \\"'I‚Äôve got a feeling it‚Äôs the same guy. He keeps coming back'. Maybe he‚Äôll be in a happier place next time? 'Yeah, he‚Äôs a bit of a fuck-up, that guy', Kelly laughs\\". The final single, \\"God's Hotel\\" was co-written with Nick Cave. Kelly had read Cave's book of lyrics, King Ink (1988), and found \\"God's Hotel\\". When interviewing Cave for a newspaper article in The Age, Kelly asked about the lyrics, Cave said \\"It's just a blues ... You can use the words if you want\\". Kelly only used five of twelve verses and adapted the tune from the chords of \\"Bittersweet\\" by Hoodoo Gurus. \\"Everybody Wants to Touch Me\\" describes how a pregnant woman becomes the object of curiosity, wonder or revulsion. Although some believe the song relates to a celebrity being the centre of attention (see Paul Kapsis' cover version). In 2000 Kelly's friend Deborah Conway recorded her version for The Women at the Well tribute album. Kelly noted \\"I don't like all covers of my songs but I have to say this one's awesome. Absolutely\\". \\"Lately\\" was co-written with Geyer and followed their work on the soundtrack for the ABC-TV mini series The Seven Deadly Sins, Geyer and Kelly sang alongside Vika Bull and Conway for the 13 tracks. The cover art for Wanted Man is a colophon rendering of Australia's legendary outlaw Ned Kelly (no relation) as a guitarist and was painted by David Band. Reception and charting Wanted Man peaked at No. 11 on the ARIA Albums Chart and resulted in Kelly being nominated for 'Best Male Artist' at the ARIA Music Awards of 1995. Three singles were issued from the album, \\"Song from the Sixteenth Floor\\" (January 1994), \\"Love Never Runs on Time\\" (May) and \\"God's Hotel\\" (September) ‚Äì but none reached the ARIA Singles Chart. Rolling Stones Paul Corio observed that having Ned Kelly on the cover \\"makes perfect sense. Keeping a low profile Down Under, Paul Kelly periodically emerges with albums that raid the storehouse of critical praise, then he retreats to mine poetic gold\\". Corio felt the music was \\"folk, reggae, midtempo rock, jazz-inflected pop and hard-edged ballads ‚Äì Kelly swings them all deftly\\". Allmusic's William Ruhlmann was less favourable and said \\"[it] was familiar folk-rock, with Kelly singing romantic lyrics over acoustic and electric guitars and a rhythm section. Wanted Man was less ambitious lyrically than some of Kelly's earlier albums\\".

The term \\"trailer\\" dates back to the distribution of movies on reels of film. The reels were always distributed un-rewound (the theater about to show the film first had to rewind it, as early experience showed the danger of expecting an incoming film to have been rewound). Therefore, the end of the movie was the most accessible part, to which previews were spliced, \\"trailing\\" the film. Movie trailers have now become popular on DVDs and Blu-ray discs, as well as on the Internet and mobile devices. Of some 10 billion videos watched online annually, film trailers rank third, after news and user-created video. The trailer format has also been adopted as a promotional tool for television shows, video games, books, and theatrical events/concerts.  History  The African Queen (1951). The first trailer shown in an American film theater was in November 1913, when Nils Granlund, the advertising manager for the Marcus Loew theater chain, produced a short promotional film for the musical The Pleasure Seekers, opening at the Winter Garden Theatre on Broadway. As reported in a wire service story carried by the Lincoln, Nebraska Daily Star, the practice which Loew adopted was described as \\"an entirely new and unique stunt\\", and that \\"moving pictures of the rehearsals and other incidents connected with the production will be sent out in advance of the show, to be presented to the Loew's picture houses and will take the place of much of the bill board advertising\\".\\"Movies Score on Legit in New York;\\" Lincoln, Nebraska Daily Star; November 9, 1913; Page 25 Granlund was also first to introduce trailer material for an upcoming motion picture, using a slide technique to promote an upcoming film featuring Charlie Chaplin at Loew's Seventh Avenue Theatre in Harlem in 1914.Blondes, Brunettes, and Bullets, Granlund, N.T.; Van Rees Press, NY, 1957, Page 53 Trailers were initially shown after, or \\"trailing\\", the feature film, and this led to their being called \\"trailers\\". The practice was found to be somewhat ineffective, often ignored by audiences who left immediately after the feature. Later, exhibitors changed their practice so that trailers were only one part of the film program, which included cartoon shorts, newsreels, and serial adventure episodes. Today, more elaborate trailers and commercial advertisements have largely replaced other forms of pre-feature entertainment, and in major multiplex chains, about the first 20 minutes after the posted showtime is devoted to trailers. Up until the late 1950s, trailers were mostly created by National Screen Service and consisted of various key scenes from the film being advertised, often augmented with large, descriptive text describing the story, and an underscore generally pulled from studio music libraries. Most trailers had some form of narration, and those that did featured stentorian voices. In the early 1960s, the face of motion picture trailers changed. Textless, montage trailers and quick-editing became popular, largely due to the arrival of the \\"new Hollywood\\" and techniques that were becoming increasingly popular in television. Among the trend setters were Stanley Kubrick with his montage trailers for Lolita (1962), Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964), and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). Kubrick's main inspiration for the Dr. Strangelove trailer was the short film Very Nice, Very Nice (1961) by Canadian film visionary Arthur Lipsett. Pablo Ferro, who pioneered the techniques Kubrick required as necessary elements for the success of his campaign, created the Dr. Strangelove trailer, as well as the award-winning trailer for A Clockwork Orange (1971). Attack! (1956). The Wolverine (2013), a 'modern' film trailer. Many home videos contain trailers for other movies produced by the same company scheduled to be available shortly after the legal release of the video, so as not to spend money advertising the videos on TV. Most VHS tapes would play them at the beginning of the tape, but some VHS tapes contained previews at the end of the film or at both ends of the tape. VHS tapes that contained trailers at the end usually reminded the viewer to \\"Stay tuned after the feature for more previews.\\" With DVDs and Blu-rays, trailers can operate as a bonus feature instead of having to watch through the trailers before the film.  Definition  Trailers consist of a series of selected shots from the film being advertised. Since the purpose of the trailer is to attract an audience to the film, these excerpts are usually drawn from the most exciting, funny, or otherwise noteworthy parts of the film but in abbreviated form and usually without producing spoilers. For this purpose the scenes are not necessarily in the order in which they appear in the film. A trailer has to achieve that in less than 2 minutes and 30 seconds, the maximum length allowed by the MPAA. Each studio or distributor is allowed to exceed this time limit once a year, if they feel it is necessary for a particular film. In January 2014, the movie theater trade group National Association of Theatre Owners issued an industry guideline asking that film distributors supply trailers that run no longer than two minutes, which is 30 seconds shorter than the prior norm. The guideline is not mandatory, and also allows for limited exceptions of a select few movies having longer trailers. Film distributors reacted coolly to the announcement. There had been no visible disputes on trailer running time prior to the guideline, which surprised many. Some trailers use \\"special shoot\\" footage, which is material that has been created specifically for advertising purposes and does not appear in the actual film. The most notable film to use this technique was Terminator 2: Judgment Day, whose trailer featured an elaborate special effect scene of a T-800 Terminator being assembled in a factory that was never intended to be in the film itself. Dimension Films also shot extra scenes for their 2006 horror remake, Black Christmas - these scenes were used in promotional footage for the film, but are similarly absent from the theatrical release. A trailer for the 2002 blockbuster Spider-Man had an entire action sequence especially constructed that involved escaping bank robbers in a helicopter getting caught in a giant web between the World Trade Center's two towers. However, after the September 11 attacks the studio pulled it from theaters. Walt Disney in a 1937 color film trailer for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. One of the most famous \\"special shoot\\" trailers is that used for the 1960s thriller Psycho, which featured director Alfred Hitchcock giving viewers a guided tour of the Bates Motel, eventually arriving at the infamous shower. At this point, the soft-spoken Hitchcock suddenly throws the shower curtain back to reveal Vera Miles with a blood-curdling scream. As the trailer, in fact, was made after completion of the film when Janet Leigh was no longer available for filming, Hitchcock had Miles don a blonde wig for the fleeting sequence. Since the title, \\"Psycho\\", instantly covers most of the screen, the switch went unnoticed by audiences for years until freeze-frame analysis clearly revealed that it was Vera Miles and not Janet Leigh in the shower during the trailer. There are dozens of companies that specialize in the creation of film trailers in Los Angeles and New York. The trailer may be created at agencies (such as The Cimarron Group, MOJO, The Ant Farm, Ben Cain, Aspect Ratio, Flyer Entertainment, Trailer Park, Buddha Jones) while the film itself is being cut together at the studio. Since the edited film does not exist at this point, the trailer editors work from rushes or dailies. Thus, the trailer may contain footage that is not in the final movie, or the trailer editor and the film editor may use different takes of a particular shot. Another common technique is including music on the trailer which does not appear on the movie's soundtrack. This is nearly always a requirement, as trailers and teasers are created long before the composer has even been hired for the film score‚Äîsometimes as much as a year ahead of the movie's release date‚Äîwhile composers are usually the last creative people to work on the film. Some trailers that incorporate material not in the film are particularly coveted by collectors, especially trailers for classic films. For example, in a trailer for Casablanca the character Rick Blaine says, \\"OK, you asked for it!\\" before shooting Major Strasser; this line of dialogue is not spoken in the final film.  Truth vs. misleading  Over the years, there have been many instances where trailers give misleading representations of their films. They may give the impression that a celebrity who only has a minor part in the film is one of the main cast members, or advertising a film as being more action-packed than it is. These tricks are usually done to draw in a larger audience. Sometimes the trailers include footage not from the film itself. This could be an artistic choice, or because the trailer was put together before the film's final cut, but at other times it is to give the audience a different impression of the movie. Then trailers could be misleading in a 'for the audience's own good' kind of way, in that a general audience would not usually see such a film due to preconceptions, and by bait and switching, they can allow the audience to have a great viewing experience that they would not ordinarily have. However, the opposite is true too, with the promise of great trailers being let down by mediocre films. An American woman sued the makers of Drive because their film \\"failed to live up to its promo's promise\\", although her lawsuit was dismissed.Deming v. CH Novi, L.L.C., No. 309989 (Mich. Ct. App. Oct. 15, 2013).Deming v. CH Novi, L.L.C., No. 148604 (Mich. Apr. 28, 2014). In August 2016, an American lawyer attempted to sue Suicide Squad for false advertising over lack of scenes including Joker.  Composition  Trailers tell the story of a film in a highly condensed fashion to have maximum appeal. In the decades since film marketing has become a large industry, trailers have become highly polished pieces of advertising, able to present even poor movies in an attractive light. Some of the elements common to many trailers are listed below. Trailers are typically made up of scenes from the film they are promoting, but sometimes contain deleted scenes from the film. The key ambition in trailer-making is to impart an intriguing story that gets film audiences emotionally involved. Most trailers have a three-act structure similar to a feature-length film. They start with a beginning (act 1) that lays out the premise of the story. The middle (act 2) drives the story further and usually ends with a dramatic climax. Act 3 usually features a strong piece of \\"signature music\\" (either a recognizable song or a powerful, sweeping orchestral piece). This last act often consists of a visual montage of powerful and emotional moments of the film and may also contain a cast run if there are noteworthy stars that could help sell the movie. Screenshot from film trailer for 1959 North by Northwest Voice-over narration is sometimes used to briefly set up the premise of the film and provide explanation when necessary, although this practice has declined in the years after the passing of voice-over artist Don LaFontaine. Since the trailer is a highly condensed format, voice-over is a useful tool to enhance the audience's understanding of the plot. Some of the best-known, modern-day trailer voice-over artists have been the aforementioned LaFontaine, Hal Douglas, Mark Elliott, John Leader, Corey Burton, George DelHoyo, Peter Cullen, Morgan Freeman, Ashton Smith, Jim Cummings, John Garry, Tom Kane, Nick Schatzki, Ben Patrick Johnson, Tony Rodgers, Beau Weaver, and Brian Cummings. Classic voice-over artists in film trailers of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s included Howard Strickling (for MGM), Lou Marcelle (for Warner Bros.), Art Gilmore, Knox Manning, Reed Hadley, Les Tremayne (for MGM), Fred Foy (for MGM), Karl Weber (for MGM) and Bob Marcato. Hollywood trailers of the classic film era were renowned for clich√©s such as \\"Colossal!\\", \\"Stupendous!\\", etc. Some trailers have used voice over clich√©s for satirical effect. This can be seen in trailers for films such as Jerry Seinfeld's Comedian and Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny. Music helps set the tone and mood of the trailer. Usually the music used in the trailer is not from the film itself (the film score may not have been composed yet). The music used in the trailer may be: * Music from the score of other movies. * Popular or well-known music, often chosen for its tone, appropriateness of a lyric or lack thereof, or recognizability. The most often used of these is O Fortuna from Carmina Burana by Carl Orff, as well as the works of E.S. Posthumus and Beethoven. Popular music may be selected for its tone (i.e. hard rock for an action film, lighter pop for a romantic comedy), or to establish context (e.g. the trailer for a film set in the 1940s might use big band swing). * \\"Library\\" music previously composed specifically to be used in advertising by an independent composer. There are many trailer music library companies which produce trailer music, some of the best known are audiomachine, Two Steps From Hell, Immediate Music and X-Ray Dog or SFX and Music libraries like the ones from Moss Landing, Gerrit Kinkel Productions or redCola. * Specially composed music. One of the most famous Hollywood trailer music composers, credited with creating the musical voice of contemporary trailers, is John Beal, who began scoring trailers in the 1970s and, in the course of a thirty-year career, created original music for over 2,000 film trailer projects, including 40 of the top-grossing films of all time, such as Star Wars, Forrest Gump, Titanic, Aladdin, Braveheart, Ghost, The Last Samurai and The Matrix. A cast run is a list of the stars that appear in the movie. If the director or producer is well-known or has made other popular movies, they often warrant a mention as well. Most trailers conclude with a billing block, which is a list of the principal cast and crew. It is the same list that appears on posters and print publicity materials, and also usually appears on- screen at the beginning (or end) of the movie. Studio production logos are usually featured near the beginning of the trailer. Until the late 1970s, they were put only at the end of the trailer or not used at all; however, Paramount Pictures was the first studio to use its actual studio logo at the beginning of its trailers in the 1940s. Often there will be logos for both the production company and distributor of the film. Many trailers are mixed in Dolby Digital or any other multichannel sound mix. Scenes including sound effects and music that are enhanced by stereophonic sound are therefore the focus point of many modern trailers. Trailers preceding feature films are generally presented in the same format as the feature, being either 35 mm film or a digital format. High bandwidth internet connections allow for trailers to be distributed online at any resolution. Since the advent of Digital 3‚ÄëD, it has become common for a 3‚ÄëD feature film to be preceded by one or more trailers that are also presented in 3‚ÄëD.  Collections  National Screen Service contracts required that trailers be returned (at the cinema's expense) or destroyed; however, it required no proof of destruction, and depositing them in a waste bin counted. A market for trailers evolved as it became clear that some had a commercial value to collectors. Many of the trailers for films like the Star Wars series reported as 'destroyed' were taken back out of the bin and sold by cinema staff. As they cost about $60 each to make (1981 estimate) and were hired to the cinema for $10, such losses led to NSS increasing its rental charges, which led to a decrease in the number of trailers rented and shown to audiences.\\"Coming Soon to a Theatre Near You - Maybe\\" in Ares 8, Schow, DJ; Simulations Publications, NY 1981, Page 33 Some cinemas also began to show \\"trailer trash\\" programs of trailers without a main feature. Similarly, several DVDs containing nothing but trailers for films, typically from exploitation film genres, have been produced for sale.  Other types of trailers  Beginning in the late 1990s to early 2000s, and along with the development of the Internet and sites such as YouTube as well as animation techniques, more types of trailers began to be created due to easier and cheaper costs to produce and show trailers. = Video game trailers = Beginning in the late 1990s to early 2000s, video game trailers have been produced as they have become more mainstream. Used to entice viewers to go out and play the game, game trailers are very useful. The content and production process is similar to that for movies, complicated by the need to convey the way the game plays. The trailer for Aliens: Colonial Marines, for example, featured graphics that were of a higher standard than the game that was eventually sold. Hideo Kojima, a game creator strongly influenced by Hollywood movies, edits the elaborate trailers for his own games from a special studio in his office. = TV spots = TV spots are trailers for movies shown on television that are often shortened to 30‚Äì60 seconds. These trailers are similar to green band trailers and have content \\"appropriate\\" for the channel. = TV show trailers = While not initially prevalent in television, TV show trailers started as a common form of advertisement in the late 2000s. They are often trailers advertising a new TV series, episode, event or marathon premiering on television. Trailers for the next episode of a TV series are often shown during or following the closing credits of the show. = Book trailer = A book trailer is a video advertisement for a book which employs techniques similar to those of movie trailers to promote books and encourage readers. These trailers can also be referred to as \\"video-podcasts\\", with higher quality trailers being called \\"cinematic book trailers\\". They are circulated on television and online in most common digital video formats. Common formats of book trailers include actors performing scenes from the book akin to a movie trailer, full production trailers, flash videos, animation or simple still photos set to music with text conveying the story. This differs from author readings and interviews, which consist of video footage of the author narrating a portion of their writing or being interviewed. Early book trailers consisted mostly of still images of the book, with some videos incorporating actors, with John Farris's book trailer for his 1986 novel Wildwood incorporating images from the book cover along with actors such as John Zacherle. In September 2007, the School Library Journal established the Trailie Award for the best book trailers. There are three categories: author/publisher created, student created and librarian/adult created. The award was announced at the School Library Journal Leadership Summit on the Future of Reading on October 22, 2010 in Chicago. In 2014, Dan Rosen and CV Herst established BookReels, a website dedicated to allowing publishers and authors to post book trailers and other multimedia, culminating in the annual BookReels Awards. BookReels lets readers browse and rate trailers, post comments and reviews, join discussion groups, and share BookReel discoveries. = Fan-made trailers = For popular movies, fans often make trailers on their own. These are unofficial videos by fans utilizing audio or video of a movie, studio trailer, animation techniques or fan-acted scenes replacing the video of the official trailer.  Awards  Every year there are two main events that give awards to outstanding film trailers: The Key Art Awards, presented by The Hollywood Reporter, and the Golden Trailer Awards. The Golden Trailer Awards and the Key Art Awards pick winners in all creative parts of film advertising, from trailers and TV spots to posters and print ads. The Golden Trailer Awards are currently expanding to add a sister event, The World Trailer Awards, to be a kickoff to the Cannes Film Festival in France, 2013. The yearly Key Art Awards ceremony is often held at the Dolby Theater in Hollywood. The Film Informant also recognizes movie marketing media and held the first annual TFI Awards in early January 2012. The site is the first to officially start recognizing and rating movie marketing media on a daily basis.

one of the oldest military awards of the United States Armed Forces. The U.S. Navy's variant of the Good Conduct Medal was established in 1869, the Marine Corps version in 1896, the Coast Guard version in 1923, the Army version in 1941, and the Air Force version in 1963; the Air Force Good Conduct Medal was temporarily discontinued from February 2006 to February 2009, followed by its subsequent reinstatement. Criteria The criteria for a Good Conduct Medal are defined by Executive Orders 8809, 9323, and 10444. The Good Conduct Medal, each one specific to one of the five branches of the U.S. Armed Forces, is currently awarded to any active duty enlisted member of the United States military who completes three consecutive years of \\"honorable and faithful service\\". Such service implies that a standard enlistment was completed without any non-judicial punishment, disciplinary infractions, or court martial offenses. If a service member commits an offense, the three-year mark \\"resets\\" and a service member must perform an additional three years of service without having to be disciplined, before the Good Conduct may be authorized. During times of war, the Good Conduct Medal may be awarded for one year of faithful service. The Good Conduct Medal may also be awarded posthumously, to any enlisted service member who dies in the line of duty. =Reserve components= Service for the Good Conduct Medal must be performed on active duty; with two exceptions, it is not awarded to enlisted members of the military reserve components, to include the Army National Guard and Air National Guard, for inactive part-time (e.g., \\"drilling\\") reserve duty or full-time Army Reserve Technician or Air Reserve Technician (ART) status, although enlisted reservists and national guardsmen are eligible if they complete sufficient active service via mobilization to active duty. This restriction does not apply to full-time active duty enlisted members in the Reserve Component, such as Army and Air Force personnel in an Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) status, Navy personnel in a Full Time Support (FTS), previously known as Training & Administration of the Reserve (TAR), and Marine Corps Active Reserve (AR) programs. On 1 January 2014, the Navy discontinued the Naval Reserve Meritorious Service Medal, a de facto Good Conduct Medal for Navy Reserve (formerly Naval Reserve) enlisted personnel. Since that date, all Navy enlisted personnel have received the Navy Good Conduct Medal, whether in a full-time active duty or a part-time drilling reserve status. The various services have established separate Reserve Good Conduct Medals, albeit under various names, as a comparable award available to enlisted Reserve and National Guard members who satisfactorily perform annual training, drill duty and any additional active duty of less than 3 consecutive years duration. The exception, as previously stated, is the United States Navy, which discontinued that service's separate award for Reserve Component enlisted personnel as of 1 January 2014. Enlisted Navy Reservists now earn time towards the Navy Good Conduct Medal, the same as the Active Component (e.g., Regular Navy) and any time previously earned towards an unawarded Naval Reserve Meritorious Service Medal is automatically carried over to the Navy Good Conduct Medal. Navy Good Conduct Medal The Navy Good Conduct Medal is the third oldest continuously awarded medal in the United States. The \\"U.S.N.\\" Type I medal was authorized on 26 April 1869 and was produced by E. V. Haughwout Company of New York. The medal was issued with a red, white and blue material suspension ribbon without a suspension pin. The medal is in the design of a Maltese cross and the name of the recipient was engraved on the reverse. The Navy Good Conduct Medal is the oldest Good Conduct Medal, dating back to 26 April 1869. There have been a total of four versions of the Navy Good Conduct Medal, the first version of which was issued from 1870 to 1884. The original Navy Good Conduct Medal was also not worn on a uniform, but issued with discharge papers as a badge to present during reenlistment. A sailor in the Navy received a new Good Conduct Medal for each honorable enlistment completed. The second version of the Navy Good Conduct Medal was issued between 1880 and 1884. The medal was considered a \\"transitional decoration\\" and was the first of the Good Conduct Medals to be worn on a uniform. The medal was phased out by 1885 and a new medal issued between 1885 and 1961. The new medal was a Good Conduct medallion suspended from an all red ribbon. Enlistment bars, denoting each honorable enlistment completed, were pinned on the ribbon as attachments. There was slight oddity during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War when the Navy created the Specially Meritorious Service Medal which also had an all red suspension and service ribbon. There were recorded cases of Navy enlisted personnel who were awarded both the Good Conduct Medal and the Specially Meritorious Service Medal who wore two red service ribbons on their Navy service uniforms. This is one of the rare times in the history of U.S. military awards that two awards had identical ribbons. In the 1950s bronze and silver 3/16 inch stars, with one silver star worn in lieu of five bronze stars (e.g., six awards), replaced the enlistment bars. Although the medal itself had not changed since 1884, in 1961 a ring suspension for the ribbon and medal combination was adopted, differentiating the suspension from its Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal counterpart and standardizing it with the majority of other service medals. It is this 1961 version of the Navy Good Conduct Medal that is still in use today. The current Navy Good Conduct Medal is issued to every active duty enlisted sailor who completes three years of honorable and faithful service since 1 January 1996. For prior awards to personnel between 1 November 1963 and 1 January 1996, four years of service were required. The four year requirement also applies for award of the Navy Good Conduct Medal from its original establishment until 1 November 1963. Additional awards of the Navy Good Conduct Medal are denoted by bronze and silver 3/16 inch stars; silver stars are worn in place of five bronze ones. The reverse side of the medal has three words, \\"FIDELITY ZEAL OBEDIENCE\\" superimposed in a semicircle. Upon 12 years of service, sailors are also allowed to wear gold-colored version of their petty officer insignia, something usually seen with those with the rate of chief petty officer or petty officer first class and above, but occasionally petty officer second class. Prior to June 2019, those 12 years had to be infraction-free. It is extremely rare in the contemporary U.S. Navy, but provisions do allow for sailors rated petty officer third class to wear gold rate insignia, provided they meet the same requirements.

Current USMC GCM The Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal was established on 20 July 1896. The medal was originally a ribbon and medal suspended from a clasp bearing the words \\"U.S. Marine Corps\\". The clasp was eliminated after 1935 and the medal has remained unchanged in appearance since that time. Since its inception in 1896, the name of the recipient was engraved by hand on the reverse side of the medal until stamping the name on the medal began during World War II (numbered on the rim) and was done completely by 1951. Prior to 10 December 1945, four years of honorable creditable enlisted service was required in the Marine Corps for award of the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal. After 10 December 1945, the required period of service was reduced to three years.SECNAVINST 1650.1H NAVY AND MARINE CORPS AWARDS MANUAL. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2014-05-24. Since that latter date, members of the Marine Corps must have three consecutive years of honorable and faithful service in order to be eligible for the medal. In 1953, the Marine Corps adopted bronze and silver 3/16-inch service stars to denote additional awards of the Good Conduct Medal, replacing enlistment bars showing each honorable period of service. Coast Guard Good Conduct Medal The Coast Guard Good Conduct Medal was authorized by the Commandant on 18 May 1921, but not designed until 1923 and originally used enlistment bars as attachments, in the same manner as the Marine Corps and Navy Good Conduct Medals. In 1966, the Coast Guard began using bronze and silver 3/16-inch service stars to denote additional awards of the Coast Guard Good Conduct Medal. Army Good Conduct Medal The Army Good Conduct Medal Reverse The Army Good Conduct Medal was established by Executive Order 8809, dated 28 June 1941, and authorized the award for soldiers completing three years active service after that date. The criteria were amended by Executive Order 9323, dated 31 March 1943, to authorize the award for enlisted soldiers having three years of service after 27 August 1940 or one year of service after 7 December 1941 while the United States is at war. Executive Order 10444, dated 10 April 1953, revised the criteria to authorize the award for soldiers having three years of service after 27 August 1940; one year of service after 7 December 1941 while the United States is at war; and for soldiers having the first award for service after 27 June 1950 upon termination of service, for periods less than three years, but more than one year. *The medal was designed by Mr. Joseph Kiselewski and approved by the Secretary of War on 30 October 1942. ::The eagle, with wings spread, denotes vigilance and superiority. ::The horizontal sword denotes loyalty, ::The book represents knowledge acquired and ability gained. ::On the reverse, the lone star denotes merit. ::The wreath of laurel and oak leaves denotes reward and strength. Subsequent Award Clasps *The second and subsequent awards are indicated by the wear of the clasp with loops on the ribbon. ::Bronze clasps indicate the second (two loops) through fifth award (five loops); ::Silver clasps indicate sixth (one loop) through tenth award (five loops); and ::Gold clasps indicate eleventh (one loop) through the fifteenth award (five loops). Officially, the Good Conduct Medal is awarded for exemplary behavior, efficiency, and fidelity in active Federal Military service. It is awarded on a selective basis to each soldier who distinguishes himself/herself from among his/her fellow soldiers by their exemplary conduct, efficiency, and fidelity throughout a specified period of continuous enlisted active Federal military service. Qualifying periods of service include each three years completed after 27 August 1940 or, for first award only, upon completion of at least one year upon termination of service if separated prior to three years. Also for the first award only, for those individuals who died before completing one year of active Federal military service if the death occurred in the line of duty. The immediate commander must approve the award and the award must be announced in permanent orders. The \\"loops\\" indicating subsequent awards were called \\"hitches\\", a \\"hitch\\" being three years of service. During the Vietnam War it was known as the \\"Dentyne wrapper\\" (chewing gum brand) owing to it being red and white like the medal's suspension ribbon. Air Force Good Conduct Medal AFGCM The Air Force Good Conduct Medal is the last version of the Good Conduct Medal. The medal was authorized by Congress on 6 July 1960, but not created until 1 June 1963. Air Force personnel were issued the Army Good Conduct Medal between 1947 and 1963 and for those serving both before and after 1963, the Army and Air Force Good Conduct Medals could be worn simultaneously on an Air Force uniform. The Air Force version is the same as the Army version, except that the suspension and service ribbons for the medals are different for each medal. The Air Force Good Conduct Medal has remained unchanged in appearance since its original design over fifty years ago. Additional awards of the Air Force Good Conduct Medal are denoted by bronze or silver oak leaf clusters. The criteria for award of the Air Force Good Conduct medal are as follows: It is awarded to Air Force enlisted personnel during a three-year period of active military service or for a one- year period of service during a time of war. Those airmen who were awarded this medal must have had character and efficiency ratings of excellent or higher throughout the qualifying period including time spent in attendance at service schools, and there must have been no convictions of court martial or non-judicial punishment during this period. In October 2005, the 97th Air Force Uniform Board met and considered discontinuing the Good Conduct Medal with the rationale that good conduct of airmen is the expected standard, not an exceptional occurrence worthy of recognition. The decision was finalized on 8 February 2006 and the medal was no longer issued. Those airmen who had previously earned the Good Conduct Medal were still authorized to wear it. By May 2008, however, Air Force officials began reconsidering the policy. On 11 February 2009, the medal was reinstated and made retroactive to 8 February 2006, with all eligible recipients being awarded the medal automatically.

She has issued seven albums, Quiet Girl with a Credit Card (1996), As Far as a Life Goes (1999), Car Tape (2002), Version Originale (2003), Morning in the Bowl of Night (2007), Car Tape 2 (2010) and Meet the Misses (2012). She has a clear, bitter-sweet voice and provides poignant semi-biographical lyrics. At the ARIA Music Awards she has been nominated nine times.  Biography  Lisa Miller is the daughter of social realist painter, Peter Miller, and grew up in the Melbourne suburb of Chadstone with her elder brother Lewis Miller (born 1959), who is also a painter, and a younger brother Paul Miller. Lewis won the 1998 Archibald Prize. Miller started writing songs at fourteen and has memories of being in a folk music duo with a friend, Tracey, \\"I played flute, she played guitar and sang, and we wore matching paisley dresses that went to the floor, and played at coffee houses where people drank hot chocolates with marshmallows.\\" Tracey later married Miller's brother Paul to become Tracey Miller, and, as from 2005, was also a country music singer-songwriter. While working as a secondary school teacher, Miller's first rock group were the Hepeleptics, in 1986. She became vocalist and rhythm guitarist for the Whole Shebang in the following year. Miller wrote their track, \\"Another Sunday Morning\\", Note: For additional work user may have to select 'Search again' and then 'Enter a title:' &/or 'Performer:' which appeared on a various artists' compilation album, The Preston Story, Vol. 1, in 1995 via Canetoad Records. She also sang in the Everlovin' O'Sheas, with Andy Baylor, Rick O'Shea and Warren Rough in 1988. In 1989 she travelled to the United States to hear music in Memphis, Nashville, Austin, New Orleans and San Francisco. Miller returned to Melbourne in 1990 and re-joined Baylor in the Prestones, alongside Steve Mander, Victor O'Neill, Graeme Thomas and Gary Young. She formed her own roots rock band, the Trailblazers (1990‚Äì91), on lead vocals with Mark Ferrie (ex- Models, Sacred Cowboys) on bass guitar, Nick Grant on guitar, Martin Lubran on pedal steel guitar and Tony Thornton on drums.Lisa Miller associated entries at Australian Rock Database: * Lisa Miller: * Truckasaurus (1993‚Äì94): Miller and Ferrie renamed the group as Truckasaurus in 1993 with additional members, Ed Bates on guitar and Graham Lee on pedal steel guitar. They favoured original material by Miller or Ferrie and issued a self-titled album in 1993 before Miller left to be replaced by Kaarin Fairfax on lead vocals in 1994. In 1994 Miller went solo and released two extended plays on the In-Law label: Do That for You (May 1995) and All Worked Out (November). The first EP had four tracks with co-production by Miller with Steve Hoy and Gordon Blake, and recorded at the Gershwin Room, Esplanade Hotel, Melbourne. The second EP had five tracks and was co-produced with Shane O'Mara and recorded at O'Mara's home studio, Yikesville, \\"[with] an ADAT recorder and a couple of cheap delay units in the spare bedroom, rather than the sophisticated backyard operation it is today. Lisa is adamant that she came up with the name 'Yikesville' during this session, but Shane doesn't believe her\\". O'Mara mixed it, \\"one night when the ARIA awards were on (the year Silverchair and Tim Rogers did 'New Race'). Lisa and Rebecca spent the evening glued to the telly, while Shane and Ben [Lempriere] got progressively drunker over the 8-track Mackie desk.\\" Her debut album, Quiet Girl with a Credit Card, followed in June 1996 on the W.Minc label and distributed by Shock Records. It had been recorded in April 1995 with former bandmate, Graham Lee, producing at Fortissimo Studios, South Melbourne. Dave Dawson of Impress Magazine observed that Miller's US trip, \\"with country radio as a sporadic soundtrack, was the fertile fuel which prompted her to quit teaching when she arrived home, manage stores selling Americana gear and sing for her supper in Suburban bars.\\" He felt that, \\"The long gestation period for this album has been a blessing ‚Äì songs that began life in one guise have, by osmosis, developed new cloaks... country and western... is a far cry from Ms Miller's eclectic mix of country, funk, folk and pop.\\" It was also issued in the United Kingdom on Demon Records, to date her only release outside of Australia. Three years later her second album, As Far as a Life Goes (June 1999), appeared on the W.Minc label, albeit via the now-defunct, Festival Mushroom Records. It was produced by Barry Palmer (Deadstar, Mark Seymour, Christopher Marshall) at Sing Sing Studios, Richmond in September 1998. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1999 she was nominated for Best Female Artist for As Far as a Life Goes. After sorting out troubles with her record companies, Miller released an album, Car Tape, of cover versions in May 2002 for the fledgling Melbourne label, Raoul Records, which is run by her husband, Ben Lempriere. It found her in a country-soul vein and was a critical success. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, felt it was, \\"a delightful and idiosyncratic collection of songs.\\" Her material was mostly by US singer- songwriters including, Arthur Alexander, Karen Dalton, Charlie Rich and Townes Van Zandt. She also provided her rendition of Tim Rogers' \\"Word for Sadness\\", which appeared on You Am I's fifth album, Deliverance in September. According to Miller it was named for, \\"grimy cassettes which get stuck, and you have to stick a pen into the reel to wind them up. And they're funny songs that someone puts on a tape because they're special to them, and they're often a bit odd.\\" Car Tape was produced, recorded and mixed by O'Mara at his studio, at various times during 2000 and 2001. It peaked at No. 8 on the ARIA Hitseekers Albums and No. 24 on the ARIA Alternative Albums chart. O'Mara later recalled, \\"It was sort of when everything clicked and I found my feet or something. It was through that album that I met Tim Rogers who told me he loved what I did on Lisa's album.\\" She received three more ARIA Music Award nominations in 2002: for Best Female Artist, Best Independent Release and Best Adult Contemporary Album for Car Tape. It was one of the best-selling Australian independent releases of 2002. In 2003 she released her fourth album, Version Originale, a CD of original compositions, that was also warmly received by critics. With her band, featuring guitarist and producer, O'Mara, Miller has been a sporadic live performer in and around Melbourne, with forays up the east coast of Australia, including the Byron Bay Blues Festival. She has played with Billy Bragg and toured Australia with Neil Young and Nick Cave. She has also appeared on recordings by Australian musicians David McComb, Tim Rogers, Tex Perkins, Andy Baylor, Barb Waters, Doug Mansfield, Amanda Brown (of The Go-Betweens) and David Chesworth. At one time she was managed by the late Mick Geyer (close associate of Nick Cave), but is now self-managed. In 2004 Miller released the EP, Pushover, which features five songs recorded live on the 2003 Neil Young tour. She was again nominated in the Best Female Artist category at the 2004 ARIA Awards, at which ‚Äì once again ‚Äì she was beaten by Kasey Chambers. Miller collaborated with composer Amanda Brown on a number of songs for the feature film, Look Both Ways, but only one track, \\"Eleven\\", made the final selection. In 2005 she recorded a version of the Split Enz song \\"I Hope I Never\\" for She Will Have Her Way, a tribute album of female Australian and New Zealand artists performing the works of Tim and Neil Finn. This album was nominated for a 2006 ARIA award under \\"Best Adult Contemporary Artist\\". Her fifth album, Morning in the Bowl of Night, was released in March 2007, many of the songs focussing around the death of Miller's mother. In early 2008, Morning in the Bowl of Night, was shortlisted for the Australian Music Prize.

It is commonly used for the transport of goods and materials. Sometimes recreational vehicles, travel trailers, or mobile homes with limited living facilities where people can camp or stay have been referred to as trailers. In earlier days, many such vehicles were towable trailers.  United States  dolly In the United States, the term is sometimes used interchangeably with travel trailer and mobile home, varieties of trailers and manufactured housing designed for human habitation. Their origins lay in utility trailers built in a similar fashion to horse-drawn wagons. A trailer park is an area where mobile homes are placed for habitation. In the United States trailers ranging in size from single-axle dollies to 6-axle, high, long semi-trailers are commonplace. The latter, when towed as part of a tractor-trailer or \\"18-wheeler\\", carries a large percentage of the freight that travels over land in North America. Types of trailers ACP Backtracking genset trailer Some trailers are made for personal (or small business) use with practically any powered vehicle having an appropriate hitch, but some trailers are part of large trucks called semi-trailer trucks for transportation of cargo. Enclosed toy trailers and motorcycle trailers can be towed by commonly accessible pickup truck or van, which generally require no special permit beyond a regular driver's license. Specialized trailers like open-air motorcycle trailers, bicycle trailers are much smaller, accessible to small automobiles, as are some simple trailers, pulled by a drawbar and riding on a single set of axles. Other trailers, such as utility trailers and travel trailers or campers come in single and multiple axle varieties, to allow for varying sizes of tow vehicles. There also exist highly specialized trailers, such as genset trailers, pusher trailers and their ilk that are also used to power the towing vehicle. Others are custom-built to hold entire kitchens and other specialized equipment used by carnival vendors. There are also trailers for hauling boats. = Bicycle trailer = = Construction trailer = =Travel trailer= A custom-made popup camper trailer Popular campers use lightweight trailers, aerodynamic trailers that can be towed by a small car, such as the BMW Air Camper. They are built to be lower than the tow vehicle, minimizing drag. Others range from two-axle campers that can be pulled by most mid-sized pickups to trailers that are as long as the host country's law allows for drivers without special permits. Larger campers tend to be fully integrated recreational vehicles, which often are used to tow single-axle dolly trailers to allow the users to bring small cars on their travels. =Semi-trailer= A semi-trailer is a trailer without a front axle. A large proportion of its weight is supported either by a road tractor or by a detachable front axle assembly known as a dolly. A semi-trailer is normally equipped with legs, called \\"landing gear\\", which can be lowered to support it when it is uncoupled. In the United States, a single trailer cannot exceed a length of on interstate highways (unless a special permit is granted), although it is possible to link two smaller trailers together to a maximum length of . Semi-trailers vary considerably in design, ranging from open- topped grain haulers through Tautliners to normal-looking but refrigerated x enclosures (\\"reefers\\"). Many semi-trailers are part of semi-trailer trucks. Other types of semi-trailers include dry vans, flatbeds and chassis. Many commercial organizations choose to rent or lease semi-trailer equipment rather than own their own semi-trailers, to free up capital and to keep trailer debt from appearing on their balance sheet. =Full trailer= Full trailer with steered axle A full trailer is a term used in the United States for a freight trailer supported by front and rear axles and pulled by a drawbar. In Europe this is known as an A-frame drawbar trailer. A commercial freight trailer is wide and long. As per AIS 053, full trailer is a towed vehicle having at least two axles, and equipped with a towing device which can move vertically in relation to the trailer and controls the direction of the front axle(s), but which transmits no significant static load to the towing vehicle. This style of trailer is also popular for use with farm tractors. =Close-coupled trailer= A close-coupled trailer A close-coupled trailer is fitted with a rigid towbar which projects from its front and hooks onto a hook on the tractor. It does not pivot as a drawbar does. =Motorcycle trailer= Interior of an enclosed motorcycle trailer A motorcycle trailer may be a trailer designed to haul motorcycles behind an automobile or truck. Such trailers may be open or enclosed, ranging in size from trailers capable of carrying several motorcycles or only one. They may be designed specifically to carry motorcycles, with ramps and tie-downs, or may be a utility trailer adapted permanently or occasionally to haul one or more motorcycles. Another type of motorcycle trailer is a wheeled frame with a hitch system designed for transporting cargo by motorcycle. Motorcycle trailers are often narrow and styled to match the appearance of the motorcycle they are intended to be towed behind. There are two-wheeled versions and single-wheeled versions. Single- wheeled trailers, such as the Unigo or Pav 40/41, are designed to allow the bike to have all the normal flexibility of a motorcycle, usually using a universal joint to enable the trailer to lean and turn with the motorcycle. No motorcycle manufacturer recommends that its motorcycles be used to tow a trailer because it creates additional safety hazards for motorcyclists. =Livestock trailer= A horse trailer There is a number of different styles of trailers used to haul livestock such as cattle and horses. The most common is the stock trailer, a trailer that is enclosed on the bottom, but has openings at approximately the eye level of the animals to allow ventilation. The horse trailer is a more elaborate form of stock trailer. Because horses are usually hauled for the purpose of competition or work, where they must be in peak physical condition, horse trailers are designed for the comfort and safety of the animals. They usually have adjustable vents and windows as well as suspension designed to provide a smooth ride and less stress on the animals. In addition, horse trailers have internal partitions that assist the animal in staying upright during travel and protect horses from injuring each other in transit. Larger horse trailers may incorporate additional storage areas for horse tack and may even include elaborate living quarters with sleeping areas, bathroom and cooking facilities, and other comforts. Both stock trailers and horse trailers range in size from small units capable of holding one to three animals, able to be pulled by a pickup truck or even an SUV; to large semi-trailers that can haul a significant number of animals. = Boat trailer = = Trailer (Rail Coach) = A trailer in rail terms is an unpowered coach or vehicle usually found in and . They generally intermediate coaches within the consist and sometimes have driving facilities (called ). They not only provide extra passenger facilities, but they can carry auxiliary equipment (Eg the braking system, air conditioning, etc) for, usually, an EMU set, where space is limited. Hitching a trailer Trailer-hitch on a large vehicle A trailer hitch, fifth-wheel coupling or other type of tow hitch is needed to draw a trailer with a car, truck or other traction engine. =Ball and socket= A trailer coupler is used to secure the trailer to the towing vehicle. The trailer coupler attaches to the trailer ball. This forms a ball and socket connection to allow for relative movement between the towing vehicle and trailer while towing over uneven road surfaces. The trailer ball is mounted to the rear bumper or to a draw bar, which may be removable. The draw bar is secured to the trailer hitch by inserting it into the hitch receiver and pinning it. The three most common types of couplers are straight couplers, A-frame couplers, and adjustable couplers. Bumper-pull hitches and draw bars can exert tremendous leverage on the tow vehicle making it harder to recover from a swerving situation. =Fifth wheel and gooseneck= A gooseneck trailer attached to a pickup truck Tandem axle dually pickup truck with gooseneck trailer These are available for loads between . Both the hitches are better than a receiver hitch and allow a more efficient and central attachment of a large trailer to the tow vehicle. These hitch types are designed for pickup truck bed. They are able to haul large loads without disrupting the stability of the vehicle. Traditional hitches are connected to the vehicle back but these are attached to the truck bed, which make them better for making sharp turns and cutting tight corners. Both styles have trailers attach to a coupler mounted above the axle within the bed of the tow vehicle such as a flat deck or pickup truck. A fifth-wheel coupling is also referred to as a kingpin hitch and is a smaller version of the semi-trailer \\"fifth wheel\\". Though a fifth wheel and a gooseneck trailer look much the same, their method for coupling is different. A fifth wheel uses a large horseshoe-shaped coupling device mounted a foot or more above the bed of the tow vehicle. A gooseneck couples to a standard ball mounted on the bed of the tow vehicle. The operational difference between the two is the range of movement in the hitch. The gooseneck is very maneuverable and can tilt in all directions, while the fifth wheel is intended for level roads and limited tilt side to side. Gooseneck mounts are often used for agricultural and industrial trailers. Fifth-wheel mounts are often used for recreational trailers. Standard bumper-hitch trailers typically allow a 10% or 15% hitch load while a fifth wheel and gooseneck can handle 20% or 25% weight transfer. Steam locomotive on heavy trailer =Trailer jack= The basic function of a trailer jack is to lift the trailer to a height that allows the trailer to be hitched or unhitched to and from the towing vehicle. Trailer jacks are also used for leveling the trailer during storage. The most common types of trailer jacks are A-frame jacks, swivel jacks, and drop-leg jacks. Some trailers, such as horse trailers, have a built-in jack at the tongue for this purpose.  Electrical components  Many older cars took the feeds for the trailer's lights directly from the towing vehicles rear light circuits. As bulb-check systems were introduced in the 1990s \\"by-pass relays\\" were introduced. These took a small signal from the rear lights to switch a relay which in turn powered the trailer's lights with its own power feed. Many towing electrical installations, including vehicle-specific kits incorporate some form of bypass relays. In the US, trailer lights usually have a shared light for brake and turn indicators. If such a trailer is to be connected to a car with separate lamps for turn indicator and brake a trailer light converter is needed. Nowadays some vehicles are being fitted with CANbus networks, and some of these use the CANbus to connect the tow bar electrics to various safety systems and controls. For vehicles that use the CANbus to activate towing- related safety systems, a wiring kit that can interact appropriately must be used. Without such a towbar wiring kit the vehicle cannot detect the presence of a trailer and can therefore not activate safety features such as trailer stability program which can electronically control a snaking trailer or caravan. By-pass systems are very cost effective but may not be appropriate on cars with interactive safety features. = Brakes = Bus trailer Bus and trailer in Saskatchewan, Canada Larger trailers are usually fitted with brakes. These can be either electrically operated, air operated, or overrun brakes.  Stability  Trailer stability can be defined as the tendency of a trailer to dissipate side-to-side motion. The initial motion may be caused by aerodynamic forces, such as from a cross wind or a passing vehicle. One common criterion for stability is the center of mass location with respect to the wheels, which can usually be detected by tongue weight. If the center of mass of the trailer is behind its wheels, therefore having a negative tongue weight, the trailer will likely be unstable. Another parameter which is less commonly a factor is the trailer moment of inertia. Even if the center of mass is forward of the wheels, a trailer with a long load, and thus large moment of inertia, may be unstable. Some vehicles are equipped with a Trailer Stability Program that may be able to compensate for improper loading.

The name was given to the island of Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands in 1568. The name was chosen by Pedro de Ortega Valencia who had been born in the village. He was a subordinate of Spanish explorer and navigator √Ålvaro de Menda√±a de Neira.  Location and population  In 2006 there were 2,970 inhabitants. It has an area of 275 square kilometres and a population density of 10,6 people per square-km. It is at an altitude of 662 metres, in a valley between the Sierra del Agua and the Sierra del Viento, in the region of the Sierra Norte of Seville. Guadalcanal is 80 kilometres north of Seville, it depends to the judicial party of Cazalla de la Sierra  Etymology  The name, etymologically, might come from the Arabic phrase wƒÅdƒ´ al-qanƒÅl, meaning \\"river of the stalls\\" or \\"valley of stalls\\", referring to the refreshment stalls set up there during the Muslim rule in Andalusia. But it is more likely to be a mixture of Arabic \\"Wad\\" (river) and Spanish \\"del Canal\\" (of the canal). Other names were Tereses or Tereja or Canani with the Iberians. History Ermita de San Benito. Guadalcanal. Iglesia de Santa Ana. Guadalcanal. Iglesia de la Concepci√≥n. It was reconquered by the Order of Santiago in 1241 from the Moors, then Guadalcanal belonged to the Kingdom of Le√≥n as well as other parts of Extremadura. In ecclesiastical terms, it belonged to the Santa Mar√≠a de Tendudia vicary. Guadalcanal was fortified by means of a now-ruined wall which was demolished because the village took part in the Guerra de las Comunidades de Castilla. In the mid-16th century, the area had some silver mines financed by the Fugger family. The village suffered a crisis in the 19th century, which caused the four nunneries in the village to close. As other rural communities in Spain, it faced a massive exodus of its inhabitants to the cities in the 20th century.

A cardinal is unfoldable if and only if it is an Œª-unfoldable for all ordinals Œª. A cardinal number Œ∫ is strongly Œª-unfoldable if and only if for every transitive model M of cardinality Œ∫ of ZFC-minus- power set such that Œ∫ is in M and M contains all its sequences of length less than Œ∫, there is a non-trivial elementary embedding j of M into a transitive model \\"N\\" with the critical point of j being Œ∫, j(Œ∫) ‚â• Œª, and V(Œª) is a subset of N. Without loss of generality, we can demand also that N contains all its sequences of length Œª. Likewise, a cardinal is strongly unfoldable if and only if it is strongly Œª-unfoldable for all Œª. These properties are essentially weaker versions of strong and supercompact cardinals, consistent with V = L. Many theorems related to these cardinals have generalizations to their unfoldable or strongly unfoldable counterparts. For example, the existence of a strongly unfoldable implies the consistency of a slightly weaker version of the proper forcing axiom. A Ramsey cardinal is unfoldable, and will be strongly unfoldable in L. It may fail to be strongly unfoldable in V, however. In L, any unfoldable cardinal is strongly unfoldable; thus unfoldables and strongly unfoldables have the same consistency strength. A cardinal k is Œ∫-strongly unfoldable, and Œ∫-unfoldable, if and only if it is weakly compact. A Œ∫+œâ-unfoldable cardinal is totally indescribable and preceded by a stationary set of totally indescribable cardinals.

The PA said the building's elevation was exceptional in the way that the traditional townhouse had been reinterpreted in a modernist style making use of strong geometric motifs. G≈ºira () is a town in the Central Region of Malta. It is located between Msida and Sliema, also bordering on Ta' Xbiex. It has a population of 8,029 as of March 2014. The word G≈ºira means \\"island\\" in Maltese, and the town is named after Manoel Island which lies just adjacent to the town. The seafront of G≈ºira has views of the walled city of Valletta, which are illuminated at night, forming a backdrop to Manoel Island, the yacht marina and a seafront public garden. Kappara is located close to G≈ºira. The Orpheum Theatre is located in G≈ºira.  Town history  In the mid-19th century a villa was built in G≈ºira by Chevalier Jacob Tagliaferro. Slowly G≈ºira started developing into a working-class suburb of Sliema. Until the 1970s, G≈ºira had many bars, particularly the Snake Pit, Britannia and the Granada along and in proximity of the Strand, which economic activity ended when the British Service left Malta on 31 March 1979. Tables have turned and the regenerated G≈ºira is now host to a business community of hoteliers, restaurants, financial institutions, legal firms, online betting companies, real estate and offices amidst a multi-ethnic and multicultural community of residents. Since the last decade, G≈ºira had a real estate boom, and new buildings, mainly apartments, replace the old buildings. As a result, much of the character and charm of the seafront houses has changed, although in the heart of G≈ºira there are still examples of traditional Maltese fa√ßades, with timber balconies (Gallarija) and bow-fronted, wrought iron balconies. The proliferation of modern apartments in G≈ºira as well as the development of high rise buildings, namely Metropolis and 14 East, led to an inflation of housing prices, as the town became sought after by both Maltese and foreigners. G≈ºira's population has been fairly stable over the past few years, hovering around 8,029 people as of March 2014. It is known as being quite a multicultural town, with well-established and fairly integrated immigrant groups. The main reason behind the area's popularity is that it is fairly centrally located in Malta, being close to the University of Malta, Sliema, and the capital Valletta. Service industries, commercial outlets and educational services are the town's main activities. The crime rate in G≈ºira is very low, and the town is generally as safe as the rest of Malta and Gozo. = Religion = The Roman Catholic parish church of G≈ºira is also known locally as tal-ƒ†ebla. Its literal translation means \\"of the stone\\". In fact it is a reference to an incident which took place in G≈ºira on 10 July 1902. Three British drunken sailors, William Walls, Charles Thurbull and John Packhun, wanted to enter a bar, which at that time of day was closed. When Karmnu Brincat, the owner of the bar, refused to open, the sailors started throwing stones at the place. One of these stones hit a small shrine depicting a picture of Our Lady of Mount Carmel hanging outside the bar. The stone broke the glass of the frame, but did not make contact with the portrait itself, which remained intact. Notwithstanding the wind, the stone remained fixed within the broken glass. The stone was removed by Rev. Anton Manch√© and taken to the Stella Maris Parish Church in Sliema, whose parish priest at the time was the Rev. Francis Vincent Manch√©, the brother of Rev. Anton Manch√©. For three days, prayers and services for reparation were held. Rev. Anton Anton Manch√© managed to set up a small chapel in G≈ºira where the small shrine was taken. On 7 July 1913 Bishop Pietro Pace declared the chapel as a vice-parish. On 15 May 1921, Bishop Don Mauro Caruana declared the chapel as a parish. Rev. Anton Anton Manch√© was the first parish priest of G≈ºira. The existing parish church was built between 1921 and 1935. The second parish priest in the history of the G≈ºira parish was the late Rev. Carlo Manch√©, a man revered by many locals as a saint. He became parish priest of G≈ºira on 12 March 1935 until his death on 18 November 1950. The frame, the broken glass and the stone that was thrown at the portrait of The Madonna have been very well preserved, and today they can still be seen at the parish church of G≈ºira. The parish church of G≈ºira is dedicated to Our Lady of Mount Carmel, and its annual festa (village feast) is celebrated on the second Sunday of July.

It was the property of the Mdina Cathedral. In 1643 Jean Paul Lascaris, Grandmaster of the Knights of Malta, constructed a quarantine hospital (Lazzaretto) on the island, in an attempt to control the periodic influx of plague and cholera. In 1675, another Grand Master, this time, Nicola' Cottoner, decided to construct another isolation hospital with an additional forty beds, a chapel and a cemetry. Alfie Guillaumier, Bliet u Irhula Maltin,Malta 1972, page 121. The island was renamed after Ant√≥nio Manoel de Vilhena, a Portuguese Grandmaster of the Knights of Malta under whose leadership Fort Manoel was built in 1726. Fort Manoel is considered a marvel of 18th-century military engineering. The original plans for the fort are attributed to Louis d'Augbigne Tign√©, and are said to have been modified by his friend and colleague Charles Fran√ßois de Mondion, who is buried in a crypt beneath Fort Manoel.At one time, the Knights of Malta considered developing a walled city on Manoel Island, but instead they settled on a fort designed to house up to 500 soldiers. The fort has a magnificent quadrangle, parade ground and arcade, and once housed a baroque chapel dedicated to St. Anthony of Padua, under the direct command of the Order.Alfie Guillaumier, Bliet u Irhula Maltin,Malta 1972, page 122. During World War II, Manoel Island and its fort were used as a naval base by the Royal Navy, at which time it was referred to variously as \\"HMS Talbot\\" or \\"HMS Ph≈ìnicia\\". The Chapel of St. Anthony was virtually destroyed following a direct hit by Luftwaffe bombers in March 1942.Joe Ian Attard, l-Istorja tal-G≈ºira, online at www.My-Malta.com For several years now, Manoel Island houses a quaint, informal sanctuary for ducks and other waterfowl, created and maintained by a local volunteer, and funded entirely by private donations near the bridge connecting the island with the main island. As of November 2006, the historic fort was undergoing significant restoration and renovation works, and a new housing development was under construction on Manoel Island. The Manoel Island redevelopment project, however, has been heavily criticized due to its proximity to the island's important historical buildings. A guarded barrier some 300 yards after the bridge makes it clear that the public is not welcome on the largest part of the island.

It had traditionally been classified within the lutung genus Trachypithecus but was moved to the genus Semnopithecus based on DNA evidence indicating that is it more closely related to the gray langurs. In Sinhala it is known as ‡∑Å‡∑ä‚Äç‡∂ª‡∑ì ‡∂Ω‡∂Ç‡∂ö‡∑è ‡∂ö‡∂Ω‡∑î ‡∑Ä‡∂Ø‡∑î‡∂ª‡∑è (Sri Lanka black monkey). Description In the purple-faced langur, males are usually larger than females.

The species tends to have whitish to gray short 'trousers' rounded off by purplish-black faces with white sideburns. Part of the back is covered with whitish fur, and tail is also furred with black and white mixed colors. The feet and hands are also purplish-black in color. Size varies among the subspecies.

Among the primates that live in Sri Lanka, it is somewhat smaller than the tufted gray langur despite leading males of the group of purple-faced langurs often being larger than the tufted gray langur that lived together in the habitats. In the subspecies known as the \\"bear monkey\\" (S. v. monitcola) usually has a darker coat and usually sports a heavy mustache. In this species, the hair of crown directed backwards throughout, not radiating. it lacks the crest of tufted gray langurs and has hair on the crown no longer than on temples and nape. Purple-faced langurs have a rump that is pure white or whitish gray. S.v.nestor S.v.vetulus S.v.monticola =Subspecies= According to the Mammals of Sri Lanka, the 4 subspecies are recognized as follows. * Southern lowland wetzone purple-faced langur, Semnopithecus vetulus vetulus - \\"Color varies greatly. Black upper torso, light brown cap, well defined silvery rump patch that extends to legs. Prominent white whiskers. Tail is also white colored. Many white morphs are observed in this subspecies. They can be all-white to partly white leucistic.\\" * Western purple-faced langur or north lowland wetzone purple-faced langur, Semnopithecus vetulus nestor - \\"It is the smallest of all subspecies. Upper torso dark grayish brown with light grayish brown rump patch, darker grayish brown legs and white cap.\\" * Dryzone purple- faced langur, Semnopithecus vetulus philbricki - \\"Largest subspecies. Grayish brown torso, ill-defined grayish rump patch, dark cap. Prominent white cheeks with tufts. Exceptionally long slimy tail.\\" * Montane purple-faced langur or Bear Monkey, Semnopithecus vetulus monticola - \\"Dark gray brown coat. Large but ill-defined grayish rump patch. Prominent white cheek tufts, light brownish gray cap. Fur long and shaggy due to habitat they live is cold.\\" All four recognizable subspecies exhibit different cranial and pelage characteristics, as well as body size. The western purple-faced langur is one of the 25 most endangered primates in the world. Most groups of langurs contain only one adult male. A possible subspecies called Semnopithecus vetulus harti is recognized, but not yet given validity. This subspecies is known from some skins found from Jaffna peninsula and north of the Vavuniya. Uniquely, this subspecies has yellowish golden hair on its scalp and a golden sheen to its fur. Otherthan these differences, anatomy and all the other aspects are similar to the Semnopithecus vetulus philbricki. Although traditionally classified within the genus Trachypithecus based on morphological similarities, DNA and vocal evidence suggests that the purple- faced langur actually is more closely related to the gray langurs of the genus Semnopithecus. Habitat and status The purple-faced langur is found in closed canopy forests in Sri Lanka's mountains and the southwestern part of the country, known as the \\"wet zone\\". Only 19% of Sri Lanka consists of forested areas. This habitat has decreased from 80% in 1980 to ~25% in 2001. Currently this range has decreased to below 3%. The range consists of the most densely populated lowland rainforest areas of Sri Lanka. Deforestation has resulted in the langurs home ranges to be exposed to direct sunlight. Purple- faced langurs are most often found in small and widely scattered groups. Ninety percent of the langurs range, now consists of human populated areas. Populations are critically low within and between sites. Threats to this species include infringement on range by croplands, grazing, changing agriculture, road production, soil loss/erosion and deforestation, poisoning from prevention of crop raiding, and hunting for medicine and food. Its range has constricted greatly in the face of human encroachment, although it can still be seen in Sinharaja, Kitulgala, Kandalama, Mihintale, in the mountains at Horton Plains National Park or in the rainforest near the city of Galle. Behaviour and ecology =Diet= The purple-faced langur is mostly folivorous, but will also feed on fruits, flowers, and seeds. While they normally avoid human habitations, fruit such as jak (Artocarpus heterophyllus), rambutan (Nephelium lappaceum), banana (Musa balbisiana), and mango (Mangifera indica) may contribute up to 50% to their diet in cultivated areas. In the wild, food such as the fruits of Dimocarpus longan and Drypetes sepiaria are taken. Purple-faced langur digestion is adapted to derive the majority of required nutrients and energy from complex carbohydrates found in leaves, with the help of specialized stomach bacteria. Where the species' diet is currently heavily dependent cultivated fruits, the ability to derive sufficient nutrition may become impaired. Seasonal availability of fruit may serve to increase this effect. T. vetulus feed on a less diverse diet than S. priam, with a greater proportion of leaves. Food plants that have been identified include Holoptelea integrifolia, Hydnocarpus venenata, Macaranga peltata, Manilkara hexandra, Mikania scandens, Mischodon zeylanica, Pterospermum suberifolium, Tetrameles nudiflora, Vitex altissima, and Wrightia angustifolia. The purple-faced langur was found to be dominated by tufted gray langurs in mixed feeding groups. =Communication= Loud calls are often used to distinguish between individual purple-faced langurs. The elements of a call fall into three categories: harsh barks, whoops, and residuals. Individuals can be differentiated by the number of phrases and residuals within a call. Calls occur more often in the morning mostly stimulated by neighboring groups and territorial battles. More calls occur during sunny periods than cloudy. The fewest calls occur in the evening. Daytime calls usually aid in the defense of home ranges. The loud barking call, particularly of the highland form, can be mistaken for the roar of a predator such as a leopard. Calls of the purple-faced langur differ from those of any of the subspecies. Environmental characters impact call times as well as anthropogenic disturbance. Vocalization can be used to alert members of predators, attract mates, defend territory, and locate group members. Vocalization is extremely important for the use in conservation especially because they are very difficult to observe directly. Adult males are the most vocal among the entire group. Defensive whooping calls are also accompanied by intense visual and locomotive displays. Vocalizations are also helpful in determining taxonomic identification. Based on alarm calls issued in response to these and known predators of the similar tufted gray langur, the main potential predators of this species are likely to be leopards followed infrequently by Indian pythons and mugger crocodile. For young or infirm langurs, black eagles and possibly other larger birds of prey are perhaps not infrequently a threat. Conservation Some conservation strategies consist of improving management of the already protected areas as well as locate and protect new areas and corridors within ranges. Efforts to help increase populations may help survival. It would be beneficial to lower human-langur conflicts. Rope bridges could be established for langurs to move between ranges safely, which may decrease the crossing of power lines and roads. Replanting pine plantations with native species exploited by these langurs, could possibly increase its preferred habitat as well. Public education of conservation to the local people emphasizing compassion and kindness as well as explaining the importance and necessity of these mammals to the ecosystems overall biodiversity.

The slogan's invention is credited to US punk band Bikini Kill, who published a zine called Girl Power in 1991.  Early usage and origins Girls wearing \\"Girl power\\" sashes at the 2017 Women's March in New York City In 1991, US punk band Bikini Kill published a feminist zine called Girl Power. The band's lead singer, Kathleen Hanna, said was inspired by the Black Power slogan. The term became popular in the early and mid 90s punk culture. The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll credits the zine with coining the slogan: \\"In their feminist fanzine Bikini Kill they articulated an agenda for young women in and outside of music; the band put those ideas to practice. (Ironically, the zine first coined the \\"girl power\\" slogan, later co-opted by Britain's bubblegum pop band the Spice Girls.) Bikini Kill earned a reputation in the punk underground for confronting certain standards of that genre; for example, asking people to slam at the side of the stage, so that women would not get pushed out of the front, and inviting women to take the mic and talk about sexual abuse. The phrase is sometimes sensationally spelled grrrl power, based on the spelling of riot grrrl. Some other musical artists who have used the slogan in their music are Welsh band Helen Love, with it appearing in the chorus of their 1992 song ‚ÄúFormula One Racing Girls‚Äù, and pop-punk duo Shampoo, who released an album and single titled Girl Power in 1995.  Spice Girls and scholarship  British pop quintet Spice Girls popularized the slogan in the mid-1990s. In her 2002 book Girl Heroes: The New Force in Popular Culture, Professor Susan Hopkins suggests a correlation between girl power, Spice Girls, and female action heroes at the end of the 20th century. Geri Halliwell, a member of the Spice Girls, credited former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a leading conservative, as the pioneer of their ideology of girl power.Amanda Evans and Tara Brabazon, \\"I'll never be your woman: the Spice Girls and new flavours of feminism.\\" Social Alternatives 17#2 (1998): 39. The slogan has also been examined within the context of the academic field, for example Buffy studies.\\"The Third Wave's Final girl: Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" Media theorist Kathleen Rowe Karlyn in her article \\"Scream, Popular Culture, and Feminism's Third Wave: I'm Not My Mother\\" and Irene Karras in \\"The Third Wave's Final girl: Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" suggest a link with third-wave feminism. Frances Early and Kathleen Kennedy in the introduction to Athena‚Äôs Daughters: Television‚Äôs New Women Warriors, discuss what they describe as a link between girl power and a \\"new\\" image of women warriors in popular culture. =Oxford English Dictionary= A 2001 update to the Oxford English Dictionary defined girl power as: The dictionary further offers an example of this term by quoting from \\"Angel Delight\\", an article in the March 24, 2001 issue of Dreamwatch about the television series Dark Angel: =Criticism= Girl Power slogan on display at a women's march in Sacramento, California Dr. Debbie Ging, Chair of the BA in Communications Studies in Dublin City University, was critical of the \\"Girl power\\" ideals, and linked it to the sexualisation of younger children, girls in particular.Ging, Debbie. \\"Girl Power\\" doesn‚Äôt empower: why it‚Äôs time for an honest debate about the sexualisation of children in Ireland July 2007. Amy McClure of North Carolina State University warns against placing too much hope on girl power as an empowering concept. She says, ‚ÄúAn ideology based on consumerism can never be a revolutionary social movement. The fact that it appears to be a revolutionary movement is a dangerous lie that not only marketers sell to us but that we often happily sell to ourselves.‚Äù Media can sometimes present a narrow definition of what it means to be a girl today. One common example being popular toys such Mattel's Barbie. The recent ‚ÄúI can be‚Äù Barbiehttp://icanbe.barbie.com embodies this concept of ‚Äúgirl power‚Äù: that little girls can be anything they want when they grow up. Arguably, Barbie's image may also present narrowed options with which girls can identify. Hannah Jane Parkinson of The Guardian criticized the term as something \\"young women [that] are feeling more confident about calling themselves feminists and standing up for principles of equality\\" hide behind and denounced it for including the word \\"girl\\", claiming it promoted the calling of adult women as girls.

He is the co-founder of Tianwang Center for Missing Persons (later renamed the Tianwang Human Rights Center), along with his wife Zeng Li. Initially the mission of the organization was to help counter human trafficking that had become a swelling problem in the late 1990s, but later it was expanded to include campaign against human rights abuse. Huang is also the owner and webmaster of 64tianwang.com, a website originally intended to release news about people who had disappeared in the People's Republic of China. Huang was imprisoned by the government from June 2000 to June 2005 and again arrested in July 2008 for \\"illegal possession of state secrets\\" after he helped the victims of the Sichuan earthquake. In November 2009 he was sentenced to three years of imprisonment. He was subsequently described as a political prisoner;Congressional-Executive Commission on China, Political Prisoner Database:Huang Qi .U.S. Department of State, China (includes Tibet, Hong Kong, and Macau), 28 February 2005. Amnesty International described him as a victim of vague state secrets laws.China must free activist who defended earthquake victims. Amnesty International. November 23, 2009. Huang was sentenced to twelve years in prison in July 2019 for leaking state secrets to foreigners. Website Huang and his wife, Zeng Li, from Chengdu in Sichuan, set up the website www.64tianwang.com in June 1998 to track cases of human trafficking by posting information about missing people. Huang managed the site, helped to decide on its content, and actively investigated cases, ultimately aiding in the rescue of several trafficked girls. He continued to post articles exposing cases of people exploited by government officials until late 2000; this included the custodial death of a 15-year-old boy and another case of a follower of Falun Gong. The police tried to shut down his website, but Huang moved his website to servers in the United States. Huang was arrested in late 2000 under the charges of \\"inciting subversion\\" and sentenced to five years in prison. Soon after his release in 2005, he resumed posting similar content on his website as he did before the arrest, until June 2008, when he was arrested again under the charges of \\"illegal possession of state secrets\\" after he posted an article on behalf of parents of school children who had died in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, demanding an investigation into the schools‚Äô construction. Reporters Without Borders awarded its Cyber-Freedom Prize to Huang Qi in 2004. Imprisonment = Early 2000s = Huang was arrested on June 3, 2000‚Äîthe day before the 11th anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests of 1989‚Äîaccused of posting on his website articles about the protests written by dissidents living abroad. The website was used by the independence movement in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region and the Falun Gong. He was jailed in July 2000 at the Detention Center No. 1 in Chengdu. Former cellmates said he was beaten regularly and denied medicine he needed. Huang was ultimately tried for \\"subversion\\" in August 2001. He was charged under articles 103, 105, 55 and 56 of the Criminal Law and tried in secret by the Chengdu Intermediate Court in August 2001. He was detained without sentencing until May 9, 2003, when he was sentenced to five years in prison. Amnesty International named him a prisoner of conscience \\"imprisoned for the peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of expression and association\\" and called for his immediate release. On June 4, 2005, Huang Qi was released from jail after completing his sentence. He told Radio Free Asia that he wanted to resume his web site dedicated to the memory of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. \\"I will do my best to resume the Tianwang Web site. When it was first created it was for very few people. But I now realize that there are many like-minded people,\\" he said. = Sichuan earthquake affair = After the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, he assisted in relief work and also responded to some parents' requests for assistance in their questions and complaints concerning the collapse of school buildings. Huang posted their demands as an article on his website. A week later, on June 10, plain-clothed policemen arrested him in Chengdu and held him \\"on suspicion of illegally possessing state secrets\\", an ill-defined charge often used by the Chinese government to clamp down on dissent. A formal announcement of his arrest was made on July 18, 2008. He was sentenced to three years of imprisonment in November 2009 based on the discovery of two city-level documents in his house. The court was heavily guarded by police with only Huang's wife and mother allowed to enter, Huang's lawyers were unable to attend because of short notice given. Huang is expected to appeal against the verdict and has been refused bail. Human Rights organizations condemned the verdict and \\"inhumane treatment\\" of Huang in prison. Amnesty International alleges that during his detention Huang was interrogated for long periods and subject to sleep deprivation. Huang's family have said that his health has deteriorated rapidly in detention and that he has not received adequate medical care. One of his lawyers has stated that he has been diagnosed with two tumours, one in the stomach and one in the chest, during his period in detention. Earlier on November 7, the U.S. House of Representatives had passed a near-unanimous resolution seeking freedom of activists Huang Qi and Tan Zuoren. Following Huang's imprisonment, fellow human rights activist and pundit Liu Dan authored a piece on Huang's Tianwang website condemning Chinese President Hu Jintao's Harmonious Society ideology, saying that it was a \\"sham\\" in the face of Huang Qi's sentencing. Liu wrote that Hu's administration silences anyone whose opinions differ from the party line, whether that opinion is coming from external elements (censorship of dissidents), foreign elements (deletion of U.S. President Barack Obama's town- hall meeting from news items), or within the Chinese political system itself (removal of Premier Wen Jiabao's calls for greater freedoms in Xinhua publications). Huang was released in 2011 after completing his sentence. = 2016‚Äì2019 = On November 28, 2016, Huang was detained after police raided his home. On December 7, a petitioner told Radio Free Asia that Huang has been detained at Mianyang City Detention in Sichuan Province but Huang's mother also went missing. Several days later, on December 16, Huang's mother has returned home and Huang has been formally arrested for \\"leaking state secrets\\". In January 2019 Huang was put on trial at the Intermediate People's Court of Mianyang City in Sichuan, accused of leaking state secrets. On July 29, 2019, it was announced that Huang had been found guilty of intentionally leaking state secrets to foreigners, and had been sentenced to twelve years in prison, as well as being deprived of his political rights for four years, and fined 20,000 yuan. Huang has kidney and heart disease, and Christophe Deloire, secretary-general of Reporters Without Borders, noted that \\"[t]his decision is equivalent to a death sentence, considering Huang Qi's health has already deteriorated from a decade spent in harsh confinement\\".

It was first published in 1934 by the Obelisk Press in Paris, France, but this edition was banned in the United States. Its publication in 1961 in the U.S. by Grove Press led to obscenity trials that tested American laws on pornography in the early 1960s. In 1964, the U.S. Supreme Court declared the book non-obscene. It is regarded as an important work of 20th-century literature. Writing and publication Miller wrote the book between 1930 and 1934 during his \\"nomadic life\\" in Paris. The fictional Villa Borghese was actually 18 Villa Seurat in Paris' 14th arrondissement.D'Abate, Matthew. Paris: Street by Street. CouCou, Feb. 8, 2018, As Miller discloses in the text of the book, he first intended to title it \\"Crazy Cock\\". Miller gave the following explanation of why the book's title was Tropic of Cancer: \\"It was because to me cancer symbolizes the disease of civilization, the endpoint of the wrong path, the necessity to change course radically, to start completely over from scratch.\\" Ana√Øs Nin helped to edit the book. In 1934, Jack Kahane's Obelisk Press published the book with financial backing from Nin, who had borrowed the money from Otto Rank. Emerson quotation, preface, and introduction In the 1961 edition, opposite the novel's title page is a quotation from Ralph Waldo Emerson: > These novels will give way, by and by, to diaries or > autobiographies‚Äîcaptivating books, if only a man knew how to choose among > what he calls his experiences that which is really his experience, and how > to record truth truly. p. 1 The 1961 edition includes an introduction by Karl Shapiro written in 1960 and titled \\"The Greatest Living Author\\". The first three sentences are: > I call Henry Miller the greatest living author because I think he is. I do > not call him a poet because he has never written a poem; he even dislikes > poetry, I think. But everything he has written is a poem in the best as well > as in the broadest sense of the word. Following the introduction is a preface written by Nin in 1934, which begins as follows: > Here is a book which, if such a thing were possible, might restore our > appetite for the fundamental realities. The predominant note will seem one > of bitterness, and bitterness there is, to the full. But there is also a > wild extravagance, a mad gaiety, a verve, a gusto, at times almost a > delirium. Summary Set in France (primarily Paris) during the late 1920s and early 1930s, Tropic of Cancer centers on Miller's life as a struggling writer. Late in the novel, Miller explains his artistic approach to writing the book itself, stating: > Up to the present, my idea of collaborating with myself has been to get off > the gold standard of literature. My idea briefly has been to present a > resurrection of the emotions, to depict the conduct of a human being in the > stratosphere of ideas, that is, in the grip of delirium. Combining autobiography and fiction, some chapters follow a narrative of some kind and refer to Miller's actual friends, colleagues, and workplaces; others are written as stream-of-consciousness reflections that are occasionally epiphanic. The novel is written in the first person, as are many of Miller's other novels, and does not have a linear organization, but rather fluctuates frequently between the past and present. Themes The book largely functions as an immersive meditation on the human condition. As a struggling writer, Miller describes his experience living among a community of bohemians in Paris, where he intermittently suffers from hunger, homelessness, squalor, loneliness, and despair over his recent separation from his wife. Describing his perception of Paris during this time, Miller wrote: > One can live in Paris‚ÄîI discovered that!‚Äîon just grief and anguish. A bitter > nourishment‚Äîperhaps the best there is for certain people. At any rate, I had > not yet come to the end of my rope. I was only flirting with disaster. ... I > understood then why it is that Paris attracts the tortured, the > hallucinated, the great maniacs of love. I understood why it is that here, > at the very hub of the wheel, one can embrace the most fantastic, the most > impossible theories, without finding them in the least strange; it is here > that one reads again the books of his youth and the enigmas take on new > meanings, one for every white hair. One walks the streets knowing that he is > mad, possessed, because it is only too obvious that these cold, indifferent > faces are the visages of one's keepers. Here all boundaries fade away and > the world reveals itself for the mad slaughterhouse that it is. The > treadmill stretches away to infinitude, the hatches are closed down tight, > logic runs rampant, with bloody cleaver flashing. There are many passages explicitly describing the narrator's sexual encounters. In 1978, literary scholar Donald Gutierrez argued that the sexual comedy in the book was \\"undeniably low... [but with] a stronger visceral appeal than high comedy\\". The characters are caricatures, and the male characters \\"stumbl[e] through the mazes of their conceptions of woman\\". Michael Hardin made the case for the theme of homophobia in the novel. He proposed that the novel contained a \\"deeply repressed homoerotic desire that periodically surfaces\\". Music and dance are other recurrent themes in the book. Music is used \\"as a sign of the flagging vitality Miller everywhere rejects\\". References to dancing include a comparison of loving Mona to a \\"dance of death\\", and a call for the reader to join in \\"a last expiring dance\\" even though \\"we are doomed\\". Characters Other than the first-person narrator \\"Henry Miller\\", the major characters include: ; Boris: A friend who rents rooms at the Villa Borghese. The character was modeled after Michael Fraenkel, a writer who \\"had sheltered Miller during his hobo days\\" in 1930. ; Carl: A writer friend who complains about optimistic people, about Paris, and about writing. Miller helps Carl write love letters to \\"the rich cunt, Irene\\", and Carl relates his encounter with her to Miller. Carl lives in squalor and has sex with a minor. The inspiration for Carl was Miller's friend Alfred Perl√®s, a writer. ; Collins: A sailor who befriends Fillmore and Miller. As Collins had fallen in love with a boy in the past, his undressing a sick Miller to put him to bed has been interpreted as evidence of a homoerotic desire for Miller. ; Fillmore: A \\"young man in the diplomatic service\\" who becomes friends with Miller. He invites Miller to stay with him; later the Russian \\"princess\\" Macha with \\"the clap\\" joins them. Fillmore and Miller disrupt a mass while hung over. Toward the end of the book, Fillmore promises to marry a French woman named Ginette who is pregnant by him, but she is physically abusive and controlling, and Miller convinces Fillmore to leave Paris without her. Fillmore's real-life counterpart was Richard Galen Osborn, a lawyer. ; Mona: A character corresponding to Miller's estranged second wife June Miller. Miller remembers Mona, who is now in America, nostalgically. ; Tania: A woman married to Sylvester. The character was modeled after Bertha Schrank, who was married to Joseph Schrank. It may also be noted that during the writing of the novel, Miller also had a passionate affair with Anais Nin; by changing the \\"T\\" to an \\"S\\", one can make out Anais from Tania by rearranging the letters. It may also be noted that in one of Nin's many passionate letters to Miller, she quotes his swoon found below. Tania has an affair with Miller, who fantasizes about her: > O Tania, where now is that warm cunt of yours, those fat, heavy garters, > those soft, bulging thighs? There is a bone in my prick six inches long. I > will ream out every wrinkle in your cunt, Tania, big with seed. I will send > you home to your Sylvester with an ache in your belly and your womb turned > inside out. Your Sylvester! Yes, he knows how to build a fire, but I know > how to inflame a cunt. I shoot hot bolts into you, Tania, I make your > ovaries incandescent. ; Van Norden: A friend of Miller's who is \\"probably the most sexually corrupt man\\" in the book, having a \\"total lack of empathy with women\\". Van Norden refers to women using terms such as \\"my Georgia cunt\\", \\"fucking cunt\\", \\"rich cunt\\", \\"married cunts\\", \\"Danish cunt\\", and \\"foolish cunts\\". Miller helps Van Norden move to a room in a hotel, where Van Norden brings women \\"day in and out\\". The character was based on Wambly Bald, a gossip columnist. Legal issues =United States= Upon the book's publication in France in 1934, the United States Customs Service banned the book from being imported into the U.S. Frances Steloff sold copies of the novel smuggled from Paris during the 1930s at her Gotham Book Mart, which led to lawsuits. A copyright-infringing edition of the novel was published in New York City in 1940 by \\"Medusa\\" (Jacob Brussel); its last page claimed its place of publication to be Mexico. Brussel was eventually sent to jail for three years for the edition. In 1950, Ernest Besig, the director of the American Civil Liberties Union in San Francisco, attempted to import Tropic of Cancer along with Miller's other novel, Tropic of Capricorn, to the United States. Customs detained the novels and Besig sued the government. Before the case went to trial, Besig requested a motion to admit 19 depositions from literary critics testifying to the \\"literary value of the novels and to Miller's stature as a serious writer\\". The motion was denied by Judge Louis A. Goodman. The case went to trial with Goodman presiding. Goodman declared both novels obscene. Besig appealed the decision to the Ninth Circuit of Appeals, but the novels were once again declared \\"obscene\\" in a unanimous decision in Besig v. United States. In 1961, when Grove Press legally published the book in the United States, over 60 obscenity lawsuits in over 21 states were brought against booksellers that sold it. The opinions of courts varied; for example, in his dissent from the majority holding that the book was not obscene, Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice Michael Musmanno wrote Cancer is \\"not a book. It is a cesspool, an open sewer, a pit of putrefaction, a slimy gathering of all that is rotten in the debris of human depravity.\\"Commonwealth v. Robin, 218 A.2d 546, 561 (Pa. 1966). Publisher Barney Rosset hired lawyer Charles Rembar to help Rosset lead the \\"effort to assist every bookseller prosecuted, regardless of whether there was a legal obligation to do so\\". Rembar successfully argued two appeals cases, in Massachusetts and New Jersey, although the book continued to be judged obscene in New York and other states. In 1964, the U.S. Supreme Court, in Grove Press, Inc. v. Gerstein, cited Jacobellis v. Ohio (which was decided the same day) and overruled state court findings that Tropic of Cancer was obscene. =Other countries= The book was banned outside the U.S. as well: * In Canada, it was on the list of books banned by customs as of 1938. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police seized copies of the book from bookstores and public libraries in the early 1960s. By 1964, attitudes toward the book had \\"liberalized\\". * Only smuggled copies of the book were available in the United Kingdom after its publication in 1934. Scotland Yard contemplated banning its publication in Britain in the 1960s, but decided against the ban because literary figures such as T. S. Eliot were ready to defend the book publicly. * In Finland all printed copies of the Finnish versions of the book were confiscated by the state before the books were to be published in 1962. The book was not published there in Finnish until 1970, however the book was available in Swedish and English.http://www2.kirjastot.fi/kysy/arkistohaku/kysymys/?ID=c56f8e10-74fb-4a3d-8a29-f6e47032a6d2 Critical reception =Individual reviewers= In 1935, H. L. Mencken read the 1934 Paris edition, and sent an encouraging note to Miller: \\"I read Tropic of Cancer a month ago. It seems to me to be a really excellent piece of work, and I so reported to the person who sent it to me. Of this, more when we meet.\\" George Orwell reviewed Tropic of Cancer in The New English Weekly in 1935. Orwell focused on Miller's descriptions of sexual encounters, which he deemed significant for their \\"attempt to get at real facts\\", and which he saw as a departure from dominant trends. Orwell argued that, although Miller concerns himself with uglier aspects of life, he is nonetheless not quite a pessimist, and seems to find that the contemplation of ugliness makes life more worthwhile rather than less. Concluding, he described Tropic of Cancer as \\"a remarkable book\\" and recommended it to \\"anyone who can get hold of a copy\\" Returning to the novel in the essay \\"Inside the Whale\\" (1940), George Orwell wrote the following: > I earnestly counsel anyone who has not done so to read at least Tropic of > Cancer. With a little ingenuity, or by paying a little over the published > price, you can get hold of it, and even if parts of it disgust you, it will > stick in your memory. ... Here in my opinion is the only imaginative prose- > writer of the slightest value who has appeared among the English-speaking > races for some years past. Even if that is objected to as an overstatement, > it will probably be admitted that Miller is a writer out of the ordinary, > worth more than a single glance.... Samuel Beckett hailed it as \\"a momentous event in the history of modern writing\\".Cited in: Henry Miller, Tropic of Cancer, (Harper Perennial, UK, 2005) Norman Mailer, in his 1976 book on Miller entitled Genius and Lust, called it \\"one of the ten or twenty great novels of our century, a revolution in consciousness equal to The Sun Also Rises\\". Edmund Wilson said of the novel: > The tone of the book is undoubtedly low; The Tropic of Cancer, in fact, from > the point of view both of its happenings and of the language in which they > are conveyed, is the lowest book of any real literary merit that I ever > remember to have read... there is a strange amenity of temper and style > which bathes the whole composition even when it is disgusting or tiresome. In Sexual Politics (1970), Kate Millett wrote that Miller \\"is a compendium of American sexual neuroses\\", showing \\"anxiety and contempt\\" toward women in works such as Tropic of Cancer. In 1980, Anatole Broyard described Tropic of Cancer as \\"Mr. Miller's first and best novel\\", showing \\"a flair for finding symbolism in unobtrusive places\\" and having \\"beautiful sentence[s]\\". Julian Symons wrote in 1993 that \\"the shock effect [of the novel] has gone\\", although \\"it remains an extraordinary document\\". A 2009 essay on the book by Ewan Morrison described it as a \\"life-saver\\" when he was \\"wandering from drink to drink and bed to bed, dangerously close to total collapse\\". =Appearances in lists of best books= The book has been included in a number of lists of best books, such as the following: * In July 1998, the Board of the Modern Library ranked Tropic of Cancer 50th on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. * In July 1998, students of the Radcliffe Publishing Course, at the request of the Modern Library editorial board, compiled their own list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century, and the book was ranked 84th. * Between July 1998 and October 1998, an online reader poll by the Modern Library placed the novel 68th among the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. * In a survey of librarians published in November 1998, the book was ranked 132nd in a list of 150 fiction books from the 20th century. * Time magazine included the novel in its list of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to 2005. * The novel was listed in the 2006 book 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die. * It was one of the \\"1000 Novels Everyone Must Read\\" in The Guardian in 2009. * It was included in the list \\"The 75 Books Every Man Should Read\\" (2011) in Esquire. Influences =Influences on Miller= Critics and Miller himself have claimed that Miller was influenced by the following in writing the novel: * Louis-Ferdinand C√©line, especially Journey to the End of the Night (1932), his semi-autobiographical first novel featuring a \\"comic, antiheroic character\\". Nevertheless, Orwell wrote \\"Both books use unprintable words, both are in some sense autobiographical, but that is all.\\" * Fyodor Dostoyevsky, especially his Notes from Underground (1864). * James Joyce. Nevertheless, Orwell felt that the novel did not resemble Joyce's Ulysses. * Fran√ßois Rabelais. * Henry David Thoreau. * Walt Whitman, who wrote in a similar style about common people. The poet is mentioned favorably in the novel several times, for example: \\"In Whitman the whole American scene comes to life, her past and her future, her birth and her death. Whatever there is of value in America Whitman has expressed, and there is nothing more to be said.\\" =Novel's influence on other writers= Tropic of Cancer \\"has had a huge and indelible impact on both the American literary tradition and American society as a whole\\". The novel influenced many writers, as exemplified by the following: * Lawrence Durrell's 1938 novel The Black Book was described as \\"celebrat[ing] the Henry Miller of Tropic of Cancer as his [Durrell's] literary father\\". * It has been claimed that the novel impressed the Beat Generation writers in the 1960s such as Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs. * Erica Jong wrote \\"...when I was searching for the freedom to write [the 1973 novel] Fear of Flying, I picked up Tropic of Cancer and the sheer exuberance of the prose unlocked something in me.\\" In turn, Miller praised Fear of Flying in 1974, comparing it to Tropic of Cancer. Adaptation The novel was adapted for a 1970 film Tropic of Cancer directed by Joseph Strick, and starring Rip Torn, James T. Callahan, and Ellen Burstyn. Miller was a \\"technical consultant\\" during the production of the movie; although he had reservations about the adaptation of the book, he praised the final movie. The film was rated X in the United States, which was later changed to an NC-17 rating. References or allusions in other works ; Literature * In his 1948 autobiography, poet and writer Robert W. Service wrote a few comments about Tropic of Cancer, for example, \\"Of course the book shocked me but I could not deny a strange flicker of genius in its wildest fights.\\" * In chapter 2 of William Gaddis's 1955 novel The Recognitions, set in Paris in the 1930s, an artist complains \\"I've got to show these pictures, I've got to sell some of them, but how can I have people coming up there with him there? He's dying. I can't put him out on the street, dying like that . . . even in Paris\\" (63-64), which echoes the scene in Tropic of Cancer where the artist Kruger tries to get the sick Miller out of his studio so that he can exhibit his pictures. \\"People can't look at pictures and statues with enthusiasm when a man is dying before their eyes\\" (Grove ed., 195). * In his 1960 short story \\"Entropy\\", Thomas Pynchon begins with a quote from this novel. * In the 1965 novel God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater by Kurt Vonnegut, Lila reads the book \\"as though...

He is a weather prophet.\\" * Frontman Henry Rollins of the hardcore punk band Black Flag was heavily affected by the book as well and frequently made references to it in his songs, often taking lyrics directly from Tropic of Cancer. He would also read passages of it to his audiences mid-show. * In the song \\"Delirium of Disorder\\" by punk band Bad Religion, the opening verse quotes the novel, \\"Life is a sieve through which my anarchy strains resolving itself into words. Chaos is the score on which reality is written...\\". * In the song \\"Protest Song 68\\" by Refused, the opening verse quotes the novel, \\"To sing you must first open your mouth. You must have a pair of lungs...\\" * In the song \\"Ashes of American Flags\\" by Wilco, one phrase from the lyrics is taken from the novel: \\"A hole without a key.\\" * In 2012, the American grindcore band Pig Destroyer used a passage from the book on tape, read by Larry King, as the introduction to their song The Bug on their album entitled Book Burner. ; Film and television * In a 1962 episode of the TV series Perry Mason (\\"The Case of the Bogus Books\\"), a character tells another that \\"Tropic of Cancer is not a medical book.

It depicts the wartime experiences of a platoon, based partially on Mailer's experiences as a cook with the 112th Cavalry Regiment during the Philippines Campaign in World War II. Published when he was 25 years old, the novel quickly became a bestseller, paving the way for other works such as The Deer Park, Advertisements for Myself, and The Time of Our Time. Mailer believed The Naked and the Dead to be his most renowned work. It became the first popular novel about World War II and is considered one of the greatest English-language novels.John Bear, The #1 New York Times Best Seller: intriguing facts about the 484 books that have been #1 New York Times bestsellers since the first list, 50 years ago, Berkeley: Ten Speed Press, 1992, pp. 31-39 It was later adapted into a film in 1958. In 1998 the Modern Library ranked The Naked and the Dead 51st on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. Plot The novel is divided into four parts: Wave; Argil and Mold; Plant and Phantom; and Wake. Within these parts are chorus sections, consisting of play-like dialogue between characters, as well as Time Machine sections, which give brief histories and flashbacks of individual characters‚Äô lives. The story takes place on Anopopei, a fictional island somewhere in the South Pacific. American forces are faced with a campaign to drive out the Japanese so that Americans can advance into the Philippines. The novel focuses on the experiences of one platoon. =Part One - Wave= Staff Sergeant Sam Croft, Woodrow Wilson, and Roy Gallagher are playing cards the night before a scheduled attack. They are members of a recon platoon fighting in the Asian theater of World War II on a fictional island named Anopopei. The next morning, as the platoon takes boats to the island, they are nervous. Sgt. William Brown and Cpl. Stanley talk about women and the other men in their squad. The assault begins, and as the platoon waits for their scheduled turn to come to the island, they nervously joke amongst themselves. Once the squad reaches the beach, they begin digging foxholes. Stanley picks a fight with Oscar Ridges and Red Valsen, but ultimately Red knows the time is not right for a fight, and he backs down. Croft leaves to find his commanding officer. Once they‚Äôve begun to settle in on the beach, the Japanese begin to attack. The squad splits up. Cpl. Toglio, Hennessey, and Ridges have completed their foxholes, so they stay on the beach. Brown, Gallagher, Wilson, Red, Stanley, and Sgt. Julio Martinez run after Croft. As the beach is shelled, Hennessey panics and soils himself. He runs down the beach in an attempt to clean his pants, but he is killed by shrapnel. =Part Two - Argil and Mold= Croft pleads with higher officers to give him more men to replace those lost. He ultimately earns an extra replacement man, bringing the depleted squad up to fourteen out of an intended twenty. Roth and Goldstein, two of the new men in the platoon, bond over their shared Jewish heritage. Lt. Robert Hearn, a noncom officer, snaps at the officer‚Äôs table towards a couple other officers. Major General Edward Cummings steps in to prevent the situation from escalating further. Hearn and Cummings form an odd friendship. The two talk in Cummings‚Äô tent at night. They discuss philosophy and Cummings analyzes Hearn‚Äôs personality based on his behavior. Cummings tells Hearn that, as an officer, he must develop resentment for the enlisted men. An intense storm comes in, destroying all the work the enlisted men had done the previous week building a bivouac. Tents go flying and everyone tries to stay as dry as they can. In an effort to keep the men‚Äôs spirits up during the storm, Red leads them in song. General Cummings makes the rounds to evaluate the storm damage and good-naturedly tells the men to expect a Japanese attack. Cummings makes further preparations up and down the line for the attack. Roth and Minetta are separated from the rest of the squad, and when they hear gunfire, they assume recon must be in the middle of a firefight. As Roth keeps watch, he falls asleep at his post and wakes up Stanley a half hour late. The next day, the other half of the platoon moves anti-tank guns, which is difficult because of all the mud. Wyman drops his leg of the gun, and it rolls all the way back down a hill. When he tries to take responsibility, Croft thinks he‚Äôs covering for Goldstein, who he blames instead. The entire platoon meets back up, and as they sleep, they‚Äôre attacked by Japanese soldiers. Luckily, Croft is one of the men on watch when they attack, and he leads the platoon in repelling the Japanese, killing multiple Japanese soldiers. Toglio gets hit in the arm during the battle, which means he‚Äôll get to go home. The soldiers say he‚Äôs lucky because his wound won‚Äôt prevent him from doing anything once it heals, but he still gets to return to America. The Japanese attack up and down the American lines, but the Americans fend off the attack at all points. Cummings and Hearn continue their antagonistic relationship and Cummings assigns Hearn to oversee the construction of a recreation tent for the officers. Hearn realizes he is feeling the resentment towards the enlisted men that Cummings predicted. The two discuss the nature of war, soldiers, and fighting. They also discuss politics and philosophy, and Cummings beats Hearn in a game of chess. Cummings tells Hearn, ‚ÄúMy wife is a bitch.‚Äù It is implied that Cummings is gay. ‚ÄúBetween [Cummings and Hearn]...was the uncomfortable realization that they did not like each other at all.‚Äù Croft, Red and Gallagher run into four Japanese soldiers in the forest, who don‚Äôt notice them. Croft throws a grenade, killing three of the soldiers. Red goes to finish off the remaining soldier, but his gun jams. The soldier rushes Red with a bayonet, and Red trips and falls. Croft comes out and stops the soldier from killing Red, and the Japanese man surrenders. Red goes back to camp, and Croft and Gallagher take the soldier prisoner. Croft gives the prisoner a cigarette and some chocolate. The prisoner shows them a picture of his family, and Gallagher tells him that his wife is going to have a baby shortly. Croft gives him another cigarette and then shoots him in the face, which brings him a perverse sense of pleasure. Wilson hears about a sergeant in another platoon who makes good liquor. He borrows money from a few other men to buy some. Wilson buys four canteens and brings three back to the squad, hiding one for himself. The men get drunk together. Wilson offers Goldstein a drink, but he refuses, saying that he is in the middle of writing a letter to his wife. The men mock Goldstein for being Jewish, and he realizes he hates everyone around him. He writes to his wife that he cannot remember why he is fighting. The drunk members of the platoon look for corpses to loot, but only find bodies that have been picked clean of ‚Äúsouvenirs.‚Äù Wilson drinks the canteen he stashed away before he goes on watch. As he stands by the machine gun, drunk, he sees a bush that he thinks would be a good hiding spot for a Japanese soldier, so he shoots the bush. The men wake up in a rush, thinking they are under attack. When Croft realizes that Wilson is the only one shooting, he yells at him. Hearn sits on a beach relaxing with the other officers as the enlisted men work in the forest. He realizes he does not like any of the other officers, and he has stronger feelings of resentment towards the enlisted men. The men discuss all the important men they knew back in the States, and one of them claims to have known Hearn‚Äôs father. Hearn quickly realizes that this man did not know his father, and he likely didn‚Äôt know any of the other important people he claimed to know either. Major Dalleson makes an officer with a camera take pictures of him shooting pebbles with his carbine to send back to his skeet shooting club back home. A load of mail comes in. Wyman is upset because he didn‚Äôt get anything from his girl back home. Red comforts him. Wilson‚Äôs wife is angry that he doesn‚Äôt send more money, and Wilson has Gallagher transcribe an angry response for him. Gallagher reads his own letters and feels a pang of jealousy to discover that an old friend earned a promotion that he was once up for. The chaplain calls Gallagher in and reports to him that his wife has died in childbirth, but his child survived. He continues to get letters from his wife, however. When the last letter arrives, Gallagher freaks out. He wonders what the point of fighting is. ‚ÄúHe thought of Hennessy and his mouth tightened. Get your head blown off...for what, for what?‚Äù Stanley, who just made corporal, clashes with Sgt. Brown. The two are unsure how to relate to each other. Stanley tells a story about a time he stole and then repaid money from a store he worked at to buy cheap furniture. From the beach, Croft spots a couple Japanese soldiers in the forest. The platoon, led by Croft, shoots them both, but Minetta is hit in the leg. Brown expresses a contempt for women to Stanley, who begins to wonder if his own wife is being faithful. The fighting settles down for a few weeks, and the lines begin to become stagnant. Cummings worries that the men are getting too comfortable in one place, which will make them unwilling to fight. He fears that if he cannot shift the front line, he will be replaced. His anxiety leads to health problems and constant outbursts directed at Hearn. Cummings commands Hearn to have Clellan, an enlisted man, put flowers in his tent each morning. This inspires conflict between Hearn and Clellan, which is what Cummings intends. Hearn becomes frustrated and easily provoked. Cummings instructs him to go pick up supplies for the officers‚Äô mess hall, but secretly pays off the seller to keep the goods from Hearn. Hearn bribes an assistant to get the supplies and later realizes what Cummings has done. The incident reframes Hearn‚Äôs past experiences with Cummings, which he realizes have all been aimed to anger him. Furious, Hearn extinguishes a cigarette on the floor of Cummings‚Äôs tent when Cummings is gone. Cummings discovers that a sergeant has been falsifying his patrol reports and realizes that his entire command has likely been doing the same thing. He vows to crack down on disciplinary issues. He returns to his tent to discover Hearn‚Äôs cigarette. He summons Hearn to his tent for the first time since they played chess. They have an intense discussion about the war and what will happen afterwards. Cummings reiterates his distaste for women. Cummings explains to Hearn that he wants to be a type of god. Cummings smokes a cigarette and throws it on the ground, just as Hearn did. He commands Hearn to pick up the cigarette or he will be court-martialed. Hearns asks him for a transfer to another division and Cummings denies his request and tells him to work labor under Dalleson. Hearns cuts Cummings back by asking, ‚ÄúShort of bringing in every man in the outfit, all six thousand of them, and letting them pick up your cigarettes, how are you going to impress them?‚Äù Minetta is in the hospital from his gunshot wound, which is healing quickly. He worries that he will be sent back to the front lines, so he deliberately re-opens his own wound. When he realizes he will likely be discharged, he decides that he would rather feign insanity in order to get sent home than return to the platoon. Minetta fires his gun in the medical tent and yells about enemy soldiers. A doctor is skeptical, but Minetta is sent to a separate tent for mental patients. Minetta spends a couple days in the mental ward and realizes he can‚Äôt take it anymore, so he claims to have woken up with no memory of the past week. The doctor who was skeptical pulls him aside and tells him that he knew Minetta was faking. When Minetta goes back to the platoon, he reports that the hospital was nicer than the front, so Red and Wilson try to report as sick. The doctors dismiss Red, but they caution Wilson that he‚Äôll need surgery after the war. Cummings tries to devise a new attack plan. He thinks long and hard about the most effective ways to outmaneuver the Japanese army. He comes up with a plan that he thinks will be militarily successful and also inspire the men to fight hard. Cummings asks Dalleson what he would think if Cummings transferred Hearn to another unit, which Dalleson perceives as odd, since generals usually wouldn‚Äôt be concerned with such minutiae. Hearn is doing busywork recording patrol logs when Dalleson comes in. The two begin to scrap, but Cummings interrupts. He asks Hearn to bring him a large and heavy map, which Hearn semi-accidentally drops on Cummings‚Äôs foot. When Cummings hears that he will not get naval support, he has to adjust his attack plan. He comes up with a new strategy. The plan is to send a recon squad, led by Hearn, who Cummings will transfer, to scout a trail from the backside of the island towards the beach, thereby allowing Cummings to send in a full company through that route from the back. The secondary company would then overpower the beach defenses, allowing for a full invasion from the beach. =Part Three - Plant and Phantom= Hearn joins the recon platoon on the boat to the other side of the island. He immediately realizes that Croft knows more than he does, and he doesn‚Äôt want the rest of the squad to realize that. Croft immediately dislikes Hearn because Hearn tries to befriend the men in the squad. Stanley tells Croft that he wishes Croft were still in charge. All the men are anxious about their own standing within the platoon, particularly the noncommissioned officers. Brown and Martinez discuss their fears. Croft and Hearn struggle for control of the platoon early in the mission, and Croft takes what Hearn will give him. Roth and Minetta struggle to keep up with the rest of the platoon as they try to bushwack through the jungle. Croft gets on them for being slow, and Minetta snaps at Croft. Croft realizes Hearn will soon get comfortable around the platoon and take more control. Goldstein and Ridges end up doing most of Roth and Minetta‚Äôs work. Minetta picks on Roth for being Jewish, and Goldstein, who is also Jewish, takes Minetta‚Äôs side. The platoon slowly works their way through the jungle, cutting leaves at a rate of about two yards a minute. It takes them five hours to get through the jungle to open fields. Hearn and Croft continue to subtly struggle for power. Hearn wants to try to go through a pass in the mountain range, but Croft wants to go over the mountain. Hearn continues to try to befriend the men in the platoon, which further angers Croft. Martinez, as the best at forging a trail, walks in front. Hearn stays in the back of the squad and realizes that no matter what he does he will not be able to get the men to like him. The platoon comes across an exposed field. Hearn and Croft decide to split the platoon into two groups, one to lead the way and the other to provide cover. Croft offers to lead the first group, but Hearn elects to do it himself. The first group gets about halfway through the field when they begin taking fire. Hearn freezes when the shooting stops and realizes he is waiting for Croft to give an order. This realization frustrates him enough to get him to move. He leads the group in a retreat. They move away from the field for ten minutes before they realize Wilson is missing. Wilson was shot in the stomach during the skirmish. He hides in a patch of tall grass, unseen to Japanese soldiers who he can hear talking. Croft, Red, Gallagher, Ridges, and Goldstein go back to the field to get Wilson. They bring him back to the rest of the platoon and realize his injury is too severe for him to continue the mission. Polack, Roth, and Minetta are getting materials to build for a stretcher for Wilson, but Roth gets distracted by a baby bird. Everyone is looking at the bird as Croft builds the stretcher. Croft sees them gathered around the bird and goes into a rage. He crushes the bird and throws it. The men are furious about it, and Red decides that enough is enough and challenges Croft. Hearn breaks up the fight and orders Croft to apologize. He does so reluctantly and only becomes more angry at Hearn. Brown, Stanley, Ridges, and Goldstein are assigned to carry Wilson back to the beach, and four more men (Minetta, Wyman, Polack, and Gallagher) go with them to help until they‚Äôre far from Japanese lines, leaving just five men: Hearn, Croft, Red, Roth, and Martinez. After Minetta, Wyman, Polack, and Gallagher return to the rest of the platoon, Brown stresses over the responsibility that he has been given. He realizes how important it is to him that they bring Wilson back alive. Back on the other side of the island, Cummings is pleasantly surprised by how well the attacks are going. He realizes he has misjudged his men‚Äôs morale, but it has worked out for the best since the men are more inclined to fight when they are restless. He receives word that he will receive more naval support than he expected, and he wonders if the recon mission was necessary. Roth is experiencing extreme anxiety, which is causing him stomach problems and keeping him from sleeping. He talks to Red and tries to thank him for standing up to Croft over the bird. Red recognizes that if he allows himself to become close with Roth, Roth‚Äôs death will be more painful, so he deliberately snaps at Roth to keep him distant. Red thinks to himself about the nature of the war. ‚Äú‚ÄòDid the GIs die in vain?‚Äô [Red] snorted. Who didn‚Äôt know the answer? Of course they died in vain, any GI knew the score.‚Äù Hearn realizes that the mission has almost no chance of succeeding now that the Japanese know they‚Äôre there. He considers turning back, but he decides that he could not face Cummings empty handed. He finally understands that his whole motivation throughout the entire mission was to get back at Cummings. That night, Hearn admits that there is nothing left to be gained, and he decides to turn around the next morning. However, Croft persuades him to send out a single man to see if the Japanese are still in the field where they were ambushed. They agree that if the recon man sees anything, they‚Äôll turn back. They pick Martinez as the recon man, but before he leaves, Croft tells Martinez to report to Hearn that he saw nothing when he gets back. At first, Martinez sees nothing. However, he soon realizes he has wandered into the middle of a Japanese camp, full of sleeping soldiers. He quietly kills the guard and escapes. He makes his way further through the valley and finds another Japanese camp. At this point, Martinez returns to the platoon and reports his findings to Croft. Croft warns him not to say anything about what he has seen to Hearn. Croft tells Hearn that Martinez saw nothing on his recon mission, and Hearn feels obligated to try to go through the valley. Hearn is leading the men back through the valley when he is unceremoniously shot and killed. Croft feels a sense of relief. ‚ÄúNo longer was there that confusion, that momentary internal pause before he gave an order.‚Äù The men are generally apathetic about Hearn‚Äôs death, seeing him as just another officer. Croft takes control of the platoon and decides to take the platoon up and over the mountain. Brown, Stanley, Ridges, and Goldstein are still carrying Wilson back to the beach, which is difficult given the terrain, heat, and fatigue. The group moves about a hundred yards at a time. Wilson is drifting in and out of consciousness and swearing at the men carrying him. Brown and Stanley fight. Wilson wants water, but Brown says he can‚Äôt have any because he has a stomach wound. Wilson begins to hallucinate. Wilson demands that they leave him, and each man individually considers it. Stanley collapses, and Brown stays with him, while Ridges and Goldstein continue to carry Wilson back to the beach. Croft cracks down on discipline to reassert himself as the leader of the platoon. Martinez tells the other men that he saw Japanese soldiers on his recon mission the night before, but when he reported it to Hearn, he didn‚Äôt believe it. Martinez believes that this is the truth. Martinez and Gallagher, as the Catholics of the group, discuss their fear of death, particularly with no priest around to confess their sins to if something were to happen to them. Croft knows that he must reach the top of the mountain, or the trick he pulled that got Hearn killed would be for nothing. But the mountain is extremely difficult, and the men are not motivated. Goldstein and Ridges continue to carry Wilson. They are exhausted beyond conversation and can only carry Wilson for ten to fifteen yards at a time. Wilson continues to mutter nonsense. By the end of the day, they‚Äôve advanced five miles since they left Brown and Stanley. Cummings leaves the island for Army headquarters to appeal for more naval support. Major Dalleson is left in charge. Dalleson receives a report indicating a large breach in the Japanese lines and sees no choice but to attack. He finds himself hoping that the report is untrue, because he is unsure of what to do in the case that the report is correct. He realizes he is unqualified to be leading the Army in such a situation, and he wishes Cummings had not left. Dalleson quickly throws together an attack plan, and as the plan is executed, he realizes there are many things he has not considered. Dalleson‚Äôs attack is wildly successful. The Japanese general is killed, along with much of his support staff. Cummings returns with the destroyer he just begged for, only to find that there is no longer much of a need for it. The destroyer provides a little bit of support from the sea, and the Americans essentially wrap up the campaign. Cummings has forgotten entirely about the recon mission. Up on the mountain, the platoon has no idea what is happening with the rest of the campaign. The mountain proves more treacherous than even Croft expected, and every man in the platoon, including Croft, feels an internal desire to turn back. Minetta, Wyman, and Roth are dragging behind the rest of the squad. Roth begins to fall every hundred feet or so, to the increasing irritation of the rest of the platoon. Roth falls again and tells them to leave him behind. Gallagher hits him and yells, ‚ÄúGet up, you Jew bastard!‚Äù The comment angers Roth enough to motivate him to stand and continue. The mountain terrain is becoming increasingly dangerous, and they come to a narrow ledge in front of a gap of about four feet. Croft sees no way over it but to jump, and everyone in the platoon achieves the jump with relative ease. Roth knows he cannot make the jump, but as he stands on the ledge, he hears Gallagher goading him. He jumps but comes up short and falls to his death. Goldstein and Ridges continue to struggle with Wilson. Ridges can no longer remember why Wilson should not be allowed to have water and gives him some. Ridges comes to the realization that no matter what they do, Wilson is going to die. Both Ridges and Goldstein consider leaving Wilson, but they both decide that they cannot for religious reasons. Ridges asks Wilson to repent before he dies, and Wilson, who is no longer lucid, agrees. As they rest in preparation to cross a river, Wilson dies. Ridges and Goldstein continue to carry his body, but as they cross the river, they lose it. Ridges and Goldstein make it back to the beach and realize they have nothing to do but sit and wait for the rest of the squad. The platoon is shaken after Roth‚Äôs death. They move a little bit farther and decide to camp for the night. Gallagher realizes the responsibility he has for Roth‚Äôs death. The next morning, Gallagher and Martinez turn on Croft and demand that they turn back. However, Croft will not waver and orders the men to continue on. Red declares that he will not continue either, and Croft threatens to shoot him. Red eventually backs down, bringing the lengthy power struggle between the two to a conclusion. Red admits to himself that the army ‚Äúhas him licked.‚Äù Croft turns around a bend only to directly upset a hornets‚Äô nest. The men run back to evade the hornets, and in their hurry, toss away their packs and rifles. Within fifteen minutes, they‚Äôve made it back farther than the place they started that morning. Croft accepts defeat and wearily gives the order that they will go back to the beach and wait for the boat to bring them back to the American lines. All the surviving members of the platoon meet back up on the beach. Stanley and Brown arrive only a few hours before Croft‚Äôs group. Once the boat picks them up, the men learn that the campaign is essentially over. They share laughter for a while, which is slowly replaced by a silent sadness, mixed with uncertainty and frustration that the entire patrol was for naught. =Part Four - Wake= In the process of ‚Äúmopping up,‚Äù Cummings discovers that a Japanese supply depot had been destroyed by artillery fire weeks before. The Japanese lines had been falling apart for months, and a week before the final attack, the Japanese had run out of ammo. Cummings looks back at his intelligence reports and sees that they gave no indication of Japanese weaknesses. ‚ÄúFor a moment [Cummings] almost admitted that he had had very little or perhaps nothing at all to do with this victory, or indeed any victory -- it had been accomplished by a random play of vulgar good luck larded into a causal net of factors too large, too vague, for him to comprehend. He allowed himself this thought...but it caused him a deep depression.‚Äù The novel ends with Major Dalleson thinking of a new way to implement map training exercises, indicating that despite the lessons each character in the novel learned about the meaninglessness of war, the structures will remain unchanged. Main characters *Hennessey is a newer member of the platoon. He is very cautious with all of his gear and movements so as to not get killed. When they arrive at the beach of Anopopei, he defecates in his pants out of fear during the opening action scene. He has a mental break down and runs down the beach in hopes of getting new pants. He is killed soon after by shrapnel from an exploding mortar shell. *Woodrow Wilson is a large, impoverished white Southerner. He has a happy-go-lucky and generous nature. In his \\"Time Machine\\" we learn Wilson wakes up married to a woman named Alice after a drunken night at the bar. Their marriage consists of love affairs and money troubles. Later, Wilson suffers a long, agonizing death after being shot in the stomach by the Japanese; Brown, Goldstein, Ridges, and Stanley try to carry him back to the beach to be saved but he dies on the way there. *Julio Martinez is a Mexican-American from Texas. He is nicknamed Japbait by Croft and made sergeant in General Cummings infantry division. Martinez was terrified, constantly on edge and an introvert throughout the beginning of the novel. He however, gains bravery through battle and is an excellent soldier, especially in terms of getting a scope for the land. He is well trusted by the other men in the platoon. Croft convinces Martinez to lie about a Japanese platoon he saw on a solo scouting mission, which leads to the death of Hearn and to the men hiking to Mount Anaka under Croft's command. *Sam Croft has a large ego and is coldblooded throughout the novel. At one point, he immorally kills a Japanese POW. Later, he squeezes Roth‚Äôs baby bird to death as if he is crushing all innocence. He loves war and is Mailer‚Äôs version of a psychopath within the novel. He is seen as one of the best soldiers in the platoon and the other men both fear and respect him as a leader. In his time capsule, we learned he was cheated on by the women he loved which led to him being cold and developing a love for war. At the conclusion of the book, Croft refuses to look forward to his homecoming, believing that the war will continue for much longer. After all, he enjoys the war because he finds a thrill in killing. *Red Valsen claims he does not want to rise in the ranks. He appears numb to death and the war itself. As a child, he grew up in a mine town in Montana. Later, he runs away from home, losing contact with his entire family. After holding many jobs, Red moves in with his girlfriend Lois and her son. Afraid of commitment, Red joins the Army and runs away from Lois. While in the Army, Red loses contact with Lois just like he did with his own family. *Lieutenant Robert Hearn is the stereotypical white liberal. Harvard educated and from an affluent family, Hearn is General Cummings‚Äô assistant. He despises the caste system within the Army, wishing that he could reach out to the lower class foot soldiers. Later, Cummings transfers Hearn to Dalleson‚Äôs section. He leads the platoon through the jungle and to the mountain pass. Here, he is shot and killed quickly and anticlimactically not expecting Japanese resistance after Croft keeps the information from him. *General Edward Cummings is power-hungry, often comparing himself to God. As a child, Cummings experiences gender-role confusion. This forces his father to send him to military school. Later, Cummings attends West Point. While at West Point, he meets Margaret and feels socially pressured into marrying her. Margaret and Cummings are married and never have children. They have an unhappy marriage, perhaps due to Cummings homosexual tendencies and feelings. It is apparent through his conversations with Hearn that he has romantic feelings for him. *Roy Gallagher is Boston Irish and part of an Anti-Semitic gang called Christians United. He always seems angry throughout the novel. Later, he learns that his wife Mary died in childbirth, but their baby lived. Gallagher remains devastated for the rest of the novel. *Roth is a depressing, fickle stereotypical representation of a Jew. He, however, refuses to consider himself and strongly associate with being Jewish. Throughout the novel, he has a superiority complex because he is better educated than the other men of the platoon. Roth dies while climbing the mountain because he misses a jump and fails to grasp Gallagher‚Äôs hand. *Joey Goldstein is also Jewish like Roth. However, unlike Roth, he does not view himself as better than his Christian friends. Goldstein grows up as a mamma‚Äôs boy and desires to own his own shop. Later, he becomes a welder and marries Natalie, despite his mother‚Äôs disapproval. After their son is born, Goldstein struggles to support his family and maintain a loving relationship with his wife. Throughout the war, Goldstein is well-respected by his comrades, although he does lack courage at times. *William Brown is the stereotypical well-liked, neighborhood boy. Growing up in a middle-class family, Brown later attends a state university. Here he joins a fraternity and flunks out by freshman year. He marries a girl from his high school, Beverly, and lives a fairly boring life. Throughout the war, he worries that Beverly will cheat on him while he‚Äôs away. He is certain that he will throw her out of the house when he returns home. *Stanley insists that women are no different from men. He trusts his wife Ruthie, who is the mother of his child. In some ways, he is the quiet feminist within the novel. He is also more ambitious than the other soldiers, since he is inexperienced in war; he desires to move up in ranks and befriends Brown in order to do so. *Toglio is an Italian- American. Patriotic, trusting, and good-natured, he is friends with most of his platoon. He sustains a million-dollar wound during combat and is sent home. Subsequently, as time passes, some characters come to envy his wound and grow to hate him. *Casimir \\"Polack\\" Czienwicz comes from a lower-class Polish family. He grows up with seven siblings and, after his father dies, he enters the orphanage. At thirteen, an older woman seduces him multiple times. These experiences make Polack a tough, courageous soldier in the Army. *Oscar Ridges is extremely Christian. He assures Wyman, who refers to him as ‚Äúthe preacher,‚Äù that ‚ÄúThe Lord‚Äôll keep me from shooting a Christian‚Äù. Despite his Christian beliefs, Ridges befriends Goldstein as his buddy. This friendship between a Jew and Christian demonstrates how the war brought men of different backgrounds together. *Buddy Wyman does not play a major role within the novel. He dreams of becoming a war hero in order to support his mother and himself. *Steven Minetta is twenty years old and was known as the ‚Äúbest dresser on the block‚Äù when he was growing up. He is eventually wounded but then returns to the platoon. At the conclusion of the novel, Minetta feels anger towards power figures and hopes to ‚Äúexpose the goddam Army.‚Äù *Dalleson was second in command to Cummings. He was very nervous throughout the novel and did not trust his own judgment. At the end of the novel, however, it is Dalleson who helps them win the war against the Japanese Army. Themes Throughout the novel, Mailer dwells on many themes. These themes are recurring throughout his works and reappear in several of his later essays and novels. Dehumanization of soldiers Commenting on the dehumanization of soldiers in The Naked and the Dead, Mailer said, \\"The book finds man corrupted, confused to the point of helplessness, but it also find that there are limits beyond which he cannot be pushed.\\" The narrator illustrates the exhaustion and humiliation of the soldiers' life: ‚ÄúWhen a man was harnessed into a pack and web belt and carried a rifle and two bandoliers and several grenades, a bayonet and a helmet, he felt as if he had a tourniquet over both shoulders and across his chest. It was hard to breathe and his limbs kept falling asleep.‚Äù Dehumanization of the soldier is also seen in Chapter 5 when the platoon had to carry antitank guns between 1st Battalion and A Company, which was about a mile of muddy trail. The men became numb and only went through the motions of carrying the guns and the generals disregarded the soldiers' exhaustion. The soldiers generally believed the army didn't see them as people and that \\"they don't care if you live or die here [the infirmary]. All they want is to get you back where you can stop a bullet\\". Mailer described The Naked and the Dead as \\"'an odyssey of fear, exhaustion, and death,'\\" and presents the natural world as \\"uncaring, unyielding, implacable, and occasionally, beautiful.\\" He adds insights into soldiers, like Martinez, in this context. Mailer writes that on his scouting mission, \\"Martinez was functioning more like an animal than a human.\\" Mailer also distills how dehumanizing the enemy was an essential aspect to the structure of war. Mailer writes, \\"Martinez had a sense of unreality . . . They were men. The entire structure of war wavered in his brain for a moment.\\" Mailer concludes the platoon's climb of Mount Anaka, reinforcing the loss of the individual within war, writing that \\"[the soldiers] did not think of themselves as individual men any longer. They were merely envelopes of suffering. They had forgotten about the patrol, about the war, their past, they had even forgotten the earth they had just climbed.\\" Loneliness: Loneliness acted as an equalizer among soldiers and officers during the Second World War. Despite divisions of rank, economic, political, sexuality, or class, loneliness was a unilateral phenomenon among soldiers and officers during the Second World War. Furthermore, this factored into the construction of brotherhood in wartime. In The Naked and the Dead, Goldstein feels a connection and a sort of alliance with Roth in their Jewish heritage. Although the men in the platoon do have a sense of brotherhood with one another, they still feel alone during their deployment. Throughout the novel, the men long for women and deeper friendships. Roth, for example, wishes to have someone whom he ‚Äúcould talk to seriously.‚Äù He realizes that he doesn‚Äôt know his own comrades very well, since everyone he met when he initially entered the Army was either killed or reassigned somewhere else. The men degrade women through the narrative; however, the absence of women factors into their reaction to disparage women, whose presence on the front lines was limited. Death: The men are faced with unexpected deaths, such as Hennessey's, Wilson, Hearn, Roth, and Gallagher‚Äôs wife who dies during childbirth. It is clear death surrounds them and their lives could be taken away in any moment. Cummings, having been surrounded by Army deaths the majority of his career, still never warms to the smell of rotting corpses. Red, like the other soldiers, realizes he or one of his comrades could be killed any minute. Even when they grew used to death and saw it as \\"large and devastating and meaningless. Men who were killed were nearly men no longer around\\", a comrade's death would cause \\"the idea of death [to be] fresh and terrifying again\\". This fear of death also had a negative impact on the mental health and sanity of the men. For instance, Red states, \\"Goddam Army gets you so you're afraid to turn around\\". The men began to have a pessimistic view of life believing \\"All dead things... everything lives to die\\" This was especially so since \\"that's all [soldiers] can ever do in the Army, sit and think\\" which caused the thoughts and fears of death to be constant and prevalent. The first death in the novel introduces this theme into the narrative. Red observes Hennessey's death. The narrator reveals that \\"[u]ntil Hennessy had been killed, Red had accepted all the deaths of the men he knew as something large and devastating and meaningless . . . Hennessey's death had opened a secret fear.\\" Croft is also surprisingly moved by Hennessey's death. The narrator declares that \\"Hennessey's death had opened to Croft vistas of such omnipotence that he was afraid to consider it directly. All day the fact hovered about his head, tantalizing him with odd dreams and portents of power.\\" Gallagher's wife, Mary dies in childbirth in America. When Gallagher learns of her death, he continues to receive letters she sent before her death. Because of the disparity of time and space between men and women and their families during wartime, Gallagher considers that Mary \\"lived for him only at the exact time when he read her letters.\\" On the mission across Mount Anaka, Roth discovers a baby bird, and the platoon, with the exception of Croft, are fascinated by the bird. The bird symbolizes innocence and the futility of death during war, as Roth cares for the baby bird and Croft is then enraged by it and crushes the bird in his hand.. Moreover, the contrast between Hearn and Roth's deaths reflects both the bonds of brotherhood made among soldiers during war and the division between rank. Lieutenant Hearn's death is immediate and has little recovery time, with the platoon mourning for ten or twenty seconds. Croft is even relieved by Hearn's death, as he is now in charge of the platoon again. In contrast, Roth's death \\"shatter[s] the platoon.\\" Instead of choosing to face Croft, Roth chose to risk falling to his death. Not only is the platoon shattered, but Mailer underlines the division between the empowered and powerless, the narrator declares, \\"It was Croft's fault that Roth had been killed.\\" Power: Mailer's predominant theme throughout The Naked and the Dead is illustrated through the power relations among the men, especially the relationships between commanding officers and subordinates. Power is distilled in General Cummings's character. Cummings compares himself to the ‚Äúchief monk‚Äù and God throughout the book. He also openly supports the class system within the military, and states Hearn must accept the ‚Äúemotional prejudices of his class‚Äù, especially since he is an officer. People of higher ranks like Hearn and Cummings, after all, enjoy a better quality of life than the other foot soldiers. They sleep in larger staterooms while the soldiers share small rooms and are jammed into cots. This power system and power relations is reinforced within the missions. After Hearn dies, Croft is \\"relieved\\" that there is no longer a rival to his power and takes over leading the platoon up the mountain. While the other soldiers clearly want to stop and give up, they continue hiking the mountain simply because Croft commands them to. Chickenshit, as termed by Paul Fussell in Wartime: Understanding and Behavior in the Second World War, was a major aspect of the theme of power in the novel. This is shown in how Cummings makes Hearn do humiliating tasks and in the end sends him on a mission knowing he will die, which is the ultimate chickenshit since he sent him to die solely to demonstrate his power. This is another instance where the undemocratic nature of the Army is apparent. Analogous to the replacement of \\"fuck\\" with \\"fug,\\" Fussell commented on the obscenity in war, arguing that explicit language in wartime became precious as a way for millions of conscripts to note, in a licensed way, their bitterness and anger. During his service in World War II, Mailer did not yet have a plan for his war novel, but knew that he wanted to write a combat novel specifically set in the Philippines where \\"the American hunger for power was palpable.\\" Mailer told his sister that he wrote to his wife, Bea, about his plans for a novella with \\"'a ridge or a peak as a symbol' of 'the higher aspirations of man, the craving for the secret, the core of life,'\\" and the Faustian need for power. In another letter to his wife, Mailer recounted an encounter with the top mess sergeant, who called him \\"'a chickenshit son of a bitch.'\\" This real life incident inspired Mailer to construct the pivotal confrontation between General Cummings and Lieutenant Hearn which leads indirectly to Hearn's death. Initially, Cummings burdens Hearn with small, chickenshit tasks, and later Hearn retaliates within restricted power dynamics by dropping a match on the General's floor and grounds it into the floor with his heel. According to General Cummings, \\"what Hearn had done was equivalent to a soldier's laying hands on his person.\\" Thus, Cummings transfers Hearn to the platoon with Croft. During World War II, General Patton was considered on of the most fastidious perpetuators of chickenshit, constantly enforcing the Army's dress code on his soldiers. Similarly, in The Naked and the Dead, Dalleson harps on pride in the outfit of the Army. J. Michael Lennon, Mailer's definitive biographer, claims that \\"Mailer's landscape descriptions crackle and pulse with energy and must be ranked among the best of postwar American writers.\\". Diana Trilling Diana_Trilling observed, \\"'The most dramatic moments in The Naked and the Dead are precipitated by intensities in nature.'\\" While writing his combat novel, Mailer stated that \\"[t]here are going to be troubling terrifying glimpses of order in disorder, of a horror which may or may not lurk beneath the surface of things.'\\" Hennessey's death as well as Croft, Reed, and Martinez's \\"primitive glimpses of a structure behind things\\" is Mailer's depiction of '\\"the old business of man constructing little tag-ends of a Gd for himself in his moral wilderness.'\\" Mailer argued that everything is more direct in war and this dramatically impacts the senses and one's perception of realism. Mailer depicts this theme of power in nature and man's subjection to that in Cummings and Croft's reflection on Mount Anaka. Homosexuality: The theme of homosexuality is most evident through Cummings. In his \\"Time Machine\\", Mailer illustrates Cummings growing up experiencing gender-role confusion. Although his mother supports Cummings' identity, his father refuses to have a son who is homosexual and thus sends him to military school. This portages the notion of the Army being only for \\"real men\\". However, there were a lot of homosexual men who were soldiers during WWII and as Allan B√©rub√© illustrates in Coming Out Under Fire: History of Gay Men and Women in World War Two, they were often seen as trusted and respected soldiers and medics. While in the Army, it is clear Cummings developed romantic feelings towards Hearn and sexually desired him. Through Cummings, Mailer illustrates his beliefs of homosexuality. Although Mailer believes being homosexual is evil, it is interesting he had the general be the homosexual character in the novel, especially since he depicts the general as being a powerful figure who is a good leader. Mailer also includes homosexual characters in his other works as well, such as in The Deer Park. Mailer directly addresses this theme and his beliefs of homosexuality in \\"The Homosexual Villain\\" stating he saw homosexuals as evil and always depicted them as the villain in his works but realized they were humans. Mailer utilizes the trope than men coded as homosexual are villains, repressed, and effeminate. Brotherhood: The Naked and the Dead depicts the bonds of brotherhood during World War II, particularly examining the relationships among platoons. During World War II, soldiers developed strong friendships to which civilians could not relate. Croft expresses his feelings of brotherhood and tells his comrades, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre all good guys. You‚Äôre all chicken, and you‚Äôre all yellow, but you‚Äôre good guys. They ain‚Äôt a goddam thing wrong with you.‚Äù Mailer's use of Croft in this scene emphasizes the unilateral sentiment and necessity of brotherhood during wartime. The theme recurs in Part III when Brown, Goldstein, Ridges, and Stanley attempt to carry the wounded Wilson back to camp. Despite the physical strains, the men persisted in order to save Wilson. The brotherhood of the platoon is also illustrated by the group's reactions to the deaths of Hearn and Roth. New to the platoon, Hearn, when he was killed by Japanese soldiers, the platoon stood shocked for a couple of seconds but quickly moved on under the continued leadership of Croft. However, when in the wake of Roth's death, \\"the platoon was shattered. For ten minutes they huddled together on the shelf, too stricken, too terrified, to move on.\\" The gravity of Roth's death demonstrates the deep bond of brotherhood, pervasive not only during World War II but more specifically among the platoon. Masculinity: The Naked and the Dead acts as Mailer's introduction into the literary pantheon, and like his later works, Mailer portrays women as sexual objects. Many men, especially Brown, fear their wives are cheating on them while they are at war. This causes them to have more hatred towards women and a deep distrust towards them. Brown tells Stanley that if he finds out his wife cheated on him, he will beat her then throw her out. Later, in the Chorus ‚ÄúWomen,‚Äù Polack insists that ‚Äúthere ain‚Äôt a fuggin woman is any good‚Äù and Brown agrees. Women are especially emphasized within \\"Time Machine\\" segments. In these segments, the men‚Äôs romantic relationships and sexual experiences are described in detail. In many of the \\"Time Machines\\", such as Martinez's, women are portrayed as simply sexual objects. In Croft's \\"Time Machine\\", we learn was cheated on by the women he loved which resulted in him being cold and having a hatred towards women. The men seem to disregard the fact that they have cheated several times on their partners but show extreme hatred in the thought of their wives cheating on them. The only character that seems to positively view his wife is Gallagher, who becomes miserable and lost after she dies. This deep hatred for women, however, is a way to mask how strongly these men miss and desire women; they desperately need women for a variety of different reasons. Mailer exemplifies the construction of the masculine identity, and analyzes masculinity as socially constructed, context-specific and culture-bound. Male studies enforces The Naked and the Dead as part of American literature which reflects American society's conception of masculinity based on the representation of masculinity in American fiction. The construction of American masculinity predicated off of violence and adventure narratives is particularly distilled in Croft as the typified combat soldier. Development Writing development: Before he left for basic training, Mailer was certain that he could write \\"THE war novel\\" based on his experiences as a cook and the experiences of soldiers in World War II. After returning home from the war, he moved to France with his first wife, Beatrice, where he studied at the Sorbonne in Paris. Here, in just 15 months, Mailer wrote his war novel as noted in his introduction to its Fiftieth Anniversary Edition. Mailer states his writing inspiration came from the great Russian novelists like Leo Tolstoy. While writing, Mailer often read \\"from Anna Karenina most mornings before he commenced his own work.\\" Mailer believed Tolstoy enabled him to bring compassion to his pages; Tolstoy taught him that \\"compassion is valueless without severity.\\" Mailer was convinced he brought this compassion to The Naked and the Dead, and it is what enabled a 25-year-old to write an incredible war novel. Throughout his writing process, Mailer explained, he \\"used to write twenty-five pages of first draft a week,\\" which allowed his novel to flow from page to page. Mailer felt this novel was the easiest for him to write, as he finished it quickly and passionately. He later stated, \\"Part of me thought it was possibly the greatest book written since War and Peace.\\" Despite the author‚Äôs self-praise, he acknowledged his writing immaturity within the novel. Mailer insisted \\"it was sloppily written in many parts (the words came too quickly and too easily) and there was hardly a noun in any sentence that was not holding hands with the nearest and most commonly available adjective.\\" However, despite this criticism, Mailer believed the book deserved to be a best seller. It was written with vigor and contained acute descriptiveness which enabled readers to imagine what World War II was really like. Mailer admitted that he still returned to The Naked and the Dead occasionally and reread passages because they gave him hope ‚Äúfor all of us.‚Äù Character that represents Mailer: Mailer stated he did not portray himself as one of the characters. However, he mentions the character of Roth is the most similar to himself. He states Roth's experiences within the novel closely resembled his own experiences in WWII, especially in comparison to the other characters. This similarity is also evident in how they are both Jewish but don't necessarily strongly declare being Jewish. = \\"Fug\\" = The publishers of The Naked and the Dead prevented Mailer from using the word \\"fuck\\" in his novel and had to use the euphemism \\"fug\\" instead. Mailer's version of a subsequent incident follows: > The word has been a source of great embarrassment to me over the years > because, you know, Tallulah Bankhead's press agent, many years ago, got a > story in the papers which went...\\"Oh, hello, you're Norman Mailer,\\" said > Tallulah Bankhead allegedly, \\"You're the young man that doesn't know how to > spell...\\" You know, the four-letter word was indicated with all sorts of > asterisks. The incident is mentioned in John Green's An Abundance of Katherines. Colin Singleton tells Lindsey Lee Wells he likes to read literary criticism after reading a book. Colin says the publisher indicated that no one in 1948 would buy The Naked and the Dead \\"'because it contains even more F-bombs than it does Regular Bombs.' So Norman Mailer, as a kind of fug-you to the publisher, went through his 872-page book and changed every last F-word to 'fug.'\\" The rock band the Fugs took their name from this word. Reception In 1948, at the age of twenty-five, Mailer published The Naked and the Dead, which was extremely successful. The book sold 200,000 copies in its first three months and remained on the New York Times best seller list for 62 weeks. Later, Modern Library named The Naked and the Dead one of the top hundred novels in the English language. Publisher Bennett Cerf declared in 1948 \\"only three novels published since the first of the year that were worth reading ... Cry, the Beloved Country, The Ides of March, and The Naked and the Dead.\\" Hartley Shawcross as Attorney General for England and Wales explained why he would not prosecute the book under the Obscene Publications Acts: \\"Whilst there is much in this most tedious and lengthy book which is foul, lewd and revolting, looking at it as a whole I do not think that its intent is to corrupt or deprave or that it is likely to lead to any result other than disgust at its contents.\\" Tom Driberg welcomed the decision. In its initial review the Times Literary Supplement complained that the novel \\"grows increasingly unreadable\\" due to Mailer's tendency to \\"leave nothing out\\".Ross, Alan. \\"Under Fire.\\" The Times Literary Supplement, 20 May 1949, p. 325. The Daily Telegraph described the novel as \\"dull\\" for the same reason.Johnson, Pamela Hansford. \\"New Fiction.\\" Daily Telegraph, 13 May 1949, p. 6. Later, Gore Vidal would write: > My first reaction to The Naked and the Dead was: it‚Äôs a fake. A clever, > talented, admirably executed fake. I have not changed my opinion of the book > since‚Ä¶ I do recall a fine description of men carrying a dying man down a > mountain‚Ä¶ Yet every time I got going in the narrative I would find myself > stopped cold by a set of made-up, predictable characters taken not from > life, but from the same novels all of us had read, and informed by a na√Øvet√© > which was at its worst when Mailer went into his Time-Machine and wrote > those passages which resemble nothing so much as smudged carbons of a Dos > Passos work.

History  Spring of the River Bosna under Mount Igman Vrelo Bosne, in the municipality of Ilid≈æa, is one of the country's popular natural landmarks and provides a quiet escape from an otherwise busy city life. A Roman Bridge is located not far from Vrelo Bosne on the Bosna river in the Ilid≈æa municipality, which was built sometime between 1530 and 1550 from the original Roman stones and ruins of the bridge that stood there during the Roman period used to connect the Romans with the village of Aquae Sulphurae at the time. Ilid≈æa is also known to have been an archaeological site dating 2400‚Äì2000BC. The spring water at Vrelo Bosne is drinkable, however not recommended. On a typical year more than 60,000 tourists visit the park. The park is usually entered by foot or, for a reasonable price, by horse-carriage via the 3 kilometer straight main avenue (Velika Aleja) leading into it. The avenue itself contains traditional buildings from the Austro-Hungarian-era offering a peek into the luxuries of the past. The paths and roads inside the park are ideal for walks and bicycle riding and give the visitors the opportunity to take a closer look at the bubbling streams and waterfalls. Outdoor caf√©s and restaurants are available offering drinks and food but opening times vary from season to season. Typical animals are ducks and swans among others. During the Bosnian War the park was not maintained and trees were chopped and used for heating by the local citizens. In 2000 the park was restored to its former look by local youths led by an international ecological organization. Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team is known to hold their training sessions at the Vrelo Bosne park. Team also stays at near by Hotel Hercegovina.

Electrical breakdown or dielectric breakdown is a process that occurs when an electrical insulating material, subjected to a high enough voltage, suddenly becomes an electrical conductor and electric current flows through it. All insulating materials undergo breakdown when the electric field caused by an applied voltage exceeds the material's dielectric strength. The voltage at which a given insulating object becomes conductive is called its breakdown voltage and depends on its size and shape. Under sufficient electrical potential, electrical breakdown can occur within solids, liquids, gases or vacuum. However, the specific breakdown mechanisms are different for each kind of dielectric medium. Electrical breakdown may be a momentary event (as in an electrostatic discharge), or may lead to a continuous electric arc if protective devices fail to interrupt the current in a power circuit. In this case electrical breakdown can cause catastrophic failure of electrical equipment, and fire hazards. Explanation Electric current is a flow of electrically charged particles in a material caused by an electric field, usually created by a voltage difference across the material. The mobile charged particles which make up an electric current are called charge carriers. In different substances different particles serve as charge carriers: in metals and some other solids some of the outer electrons of each atom (conduction electrons) are able to move about in the material; in electrolytes and plasma it is ions, electrically charged atoms or molecules, and electrons that are charge carriers. A material that has a high concentration of charge carriers available for conduction, such as a metal, will conduct a large current with a given electric field, and thus has a low electrical resistivity; this is called an electrical conductor. A material that has few charge carriers, such as glass or ceramic, will conduct very little current with a given electric field and has a high resistivity; this is called an electrical insulator or dielectric. All matter is composed of charged particles, but the common property of insulators is that the negative charges, the orbital electrons, are tightly bound to the positive charges, the atomic nuclei, and cannot easily be freed to become mobile. However, when a large enough electric field is applied to any insulating substance, at a certain field strength the number of charge carriers in the material suddenly increases by many orders of magnitude, so its resistance drops and it becomes a conductor. This is called electrical breakdown. The physical mechanism causing breakdown differs in different substances. In a solid, it usually occurs when the electric field becomes strong enough to pull outer valence electrons away from their atoms, so they become mobile, and the heat created by their collisions releases additional electrons. In a gas, the electric field accelerates the small number of free electrons naturally present (due to processes like photoionization) to a high enough speed that when they collide with gas molecules they knock additional electrons out of them, called ionization, which go on to ionize more molecules creating more free electrons and ions in a chain reaction called a Townsend discharge. As illustrated above, in most materials breakdown occurs by a chain reaction in which mobile charge particles release additional charged particles. = Dielectric strength and breakdown voltage = The electric field strength (in volts per meter) at which breakdown occurs is an intrinsic property of the insulating material called its dielectric strength. The electric field is usually caused by a voltage difference applied across the material. The applied voltage required to cause breakdown in a given insulating object is called the object's breakdown voltage. The electric field created in a given insulating object by an applied voltage varies depending on the size and shape of the object and the location on the object where the voltage is applied, so in addition to the material's dielectric strength, the breakdown voltage depends on these factors. In a flat sheet of insulator between two flat metal electrodes, the electric field E is proportional to the voltage difference V divided by the thickness D of the insulator, E \\\\propto V/D, so in general the breakdown voltage is proportional to the length of insulation between two conductors. However the shape of the conductors can influence the breakdown voltage. = Breakdown process = Breakdown is a local process, and in an insulating medium subjected to a high voltage difference begins at whatever point in the insulator the electric field first exceeds the local dielectric strength of the material. Since the electric field at the surface of a conductor is highest at protruding parts, sharp points and edges, in a homogeneous insulator like air or oil adjacent to a conductor breakdown usually starts at these points. If the breakdown is caused by a local defect in a solid insulator, such as a bubble in a ceramic insulator, it may remain limited to a small region; this is called partial discharge. In a gas adjacent to a sharp pointed conductor, local breakdown processes, corona discharge or brush discharge, can allow current to leak off the conductor into the gas as ions. However, usually in a homogeneous solid insulator after one region has broken down and become conductive there is no voltage drop across it, and the full voltage difference is applied to the remaining length of the insulator. Since the voltage drop is now across a shorter length, this creates a higher electric field in the remaining material, which causes more material to break down. So the breakdown region rapidly (within microseconds) spreads in the direction of the voltage gradient from one end of the insulator to the other, until a continuous conductive path is created through the material between the two contacts applying the voltage difference, allowing a current to flow between them. Electrical breakdown can also occur without an applied voltage, due to an electromagnetic wave. When a sufficiently intense electromagnetic wave passes through a material medium, the electric field of the wave can be strong enough to cause temporary electrical breakdown. For example a laser beam focused to a small spot in air can cause electrical breakdown and ionization of the air at the focal point. = Consequences = In practical electric circuits electrical breakdown is usually an unwanted occurrence, a failure of insulating material causing a short circuit, possibly resulting in a catastrophic failure of the equipment. In power circuits, the sudden drop in resistance causes a high current to flow through the material, beginning an electric arc, and if safety devices do not interrupt the current quickly the sudden extreme Joule heating may cause the insulating material or other parts of the circuit to melt or vaporize explosively, damaging the equipment and creating a fire hazard. However, external protective devices in the circuit such as circuit breakers and current limiting can prevent the high current; and the breakdown process itself is not necessarily destructive and may be reversible. If the current supplied by the external circuit is sufficiently limited, no damage is done to the material, and reducing the applied voltage causes a transition back to the material's insulating state. Lightning and sparks due to static electricity are natural examples of the electrical breakdown of air. Electrical breakdown is part of the normal operating mode of a number of electrical components, such as gas discharge lamps like fluorescent lights, and neon lights, zener diodes, avalanche diodes, IMPATT diodes, mercury-vapor rectifiers, thyratron, ignitron, and krytron tubes, and spark plugs.  Failure of electrical insulation  Electrical breakdown is often associated with the failure of solid or liquid insulating materials used inside high voltage transformers or capacitors in the electricity distribution grid, usually resulting in a short circuit or a blown fuse. Electrical breakdown can also occur across the insulators that suspend overhead power lines, within underground power cables, or lines arcing to nearby branches of trees. Dielectric breakdown is also important in the design of integrated circuits and other solid state electronic devices. Insulating layers in such devices are designed to withstand normal operating voltages, but higher voltage such as from static electricity may destroy these layers, rendering a device useless. The dielectric strength of capacitors limits how much energy can be stored and the safe working voltage for the device.  Mechanism  Breakdown mechanisms differ in solids, liquids, and gasses. Breakdown is influenced by electrode material, sharp curvature of conductor material (resulting in locally intensified electric fields), the size of the gap between the electrodes, and the density of the material in the gap. =Solids= In solid materials (such as in power cables) a long-time partial discharge typically precedes breakdown, degrading the insulators and metals nearest to the voltage gap. Ultimately the partial discharge chars through a channel of carbonized material that conducts current across the gap. =Liquids= Possible mechanisms for breakdown in liquids include bubbles, small impurities, and electrical super-heating. The process of breakdown in liquids is complicated by hydrodynamic effects, since additional pressure is exerted on the fluid by the non-linear electrical field strength in the gap between the electrodes. In liquefied gases used as coolants for superconductivity - such as Helium at 4.2 K or Nitrogen at 77 K - bubbles can induce breakdown. In oil-cooled and oil-insulated transformers the field strength for breakdown is about 20 kV/mm (as compared to 3 kV/mm for dry air). Despite the purified oils used, small particle contaminants are blamed. =Gases= Electrical breakdown occurs within a gas when the dielectric strength of the gas is exceeded. Regions of intense voltage gradients can cause nearby gas to partially ionize and begin conducting. This is done deliberately in low pressure discharges such as in fluorescent lights. The voltage that leads to electrical breakdown of a gas is approximated by Paschen's Law. Partial discharge in air causes the \\"fresh air\\" smell of ozone during thunderstorms or around high-voltage equipment. Although air is normally an excellent insulator, when stressed by a sufficiently high voltage (an electric field of about 3 x 106 V/m or 3 kV/mm), air can begin to break down, becoming partially conductive. Across relatively small gaps, breakdown voltage in air is a function of gap length times pressure. If the voltage is sufficiently high, complete electrical breakdown of the air will culminate in an electrical spark or an electric arc that bridges the entire gap. The color of the spark depends upon the gases that make up the gaseous media. While the small sparks generated by static electricity may barely be audible, larger sparks are often accompanied by a loud snap or bang. Lightning is an example of an immense spark that can be many miles long. =Persistent arcs= If a fuse or circuit breaker fails to interrupt the current through a spark in a power circuit, current may continue, forming a very hot electric arc (about 30 000 degrees). The color of an arc depends primarily upon the conducting gasses, some of which may have been solids before being vaporized and mixed into the hot plasma in the arc. The free ions in and around the arc recombine to create new chemical compounds, such as ozone, carbon monoxide, and nitrous oxide. Ozone is most easily noticed due to its distinct odour. Although sparks and arcs are usually undesirable, they can be useful in applications such as spark plugs for gasoline engines, electrical welding of metals, or for metal melting in an electric arc furnace. Prior to gas discharge the gas glows with distinct colors that depend on the energy levels of the atoms. Not all mechanisms are fully understood. Voltage-current relation before breakdown The vacuum itself is expected to undergo electrical breakdown at or near the Schwinger limit. = Voltage-current relation = Before gas breakdown, there is a non-linear relation between voltage and current as shown in the figure. In region 1, there are free ions that can be accelerated by the field and induce a current. These will be saturated after a certain voltage and give a constant current, region 2\\\\. Region 3 and 4 are caused by ion avalanche as explained by the Townsend discharge mechanism. Friedrich Paschen established the relation between the breakdown condition to breakdown voltage. He derived a formula that defines the breakdown voltage (V_\\\\text{b}) for uniform field gaps as a function of gap length (d) and gap pressure (p). : V_\\\\text{b} = {Bpd \\\\over \\\\ln\\\\left({Apd \\\\over \\\\ln\\\\left(1 + {1 \\\\over \\\\gamma}\\\\right)}\\\\right)} Paschen also derived a relation between the minimum value of pressure gap for which breakdown occurs with a minimum voltage. : \\\\begin{align} (pd)_\\\\min &= {2.718 \\\\over A} \\\\ln\\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\gamma}\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ V_{\\\\text{b},\\\\min} &= 2.718 {B \\\\over A} \\\\ln\\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\gamma}\\\\right) \\\\end{align} A and B are constants depending on the gas used. Corona breakdown Partial breakdown of the air occurs as a corona discharge on high voltage conductors at points with the highest electrical stress. Conductors that have sharp points, or balls with small radii, are prone to causing dielectric breakdown, because the field strength around points is higher than that around a flat surface. High-voltage apparatus is designed with rounded curves and grading rings to avoid concentrated fields that precipitate breakdown. =Appearance= Corona is sometimes seen as a bluish glow around high voltage wires and heard as a sizzling sound along high voltage power lines. Corona also generates radio frequency noise that can also be heard as ‚Äòstatic‚Äô or buzzing on radio receivers. Corona can also occur naturally as \\"St. Elmo's Fire\\" at high points such as church spires, treetops, or ship masts during thunderstorms. =Ozone generation= Corona discharge ozone generators have been used for more than 30 years in the water purification process. Ozone is a toxic gas, even more potent than chlorine. In a typical drinking water treatment plant, the ozone gas is dissolved into the filtered water to kill bacteria and destroy viruses. Ozone also removes the bad odours and taste from the water. The main advantage of ozone is that any residual overdose decomposes to gaseous oxygen well before the water reaches the consumer. This is in contrast with chlorine gas or chlorine salts, which stay in the water longer and can be tasted by the consumer. =Other uses= Although corona discharge is usually undesirable, until recently it was essential in the operation of photocopiers (xerography) and laser printers. Many modern copiers and laser printers now charge the photoconductor drum with an electrically conductive roller, reducing undesirable indoor ozone pollution. Lightning rods use corona discharge to create conductive paths in the air that point towards the rod, deflecting potentially-damaging lightning away from buildings and other structures. Corona discharges are also used to modify the surface properties of many polymers. An example is the corona treatment of plastic materials which allows paint or ink to adhere properly. Disruptive devices  Dielectric breakdown within a solid insulator can permanently change its appearance and properties. As shown in this Lichtenberg figure A disruptive device is designed to electrically overstress a dielectric beyond its dielectric strength so as to intentionally cause electrical breakdown of the device. The disruption causes a sudden transition of a portion of the dielectric, from an insulating state to a highly conductive state. This transition is characterized by the formation of an electric spark or plasma channel, possibly followed by an electric arc through part of the dielectric material. If the dielectric happens to be a solid, permanent physical and chemical changes along the path of the discharge will significantly reduce the material's dielectric strength, and the device can only be used one time. However, if the dielectric material is a liquid or gas, the dielectric can fully recover its insulating properties once current through the plasma channel has been externally interrupted. Commercial spark gaps use this property to abruptly switch high voltages in pulsed power systems, to provide surge protection for telecommunication and electrical power systems, and ignite fuel via spark plugs in internal combustion engines. Spark-gap transmitters were used in early radio telegraph systems.

The novels chronicle the life of a member of the English gentry before, during and after World War I. The setting is mainly England and the Western Front of the First World War, in which Ford had served as an officer in the Welch Regiment, a life he vividly depicts. The individual novels are: *Some Do Not ... (1924) *No More Parades (1925) *A Man Could Stand Up ‚Äî (1926) *Last Post (US title, The Last Post) (1928) The work is a complex tale written in a modernist style (\\"it is as modern and modernist as they come\\"), which does not concentrate on detailing the experience of war. Robie Macauley, in his introduction to the Borzoi edition of 1950, described it as \\"by no means a simple warning as to what modern warfare is like... [but] something complex and baffling [to many contemporary readers]. There was a love story with no passionate scenes; there were trenches but no battles; there was a tragedy without a denouement.\\" The novel is about the psychological result of the war on the participants and on society. In his introduction to the third novel, A Man Could Stand Up--, Ford wrote, \\"This is what the late war was like: this is how modern fighting of the organized, scientific type affects the mind\\". Robie Macauley includes Ford's quote to an earlier edition of A Man Could Stand Up-- in his introduction. In December 2010, John N. Gray hailed the work as \\"possibly the greatest 20th-century novel in English\\", and Mary Gordon labelled it as \\"quite simply, the best fictional treatment of war in the history of the novel\\".  History  Ford stated that his purpose in creating this work was \\"the obviating of all future wars\\". The four novels were originally published under the titles: Some Do Not ... (1924), No More Parades (1925), A Man Could Stand Up ‚Äî (1926) and Last Post (The Last Post in the USA) (1928); the books were combined into one volume as Parade's End. In 2012, HBO, BBC and VRT produced a television adaptation, written by Tom Stoppard and starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Rebecca Hall.  Plot summary  The novels chronicle the life of Christopher Tietjens, \\"the last Tory\\", a brilliant government statistician from a wealthy landowning family who serves in the British Army during the First World War. His wife Sylvia is a flippant socialite who seems intent on ruining him through her sexual promiscuity. Tietjens may or may not be the father of his wife's child. Meanwhile, his incipient affair with Valentine Wannop, a high- spirited pacifist and women's suffragist, has not been consummated, despite what all their friends believe. The two central novels follow Tietjens in the army in France and Belgium, as well as Sylvia and Valentine in their separate paths over the course of the war.  Literary notes  Notably among war novels, Tietjens' consciousness takes primacy over the war-events it filters. Ford constructs a protagonist for whom the war is but one layer of his life, and not always even the most prominent even though he is in the middle of it. In a narrative beginning before the war and ending after the armistice, Ford's project is to situate an unimaginable cataclysm within a social, moral, and psychological complexity. Robie Macauley wrote that \\"the Tietjens story...is less about the incident of a single war than about a whole era\\" and its destruction. \\"Ford took as the scheme for his allegory the life of one man, Christopher Tietjens, a member of an extinct species, which, as he says, 'died out sometime in the 18th century.' Representing in himself the order and stability of another age, he must experience the disruptive present.\\" The work is also striking in its investigation of the relationship among gender dynamics, war, and societal upheaval. Scholar David Ayers notes that \\"Parade's End is virtually alone of the male writing of the 1920s in affirming the ascendance of women and advocating a course of graceful withdrawal from dominance for men\\".  Textual history  Penguin reissued the four novels separately in 1948, just after the Second World War. The novels were first combined into one volume under the collective title Parade's End (which had been suggested by Ford, although he did not live to see an omnibus version) in the Knopf edition of 1950, which has been the basis of several subsequent reissues. Graham Greene controversially omitted Last Post from his 1963 Bodley Head edition of Ford's writing, calling it \\"an afterthought which he (Ford) had not intended to write and later regretted having written.\\" Greene went on to state that \\"...the Last Post was more than a mistake‚Äîit was a disaster, a disaster which has delayed a full critical appreciation of Parade's End.\\" Certainly Last Post is very different from the other three novels; it is concerned with peace and reconstruction, and Christopher Tietjens is absent for most of the narrative, which is structured as a series of interior monologues by those closest to him. Yet it has had influential admirers, from Dorothy Parker and Carl Clinton Van Doren to Anthony Burgess and Malcolm Bradbury (who included it in his 1992 Everyman edition). Carcanet Press published the first annotated and critical edition of the novels, edited by Max Saunders, Joseph Wiesenfarth, Sara Haslam, and Paul Skinner, in 2010‚Äì11.

Unlike many dark didactic existentialist novels (including Percy's later work), The Moviegoer has a light poetic tone. It was Percy's first, most famous, and most widely praised novel, and established him as one of the major voices in Southern literature. The novel also draws on elements of Dante by paralleling the themes of Binx Bolling's life to that of the narrator of the Divine Comedy. Plot summary The Moviegoer tells the story of Jack \\"Binx\\" Bolling, a young stock-broker in postwar New Orleans. The decline of tradition in the Southern United States, the problems of his family and his traumatic experiences in the Korean War have left him alienated from his own life. He day-dreams constantly, has trouble engaging in lasting relationships, and finds more meaning and immediacy in movies and books than in his own routine life. The loose plot of the novel follows the Moviegoer himself, Binx Bolling, in desperate need of spiritual redemption. At Mardi Gras, he breaks out of his caged everyday life and launches himself on a journey, a quest, in a \\"search\\" for God. Without any mental compass or sense of direction he wanders the streets of New Orleans' French Quarter, and Chicago, and then travels the Gulf Coast, interacting with his surroundings as he goes.

Plot summary The narrative is based on two historical figures of the late 19th century, Jean-Baptiste Lamy and Joseph Projectus Machebeuf, and rather than any one singular plot, is the stylized re-telling of their lives serving as Roman Catholic clergy in New Mexico. The narrative has frequent digressions, either in terms of stories related to the pair (including the story of the Our Lady of Guadeloupe and the murder of an oppressive Spanish priest at Acoma Pueblo) or through their recollections. The narration is in third-person omniscient style. Cather includes many fictionalized accounts of actual historical figures, including Kit Carson, Manuel Antonio Chaves and Pope Gregory XVI. In the prologue, Bishop Montferrand, a French bishop who works in the New World, solicits three cardinals at Rome to pick his candidate for the newly created diocese of New Mexico (which has recently passed into American hands). Bishop Montferrand is successful in getting his candidate, the Auvergnat Jean-Marie Latour, recommended by the cardinals over the recommendation of the Bishop of Durango (whose territory New Mexico had previously fallen under). One of the cardinals, a Spaniard named Allende, alludes to a painting by El Greco taken from his family by a missionary to the New World and lost, and asks for the new Bishop to search for it. The action then switches to the primary character, Bishop Jean Marie Latour, who travels with his friend and vicar Joseph Vaillant from Sandusky, Ohio to New Mexico. At the time of Latour's departure for New Mexico, Cincinnati is the end of the railway line west, so Latour must travel by riverboat to the Gulf of Mexico, and thence overland to New Mexico, a journey which takes an entire year (and includes losing most of his supplies in a shipwreck at Galveston). The names given to the main proponents reflect their characters. Vaillant, valiant, is fearless in his promulgation of the faith, whereas Latour, the tower, is more intellectual and reserved than his comrade. Vaillant, described as being ugly but purpose-filled, is given the nickname \\"Blanchet\\" (\\"Whitey\\") as well as \\"Trompe-la-morte\\" (\\"Death-cheater\\") for his complexion and his numerous instances of bad health, respectively. While the narrative speaks of Vaillant positively, it also alludes to his willingness to acquire (he \\"forces the hand\\" of a landowner into giving him and Latour two prize mules, Angelica and Contento, chastises the widow Dona Isabella Olivares for refusing to assert her rights under her husband's will and thereby blocking the church from its testamentary share, and goes on frank \\"begging trips\\" to acquire money) and near the end of the novel his questionable financial behaviour receives an investigation from Rome. Latour, again presented favourably, nevertheless does operate with a view to politics: he successfully canvasses donations to build a Romanesque cathedral in Santa Fe according to his own desires (he chooses the stone and brings the architect Molny from France to complete it), and bides his time to remove dissenting priests and help a poor Mexican slave- woman named Sada until he is in a position of political strength (his help of Sada is never described in the novel). The novel ends with the death of (retired) Archbishop Latour in Santa Fe: Vaillant has pre-deceased Latour as the first Bishop of Colorado after the Colorado gold rush (in reality Machebeuf was the first Roman Catholic Bishop of Denver). Near the beginning of the novel, Latour and Vaillant are saved from being murdered by the villainous Buck Scales (at whose house they have sought shelter for the night) by Scales's abused wife Magdalena. All three escape, and Scales is hanged for the murder of four of his former guests, while Magdalena ultimately serves nuns whom Latour brings from Europe and who run a school in Santa Fe. While some of the clergy already established in New Mexico are portrayed favourably (such as the Padre of Isleta Pueblo, the blind priest Father Jesus de Baca, who collects parrots), several of the entrenched priests are depicted as examples of greed, avarice, and gluttony. The priest of Albuquerque, Father Gallegos, is removed for not being devout enough (he dances and enjoys fine food and hunting), replaced by Vaillant. Father Martinez at Taos is removed for denying the necessity of priestly celibacy (and having children, although he is also described as starting a revolt and then profiting from the executions of the rebels to seize their property) and his friend Father Lucero at Arroyo Hondo (described as a miser) is also removed when he joins Father Martinez's new church (Martinez dies an apostate while Lucero receives absolution from Vaillant after repenting near death). Cather portrays the aboriginal people of the Pueblos, the Hopi and the Navajo sympathetically, including a discussion of the Long Walk of the Navajo (mentioned as a reminiscence of the dying Latour of his Navajo friend Eusabio and the Navajo leader Manuelito). Latour reflects that the removal of the Navajos was a wrong comparable to \\"black slavery,\\" and the narrator describes Kit Carson's actions with the Navajo as \\"misguided\\" and \\"a soldier's brutal work.\\" Cather's characters express the near futility of overlaying their religion on a millennia-old native culture. For example, while caught in a snowstorm with his native guide Jacinto (who dwells in the Pecos Pueblo, which in reality was already deserted by the time of Lamy), Latour and Jacinto are forced to spend the night in a cave sacred to Jacinto's people. Latour initially finds a disagreeable smell, and the unexplained actions of Jacinto with regard to the place make him uneasy. Historical background The novel is based on the life of Jean-Baptiste Lamy (1814-1888), and partially chronicles the construction of the Cathedral Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi. The capture of the Southwest by the United States in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War is the catalyst for the plot. \\"The Padre of Isleta\\",Keleher and Chant. The Padre of Isleta.

It is generally agreed to be his masterpiece and to be strongly autobiographical in nature, although Maugham stated, \\"This is a novel, not an autobiography; though much in it is autobiographical, more is pure invention.\\"Dated 28 August 1957, author's inscription in a first edition for Californian book collector, Ingle Barr. Maugham, who had originally planned to call his novel Beauty from Ashes, finally settled on a title taken from a section of Spinoza's Ethics. The Modern Library ranked Of Human Bondage No. 66 on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. Plot The book begins with the death of Helen Carey, the much beloved mother of nine-year-old Philip Carey. Philip has a club foot and his father had died a few months before. Now orphaned, he is sent to live with his aunt and uncle, Louisa and William Carey. Early chapters relate Philip's experiences at his uncle's vicarage. Aunt Louisa tries to be a mother to Philip, but his uncle is coldly disposed towards him. Philip's uncle has a vast collection of books, and Philip enjoys reading to find ways to escape his mundane existence. Less than a year later, Philip is sent to a boarding school. His uncle and aunt wish for him to eventually attend Oxford. Philip's disability and sensitive nature make it difficult for him to fit in with the other students. Philip is informed that he could have earned a scholarship for Oxford, which both his uncle and school headmaster see as a wise course, but Philip insists on going to Germany. In Germany, Philip lives at a boarding house with other foreigners. He enjoys his stay in Germany. Philip's guardians decide to take matters into their own hands and they persuade him to move to London to take on an apprenticeship. He does not fare well there as his colleagues resent him, because they believe he is a \\"gentleman\\". He goes on a business trip with one of his managers to Paris and is inspired by the trip to study art in France. In France, Philip attends art classes and makes new friends, including Fanny Price, a poor and determined but talentless art student who does not get along well with people. Fanny Price falls in love with Philip, but he does not know and has no such feelings for her; she subsequently commits suicide. Bette Davis (as Mildred) and Leslie Howard in the 1934 film version Philip realizes that he will never be a professional artist. He returns to his uncle's house in England to study medicine and pursue his late father's field. He struggles at medical school and comes across Mildred, who is working as a waitress in a tea shop. He falls desperately in love with her, and they date regularly, although she does not show any affection for him. Mildred tells Philip she will marry another man, leaving him heartbroken; Philip subsequently enters into an affair with Norah Nesbit, a kind and sensitive author of penny romance novels. Later Mildred returns, pregnant, and confesses that the man for whom she had abandoned Philip never married her, as he was already married with three children. Philip breaks off his relationship with Norah and supports Mildred financially, though he can ill afford to do so. To Philip's dismay, after Mildred has her baby, she falls in love with Philip's good friend Harry Griffiths, and runs away with him. About a year later, Philip runs into Mildred again and, feeling sympathy for her, takes her in again. Though he no longer loves her, he becomes attached to her baby. When he rejects her advances, she becomes angry with him, destroys most of his belongings, and leaves forever. In shame, and quickly running out of money, Philip leaves the house for good. He meets Mildred once more, towards the end of the novel, when she summons him for his medical opinion. As she is probably suffering from syphilis resulting from her work as a prostitute, Philip advises Mildred to give up her life as a prostitute. Mildred declines and exits from the plot, her fate remaining unknown. While working at a hospital, Philip befriends a family man, Thorpe Athelny. Athelny has lived in Toledo, Spain. Enthusiastic about the country, he is translating the works of St. John of the Cross. Meanwhile, Philip invests in mines but is left nearly penniless because of events surrounding the Boer War. Unable to pay his rent, he wanders the streets for several days before the Athelnys take him in and find him a department store job, which he hates. His talent for drawing is discovered and he receives a promotion and a raise in salary, but his time at the store is short-lived. After his uncle William dies, Philip inherits enough money to allow him to finish his medical studies and he finally becomes a licensed doctor. Philip takes on a temporary placement as locum with Dr. South, a general practitioner in Dorsetshire. Dr. South is an old, cantankerous physician whose wife is dead and whose daughter has broken off contact with him. However, Dr. South takes a shine to Philip's humour and personable nature, eventually offering Philip a partnership in his medical practice. Although flattered, Philip refuses because of his plans to visit Spain. He soon goes on a small summer holiday with the Athelnys, hop-picking in the Kent countryside. There he finds that one of Athelny's daughters, Sally, likes him. In a moment of romantic abandon one evening they have sex, and when she thinks she is pregnant, Philip decides to marry Sally and accept Dr. South's offer, instead of travelling the world as he had planned. They meet in the National Gallery where, despite learning that it was a false alarm, Philip becomes engaged to Sally, concluding that \\"the simplest pattern ‚Äì that in which a man was born, worked, married, had children, and died ‚Äì was likewise the most perfect\\". He stops searching for happiness and decides to be content with his lot. Title Maugham had borrowed the title of his book from Spinoza. Part IV of his Ethics is titled \\"Of Human Bondage, or the Strength of the Emotions\\" (). In this part, Spinoza discusses people's inability to control their emotions which, thus, constitute bondage. He also defines good and bad categories based on the people's general beliefs, connecting it to their ‚Äúemotions of pleasure or pain‚Äù. He defines perfectness/imperfectness starting out from the desire, in its meaning of particular aims and plans. Philip Carey, the main character of Of Human Bondage, was seeking this very useful end, and became satisfied only after realizing what his aim had been, and having found a person to share this aim with. Autobiographical features Maugham had a stammer (instead of a club foot), lost his parents early in life, and was sent to live with his aunt and uncle. He studied medicine and his tastes in literature coincide with those of the main character in this book. Although Maugham was never an artist, he was interested in painting. He possessed in his private collection works by four painters mentioned in the book: Pissarro, Sisley, Monet, and Renoir. In The Summing Up, he discloses that he read Ruskin and became acquainted with many pieces of European art. Many of his other works are focused on this topic: The Moon and Sixpence (the main character has some resemblance to Paul Gauguin). Maugham wrote an article for Life magazine titled \\"Painting I Have Liked\\". Of Human Bondage is, probably, the most vivid instance of Maugham's inclination towards arts. According to Stanley Archer, more than 30 artists are named in the book, ten famous paintings are mentioned by name and many others are referred to. Over half of the 33 artists named in the novel were painters whose careers developed primarily in the 19th century. Of these, 13 are French, five English, and one, Whistler, is American. Eleven were alive at the time in which the plot of the novel is unfolding and five ‚Äì Carolus-Duran, Degas, Monet, Rafelli, and Renoir ‚Äì were alive when Of Human Bondage was published in 1915.Stanley Archer's Artists and Paintings in Maugham‚Äôs Of Human Bondage.

Plot The Bas-Thornton children (John, Emily, Edward, Rachel, and Laura) are raised on a plantation in Jamaica at an unspecified time after the emancipation of slaves in the British Empire (1834). It is a time of technological transformation, and sailing ships and steamers coexist on the high seas. A hurricane destroys their home, and the parents decide the children must leave the island to return to their original home in England. Accompanied by two creole children from Jamaica, Margaret and Harry Fernandez, they leave on the Clorinda, a merchant ship under the command of Captain Marpole. The Clorinda is seized by pirates shortly after leaving Jamaica. The pirates first pretend they need to seize the ship's cargo and will refund the price of the goods taken, but when the lie becomes obvious, they menace Captain Marpole by threatening to shoot the children if he does not disclose where the Clorinda's safe is kept. The ship is ransacked, and the children are brought aboard the pirate schooner to get dinner. Captain Marpole, thinking that under cover of darkness the children have been murdered, flees the scene, unknowingly abandoning the children to the pirates. Marpole writes a letter to Mr and Mrs Thornton informing them that their children have been murdered by the pirates. The children quickly become part of life aboard the pirate ship and treat it as their new home. They are treated with some indifference, though a few crew members‚ÄîJos√© the cook and Otto the chief mate‚Äîcare for them and become fond of them, and Captain Jonsen, the pirate captain himself, becomes very fond of Emily. The pirates stop at their home base of Santa Lucia (in current-day province Pinar del R√≠o, Cuba) to sell the seized goods. Captain Jonsen tries unsuccessfully to convince a rich woman to take care of the children. During the night, Jos√© takes John, Edward, and Margaret ashore, and John accidentally falls to his death in a warehouse. He is immediately and deliberately forgotten by his own siblings. The pirate captain seems to be the last one to forget him. While drunk, Captain Jonsen makes a sexual overture to Emily. She bites his hand before anything happens, but she is frightened by the look in Jonsen's eye as he reaches for her. The author gives no explicit details for her fright, just a veiled description from Emily's point of view. Emily later suffers an injury to her leg, in an accident caused by Rachel, and is confined to the captain's cabin. Meanwhile, Margaret, who has become alienated from the other children, becomes Otto's lover and moves into his cabin. Having made no further captures, the pirates quickly take the first ship they finally see, a Dutch vessel transporting some wild animals. The captain of this ship is tied up and left in the cabin with Emily. Everyone else on the pirate ship boards the Dutch vessel to watch a fight between a lion and a tiger. The Dutch captain does all he can to get Emily to free him but is unable to communicate with her. Finally seeing a knife he rolls towards it. Emily, injured and terrified, screams but no one hears. She pounces at the last second and stabs the captain several times. He soon dies. Margaret, oldest of the children, witnesses this event. When the crew returns to the ship, the pirates mistake Margaret for the murderer and without ceremony throw her overboard, but she is rescued by other pirates heading back to the ship. The crew grows tired and scared of the children. Jonsen arranges for them to transfer to a passing steamer. Disguised as a British merchant vessel, the captain claims that some pirates abandoned the children on the Cuban shore and that he then picked them up to bring them to England. Before sending them on board the steamer, Otto instructs Emily not to disclose the truth about what has happened to them in the past months. He chooses Emily rather than Margaret, as the latter seems to have lost her sanity. Once aboard the steamer, the children are delighted with the boat's luxury and the loving treatment by the passengers, who know of the story of the children told by Captain Marpole. Despite her fondness for Captain Jonsen and the fact that she promised not to tell about what really happened, Emily quickly tells the truth to a stewardess. The pirate ship is pursued and seized by the British authorities. Back in London, the children are reintegrated into their families. They seem completely unaffected by their traumatic experiences aboard the ship, apart from Margaret who has lost her sanity. (It is hinted that she may also be pregnant.) Emily is only half aware of the crime she has committed. The younger children have distorted and contradictory memories of the facts, and after unsuccessfully attempting to extract any information from then, the family solicitor decides that only Emily should testify at the trial against the pirate crew and then only to repeat a statement written by him. Under the pressure of the courtroom, Emily breaks down and cries out that the Dutch captain died as she watched. She does not exactly say who performed the murder, but the trial's outcome is decided. The pirates are executed. The book ends with Emily playing with her schoolmates. She is so similar to them that \\"only God\\", but no one else, could tell them apart. Critical reception The book received much criticism for its content at the time of release. Many critics responded negatively to the behaviour and treatment of the children in the novel, ranging from sexual abuse to murder. Others lauded Hughes for contradicting the Victorian romances of childhood by portraying the children without emotional reduction. The book is often given credit for influencing and paving the way for novels such as Lord of the Flies by William Golding. In 1998, A High Wind in Jamaica was included as number 71 in the Modern Library's 100 Best Novels, a list of the best English-language novels of the 20th century.

The area was previously named Nat√°lia by Portuguese sailors. The republic came to an end in 1843 when British forces annexed it to form the Colony of Natal. After the British annexation of the Natalia Republic, most local Voortrekkers trekked north into Transorangia, later known as the Orange Free State, and the South African Republic. History =European settlement and setbacks= Natal cotton field (c.1885). On Christmas Day 1497 Vasco da Gama was sailing past the region now known as Transkei and named the country Terra Natalis. He next sighted the bluff at the entrance to what is now the harbour of Durban. Da Gama made no landing here, but in later years the name Nat√°lia became associated with it. Like the rest of South Africa, Natal was neglected by the Portuguese, whose nearest settlement was at Delagoa Bay. It is not proven when the clan settled in the region which was inhabited by Nguni people. A small clan living north of the Tugela River, the amaZulu, was greatly enlarged by its leader Shaka, and between 1818 and 1820 his Zulu Kingdom‚Äôs military campaigns overran the area. British traders established a small settlement at Port Natal, so founding what became the town of Durban, established in 1835. The next Europeans to settle the country were emigrant Boers from the Cape Colony, who came by land over the passes of the Drakensberg. These Voortrekkers were led by Piet Retief. Passing through the almost deserted upper regions, Retief arrived at Port Natal in October 1837. During this journey, he chose a site for the capital of the future state which he envisioned. He went to the kraal of Shaka‚Äôs successor Dingane, ruler of the Zulu Kingdom, to obtain a cession of territory for the Boer farmers. Dingane consented on condition that the Boers recover cattle stolen by another chief. Retief managed that and, with the help of missionary the Rev Francis Owen, living at Dingane‚Äôs kraal, he drew up a deed of cession in English. Dingane and Retief signed it on 4 February 1838. Two days later, Dingane ordered the execution of Retief and all of his party, 66 whites and 34 Khoikhoi servants. The Zulu king commanded his impis to kill all the Boers who had entered Natal. The Zulu forces crossed the Tugela River the same day, and the most advanced parties of the Boers were massacred, many at a spot near where the town of Weenen now stands, its name (meaning wailing or weeping) commemorating the event. Other of the farmers hastily laagered and were able to repulse the Zulu attacks; the assailants suffering serious loss at a fight near Bushman River. In one week after the murder of Retief, the Zulus had killed 600 Boers. Hearing of the attack on the Boers, the British settlers at the bay sent a force to help them. Robert Biggar commanded 20 British and a following of 700 friendly Zulus and crossed the Tugela River near its mouth. On 17 April, in a desperate fight with a Zulu force, the British were overwhelmed and only four Europeans escaped to the bay. Pursued by the Zulus, the surviving inhabitants of Durban took refuge on a ship then in harbour. After the Zulus retired, fewer than a dozen Englishmen returned to live at the port; the missionaries, hunters and other traders returned to Cape Colony. The Boers had repelled the Zulu attacks on their laagers; joined by others from the Drakensberg, about 400 men under Hendrik Potgieter and Piet Uys advanced to attack Dingane. On 11 April, they were attacked and with difficulty cut their way out. Among those slain were Piet Uys and his son Dirk, aged 15. =Battle of Blood River= Toward the end of the year, the Boers received reinforcements. In December 460 men set out under Boer general Andries Pretorius to take on the Zulus. Andries Pretorius selected Jan Gerritze Bantjes (1817-1887) as his scribe and secretary in recording events of the campaign and coming retaliation battle with the Zulus. Bantjes documented daily in his journal the progress of the commando, from their start on 27 November 1838 until they reached their selected battle site on 15 December 1838. They avoided being led into a trap as happened on the previous attempt to attack the Zulus in April which ended in disaster. On the journey, they had small skirmishes with various kraals but the main Zulu army had not arrived yet to attack. Boer and Zulu scouts were constantly monitoring each other's whereabouts. On 9 December 1838 as Bantjes wrote in his journal, the Boers congregated under a clear sky to sing appropriate psalms and celebrate the Sabbath, taking a vow which became known as the \\"Day of The Vow or Covenant\\" that \\"if the Lord might give us victory, we hereby deem to found a house as a memorial of his Great Name at a place where it shall please Him\\", and that they also implore the help and assistance of God in accomplishing this Vow and that they write down this Day of Victory in a book and disclose this event to our very last posterities in order that this will forever be celebrated in the honour of God.\\" On 16 December 1838, while laagered near the Umslatos River or Hippo Pool, they were attacked by more than 10,000 Zulus. As Bantjes wrote in his journal: The Boers fought off the Zulu. After three hours, the Boers had killed thousands of Zulus and had fewer than a dozen of their men wounded. The Zulus withdrew in defeat, many crossing the river which had turned red with blood and thereafter known as the Battle of Blood River. Modern-day Afrikaners still celebrate the Day of the Vow every year on 16 December. =British at Port Natal = Returning south, Pretorius and his fighters found that the British had annexed Port Natal (now Durban) on 4 December with a detachment of the 72nd Highlanders from Cape Colony. While the governor of the Cape, Major-General Sir George Napier, had invited the British emigrants from Natal to return to the colony, and stated his intention to take military possession of the port. In sanctioning the occupation of the port the British government of the day had no intention of making Natal a British colony, but wished to prevent the Boers establishing an independent republic upon the coast with a harbour through which access to the interior could be gained. After remaining at the port just over a year the Highlanders were withdrawn, on 24 December 1839. =Overthrow of Dingane= After the battle, Pretorius took advantage of dissension in the Zulu kingdom to ally himself with Mpande, brother of the Zulu king Dingane. Dingane's attempt to extend his kingdom north to compensate for losses to the Boers had failed. He was defeated by the Swazi people in 1839, leading to discontent with his rule. In exchange for cattle and territory Pretorius agreed to support Mpande's bid to overthrow Dingane. A Boer force supported Mpande's Zulu impi in the invasion. At the Battle of Maqongqo, Dingane was crushed and was put to flight with what retainers chose to follow him into exile. Pretorius took 36,000 head of cattle and proclaimed a large tract of land extending from St Lucia Bay to be part of the Natalia Republic. Government of Natalia =Internal affairs= Meantime the Boers had founded Pietermaritzburg, named in honour of leaders Piet Retief and Gerrit Maritz. They made it their capital and the seat of their volksraad. Legislative power was vested in the volksraad (consisting of 24 members), while the president and executive were changed every three months. For issues of importance, a meeting was called of het publiek, that is, of all who chose to attend, to sanction or reject it. \\"The result,\\" says the historian George McCall Theal, \\"was utter anarchy. Decisions of one day were frequently reversed the next, and every one held himself free to disobey any law that he did not approve of. ... Public opinion of the hour in each section of the community was the only force in the land.\\"Theal, G. M., History of South Africa 1834 - 1854, chap. xliv., quoted in =Territorial policy= The Zulus continued to exist as a distinct and numerous people with their own dispensation within their own territory to the north and east, in the region known as Zululand. The settlers were in loose alliance with and in quasi-supremacy over the Boer communities that had left the Cape and settled at Winburg and at Potchefstroom. They declared a free and independent state under the title of \\"The Republic of Port Natal and adjacent countries,\\" and sought (September 1840) from Sir George Napier an acknowledgment of their independence by Great Britain. Sir George did not give an answer but was friendly to the Boer farmers. He was disturbed when a commando force under Andries Pretorius attacked the Xhosa in December 1840. The national government declined to recognize Natalia's independence but proposed to trade with it if the people would accept a military force to defend against other European powers. Sir George communicated this decision to the volksraad in September 1841. =British and Dutch influences= The Boers strongly resented the contention of the British that they could not shake off British nationality, though beyond the bounds of any recognized British possession. They also wanted control of the British Natal Port (now renamed Durban). They rejected Napier's overtures. On 2 December 1841, Napier announced his intention to resume military occupation of Port Natal, citing the Boers' attack on the Xhosa. On 21 February 1842 the settlers responded, with a document written by Jacobus Boshoff. The farmers complained about the lack of representative government, and concluded by a protest against the occupation of any part of their territory by British troops. Soon after, an event occurred which encouraged the Boers in their opposition to Great Britain. In March 1842 a Dutch vessel sent out by Gregorius Ohrig, an Amsterdam merchant who sympathized with the farmers, reached Port Natal. Johan Arnold Smellekamp concluded a treaty with the volksraad assuring them of the protection of the Netherlands. The Natal Boers believed the Netherlands to be one of the great powers of Europe, and were firmly persuaded that its government would aid them in resisting Great Britain. Transfer to colonial government =Battle of Congella= On 1 April 1842 Captain T. C. Smith with a force of 263 men left his camp at the Umgazi, on the eastern frontier of Cape Colony, and marching overland reached Durban without opposition, and encamped, on 4 May, at the base of the Berea hills. The Boers, cut off from their port, called out a commando of some 300 to 400 men under Andries Pretorius and gathered at Congella at the head of the bay. On the night of 23 May, Smith made an unsuccessful attack on the Boer camp, losing his guns and fifty men were killed or wounded. On 26 May the Boers captured the harbour and settlement, and on 31 May blockaded the British camp, the women and children being removed, on the suggestion of Pretorius, to a ship in the harbour of which the Boers had taken possession. Meantime, an old Durban resident, Dick King, had undertaken to convey tidings of the perilous position of the British force to the commandant at Grahamstown. He started on the night of 24 May, and escaping the Boer outposts rode through the dense bush, and in nine days reached his destination‚Äîa distance of in a direct line, and nearly by the route to be followed. This remarkable ride was accomplished with one change of mount, obtained from a missionary in Pondoland. A comparatively strong force under Colonel A. J. Cloete was at once sent by sea to Port Natal, and on 26 June, Captain Smith was relieved. The besieged had suffered greatly from lack of food. Within a fortnight Colonel Cloete had received the submission of the volksraad at Pietermaritzburg. The burghers represented that they were under the protection of the Netherlands, but this plea was peremptorily rejected by the commander of the British forces. The British government was still undecided as to its policy towards Natal. In April 1842 Lord Stanley, then Secretary of State for War and the Colonies in the second Peel Administration, wrote to Sir George Napier that the establishment of a colony in Natal would be attended with little prospect of advantage, but at the same time stated that the pretensions of the emigrants to be regarded as an independent community could not be admitted. Various measures were proposed which would but have aggravated the situation. =Annexation= Finally, in deference to the strongly urged views of Sir George Napier, Lord Stanley, in a despatch of 13 December, received in Cape Town on 23 April 1843, consented to Natal becoming a British colony. The institutions adopted were to be as far as possible in accordance with the wishes of the people, but it was a fundamental condition \\"that there should not be in the eye of the law any distinction or disqualification whatever, founded on mere difference of colour, origin, language or creed.\\" Sir George then appointed Mr Henry Cloete (a brother of Colonel Josias Cloete) a special commissioner to explain to the Natal volksraad the decision of the government. There was a considerable party of Natal Boers still strongly opposed to the British, and they were reinforced by numerous bands of Boers who came over the Drakensberg from Winburg and Potchefstroom. Commandant Jan Mocke of Winburg (who had helped to besiege Captain Smith at Durban) and others of the \\"war party\\" attempted to induce the volksraad not to submit, and a plan was formed to murder Pretorius, Boshoff and other leaders, who were now convinced that the only chance of ending the state of complete anarchy into which the country had fallen was by accepting British sovereignty. =Extent of the colony= On 8 August 1843 the Natal Volksraad unanimously agreed to the terms proposed by Lord Stanley, setting Drakensberg as the northern limit of Natal. Many of the Boers who would not acknowledge British rule trekked once more over the mountains into what became the Orange Free State and Transvaal provinces to seek their freedom and independence. At the end of 1843 there were not more than 500 Dutch families left in Natal. Cloete, before returning to the Cape, visited Mpande and obtained from him a valuable concession. Hitherto the Tugela River from source to mouth had been the recognized frontier between Natal and Zululand. Mpande gave up to Natal all the territory between the Buffalo and Tugela rivers, which later formed Klip River county. Aftermath Proclaimed a British Colony of Natal in 1843, it became a part of Cape Colony in 1844, not being separated again until 1856. The power of the volksraad did not truly end until 1845, when an effective British administration was established under Martin West as lieutenant-governor. After the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879, the British defeated the Zulu army, and annexed Zululand to Natal in 1897. One of the four founding provinces of South Africa, it is now KwaZulu-Natal. This province is still home to the Zulu nation; native speakers of the Zulu language form 77.8% of the population. The province also has a large ethnic Indian population, as well as Boer-descended residents and ethnic British descendants.

S. Naipaul, significant as Naipaul's first work to achieve acclaim worldwide. It is the story of Mohun Biswas, a Hindu Indo-Trinidadian who continually strives for success and mostly fails, who marries into the influential Tulsi family only to find himself dominated by it, and who finally sets the goal of owning his own house. It relies on some biographical elements from the experience of the author's father, and views a colonial world sharply with postcolonial perspectives. In 1998, the Modern Library ranked A House for Mr Biswas number 72 on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. Time magazine included the novel in its \\"TIME 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005\\".  Synopsis  =Plot= Mohun Biswas (based on V. S. Naipaul's father, Seepersad Naipaul) is born in rural Trinidad and Tobago to Hindu Indian parents and his father is a Brahmin. His birth was considered inauspicious as he is born \\"in the wrong way\\" and with an extra finger. A pundit prophesies that the newborn child \\"will be a lecher and a spendthrift. Possibly a liar as well\\", and that he will \\"eat up his mother and father\\". The pundit advises that the boy be kept \\"away from trees and water. Particularly water\\". A few years later, Mohun leads a neighbour's calf, which he is tending, to a stream. The boy, who has never seen water \\"in its natural form\\", becomes distracted and allows the calf to wander off. Mohun then hides in fear of punishment. His father, believing his son to be in the water, drowns in an attempt to save him, thus in part fulfilling the pandit's prophecy. This leads to the dissolution of the family. Mohun's sister is sent to live with a wealthy aunt and uncle, Tara and Ajodha. Mohun, his mother, and two older brothers go to live with other relatives. The boy is withdrawn prematurely from school and apprenticed to a pundit, but is cast out on bad terms. Ajodha then puts him in the care of his alcoholic and abusive brother Bhandat, an arrangement which also ends badly. Finally, the young Mr Biswas decides to make his own fortune. He encounters a friend from his school days who helps him get into the business of sign-writing. While on the job, Mr Biswas attempts to romance a client's daughter but his advances are misinterpreted as a wedding proposal. He is drawn into a marriage which he does not have the nerve to stop and becomes a member of the Tulsi household. Mr Biswas becomes very unhappy with his wife Shama (based on Droapatie Naipaul) and her overbearing family. The Tulsis (based on the Capildeo family), and the big decaying Hanuman House (based on Anand Bhavan aka The Lion House) where they live represent the communal way of life which is traditional throughout Asia. Mr Biswas is offered a place in this cosmos, a subordinate place to be sure, but a place that is guaranteed and from which advancement is possible. But Mr Biswas wants more than being just a gharjamai. He is, by instinct, a modern man. He wants to be the author of his own life. That is an aspiration with which Tulsis cannot deal, and their decaying world conspires to drag him down.Selwyn Cudjoe, V.S. Naipaul: A Materialist Reading, University of Massachusetts Press, 1988, p. 71. See also Kenneth Ramchand, \\"The West Indies\\", in Bruce King, Literatures of the World in English, Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1974, p. 206. Despite his poor education, Mr Biswas becomes a journalist, has four children with Shama, and attempts several times to build a house that he can call his own, a house which will symbolize his independence. Mr Biswas‚Äô desperate struggle to acquire a house of his own can be linked to an individual's need to develop an authentic identity. He feels that only by having his own house he can overcome his feelings of rootlessness and alienation. = Characters = * Mohun Biswas (based on V. S.

Writing for The New York Review of Books in 1983, he stated that, \\"Of all my books A House for Mr. Biswas is the one closest to me.\\" The book took him three years to write. Naipaul finished the final proofreading of the book in May 1961. The book was first published in London by Andr√© Deutsch in 1961. McGraw Hill published the first US edition of the book in New York in the same year.  Style and themes  A central theme of the novel is alienation. Right from his birth, Mr Biswas is alienated due to the prophecy. He grew up as a lonely child who lived in isolation. Following his marriage to Shama, the joint family of the Tulsis expected him to merge his personal identity with theirs, which he finds difficult and makes him feel trapped. They later humiliate him and he is forced to work at the estate at Green Vale, where he grows resentful of even his own children. Ultimately, this sense of alienation motivates him to search for a house, symbolising an effort to find and create his own identity. Throughout the novel, Mr Biswas' gradual progress is indicated through the many objects he and his wife acquire over the years. Naipaul lists out detailed inventories, much like \\"the catalogue of ships in the Iliad or the many descriptions of rooms by Dickens\\". Legacy The novel is generally regarded as Naipaul's most significant work and is credited with launching him into international fame and renown. Time magazine included the novel in its \\"TIME 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005\\". On 5 November 2019 BBC News listed A House for Mr Biswas on its list of the 100 most influential novels. Adaptations The novel was later adapted as a stage musical, with compositions by Monty Norman. One of the songs written for the play, \\"Good Sign, Bad Sign\\", was later rewritten as the \\"James Bond Theme\\", according to the documentary Inside Dr. No. In 1980, the book was serialised by BBC in England as ‚ÄúA Book at Bedtime‚Äù and broadcast on BBC World Service in 1981. A two-part radio dramatisation, featuring Rudolph Walker, Nitin Ganatra, Nina Wadia, and Angela Wynter ran on BBC Radio Four on 26 March and 2 April 2006. References External links * V. S.

A Bend in the River is a 1979 novel by Nobel laureate V. S. Naipaul. The novel, telling the story of Salim, a merchant in post-colonial mid-20th century Africa, is one of Naipaul's best known works and was widely praised. It was shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1979. In 1998, the Modern Library ranked A Bend in the River #83 on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. A Bend in the River has also been criticized for a perceived defence of European colonialism in Africa. Plot Set in an unnamed African country after independence, the book is narrated by Salim, an ethnically Indian Muslim and a shopkeeper in a small but growing city in the country's remote interior. Salim observes the rapid changes in Africa with an outsider's distance. Salim grows up in the community of Indian traders on the east coast of Africa. Feeling insecure about his future in East Africa, he buys a business from Nazruddin in a town at \\"a bend in the river\\" in the heart of Africa. When he moves there he finds the town decrepit, a \\"ghost town\\", its former European suburb reclaimed by the bush, and many of its European vestiges ruined in a \\"rage\\" by the locals in response to their suppression and humiliation during colonial times. Old tribal distinctions have become important again. Salim trades in what people in the villages need: pencils and paper, pots and pans, other household utensils. Soon he is joined by an assistant, Metty, who comes from a family of house slaves his family had maintained in the east. One of his steady customers is Zabeth, a \\"marchande\\" from a village and a magician too. Zabeth has a son, Ferdinand, by a man of another tribe, and asks Salim to help him get educated. Ferdinand attends the local lyc√©e run by Father Huismans, a Belgian priest who collects African masks and is considered a \\"lover of Africa\\". Life in the town is slowly improving. Salim's decision to move there seems to be vindicated when he learns that the Indian community on the east coast is being persecuted, but he still does not feel secure. Mahesh says of the local Africans that \\"they are malins\\", \\"because they lived with the knowledge of men as prey\\". A rebellion breaks out and the Indian merchants live in fear. Soon white mercenaries appear and restore order. After peace has returned Father Huismans goes on a trip. He is killed by unknown assailants and nobody cares. Afterwards his collection of African masks is denounced as affront to African religion. An American visitor pillages most of the masks and ships them home as \\"The richest products of the forest\\". The town now develops into a trading centre for the region. Government agencies spring up. European salesmen and visitors arrive. Salim's friends Mahesh and Shoba become successful with their new Bigburger franchise. The new army arrives, \\"poachers of ivory and thieves of gold\\". Portraits of the President, \\"the Big Man\\", are displayed everywhere. A new section of town is built, the \\"State Domain\\", to showcase the President's vision of a new Africa. Yet buildings are shoddy, the tractors at the agricultural centre never get put to work, and much of the Domain falls quickly into disrepair. Salim calls it a \\"hoax\\". The Domain is soon converted into a university and conference centre. Salim is visited by Indar, who grew up with him on the east coast, then went to England to study and now has become a lecturer at the new institution. He takes Salim to a party in the Domain to meet Yvette and Raymond. Raymond had been the advisor and mentor of the President. Although he is in charge of the Domain, he finds himself outside the centre of power. Loyal to the President, he continues to write for him, hoping to be recalled to the capital. Salim, whose experience with women has been limited to prostitutes, is intrigued by Yvette, Raymond's much younger wife. Later, after Indar departs with the steamer, Salim and Yvette start an adulterous affair right under Raymond's eyes. Eventually the liaison breaks down, Salim hitting her and spitting on her between the legs. Raymond's attempts to please the Big Man are not successful. Instead the President publishes \\"a very small, brief book of thoughts, Maximes, two or three thoughts to each page, each thought about four or five lines long\\". Like others, Salim is forced to buy copies of the book for distribution. The local youth group displeases the President and is denounced in one of his propaganda speeches. As a result, unrest grows, corruption and extortion become more prevalent, and a \\"Liberation Army\\" forms underground. They reject the President, his cult of the black Madonna, his vision of Africa, and want to return to the \\"truthful laws\\" of the ancestors. Salim looks for a way out. He travels to London, where he meets Nazruddin. Nazruddin sold his business to Salim, moved to Uganda, left it because of persecution, moved then to Canada, left it because of its capitalistic rapaciousness, and finally landed in London, where he became a landlord. He bemoans the lack of security for honest businessmen: there is no safe place. Salim becomes engaged to Nazruddin's daughter, but soon returns to his place in Africa. Upon arrival he learns that his business has been expropriated under the President's new programme of \\"radicalization\\" and transferred to a local. Th√©otime, a \\"state trustee\\", is ignorant and lazy, and retains Salim as manager and chauffeur. Salim recognises that all is lost. He has hidden some ivory on his property, but, betrayed by Metty, is found out and put in jail. He is presented to the commissioner, Ferdinand, who has moved up in the administration after receiving training in the capital. Ferdinand tells him that there is no safety, no hope, and that everybody is in fear of his life: \\"We‚Äôre all going to hell, and every man knows this in his bones. We‚Äôre being killed. Nothing has any meaning.\\" He sets Salim free and tells him to leave the country. Salim takes the last steamer before the President arrives. During the night there is a battle on the ship, as rebels try to kidnap it. The attack is repelled, but the attached barge, full of Africans, is snapped loose and drifts down the river. Latin mottos This Latin phrase is still visible to Salim on the granite base of a ruined European monument near the dock. Later Father Huismans explains him its meaning. \\"He approves of the mingling of the peoples and their bonds of union\\", derived from Virgil's Aeneid, Book IV, line 112. Aeneas lands on the shores of Africa, falls in love with Queen Dido and wants to settle, putting his mission, the migration to Italy, in danger. The gods intervene: they do not approve of a settlement in Africa nor of the mingling of the peoples. In the motto, however, three words were altered to reverse the original meaning. A second Latin phrase is encountered by Salim: ', the motto of the lyc√©e. The original phrase by Pliny the Elder meant that there is always something new out of Africa (ex Africa). Huismans applied it jokingly to the unique masks and carvings with religious quality he had collected. Comments Naipaul is recognised as a \\"magnificent novelist\\", and A Bend in the River has been described as a \\"full-bodied masterpiece\\". Yet he has been accused of being a \\"neo-colonialist\\", and in this novel post-colonial Africa is depicted as spiralling into a kind of Hell. He has also been accused of being \\"infected by an ancestral communal resentment\\" against blacks. Whitaker indicates that Salim's plight as an outsider, a member of the Indian community in Africa, is credibly rendered, but takes Naipaul to task for ascribing to African people a \\"mysterious malevolence\\". Irving Howe admires Naipaul's \\"almost Conradian gift for tensing a story\\", the psychic and moral tension of the novel, and its \\"serious involvement with human issues\\". Howe rejects the notion that Naipaul is an apologist of colonialism. He contrasts the foreground space occupied by Salim with the background acts set in motion by the Big Man. The Big Man never appears but finds a voice in Raymond, the white intellectual who gets dumped later. Howe bemoans the fact that, as he sees it, Naipaul offers no hope, and that he allows \\"the wretchedness of his depicted scene\\" to become \\"the limit of his vision\\". Selwyn Cudjoe thinks that the novel depicts \\"the gradual darkening of African society as it returns to its age-old condition of bush and blood\\" and thinks this pessimistic view indicates Naipaul's \\"inability to examine postcolonial societies in any depth\\". The novel examines \\"the homeless condition of the East Indian in a world he cannot call home\\" and shows in Salim's case his passage to free himself from \\"the constricting ties to his society's past\\". Imraan Coovadia examines Naipaul's Latin quotations, accuses him of misquotation and manipulation, and suggests that he tries to evoke fear, disgust and condescension. Raja suggests that the novel is less about a conflict of modernity and Third World development, but more about a representation from a bourgeois perspective, Salim being interested, not in revolutionary goals, but in maintaining a profitable enterprise. He asserts that Naipaul is not a postcolonial author but a \\"cosmopolitan\\" one (as defined by Timothy Brennan), who offers an \\"inside view of formerly submerged peoples\\" for target audiences that have \\"metropolitan literary tastes\\". In 2001, without specifically referring to this novel, the Nobel Literature Prize Committee indicated that it viewed Naipaul as Conrad's heir as the annalist of the destinies of empires in the moral sense: what they do to human beings. In Heart of Darkness, Joseph Conrad presented a dark picture of the same region at the beginning of European colonization; this type of depiction of Africa is also found recast in Naipaul's novel. Like Conrad, who in Heart of Darkness does not name the big river, Naipaul does not name the river in this novel, nor the town at its bend, nor the country or its president. Yet there are possible identifiers. Thus the reader learns that the town is located in the heart of Africa, at the end of the navigable river, just below the cataracts, and the European colonisers had been French-speaking, perhaps Belgians. Naipaul's description has been interpreted to point to the town of Kisangani on the Congo river. A link between the \\"Big Man\\" and President Mobutu of Zaire was drawn by some reviewers. Naipaul credits his extramarital affair with Margaret Gooding for giving A Bend in the River and his later books greater fluidity, saying that these \\"in a way to some extent depend on her. They stopped being dry.‚Äù Although A Bend in the River did not win the Booker Prize, despite being shortlisted, it is discussed by two characters in The Inheritance of Loss by Kiran Desai, which won the prize in 2006.

In his ministry he promoted unorthodox doctrines that led to controversy, which caused the second major schism within the Religious Society of Friends. The first being the schism caused by George Keith in 1691. He broke with the Philadelphia Friends Yearly meeting and established a separate Christian Quaker meeting. His followers were called \\"Keithians\\" or \\"Christian Quakers.\\" Elias Hicks was the older cousin of the painter Edward Hicks. Early life Elias Hicks was born in Hempstead, New York, in 1748, the son of John Hicks (1711‚Äì1789) and Martha Hicks (n√©e Smith; 1709‚Äì1759), who were farmers. He was a carpenter by trade and in his early twenties he became a Quaker like his father. On January 2, 1771, Hicks married a fellow Quaker, Jemima Seaman, at the Westbury Meeting House and they had eleven children, only five of whom reached adulthood. Hicks eventually became a farmer, settling on his wife's parents' farm in Jericho, New York, in what is now known as the Elias Hicks House. There he and his wife provided, as did other Jericho Quakers, free board and lodging to any traveler on the Jericho Turnpike rather than have them seek accommodation in taverns for the night. In 1778, Hicks helped to build the Friends meeting house in Jericho, which remains a place of Quaker worship. Hicks preached actively in Quaker meeting, and by 1778 he was acknowledged as a recorded minister. Hicks was regarded as a gifted speaker with a strong voice and dramatic flair. He drew large crowds when he was said to be attending meetings, sometimes in the thousands. In November 1829, the young Walt Whitman heard Hicks preach at Morrison's Hotel in Brooklyn, and later said, \\"Always Elias Hicks gives the service of pointing to the fountain of all naked theology, all religion, all worship, all the truth to which you are possibly eligible‚Äînamely in yourself and your inherent relations. Others talk of Bibles, saints, churches, exhortations, vicarious atonements‚Äîthe canons outside of yourself and apart from man‚ÄîElias Hicks points to the religion inside of man's very own nature. This he incessantly labors to kindle, nourish, educate, bring forward and strengthen.\\" Anti- slavery activism Elias Hicks was one of the early Quaker abolitionists. On Long Island in 1778, he joined with fellow Quakers who had begun manumitting their slaves as early as March 1776 (James Titus and Phebe Willets Mott DodgeSwarthmore Friends Historical Library, Westbury Manumissions RecGrp RG2/NY/W453 3.0 1775‚Äì1798). The Quakers at Westbury Meeting were amongst the first in New York to do so and, gradually following their example, all Westbury Quaker slaves were freed by 1799. In 1794, Hicks was a founder of the Charity Society of Jerico and Westbury Meetings, established to give aid to local poor African Americans and provide their children with education. In 1811, Hicks wrote Observations on the Slavery of Africans and Their Descendents and in it he linked the moral issue of emancipation to the Quaker Peace Testimony, by stating that slavery was the product of war. He identified the economic reason for the perpetuation of slavery: > Q. 10. By what class of the people is the slavery of the Africans and their > descendants supported and encouraged? A. Principally by the purchasers and > consumers of the produce of the slaves' labour; as the profits arising from > the produce of their labour, is the only stimulus or inducement for making > slaves. and he advocated a consumer boycott of slave-produced goods to remove the economic reasons for its existence: > Q. 11. What effect would it have on the slave holders and their slaves, > should the people of the United States of America and the inhabitants of > Great Britain, refuse to purchase or make use of any goods that are the > produce of Slavery? A. It would doubtless have a particular effect on the > slave holders, by circumscribing their avarice, and preventing their heaping > up riches, and living in a state of luxury and excess on the gain of > oppression ‚Ä¶ Observations on the Slavery of Africans and Their Descendents gave the free produce movement its central argument. This movement promoted an embargo of all goods produced by slave labor, which were mainly cotton cloth and cane sugar, in favor of produce from the paid labor of free people. Though the free produce movement was not intended to be a religious response to slavery, most of the free produce stores were Quaker in origin, as with the first such store, that of Benjamin Lundy in Baltimore in 1826. Hicks supported Lundy's scheme to assist the emigration of freed slaves to Haiti and in 1824, he hosted a meeting on how to facilitate this at his home in Jericho. In the late 1820s, he argued in favor of raising funds to buy slaves and settle them as free people in the American Southwest. Hicks influenced the abolition of slavery in his home state, from the partial abolition of the 1799 Gradual Abolition Act to the 1817 Gradual Manumission in New York State Act which led to the final emancipation of all remaining slaves within the state on July 4, 1827. Doctrinal views Hicks considered obedience to the Inner Light, to be the sole rule of faith and the foundational principle of Christianity. Although many accused him of denying the divinity of Christ, the skepticism came because of the unorthodox views he held. He believed that Jesus fulfilled all the law under the Mosaic dispensation and after the last ritual (John's Baptism in water), He became clothed with power from on high to carry out his gospel ministry. He believed the outward manifestation of Jesus was unique to the Jews and that Jesus taught the imminent end of the age of Moses along with all physical outward ordinances, types and shadows. He believed Jesus to be the Christ or Son of God through perfect obedience to the Inner Light, and most commonly referred to him as our \\"great pattern\\", encouraging others that they needed to grow in love and righteousness as he did to experience the gospel state. In the year 1829, \\"Six Queries\\" were proposed by Thomas Leggett, Jr., of New York, and answered by Elias Hicks. The last was as follows: Hicks also implicitly refuted the concepts of penal substitution, original sin, the Trinity, predestination, the impossibility of falling from grace, and an external Devil. He never spoke of eternal Hell but he expressed the importance of the soul's union \\"now\\" in preparation for the \\"realms of eternity\\" and how the soul's condemnation is elected through our free agency, not by God's foreordination. Hicks was concerned that the present state of the society of friends was settling down in tradition apart from \\"that ancient power\\", and that most other Christian professors, had \\"gone back into the law state and instituted mental shadows and forms\\", instead of worshiping in spirit and truth through stillness and obedience to the law in the heart. On ministers worshiping in their own will, preparing sermons, he boldly asserted that, \\"if you took away their notes they would be dumb.\\" He was concerned that most religious profession wasn't founded in experience with the life but was mainly a submission to tradition, superstition, and the mere \\"letter that kills\\". Concerning the scriptures (which many accused him of denying) at the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting in 1826, Hicks expressed a view of the harmful tendencies without a knowledge of the inner light: > Now this seems to be so explained in the writings called the Scriptures, > that we might gain a great deal of profitable instruction, if we would read > them under the regulating influence of the spirit of God. But they can > afford no instruction to those who read them in their own ability; for, if > they depend on their own interpretation, they are as a dead letter, in so > much, that those who profess to consider them the proper rule of faith and > practice, will kill one another for the Scriptures' sake. Another sentiment from his writings is as follows: Hicks rejected of the notion of an outward Devil as the source of evil, but rather emphasized that it was the human 'passions' or 'propensities'. Hicks stressed that basic urges, including all sexual passions, were neither implanted by an external evil, but all were aspects of human nature as created by God. Hicks claimed, in his sermon Let Brotherly Love Continue at the Byberry Friends Meeting in 1824 that: > He gave us passions‚Äîif we may call them passions‚Äîin order that we might seek > after those things which we need, and which we had a right to experience and > know. Hicks taught that all wrongdoing and suffering occurred in the world as the consequence of \\"an excess in the indulgence of propensities. Independent of the regulating influence of God's light.\\" One of the most intriguing ministers the society of friends has ever encountered, he labored earnestly to lead them in what he considered the true new covenant dispensation, an invisible inward covenant and union with God, and saw the tendency that tradition, books, rituals and even the Bible itself had to hinder that light within. Even at 81 years of age, facing heavy opposition from orthodox friends, bodily afflictions, and material in circulation to damage his reputation as a minister, he never wavered in his convictions on placing the sure rule of faith, the law written on the heart, the only thing sufficient to bring each of the children of men to the true peace and love of God. Although liberal friends today claim that he is their founder, many would be uncomfortable with his definition of Christianity: \\"Nothing more than a complete mortification of our own will, and a full and final annihilation of all self exaltation.\\" On the other hand, conservative friends, would be surprised to find in his own journals and letters, his deep knowledge of scripture and challenging call to true Christianity and self-denial, as, in his words, \\"It is only in the valley of humiliation that one can have fellowship with the oppressed seed.\\" Hicksite‚ÄìOrthodox split This first split in Quakerism was not entirely due to Hicks' ministry and internal divisions. It was, in part, also a response within Quakerism to the influences of the Second Great Awakening, the revival of Protestant evangelism that began in the 1790s as a reaction to religious skepticism, deism, and the liberal theology of Rational Christianity. However, doctrinal tensions among Friends due to Hicks' teachings had emerged as early as 1808 and as Hicks' influence grew, prominent visiting English evangelical public Friends, including William Forster and Anna Braithwaite, were prompted to travel to New York State in the period from 1821 to 1827 to denounce his views. Their presence severely exacerbated the differences among American Quakers, differences that had been underscored by the 1819 split between the American Unitarians and Congregationalists. The influence of Anna Braithwaite was especially strong. She visited the United States between 1823 and 1827 and published her Letters and observations relating to the controversy respecting the doctrines of Elias Hicks in 1824 in which she depicted Hicks as a radical eccentric. Hicks felt obliged to respond and in the same year published a letter to his ally in Philadelphia Meeting, Dr. Edwin Atlee, in The Misrepresentations of Anna Braithwaite. This in turn was replied to by Braithwaite in A Letter from Anna Braithwaite to Elias Hicks, On the Nature of his Doctrines in 1825. Neither party was persuaded by this exchange. In 1819, Hicks had devoted much energy into influencing the meeting houses in Philadelphia and this was followed by years of intense organizational turmoil. Eventually, due to both external influences and constant internal strife, matters came to a head there in 1826. After the 1826 Philadelphia Yearly Meeting, at which Hicks' sermon had stressed the importance of the Inner Light before Scripture, Quaker elders decided to visit each meeting house in the city to examine the doctrinal soundness of all ministers and elders. This caused great resentment that culminated at the following Philadelphia Yearly Meeting in 1827. Hicks was not present when the differences between the meeting houses ended in acrimony and division, precipitated by the inability of the Meeting to reach consensus on the appointment of a new clerk required to record its discernment. alt=A two-story light yellow house with reddish trim, a pointed roof on the side, a small shed-roofed addition on the left and a porch along the front. Though the initial separation was intended to be temporary, by 1828 there were two independent Quaker groupings in the city, both claiming to be the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting. Other yearly meetings split along similar lines during subsequent years, including those in New York, Baltimore, Ohio, and Indiana. Those who followed Hicks became termed Hicksites and his critics termed Orthodox Friends, each faction considering itself to be the rightful expression of the legacy of the founder of the Friends, George Fox. The split was also based on marked socioeconomic factors with Hicksite Friends being mostly poor and rural and with Orthodox Friends being mostly urban and middle-class. Many of the rural country Friends kept to Quaker traditions of \\"plain speech\\" and \\"plain dress\\", both long-abandoned by Quakers in the towns and cities. Both the Orthodox and Hicksite Friends experienced further schisms. The main following of the Orthodox Friends followed the practices of the English Quaker Joseph John Gurney who possessed an evangelical position. As time went on, a majority of the meetings endorsed forms of worship much like those of a traditional Protestant church. Those Orthodox Friends who did not agree with the practices of the Gurneyites branched off to form the Wilburite, Conservative, Primitive and Independent yearly meetings. Those Hicksite Friends who did not agree with the lessened discipline within the Hicksite yearly meetings founded Congregational, or Progressive groups. In 1828, the split in American Quakerism also spread to the Quaker community in Canada that had immigrated there from New York, the New England states and Pennsylvania in the 1790s. This resulted in a parallel system of Yearly Meetings in Upper Canada, as in the United States. The eventual division between Hicksites and the evangelical Orthodox Friends in the US was both deep and long-lasting. Full reconciliation between them took decades to achieve, from the first reunified Monthly Meetings in the 1920s until finally resolved with the reunification of Baltimore Yearly Meeting in 1968. Later life On June 24, 1829, at the age of 81, Elias Hicks went on his final traveling ministry to western and central New York State, arriving home in Jericho on November 11, 1829. There, in January 1830, he suffered a stroke that left him partially paralyzed and on February 14, 1830, he suffered an incapacitating secondary stroke. He died some two weeks later on February 27, 1830, his dying concern being that no cotton blanket, a product of slavery, should cover him on his deathbed. Elias Hicks was interred in the Jericho Friends' Burial Ground as was earlier his wife, Jemima, who predeceased him on March 17, 1829. References *Gross, David M.

It is a satire of sensationalist journalism and foreign correspondents. Summary William Boot, a young man who lives in genteel poverty, far from the iniquities of London, contributes nature notes to Lord Copper's Daily Beast, a national daily newspaper. He is dragooned into becoming a foreign correspondent, when the editors mistake him for John Courtney Boot, a fashionable novelist and a remote cousin. He is sent to Ishmaelia, a fictional state in East Africa, to report on the crisis there. Lord Copper believes it \\"a very promising little war\\" and proposes \\"to give it fullest publicity\\". Despite his total ineptitude, Boot accidentally gets the journalistic \\"scoop\\" of the title. When he returns, the credit goes to the other Boot and William is left to return to his bucolic pursuits, much to his relief. Background The novel is partly based on Waugh's experience of working for the Daily Mail, when he was sent to cover Benito Mussolini's expected invasion of Abyssinia, later known as the Second Italo-Abyssinian War (October 1935 to May 1936). When he got a scoop on the invasion, he telegraphed the story back in Latin for secrecy but they discarded it.Stannard, Martin. Evelyn Waugh: The Early Years, 1903‚Äì1939. W. W. Norton & Company, New York 1987, p. 408. . Waugh wrote up his travels more factually in Waugh in Abyssinia (1936), which complements Scoop. Lord Copper, the newspaper magnate, has been said to be an amalgam of Lord Northcliffe and Lord Beaverbrook: a character so fearsome that his obsequious foreign editor, Mr Salter, can never openly disagree with him, answering \\"Definitely, Lord Copper\\" and \\"Up to a point, Lord Copper\\" in place of \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\". Lord Copper's idea of the lowliest of his employees is a book reviewer. The historian A. J. P. Taylor wrote, \\"I have Evelyn Waugh's authority for stating that Lord Beaverbrook was not the original of Lord Copper.\\"Taylor, Alan John Percivale. Beaverbrook. Hamish Hamilton, London 1972, p. 678. Bill Deedes thought that the portrait of Copper exhibited the folie de grandeur of Rothermere and Beaverbrook and included \\"the ghost of Rothermere's elder brother, Lord Northcliffe. Before he died tragically, deranged and attended by nurses, Northcliffe was already exhibiting some of Copper's eccentricities‚Äîhis megalomania, his habit of giving ridiculous orders to underlings\\".Deedes, p. 104. It is widely believed that Waugh based his protagonist, William Boot, on Deedes, a junior reporter who arrived in Addis Ababa aged 22, with \\"quarter of a ton of baggage\\".Deedes, p. 102. In his memoir At War with Waugh, Deedes wrote that: \\"Waugh like most good novelists drew on more than one person for each of his characters. He drew on me for my excessive baggage‚Äîand perhaps for my naivety....\\" He further observed that Waugh was reluctant to acknowledge models, so that with Black Mischief's portrait of a young ruler, \\"Waugh insisted, as he usually did, that his portrait of Seth, Emperor of Azania, was not drawn from any real person such as Haile Selassie\\".Deedes, pp. 44, 72. According to Peter Stothard, a more direct model for Boot may have been William Beach Thomas, \\"a quietly successful countryside columnist and literary gent who became a calamitous Daily Mail war correspondent\\". The novel is full of all but identical opposites: Lord Copper of The Beast, Lord Zinc of the Daily Brute (the Daily Mail and Daily Express); the CumReds and the White Shirts, parodies of Communists (comrades) and Black Shirts (fascists) etc. Other models for characters (again, according to Deedes): \\"Jakes is drawn from John Gunther of the Chicago Daily News. In [one] excerpt, Jakes is found writing, 'The Archbishop of Canterbury who, it is well known, is behind Imperial Chemicals...' Authentic Gunther.\\"Deedes, p. 112. The most recognisable figure from Fleet Street is Sir Jocelyn Hitchcock, Waugh's portrait of Sir Percival Phillips, working then for The Daily Telegraph.Deedes, p. 113. Mrs Stitch is partly based on Lady Diana Cooper, Mr Baldwin is a combination of Francis Rickett and Antonin Besse. Waugh's despised Oxford tutor C. R. M. F. Cruttwell makes his customary cameo appearance, as General Cruttwell. One of the points of the novel is that even if there is little news happening, the world's media descending requires that something happen to please their editors and owners back home and so they will create news. Reception Christopher Hitchens, introducing the 2000 Penguin Classics edition of Scoop, said \\"[i]n the pages of Scoop we encounter Waugh at the mid-season point of his perfect pitch; youthful and limber and light as a feather\\" and noted: \\"The manners and mores of the press, are the recurrent motif of the book and the chief reason for its enduring magic...this world of callousness and vulgarity and philistinism...Scoop endures because it is a novel of pitiless realism; the mirror of satire held up to catch the Caliban of the press corps, as no other narrative has ever done save Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur's The Front Page.\\"Hitchens, C. Introduction to Scoop. Penguin Classics, London 2000. . Scoop was included in The Observer's list of the 100 greatest novels of all time. In 1998, the Modern Library ranked Scoop No. 75 on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. Adaptations In 1972, Scoop was made into a BBC serial: it was adapted by Barry Took, and starred Harry Worth as William Boot and James Beck as Corker. In 1987, William Boyd adapted the novel into a two-hour TV film, Scoop. Directed by Gavin Millar, it starred Michael Maloney as William Boot and Denholm Elliott as Salter. In 2009 the novel was serialised and broadcast on BBC Radio 4. Legacy \\"Feather-footed through the plashy fen passes the questing vole\\", a line from one of Boot's countryside columns, has become a famous comic example of overblown prose style, incorporating the spoonerism for \\"flashy pen\\". It inspired the name of the environmentalist magazine Vole, which was originally titled The Questing Vole. The fictional newspaper in Scoop served as the inspiration for the title of Tina Brown's online news source, The Daily Beast.

As of 2020, his latest film is Jonathan Demme's A Master Builder based on the 19th-century play by Henrik Ibsen. Andre Gregory also studied acting at The Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in New York City. Life and career Gregory was born in Paris, France, in 1934 to Russian Jewish parents. Gregory studied at Harvard University, where he was affiliated with Adams House. During the 1960s and 1970s, Gregory directed a number of avant-garde productions developed through ensemble collaboration, the most famous of which was Alice in Wonderland (1970), based on Lewis Carroll's two classic Alice books. He founded his own theatrical company, known as The Manhattan Project (1968). In 1975 he directed Our Late Night, the first produced play by Wallace Shawn, which began a long working relationship between the two men. Shortly afterward, Gregory's growing misgivings about the role of theatre in modern life, and what he felt was a trend toward fascism in the United States, led him to abandon theatre abruptly and leave the country. As described in the film, My Dinner with Andre (1981), he traveled to Poland on an invitation from noted director Jerzy Grotowski, where he developed a number of experimental theatrical events for private audiences. He spent several years in a variety of esoteric spiritual communities (such as Findhorn) developing an interest and practice in what could be described as New Age beliefs. Although Gregory left the theatre in 1975, he has returned several times to direct small productions, usually for invited audiences. These included a long-running workshop of Uncle Vanya (adapted by David Mamet), which was developed from 1990 to 1994 and featured Wallace Shawn and Julianne Moore. Though never publicly performed, it was released as the film, Vanya on 42nd Street, by Gregory and Louis Malle. He appeared as himself, directing the play featured within the film. Gregory also directed a radio production of Shawn's play, The Designated Mourner, in 2002. He has had occasional film roles as a character actor, including John the Baptist in The Last Temptation of Christ and Reverend Spellgood in The Mosquito Coast, and as Dante, a restaurateur, alongside Rosanna Arquette, David Bowie, and Buck Henry in The Linguini Incident. His best-known film performance was as the title character in My Dinner with Andre (1981), directed by Louis Malle, in which he and Wallace Shawn, playing characters based on themselves, have a long conversation over dinner. They discuss Gregory's spiritual sojourn in Europe and his doubts about the future of theatre and of Western civilization in general. He appeared with Goldie Hawn in Protocol (1984). In 1988 he played the father in Some Girls, with Jennifer Connelly and Patrick Dempsey. In 1993, he performed in the movie Demolition Man with Sylvester Stallone. Returning to theatre, Gregory directed Wallace Shawn's play Grasses of a Thousand Colors, which premiered at the Royal Court Theatre in London in May 2009. He next worked with Shawn on a new version of Ibsen's The Master Builder. This resulted in the film Fear of Falling (2013), which was directed by Jonathan Demme. The film was retitled A Master Builder at its opening in New York in June 2014. In 2013, he directed Grasses of a Thousand Colors and The Designated Mourner, starring Shawn in a co-production between Theatre for a New Audience and The Public Theater in New York. A 2013 documentary about Gregory's life, called Andre Gregory: Before and After Dinner, was directed by his wife, Cindy Kleine. He and his wife discussed it on the May 3, 2013 episode of the Charlie Rose. In May 2020, Gregory released his memoir, This Is Not My Memoir (with Todd London; Farrar, Straus and Giroux, ). Marriage and family Gregory was first married to Mercedes \\"Chiquita\\" Nebelthau, a documentary filmmaker who died in 1992. They had two children together: Nicolas and Marina.

The surface warfare officer badge is typically a prerequisite for tactical action officer (TAO) training. Junior officers, typically Ensigns, assigned to the surface warfare community are known as \\"unqualified\\" or \\"non-quals\\" until they receive qualification as a Surface Warfare Officer and receive the SWO pin. Surface line personnel who are not yet qualified have the 1160 officer designator: once qualified they receive the 1110 designator for Regular Navy Officers and 1115 for Naval Reserve Officers. Prior to 2018, junior officers were granted 18 months to qualify as Surface Warfare Officers; failing to do within the time period so meant either separation from the service or applying to transfer to another warfare community. The collisions involving the USS John S. McCain (DDG-56) and the USS Fitzgerald (DDG-62) brought about a change in qualification standards. Unqualified junior officers now have no time limit to qualify within the two years of their first tour, and now must qualify solely before they transfer to their next command. Failing to qualify prevents the officer from transferring. Officers who are separated from the SWO community are known as \\"SWO non-attains\\" and this designation is entered into the officer's permanent military record. The Surface Warfare Officer pin was designed to depict the traditional and typical elements of naval service: waves breaking before the bow of a ship overlaid on crossed U.S. Navy commissioned officer's swords, rendered in gold. The insignia was introduced in 1975. Enlisted surface warfare specialist On 1 December 1978, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral T.B. Hayward approved the surface warfare specialist qualification program. This approval followed immediately by the promulgation of OPNAV Instruction 1412.4, which provided the specific details of the program. Since the introduction of the surface warfare officer (SWO) qualification program in 1975, a strong advocacy for a similar program for surface enlisted was started. The program was initiated in 1977 when the surface warfare commanders (DCNO Surface Warfare, COMNAVSURFLANT and COMNAVSURFPAC) gave their conceptual approval to the development of a surface enlisted qualification program. Initial guidelines for the program at that time were: 1\\\\. It was to reflect a level of qualification above and beyond the normal level of professional and performance criteria necessary for advancement. 2\\\\. The qualification was applicable to and reasonably attainable by all \\"surface\\" ratings. 3\\\\. Qualification was an attainable goal for dedicated enlisted serving on ships and afloat staffs. 4\\\\. Management of the program would not become an administrative burden on the ship. 5\\\\. Qualification criteria would be well defined and specific. 6\\\\. Participation was voluntary, and there was neither a financial reward nor hazardous duty associated with the qualification. The silver cutlass was available for the first time in April 1979. Specifically the criteria in 1979 to qualify was as follows: 1\\\\. Be a petty officer 2\\\\. Have 24 months on a surface ship 3\\\\. Have a performance mark and leadership marks of top 30% for CPO's and 3.4 for petty officers. 4\\\\. Complete the PQS for damage control, damage control petty officer, repair party leader, and work center supervisor. 5\\\\. Qualify in all watch stations for rating and pay grade. 6\\\\. Perform an oral board held by the commanding officer, executive officer or lieutenant commander. 7\\\\. Be recommended by the chain of command, and approved by the commanding officer. OPNAVINST 1414.9 is the Navy instruction that governs the enlisted warfare qualification programs. This instruction also cancels OPNAVINST 1414.2A. The enlisted surface warfare specialist insignia also known as the ESWS pin, is authorized for wear by any enlisted member of the United States Navy who is permanently stationed aboard a navy afloat command and completes the enlisted surface warfare qualification program and personal qualification standards (PQS). The enlisted surface warfare specialist badge can be obtained at any time after reporting to a ship, if in the paygrade of E-5 (petty officer second class) and above. It has become common for commanding officers of Navy ships to award the ESWS pin to those in paygrades E-2 and E-3 after they complete the requisite qualifications. Sailors for whom ESWS is their secondary community (mostly those in the air warfare community) are not required to re-qualify. An enlisted person who has qualified for his or her ESWS pin places the designator SW after his or her rate and rating; for example, Boatswain's Mate Second Class Jones, having qualified for his ESWS pin, is identified as BM2(SW) Jones. For those enlisted personnel who are subsequently commissioned as officers and are shipboard SWO's the enlisted surface warfare specialist badge is replaced but only after they have fully completed their Surface Warfare Officer qualifications. Unlike other warfare pins available to both enlisted and officers, the ESWS and SWO pins differ by more than just color (gold for officers and silver for enlisted is a common theme in U.S. Navy uniforms). The blade weapons behind the hull on the SWO pin are swords. The blade weapons on the enlisted pin are cutlasses. This can clearly be seen in the curvature of the blades and the shape of the handguards. This derives from the sword being a symbol of naval officers and their authority, while cutlasses were traditionally issued for battle to enlisted sailors during the age of sail. The ESWS is tall and wide. =Requirements as of August 2010= Qualification and or re-qualification is mandatory for all enlisted sailors assigned to designated warfare qualifying commands. Warfare sponsors will establish specific qualification and re- qualifying timelines by signing a punitive contract. The maximum allowable time for initial qualification of all enlisted sailors assigned to designated warfare qualifying commands will not exceed 30 months Medical corps officer Surface warfare medical corps insignia: A gold metal pin, with a spread oak leaf surcharged with a silver acorn on two crossed swords, on a background of ocean swells. Nurse corps officer Surface warfare nurse corps insignia: A gold metal pin, with a spread oak leaf on two crossed swords, on a background of ocean swells. Dental corps officer Surface warfare dental corps insignia: A gold metal pin, with a spread oak leaf, a silver acorn on each side of the stem on two crossed swords, on a background of ocean swells. Medical service corps officer Surface warfare medical service corps insignia: A gold metal pin, with a spread oak leaf, attached to a slanting twig on two crossed swords, on a background of ocean swells. Supply corps officer The surface warfare supply corps insignia is granted to those members of the Navy Supply Corps who qualify as surface warfare supply officers. Such officers are trained in shipboard supply systems, food service, housing and welfare service, disbursing operations, damage control, and receive a limited amount of training as an officer of the deck (underway) [Some ship commanding officers require supply officers to become fully OOD Underway qualified]. Depending on the ship type they may receive training in shipboard flight operations as the Helicopter Control Officer. For advancement in the surface supply community, the surface warfare supply pin must be obtained by junior supply officers within 18 months from reporting on board a naval vessel. Those failing to qualify as a surface supply officer are transferred to permanent ground assignment as shore supply officers. Other versions of the supply corps pin include the Naval Aviation Supply Corps insignia, the Submarine Supply Corps insignia and the Navy Expeditionary Supply Corps insignia. Coast Guard The United States Coast Guard does not issue the surface warfare pin. Coast Guard personnel who are permanently cross assigned to afloat Navy commands may qualify for the surface warfare badge through the standard Navy qualification system. Coast Guard personnel serving on Coast Guard cutters are eligible to receive either the officer or enlisted version of the comparable Coast Guard insignia, the cutterman insignia. NOAA Commissioned Corps NOAA deck officer insignia The NOAA Commissioned Corps deck officer pin is a gold-colored pin displaying breaking waves, with a central device consisting of a fouled anchor surcharged with a NOAA Corps device. NOAA Corps officers certified as senior watch officer may wear the NOAA deck officer insignia after authorization by the Director of the NOAA Corps.

Kraft is also believed to have committed the rape and murder of up to 51 other boys and young men. He was convicted in May 1989. and is currently incarcerated on death row at San Quentin State Prison in Marin County, California. Kraft became known as the \\"Scorecard Killer\\", because upon his arrest investigators discovered a coded list containing cryptic references to his victims; he is also sometimes referred to as the \\"Freeway Killer\\", because many of his victims' bodies were discovered beside or near freeways. He shares the latter epithet with two separate and unrelated serial killers, William Bonin and Patrick Kearney. Early life = Childhood = Randy Steven Kraft was born in Long Beach, California, on March 19, 1945, the fourth child and only son born to Opal Lee (n√©e Beal) and Harold Herbert Kraft.. Kraft's parents had moved to California from Wyoming at the outbreak of World War II; his father worked as a production worker, and his mother worked as a sewing machine operator. The Kraft family lived modestly, and Kraft's mother undertook a succession of jobs to supplement her husband's salary. Nonetheless, Opal Kraft always found time for her children, whereas in contrast, Kraft's father seldom attended any social gatherings with them, and was later described as being \\"distanced\\" from his family. As a child, Randy was doted on by his three older sisters and mother, although he was known to be accident-prone. In 1948, the Kraft family moved from Long Beach to Midway City, in neighboring Orange County. Their home was a small, wood-frame Women's Army Corps dormitory on Beach Boulevard that Kraft's father renovated into a three-bedroom house. In Midway City, Kraft attended Midway City Elementary school, where his mother served on the PTA. As a student, he was noted for his intelligence by classmates and teachers. By 1957, Kraft was deemed intelligent enough to attend accelerated classes at 17th Street Junior High School. =Adolescence and graduation= By adolescence, Kraft had taken a keen interest in politics, becoming a staunch Republican with aspirations of becoming a U.S. senator. Shortly after his enrollment at Westminster High School, he and two close friends founded a Westminster World Affairs Club. At Westminster High, Kraft was again regarded as a pleasant, bright student who regularly achieved A grades. He was also known to occasionally date girls, although some classmates and teachers later stated they suspected Kraft was homosexual.. Kraft later stated he had known from his high school days that he was homosexual, although he initially kept his sexual orientation a secret. On June 13, 1963, he graduated tenth out of a class of 390 pupils. That fall, he enrolled at Claremont Men's College in Claremont, California, where he pursued a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics. Claremont Men's College Shortly after his enrollment at Claremont Men's College (Now named Claremont McKenna College), Kraft enrolled in the Claremont Reserve Officers Training Corps and regularly attended demonstrations in support of the Vietnam War and‚Äîin 1964‚Äîfor the election of Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater. Kraft later declared these actions were merely a mimic of his parents' political views and not his own, describing his second year at Claremont as being when he abandoned the \\"last gasp\\" of his conservative ideology. The same year, Kraft entered his first known homosexual relationship. In 1964, Kraft began working as a bartender at a local Garden Grove cocktail lounge that catered to gay clientele; he was also known to regularly travel to Laguna Beach and Huntington Beach to have casual sex with hustlers. In an apparent tentative effort to announce his sexuality to his parents, Kraft took a succession of male \\"friends\\" to meet his family in the years he was enrolled at Claremont. Initially, Kraft's parents and sisters were oblivious to his homosexuality. In 1966, Kraft was arrested and charged with lewd conduct after propositioning an undercover policeman in Huntington Beach; as he had no previous criminal record, no charges were filed. The following year, he developed a radical shift in his political beliefs, becoming an ardent supporter of left-wing politics, and eventually registered as a Democrat in 1967. The same year he registered as a Democrat, Kraft became a party organizer, campaigning tirelessly for the election of Robert F. Kennedy and receiving a personal letter from the senator, thanking him for his efforts. By his senior year, he had become a lackadaisical student, drinking, taking drugs, and regularly attending all-night gambling and poker sessions with other students. The lack of commitment to his studies in his final year resulted in Kraft's failing to graduate from Claremont in June 1967. Kraft had to repeat his econometrics class, resulting in deferment of his graduation by eight months. In February 1968, he graduated from Claremont Men's College with a Bachelor of Arts in economics. U.S. Air Force Four months after his graduating from college, Kraft joined the U.S. Air Force. He was sent to basic training in Texas before being stationed at Edwards Air Force Base in southern California, where he supervised the painting of test planes. In his service within the Air Force, Kraft rose to the rank of Airman First Class and supervisor-manager. The same year Kraft became an Airman First Class, he disclosed to his family that he was homosexual. In a letter he wrote to a friend, Kraft described his father as having flown \\"into a rage\\", whereas he described his mother as being more understanding, if somewhat disapproving. Kraft's family ultimately accepted his sexuality, and he remained in close contact with his parents and siblings, although his siblings noted he began to \\"distance himself\\" from his family after he had announced his sexuality to them. On July 26, 1969, Kraft received a general discharge from the Air Force after announcing his sexuality to his superiors. The discharge was officially listed as being on \\"medical\\" grounds. In response, Kraft sought legal advice from an attorney in an attempt to challenge the grounds regarding his discharge from the Air Force. The Air Force, however, refused to change the status of his discharge. Following his military discharge, Kraft moved back into his parents' home and worked as a bartender. =First known sexual assault= In March 1970, Kraft encountered a 13-year-old Westminster youth named Joseph Gerald Fancher at Huntington Beach.. Fancher explained to Kraft that he had run away from home that day. In response, Kraft invited the youth to accompany him to his apartment on the promise that Fancher could live with him. Fancher agreed and accompanied Kraft to his Belmont Shore apartment, where he was drugged and assaulted. Hours later, Fancher escaped from Kraft's apartment after Kraft left the youth unattended to go to work. A member of the public summoned an ambulance, having observed Fancher's drugged and disheveled condition; he required having his stomach pumped as a result of the drugs he had ingested. At the hospital, Fancher informed police Kraft had given him drugs and beaten him.On Trial for Murder p. 188 He did not disclose to either his parents or the police that he had been sexually assaulted. A search of Kraft's apartment was conducted, with the cooperation of his roommate. However, as Fancher had confessed to police he had taken the pills offered to him voluntarily and the officers had conducted the search without a warrant, no charges were filed. =Enrollment at Long Beach State University= In 1971, Kraft found new employment as a forklift driver in Huntington Beach. In an effort to further his career prospects following his military discharge two years earlier, he enrolled at Long Beach State University, undertaking teaching courses. There, Kraft became acquainted with Jeff Graves, a fellow teaching student from Minnesota four years younger than Kraft, with whom he began a relationship. Murders Between 1971 and 1983, Kraft is believed to have killed a total of 67 victims. All of his suspected victims were males between the ages of 13 and 35, the majority of whom were in their late teens to mid-twenties. Kraft was charged with‚Äîand convicted of‚Äîsixteen of these homicides, all of which had occurred between 1972 and 1983. Many of his victims had been enlisted in the United States Marines Corps, and most of his victims' bodies bore evidence of high levels of both alcohol and tranquilizers in their blood systems, indicating they had been rendered insensate before they had been abused and killed. Kraft's victims were typically lured into his vehicle with an offer of a lift or alcohol. Inside Kraft's vehicle, the victims would be plied with alcohol and/or other drugs. They were then bound, tortured, and sexually abused before they were usually killed by either strangulation, asphyxiation, or bludgeoning, although some victims had also ingested fatal doses of pharmaceuticals and at least one victim was stabbed to death. The victims would then be discarded, usually‚Äîthough not exclusively‚Äîalongside or close to various freeways in southern California. Photographic evidence found at Kraft's home indicates several of his victims were driven to his house before their murder.. Many of the victims were burned with a car cigarette lighter, usually around the genitals, chest, and face, and several were found with extensive blunt force trauma to the face and head.. In several instances, foreign objects were found inserted into the victims' rectums while other victims had suffered emasculation, or mutilation and dismemberment. The majority of Kraft's murders were committed in California, although some victims had been killed in Oregon, with two further known victims murdered in Michigan in December 1982. =First suspected murder victim= On October 5, 1971, police found the nude body of a 30-year-old Long Beach resident named Wayne Joseph Dukette discarded close to the Ortega Highway. Dukette, a bartender at a gay bar named \\"The Stable\\" in nearby Sunset Beach, had last been seen alive on September 20, 1971. Putrefaction had erased any signs of foul play upon the body, and the cause of death was listed as acute alcohol poisoning due to a high blood alcohol level. The first entry in Kraft's personal journal (referred to as his \\"scorecard\\") reads \\"Stable\\", leading investigators to believe Dukette was Kraft's first murder victim.LA Times Oct. 2, 1988Crime Library p. 3. =Subsequent murders= Fifteen months after the murder of Dukette, Kraft killed a 20-year-old Marine named Edward Daniel Moore. Moore was seen alive leaving the barracks at Camp Pendleton on December 24, 1972. His body was found beside the 405 Freeway in Seal Beach during the early hours of December 26. Abrasions on Moore's body indicated he had been discarded from a moving vehicle. An autopsy revealed he had been bound about the wrists and ankles, then beaten with a blunt instrument about the face before being garrotted. His body also bore evidence of numerous bite marks, and a sock had been forced into his rectum. Facial reconstruction of an unidentified victim found in February 1973, believed to have been logged upon Kraft's scorecard as \\"Wilmington\\" Six weeks after the murder of Moore, on February 6, 1973, the body of an unidentified male, estimated to be around 17 to 25 years old, was found alongside the Terminal Island Freeway in Los Angeles. This victim had been strangled by a ligature and had also had a sock placed in his rectum. Two months later, on April 9, the body of 17-year-old Kevin Clark Bailey was found beside a road in Huntington Beach. Bailey had been emasculated and sodomized prior to his murder. By July 28, a further two victims had been murdered: an unidentified youth whose dismembered body was found on April 22 and a 20-year-old named Ronnie Gene Wiebe, whose strangled body was discarded beside an onramp to the 405 Freeway on July 30, two days after he had disappeared. Welt marks on Wiebe's wrists and ankles suggested he had been bound and suspended from a device before his murder. Kraft is only known to have killed once more in 1973. The victim was a 23-year-old bisexual art student named Vincent Cruz Mestas, whose body was found in the San Bernardino Mountains on December 29. As had been the case with several previous victims, one of the victim's socks had been forced into his rectum. Mestas's hands had also been severed from his body, and were never found. By November 1974, a further five victims had been found beside or close to mass transportation in southern California, three of which had been conclusively linked to the same killer. Two of these victims‚Äî20-year-old Malcolm Eugene Little and 19-year-old James Dale Reeves‚Äîhad each been found beside a freeway with foreign objects inserted into their bodies, whereas the body of the third victim, 18-year-old Marine Roger Edward Dickerson, bore evidence of bite marks much like several earlier victims. =1975= On January 3, 1975, Kraft abducted and murdered a 17-year-old high school student named John Leras. The youth was last seen boarding a bus in Long Beach; his strangled body was found the following day, discarded at Sunset Beach with a foreign object protruding from his anus. Drag marks along the beach close to where his body had been discarded indicated two individuals had carried Leras's body into the water. Two weeks after this murder, on January 17, the body of a 21-year-old named Craig Jonaitis was found discarded in the parking lot of the Golden Sails Hotel near the Pacific Coast Highway and Loynes Drive in Long Beach. Jonaitis had been strangled to death with a length of string, possibly a shoelace. =Investigation= By January 1975, a total of 14 victims, whose bodies had been found discarded across four separate counties within the previous three years, had been linked to the same killer. All the victims had been Caucasian males with similar physical characteristics. On January 24, homicide investigators from several jurisdictions in southern California convened in Orange County to discuss progress in the hunt for the unknown killer.. An FBI profile of the killer was read to investigators, describing the individual as a methodical, organized lust killer of above average intelligence who exhibited an indifference to the \\"interests and welfare of society\\". Some investigators believed the murders to be the work of more than one individual, one or more of whom had a military background: two victims' bodies had tissue paper residue on their noses, conforming to a known military procedure to prevent bodies from purging after death. The placing of socks inside the victims' rectums was also theorized to be a method used by the killer to prevent purging as the body was driven to the disposal location. At this stage, investigators had no solid suspects. =Murder of Keith Crotwell= On the evening of March 29, 1975, Kraft lured two youths, Keith Crotwell and Kent May, from a Long Beach parking lot into his Ford Mustang. The youths were plied with beer and Valium as Kraft drove in an apparently random, directionless manner around Belmont Shore and Seal Beach. May later recalled feeling catatonic as a result of the Valium and alcohol he had ingested before he passed out. In the parking lot where Crotwell and May had last been seen, two friends of the youths observed a distinctive black and white Mustang rapidly enter and draw to a halt before the driver leaned across, opened the passenger door, and pushed the unconscious (but otherwise unharmed) May from the rear seat onto the pavement. The driver then sped away from the scene. As he did so, the friends noted Crotwell slumped against the unknown driver's shoulder. On May 8, Crotwell's skull was found in a jetty close to the Long Beach Marina; the remainder of his body was found six months later.. Upon hearing the news, the two friends of Crotwell and May, suspecting the murderer to have been a patron of a Belmont Shore gay bar, scoured their neighborhood for the distinctive Mustang they had observed. Upon locating the vehicle less than one mile (1.6 km) from their home, the youths noted the license plate number and relayed the information to police. The registration of the vehicle was traced to Kraft. =Interrogation and release= Long Beach police questioned Kraft about Crotwell's abduction and murder on May 19, 1975. Initially, he denied having ever met either Crotwell or May and the police, initially skeptical of Kraft's denial, summoned him to the police station for further questioning. There, Kraft admitted that on or around March 29, he had encountered two youths in the Long Beach parking lot in question and had persuaded them to drink alcohol and consume Valium with him as he drove. He claimed to have returned May to the parking lot and then to have driven with Crotwell to a side road close to the El Toro offramp, where his car subsequently became embedded upon an embankment. He claimed to have walked alone to a gas station to call a tow truck while Crotwell remained with his vehicle. Upon returning to his vehicle, Kraft claimed, Crotwell had disappeared. Although Kraft's roommate was able to verify to detectives that Kraft had phoned him on the date of Crotwell's disappearance, claiming his vehicle was stuck upon an embankment, detectives remained unconvinced with Kraft's overall version of events. The following week, two detectives attempted to file homicide charges against Kraft. However, the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office dismissed the detectives' request, citing the coroner's conclusion from his autopsy of the remains thus far found (solely the youth's skull) that the youth had died of accidental drowning. Perhaps because Kraft had been questioned as a suspect in Crotwell's murder and because of additional turmoil in his personal life in the summer of 1975, Kraft is not known to have killed again until December 31, when he abducted 22-year-old Mark Hall in San Juan Capistrano. In this murder, later described by prosecutors as \\"the worst\\" of all of Kraft's known murders, the man was driven to a remote canyon, where he was bound to a tree. The autopsy report listed the cause of death as being asphyxiation caused by leaves and earth found lodged deep into Hall's trachea. The autopsy also revealed Hall had been sodomized and emasculated, with his severed genitals then inserted into his rectum. Additionally, his chest, scrotum, nose and cheeks had been burned with an automobile cigarette lighter, with his eyes being destroyed by the same object. Other injuries noted in the autopsy included numerous incisions on Hall's legs which had been inflicted with a broken bottle. On Trial for Murder p. 189 Forensic experts were able to deduce that Hall had been alive throughout much of the ordeal. Victim Paul Joseph Fuchs Relationship with Jeff Seelig By 1976, Kraft had ended his relationship with Graves. Shortly thereafter, he began a relationship with a 19-year-old apprentice baker named Jeff Seelig, and the couple moved to Laguna Hills. Although neither man was inclined towards monogamy, the couple considered their relationship permanent. Seelig later informed investigators that he and Kraft regularly picked up and propositioned hitchhikers who, if willing, would accompany them to their apartment for a threesome. However, Seelig was adamant that Kraft had never been violent towards him and that he had never seen him display violent tendencies. Kraft's relationship with Seelig is believed to be a contributory factor in the sudden lull in murders he is known to have committed.. He is not known to have killed again until December 10, 1976. The body of the victim, 19-year-old Paul Joseph Fuchs, has never been found. Nonetheless, Fuchs' name is clearly listed upon Kraft's scorecard. =Resurfacing of the Freeway Killer= Following the December 1976 murder of Fuchs, Kraft is not known to have killed any further victims for sixteen months. On January 3, 1978, homicide investigators again convened to discuss progress in relation to the manhunt for the still-unidentified killer.. By this stage, investigators knew there was more than one murderer at large: the previous July, police had arrested Patrick Kearney, who subsequently confessed to the murders of 28 boys and young men, many of whom he had dissected and discarded in trash bags beside freeways in southern California. Although Kraft had himself dismembered some of his victims' bodies, he never killed his victims by shooting them in the temple, as Kearney had. Additionally, Kearney had never tortured any of his victims: his modus operandi significantly differed from Kraft‚Äôs, and investigators were certain that an altogether separate killer was still at large. On April 16, 1978, Kraft abducted an 18-year-old Marine named Scott Michael Hughes. Hughes was plied with Valium before Kraft slit open his scrotum and removed one of his testicles, then strangled him to death with a ligature before discarding his fully clothed body‚Äîmissing only his shoelaces‚Äîbesides a freeway onramp in Anaheim. Two months later, on June 11, the body of 23-year-old Roland Gerald Young was found near a San Diego freeway. Young had been emasculated before he was stabbed to death. Abrasions to his body indicated that he had been thrown from a vehicle traveling at high speed. Eight days later, the body of a 20-year-old Camp Pendleton Marine named Richard Allen Keith was found discarded beside a road in Moulton Parkway. Welts on Keith's wrists indicated that he had been bound before he was strangled with a ligature. Froth in his throat indicated that he was also drowning as a result of flurazepam and alcohol he had consumed at the time he was strangled. Victim Keith Klingbeil Three weeks after the murder of Keith, on July 6, Kraft killed a 23-year-old hitchhiker named Keith Arthur Klingbeil. Klingbeil had ingested large doses of paracetamol and alcohol before he was strangled with his own shoelace and his body discarded beside the Interstate 5 freeway.. Although Klingbeil was still alive when discovered, he would die shortly after his admission to the Mission Community Hospital. A subsequent autopsy revealed that, prior to Klingbeil's strangulation, his left nipple had been seared with an automobile cigarette lighter. Two months later, on September 29, the body of 20-year-old Richard Anthony Crosby was found discarded 200 yards north of Highway 71 in San Bernardino County.. Crosby had disappeared the previous day as he hitchhiked home from a theater in Torrance. The youth had died of suffocation, and his left nipple had been mutilated with an automobile cigarette lighter.LA Times Oct. 2, 1988 The last known victim claimed by Kraft in 1978 was a 21-year-old Long Beach truck driver named Michael Joseph Inderbieten, whose castrated body was found beside the San Diego freeway on November 18, 1978. In addition to having been castrated, Inderbieten had been violated with a foreign object and had suffered burn wounds similar to those inflicted upon victim Mark Hall two years previously. The cause of death was listed as suffocation. Later murders Kraft is not known to have killed again until June 16, 1979, when he abducted a 20-year-old Marine named Donnie Harold Crisel. His body was thrown from a moving vehicle onto the 405 Freeway. The cause of death was listed as acute alcohol poisoning, although rope and burn marks indicated Crisel had been bound and tortured prior to his body being discarded. Two months later, on August 29, the dismembered body of an unidentified male, estimated to be aged between 18 and 30, was found placed in two trash bags behind a Union 76 gas station in Long Beach. The entry upon Kraft's scorecard simply reading \\"76\\" is believed to refer to this victim. Although only the head, torso and left leg of this victim were ever found,NamUs case file #4400 this victim, like several others, had had a sock placed inside his rectum. Two weeks later, on September 14, the body of 20-year-old Gregory Wallace Jolley was found in Lake Arrowhead. Jolley had been emasculated and his head and legs had been severed after death. His personal possessions were later found at Kraft's home. On November 24, 1979, a 15-year-old Santa Ana youth named Jeffrey Sayre is believed to have been abducted and murdered by Kraft. Sayre was last seen at a bus stop in Westminster. as he traveled home from a date with his girlfriend. The entry \\"Westminster Date\\" on Kraft's scorecard is believed to refer to Sayre. On February 18, 1980, the decapitated body of a 19-year-old Marine named Mark Alan Marsh was found near the Templin Highway. Marsh was last seen hitchhiking towards Buena Park. His hands had also been severed from his body after death. =Portland murders= In the summer of 1980, Kraft traveled to the neighboring state of Oregon as part of a contractual assignment delegated to him by his employers. Throughout the duration of his deployment, he resided in a town close to Portland. Before he returned to California in August, he is believed to have claimed a further two victims‚Äîboth of whom were listed upon his scorecard with cryptic references including the word \\"Portland\\". The first victim, a 17-year-old Denver youth named Michael Sean O'Fallon, was killed on July 17. O'Fallon had been on a solo hitchhiking trip across the U.S. and Canada prior to his enrollment at college at the time of his murder. He was plied with both alcohol and Valium before he was strangled to death. O'Fallon's nude, hogtied body was discarded ten miles south of Salem. He was listed upon Kraft's scorecard as \\"Portland Denver\\". The following day, Kraft is believed to have killed a man estimated to be aged between 35 and 45 years old whose body was found beside a freeway in the city of Woodburn. This victim‚Äîlisted as \\"Portland Elk\\" on Kraft's scorecard‚Äîhad ingested a toxic level of Valium and Tylenol before he was strangled to death with a ligature. A Polaroid photograph of victim Robert Wyatt Loggins, sitting on Kraft's couch. This image was taken by Kraft at his Long Beach residence in August 1980. On September 3, 1980, one month after his return to California from Oregon, the bound body of a 19-year-old Marine named Robert Loggins was found discarded in a trash bag located close to the El Toro Marine air base. Loggins had last been seen alive by two fellow Marines close to the Pacific Coast Highway on August 23. Photographs‚Äîand the negatives‚Äîsubsequently found in Kraft's possession depict Loggins in Kraft's living room slumped fully clothed on his sofa, apparently intoxicated, and in various nude, pornographic postures. All these pictures depict Loggins with his eyes closed; it is unknown whether the victim was alive or dead at the time they were taken.. On April 10, 1981, the body of a 17-year-old youth named Michael Cluck was found beside the Interstate 5 freeway close to the community of Goshen, Oregon. Cluck had been abducted as he hitchhiked from Kent, Washington, to Bakersfield, California,. the day prior to his body being discovered. The youth had been killed by thirty-one blows to the head, each inflicted by a blunt instrument which had destroyed the rear of his cranium. In addition, Cluck had been sodomized and his body savagely beaten, kicked and scoured. Cluck is believed to have been recorded upon Kraft's scorecard as \\"Portland Blood\\", due to the extensive blood and debris found at the murder scene. At the time of the murder, Kraft is known to have again been deployed by his employers to Oregon. In addition, on the day Cluck's body was discovered, Kraft is also known to have visited a Lane County hospital to receive treatment for a bruised foot. Four months after Cluck's murder, on August 20, 1981, the partially clothed body of 17-year-old male prostitute Christopher Allen Williams was found in the San Bernardino Mountains. Williams had been plied with both phenobarbital and benzodiazepine and was found with tissue paper lodged deep in his nostrils, causing the youth to choke to death on his own mucus.. =Echo Park murders= By early 1982, the relationship between Kraft and Seelig had become marred by frequent fights and episodes of temporary separation. In an effort to resolve their personal differences, the couple began attending weekly counseling sessions in Huntington Beach. These sessions began on June 22, 1982. Following complaints from residents of Echo Park regarding a foul odor emanating from the direction of the Hollywood Freeway on July 29, 1982, a Cal Trans employee found the decaying body of a 14-year-old. Pittsburg youth named Raymond Davis discarded alongside the Rampart Boulevard offramp. Rudimentary efforts had been made to conceal Davis's body beneath leaves and soil. He had last been seen alive in Echo Park on June 17,UPI Archives Aug. 21, 1982 searching for his missing dog. The youth's wrists had been knotted behind his back in much the same manner as victim Michael O'Fallon had been two years previously, and he had been strangled to death with his own shoelace. The entry upon Kraft's scorecard reading \\"Dog\\" is believed to refer to Davis. Just 40 feet from Davis' body, the same Cal Trans crew also found the body of 16-year-old Robert Avila. Avila had been missing since July 21, although his body was also markedly decomposed. He had been strangled to death with a length of stereo speaker wire. Kraft is not known to have killed again until November 1, 1982, when he abducted and murdered a 24-year-old Modesto man named Arne Mikeal Laine. Laine was last seen hitchhiking towards Orange County in search of work. His body was not found until January 1984, discarded on a hillside close to the town of Ramona. Four weeks after Laine's murder, the semi-nude body of 26-year-old Brian Whitcher was dumped from a moving vehicle alongside the Interstate 5 freeway, close to the city of Wilsonville, Oregon. Whitcher had ingested high levels of both alcohol and Valium, but he died of asphyxiation. On December 3, 1982, a 29-year-old carpenter named Anthony Jose Silveira disappeared while hitchhiking towards Medford. His body was found two weeks later, strangled, sodomized and bearing evidence of having been violated with foreign objects prior to his murder. At the time of the murders of both Whitcher and Silveira, Kraft was again known to have been in Oregon on a business trip, which concluded the day of Silveira's death. On December 4, Kraft is known to have driven from Portland to Seattle to visit friends. Throughout this brief visit, he was observed wearing a military jacket inscribed with the name \\"Silveira\\".. On December 5, Kraft flew from Seattle to Grand Rapids, Michigan‚Äîagain on business. =Grand Rapids and return to Portland= Two days after his arrival in Grand Rapids, Kraft encountered cousins Dennis Alt and Christopher Schoenborn as the trio attended a seminar in the Amway Grand Plaza Hotel. Kraft was observed conversing with the pair at the reception area of the hotel shortly before midnight. Their bodies were discovered on December 9 in an open field close to the hotel. Both victims had been plied with alcohol and Valium prior to their sodomy and murder, and the bodies had been arranged in sexually suggestive positions. Alt, aged 24, had died of asphyxiation, whereas Schoenborn, aged 20, had been strangled to death with his own belt. In addition, a ballpoint pen had been inserted into Schoenborn's urethra prior to his murder. Both victims were recorded upon Kraft's scorecard in a single entry reading \\"GR2\\". A set of keys belonging to Schoenborn, plus Silveira's military jacket, were left by Kraft in the hotel. On December 8, Kraft traveled from Michigan to Portland. Within 24 hours of his return to Oregon, he had killed a 19-year-old hitchhiker named Lance Taggs. Taggs had last been seen hitchhiking from the city of Tigard to the home of a relative in Los Angeles on December 8. His body was discovered the following day, discarded alongside a rural road in Clackamas County, close to where the body of Whitcher had been found just two weeks earlier. As had been the case with Alt and Schoenborn, Taggs had been plied with alcohol and Valium prior to his murder, although Taggs had died of suffocation caused by a sock thrust into his trachea. =Connection of Oregon murders to manhunt= Noting the passage of time between periods of activity when bodies of young males had been found discarded near mass transportation with alcohol and/or pharmaceuticals in their blood stream in Oregon, investigators there theorized that their killer resided in another state and struck in Oregon only when there on business. Following the murders of Silveira, Whitcher and Taggs, Oregon investigators relayed details of the murders to police in other states, describing the modus operandi of the killer they were seeking and requesting feedback from any police force who had unsolved murders of young males on their files with similar characteristics. A response from southern California counties was swift: the pattern of killings was identical to victims linked to the unknown killer in California. The six Oregon murders committed by Kraft were thus linked to the murders he had committed in California. Victim Eric Church 1983 Kraft did not kill again until January 27, 1983, when he abducted a 21-year-old hitchhiker named Eric Church. The victim was last seen alive hitchhiking from Orange County to Sacramento the day prior to his murder. His body was found discarded alongside I-605. An autopsy concluded Church had ingested high levels of alcohol and Valium and had been sodomized. Rope marks on Church's wrists indicated he had struggled against his restraints before he died of a combination of ligature strangulation and numerous blows to the side of his skull inflicted by a blunt instrument. On February 12, Kraft killed two Buena Park men: 18-year-old Geoffrey Nelson. and 20-year-old Rodger DeVaul. The two young men were last seen outside the house of a friend named Bryce Wilson shortly after midnight, informing Wilson they intended to purchase something to eat. Nelson's nude body was found alongside an offramp close to the Garden Grove Freeway several hours after he and DeVaul were last seen. He had been emasculated, strangled and thrown from a moving vehicle. DeVaul's body was found the following day; discarded down a mountainside close to Mount Baldy in San Bernardino County. He had been bound, sodomized and strangled with a cord. As had been the case with Nelson, DeVaul had ingested both alcohol and propranolol prior to his murder. In addition, both victims had ingested both potato skins and grapes shortly before their murder. =Final murder and arrest= At 1:10 a.m. on May 14, 1983, two California Highway Patrol officers observed a Toyota Celica driving erratically on Interstate 5 in the Orange County community of Mission Viejo. Observing the vehicle perform an illegal lane change, the officers‚Äîsuspecting the driver was drunk‚Äîsignaled for the vehicle to stop.. The driver slowed the vehicle to a halt and exited the car, discarding the contents of a beer bottle onto the pavement as he did so. Officer Michael Sterling met the individual, who identified himself as Randy Kraft, at the front of his patrol car and observed that his jeans were unbuttoned. Sterling had Kraft perform a sobriety test, which he failed. Sterling arrested Kraft for driving while intoxicated.. Sterling's partner, Sgt. Michael Howard, approached the Celica and observed a young man slumped with his eyes closed in the vehicle passenger seat, partially covered by a jacket. Several empty Moosehead beer bottles and an open prescription bottle of Lorazepam tablets were strewn around his feet. Howard attempted to wake the man. Receiving no response to his verbal efforts, Howard attempted to rouse the man by shaking his arm, only to note the individual had a low body temperature. Upon feeling for a pulse, Howard noted the man was dead, with a ligature mark visibly encircling his neck. Lifting the jacket from the victim's lap, Howard noted the victim's jeans had been opened to expose his genitalia. In addition, the victim's hands had been bound with a shoelace and his wrists bore evidence of welt marks. Later identified as Terry Lee Gambrel, a 25-year-old Marine stationed at El Toro air base, the victim had been strangled to death. Kraft was initially charged with driving under the influence of alcohol, and was held in custody as detectives conducted a thorough search of his vehicle. Upon the rear seat of the car, investigators found a belt, the width of which matched the bruising around Gambrel's neck. Other incriminating evidence included alcohol, tranquilizers, various prescription drugs and stimulants. The passenger seat and carpet of the vehicle was heavily bloodstained; however, Gambrel had no open wounds. The upholstery was removed for forensic analysis, the results of which confirmed the blood was human. Beneath the carpet, investigators discovered an envelope containing over 50 pictures of young men in pornographic poses. Many of the subjects in the pictures appeared either asleep or dead.. Inside the trunk, investigators found a ring binder containing a hand-written list of coded notations.On Trial for Murder p. 188 A search of Kraft's home revealed further incriminating evidence, including clothes and personal possessions of numerous young men who had been murdered over the last decade. Fibers taken from a rug matched those found upon victim Scott Hughes. In addition, the couch in Kraft's living room was identified as being the one in the photographs found in Kraft's car. Scorecard The coded list of 61 neatly printed terms and phrases found in Kraft's car is believed to refer to each of Kraft's victims. Many entries appear innocuous, but each is believed to refer to a specific murder victim or double murder. Several entries clearly refer to victims' names (for example, the entry reading \\"EDM\\" refers to the initials of victim Edward Daniel Moore, whereas \\"Vince M\\" refers to victim Vincent Mestas). In other instances, entries indicate torture or mutilation inflicted upon victims' bodies and/or places they were last seen. The entry \\"Marine Head BP\\", for example, is believed to refer to victim Mark Marsh; a Marine found decapitated having last been seen hitchhiking towards Buena Park. Other entries simply refer to body dump locations; the entry \\"Golden Sails\\", for example, refers to the fact the body of Craig Jonaitis was found in the parking lot of the Golden Sails Hotel. The list also contains entries indicating a minimum of four double murders: \\"GR2\\" (victims Dennis Alt and Christopher Schoenborn, last seen in Grand Rapids); \\"2 in 1 Beach\\" (victims Geoffrey Nelson and Rodger DeVaul); \\"2 in 1 Hitch\\" and \\"2 in 1 MV to PL\\" (neither entry of which has been linked to any double murder or disappearance). Investigators contend that two victims of whose murders Kraft was convicted (Church and Gambrel) are not listed on Kraft's scorecard. However, since the list is in code, the possibility exists that Church in particular is actually included on the scorecard as an entry which investigators cannot recognize as referring to him. Gambrel may also be included on the list, although as Kraft was arrested while he attempted to dispose of the body, he may not have recorded an entry referring to Gambrel on his scorecard. These possibilities indicate the scorecard lists a minimum of 65 and possibly a total of 67 victims. The entry upon Kraft's scorecard reading \\"Navy White\\" is believed by investigators to refer to a 17-year-old named James Sean Cox, an apprentice medic stationed at Mather Air Force Base who was last seen on September 29, 1974, hitchhiking near Interstate 5UT San Diego Aug. 14, 2005 and whose body was found several weeks later in Rancho Santa Fe. At the time of his disappearance, Cox was dressed in his white navy uniform. In addition to the color of his uniform, Cox was a blonde youth. A further entry on Kraft's scorecard, simply reading \\"Iowa\\", is believed to refer to an 18-year-old Marine named Oral Alfred Stuart, Jr., who had been born in Iowa; his body was found discarded close to a Long Beach condominium on November 10, 1974. The man had died as a result of blunt force trauma;. his body remained unidentified until March 2012. Investigators note a similar modus operandi in the murder and body disposal of Stuart to that of the victims Kraft is known to have killed. Twenty-two of Kraft's estimated 67 victims remain unrecovered and unidentified. This is due in part to the killings having occurred throughout several states, and with bodies being discarded in varying locations. =Tried victims= On May 16, 1983, Kraft was formally charged with the murder of Gambrel. By September 8, investigators had interviewed over 700 witnesses and had gathered more than 250 physical exhibits which pointed towards Kraft's guilt in a further 15 homicides committed between December 1972 and February 1983.. He was formally charged with these 15 murders‚Äîin addition to two counts of sodomy and one of emasculation‚Äîon this date.. * Edward Moore (20) December 24, 1972 * Kevin Bailey (17) April 9, 1973 * Ronnie Wiebe (20) July 28, 1973 * Keith Crotwell (18) March 29, 1975 * Mark Hall (22) January 1, 1976 * Scott Hughes (18) April 16, 1978 * Roland Young (23) June 11, 1978 * Richard Keith (20) June 19, 1978 * Keith Klingbeil (23) July 6, 1978 * Michael Inderbieten (21) November 18, 1978 * Donald Crisel (20) June 16, 1979 * Robert Loggins (19) August 23, 1980 * Eric Church (21) January 27, 1983 * Rodger DeVaul (20) February 12, 1983 * Geoffrey Nelson (18) February 12, 1983 * Terry Lee Gambrel (25) May 14, 1983. Trial Kraft's trial began on September 26, 1988 in Orange County before Judge Donald A. McCartin. At the trial, almost 160 witnesses were called to testify on behalf of the prosecution and over 1,000 exhibits were introduced as evidence. This evidence included physical evidence such as bloodstains, hair and fiber evidence found at Kraft's Long Beach residence and in his car; fingerprints found upon glass shards recovered from the Hall murder scene; negatives and photographs of victims found hidden inside Kraft's vehicle, which depicted the men either dead, drugged or asleep; the belt used to strangle Gambrel; and the prescription drugs and buck knife found in his vehicle. Other evidence introduced included work and travel records and gasoline receipts which placed Kraft in particular locations where victims had been abducted and/or discarded, and the numerous personal possessions of various murder victims found in Kraft's possession following his arrest. Kraft's defense was primarily one of alibis and alternate suspects: his attorneys dismissed much of the evidence produced as being circumstantial and attempted to portray Kraft as an articulate, hardworking and upstanding member of the community; they did not refute that the 16 men for whose murder their client was tried were murder victims, yet argued that they were \\"victims of someone, but not Randy Kraft.\\" The defense also stated that several of the 16 victims had initially been believed by investigators to have been killed by one of two other serial killers, Patrick Kearney and William Bonin, and argued there was \\"no concrete evidence\\" Kraft had killed any of the victims. The trial lasted a total of thirteen months and would prove to be the most expensive trial in Orange County history.. On April 29, 1989, each side opened their closing arguments, which lasted a total of three days: the prosecution again listing all the physical and circumstantial evidence pointing to Kraft's guilt; the defense arguing as to the circumstantial case put forward by the prosecution that all the murders were linked and accusing the prosecution of \\"glossing over\\" the truth. Following the closing arguments, the jury deliberated for a total of eleven days before reaching their verdict: on May 12, 1989, Kraft was found guilty of sixteen counts of murder, one count of sodomy, and one count of emasculation. (On one additional count of sodomy in relation to victim Rodger DeVaul, Kraft was found not guilty.)On Trial for Murder p. 190 =Penalty phase and sentencing= On June 5, 1989, the same jury reconvened to hear further testimony from the prosecution and defense as to the penalty for Kraft. This phase of Kraft's trial would last until August, and it was at this point at which the prosecution introduced evidence of several additional homicides committed in both Oregon and Michigan which they were certain Kraft had also committed and for which he had not been tried in Orange County. The defense dismissed the prosecution's assertions as being \\"highly speculative\\" and introduced testimony relating to a PET scan conducted on Kraft which, they asserted, revealed abnormalities in the frontal lobes of his brain, therefore reducing his ability to control both his emotions and impulse. The prosecution rebuffed this testimony by stating to the jury: \\"There is nothing wrong with Mr. Kraft's mind other than that he likes killing for sexual satisfaction\\", adding that the fact his family and friends had found it difficult to believe he had committed any murders simply showed \\"what a good salesman he is.\\" On August 11, 1989, the jury rendered a verdict of death. Three months later, on November 29, Judge McCartin formally sentenced Kraft to death. The sentence was upheld by the California Supreme Court on August 9, 2000. Kraft remains on death row at San Quentin State Prison. He continues to deny guilt in any of the homicides for which he is both convicted or suspected of committing. Mug shot of Randy Kraft, taken in 2007 Missing accomplice Both circumstantial and DNA evidence relating to some of Kraft's murders have caused many to strongly suspect that not all of the murders attributed to Kraft were committed by one person. The prosecution believed these inconsistencies could only be explained by the presence of an accomplice. It is contended that Kraft would have had difficulty moving around 200-pound (90 kg) corpses. Dumping them from moving vehicles while alone would also be difficult to do unnoticed. Abrasions and debris found at some of the crime scenes, where bodies had been discarded upon or alongside freeways, indicated that they had been discarded from vehicles traveling at more than 50 miles per hour, and for one individual to perform this act without compromising his driving would be very difficult. Moreover, footprints in the sand close to where the body of John Leras was found at Sunset Beach in 1975 unequivocally indicate two people had carried the youth's body to where it was discarded. In the case of Eric Church, semen samples found on his body were inconsistent with Kraft's blood type, and, while the photographs of the victims found in Kraft's car had to have been processed somewhere, no photo developer ever reported Kraft's morbid images to the police. (Kraft himself had no darkroom expertise or darkroom equipment.) During the trial, members of the prosecution admitted privately that they did not charge Kraft in several murders that they were certain he had committed because of facts relating to the cases which had indicated more than one perpetrator. Although DNA evidence found upon the body of Church was incompatible with Kraft, investigators had found photographs depicting Church in Kraft's car and his distinctive Norelco electric razor was also found in Kraft's house. =Jeff Graves= The prosecution believed Kraft's former lover, Jeff Graves, may have assisted Kraft in several murders. Graves, who had lived with Kraft between 1971 and 1976 (when 16 known murders attributed to Kraft occurred) had been questioned in relation to the Crotwell abduction and murder in 1975, when he verified part of Kraft's statement to police. When questioned further about the incident following Kraft's arrest in 1983, Graves had informed investigators: \\"I'm really not going to pay for it, you know.\\" Graves died of AIDS on July 27, 1987. At the time of his death, police had been preparing to question him further. =Bob Jackson= In January 2000, journalist Dennis McDougal, the author of a 1991 book about Kraft entitled Angel of Darkness, published an article which recounted interviews with a small-time criminal named Bob Jackson, who reportedly confessed to murdering two hitchhikers with Kraft: one in Wyoming in 1975 and another in Colorado in 1976. Authorities in both Colorado and Wyoming were unable to corroborate these claims. Jackson also told McDougal that Kraft's scorecard included only his \\"more memorable\\" murders; in Jackson's opinion, Kraft's total body count stood closer to 100. McDougal reported these allegations to the police and provided tape recordings of the interviews. Detectives interrogated Jackson and eventually persuaded him to enter a mental institution; no murder charges were filed against him due to an absence of direct incriminating evidence.Tucker, BL. The Scorecard Killer: the Randy Kraft Story. CreateSpace (2015), p. 46. Aerial view of San Quentin State Prison, where Kraft remains incarcerated on death row Kraft sued McDougal and the publisher of Angel of Darkness in 1993, seeking $62 million in damages. The suit contended that the book smeared his \\"good name\\", unjustly portrayed him as a \\"sick, twisted man\\", and destroyed his prospects for future employment by ruining his chances of overturning his conviction on appeal.Convicted Serial Killer Files Suit (May 14, 1993). Associated Press report in Lodi News-Sentinel. Retrieved July 13, 2015. The lawsuit was dismissed by the California Supreme Court in June 1994.Newton, M. The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers. Facts on File (2006), p. 149. . Other \\"Freeway Killers\\" Patrick Kearney, a suspect in a series of killings of young men known as the Trash Bag Murders, surrendered to Riverside Police in July 1977. He subsequently confessed to the murders of 28 boys and young men; many of whom he had also discarded alongside freeways in southern California. Although Kraft is also known to have dismembered some of his victims, Kearney invariably killed his victims by shooting them in the temple. In addition, Kearney discarded the majority of his victims' bodies in trash bags. Although primarily known as the Trash Bag Murderer, Kearney is also known as the Freeway Killer. In 1980, William Bonin and four known accomplices were arrested for a series of killings known as the Freeway Murders, which displayed a markedly similar disposal method to those committed by Kraft. Bonin is also known to have tortured his victims, although he never plied his victims with alcohol or drugs. In addition, although he is known to have stabbed some victims' genitalia with a knife and to have stabbed one victim to death, Bonin never mutilated their bodies and almost all of his victims were strangled to death with their own T-shirts. Moreover, the majority of Bonin's victims were younger than those of Kraft, with the age range of his victims being 12 to 19 years..

Unix-like  In a Unix-like operating system any orphaned process will be immediately adopted by the special init system process: the kernel sets the parent to init. This operation is called re-parenting and occurs automatically. Even though technically the process has the \\"init\\" process as its parent, it is still called an orphan process since the process that originally created it no longer exists. In other systems orphaned processes are immediately terminated by the kernel. In modern Linux systems, an orphan process may be reparented to a \\"subreaper\\" process instead of init. A process can be orphaned unintentionally, such as when the parent process terminates or crashes. The process group mechanism in most Unix-like operating systems can be used to help protect against accidental orphaning, where in coordination with the user's shell will try to terminate all the child processes with the \\"hangup\\" signal (SIGHUP), rather than letting them continue to run as orphans. More precisely, as part of job control, when the shell exits, because it is the \\"session leader\\" (its session id equals its process id), the corresponding login session ends, and the shell sends SIGHUP to all its jobs (internal representation of process groups). It is sometimes desirable to intentionally orphan a process, usually to allow a long-running job to complete without further user attention, or to start an indefinitely running service or agent; such processes (without an associated session) are known as daemons, particularly if they are indefinitely running. A low-level approach is to fork twice, running the desired process in the grandchild, and immediately terminating the child. The grandchild process is now orphaned, and is not adopted by its grandparent, but rather by init. Higher-level alternatives circumvent the shell's hangup handling, either telling the child process to ignore SIGHUP (by using nohup), or removing the job from the job table or telling the shell to not send SIGHUP on session end (by using disown in either case). In any event, the session id (process id of the session leader, the shell) does not change, and the process id of the session that has ended is still in use until all orphaned processes either terminate or change session id (by starting a new session via \`setsid(2)\`). To simplify system administration, it is often desirable to use a service wrapper so that processes not designed to be used as services respond correctly to system signals. An alternative to keep processes running without orphaning them is to use a terminal multiplexer and run the processes in a detached session (or a session that becomes detached), so the session is not terminated and the process is not orphaned. A server process is also said to be orphaned when the client that initiated the request unexpectedly crashes after making the request while leaving the server process running. These orphaned processes waste server resources and can potentially leave a server starved for resources. However, there are several solutions to the orphan process problem: # Extermination is the most commonly used technique; in this case the orphan is killed. # Reincarnation is a technique in which machines periodically try to locate the parents of any remote computations; at which point orphaned processes are killed. # Expiration is a technique where each process is allotted a certain amount of time to finish before being killed. If need be a process may \\"ask\\" for more time to finish before the allotted time expires.

History St. Thomas More College (STM), named for St. Thomas More, is the only federated college at the University of Saskatchewan. The college was established by the Basilian Fathers in 1936, on the invitation of the president of the University of Saskatchewan to the Catholic bishop of Saskatoon. The Congregation of St. Basil is a Roman Catholic religious organization of ordained priests with headquarters in Toronto, Ontario. This congregation is different from the Order of St. Basil the Great, which is an Eastern Catholic monastic religious order based in Rome and serving primarily Ukrainian Catholics. The Roman Catholic Basilian Fathers initiated the operation of Catholic colleges associated with non-denominational universities throughout Canada. The college was incorporated by an act of the Legislature of Saskatchewan in 1943, following formal approval by the senate and board of governors of the university. The act was amended in 1972 and 2001. The college is administratively and financially autonomous from the university. It receives direct provincial grants and is accountable to the provincial government. In 2006, the General Council of the Basilian Fathers announced that they will not be making any further appointments of Basilian priests to the college. The St. Thomas More College Amendment Act 2013 was passed in the provincial legislature making the St. Thomas More College Society the sponsor of the college.http://stmcollege.ca/news/2014/historic_transfer.php The passing of that act was the final formal step in the college's transition to the post-Basilian era.http://stmcollege.ca/news/2014/historic_transfer.php The Institute for Stained Glass in Canada has documented the stained glass at St. Thomas More College.stained glass at St Thomas More College http://stainedglasscanada.ca/site.php?site=133 In 2009, the College debuted its mascot, Reagan the Rooster, named after former students' union President, Reagan Seidler. Programs St. Thomas More College is academically integrated within the University of Saskatchewan however St. Thomas More offers a unique vision and mission of Catholic post-secondary education. The college's students receive University of Saskatchewan degrees, as STM, itself, does not grant degrees. The college cooperates with the College of Arts & Science in preparing students for all B.A. and B.Sc. degrees, as well as the B.F.A. and B.Mus. degrees. Students in the College of Arts & Science may register through St. Thomas More College, admission requirements, as well as fees, for both are the same. Enrollment in STM does not restrict choice of program or courses, and students may register with the college even if none of their classes in a given year are taught by the college. The college provides opportunities to explore and to live Christian values but imposes no obligation in this area. The college faculty are members of the faculty of the College of Arts & Science and of the university council. Faculty appointments and promotion require the approval of the university to ensure that St. Thomas More classes are equivalent in standards to other university classes. STM employs full-time tenured, non-tenured, and part-time sessional faculty on its academic staff. The college at present offers classes in these departments of arts and science: Anthropology, Archeology, Catholic Studies, Classical, Medieval & Renaissance Studies, Economics, English, Languages & Linguistics, History, Philosophy, Political Science, Psychology, Religious Studies, Ukrainian, Spanish, and Sociology. Some of these courses are the same as those offered by the corresponding department of the College of Arts & Science, thus having the same course number and title, with the added advantage of having, on average, smaller class sizes. All classes transfer directly to the University of Saskatchewan. Whether the student are registered through STM or not, all students at the University of Saskatchewan studying on campus may take STM courses. St. Thomas More College also offers additional opportunities not otherwise available to students at the University of Saskatchewan. One of these programs is the Community Service Learning (CSL) program in which students can choose to take part in valuable community service and volunteer work as part of some of their courses. This program also helps students to build connections between their community experience and their theoretical (\\"book\\") learning at university. A similar international study abroad experience is offered through the Intercordia program.

He was governor during the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. Early life and career Cowper was born in 1938 in Petersburg, Virginia to Stephanie (n√©e Smith) and Marion Cowper. He was raised in Kinston, North Carolina. He received bachelor's and law degrees from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and after serving in the U.S. Army Medical Corps and Army Reserve, he worked as a maritime lawyer in Norfolk, Virginia for three years. Cowper moved to Fairbanks, Alaska in 1968 and served as assistant district attorney for rural Alaska and Fairbanks. In 1970, Cowper went to Vietnam and worked as a freelance correspondent throughout Asia. Upon returning to Alaska, he wrote a political column for the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, taught a college course on Alaska lands, was a partner in an air taxi and cargo business, and worked as a diver for a University of Alaska marine research team. Political career Cowper during his second term in the Alaska House of Representatives. In 1974, Cowper was elected to the Alaska House of Representatives, where he served two terms.Marie Marmo Mullaney. Biographical Directory of the Governors of the United States, 1988-1994, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1994. pg. 13. During his time in the House, he served as chairman of the Finance Committee (1977‚Äì78), chairman of the Steering Council on Alaska Lands (1978), a member of the Subsistence Committee (1977‚Äì78), and a member of the Alaska Advisory Committee for the Law of the Sea Conference (1978). In 1982, Cowper ran for governor, but narrowly lost the Democratic nomination to Bill Sheffield, who went on to win the general election. =Governor of Alaska (1986‚Äì1990)= Cowper ran for governor again in 1986, and defeated incumbent Sheffield in the August 26 primary by a 2‚Äì1 margin. He eventually won the November 4 general election, winning 47% of the vote against Republican Arliss Sturgulewski and Alaskan Independence Party candidate Joe Vogler. Once in office, Cowper proposed reestablishing the state income tax to help close the state's billion-dollar deficit; this proposal was met with strong opposition. He advocated the expansion of the University of Alaska's international study program, hoped to establish an International Trade Center, and placed emphasis on the teaching of foreign languages and culture in state schools. In early 1989, he announced that he would not seek reelection in 1990, a decision considered a surprise by some observers. Post-governorship After serving as governor, Cowper served as a visiting fellow at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in 1991, and was a Co-Chairman of the Pacific Rim Fisheries Conference in 1994 and 1997. Since 1991, he has been the CEO of Steve Cowper & Associates, a group that advises companies and governments on energy-related initiatives. He has also served on the boards of multiple energy-related companies in the US and Canada. As of 2010, Cowper lived in Austin, Texas with his third wife and family.

Morris Fuller Benton (November 30, 1872 - June 30, 1948) was an American typeface designer who headed the design department of the American Type Founders (ATF), for which he was the chief type designer from 1900 to 1937. Many of Benton's designs, such as his large family of related sans-serif or \\"gothic\\" typefaces, including Alternate Gothic, Franklin Gothic, and News Gothic, are still in everyday use. Typefaces Benton is credited as America's most prolific designer of metal type, having (with his team) completed 221 typefaces, including revivals of historical models, like Bodoni and Cloister; original designs, such as Hobo, Bank Gothic, and Broadway; and adding new weights to existing faces, such as Century, Goudy Old Style and Cheltenham. Although he did not invent the concept, Benton working at ATF pioneered the concept of families of typeface designs, allowing consistency of appearance in different sizes, widths and weights. This allowed ATF to capitalise on a successful typeface's popularity and facilitated coherent layout and graphic design; its 1923 specimen book described its approach of creating families which could allow advertisers to \\"talk at command with varying emphasis and orchestral power [rather than using] a medley of display types.\\" Benton worked as the team leader of designers responsible for creating a basic design and then adapting it to different sizes and weights. He considered his work as a designer important and wrote a brief list of typefaces he considered his most important work in 1936, shortly before his retirement. Benton was relatively retiring in life: a 1936 interview described him as \\"one of the most difficult men to interview I have ever talked to...try to pin some honour on him, or give him credit for some achievement, and he will modestly sidestep with the remark that ‚ÄòLady Luck helped me a lot there!‚Äô\\" Technology In addition to his strong aesthetic design sense, Benton was a master of the technology of his day. He read mechanical engineering at Cornell University, graduating in 1896. His father, Linn Boyd Benton, invented the pantographic engraving machine, which was capable not only of scaling a single font design pattern to a variety of sizes while compensating for the size change, but could also condense, extend, and slant the design (mathematically, these are cases of affine transformation, which is the fundamental geometric operation of most systems of digital typography today, including PostScript). Morris used these machines with his father at ATF, during which these machines were refined to an impressive level of precision. Theo Rehak, the current owner of much ATF typecasting equipment, and author of the definitive treatise Practical Typecasting, explains that the Bentons demanded that any deviation in machining or casting be within two ten-thousandths of an inch. Most modern machine shops are equipped to measure down to one thousandth of an inch. As an advertising device, in 1922 ATF manufactured a piece of type eight points tall (0.11 inch) containing the entire Lord's Prayer in 13 lines of text, using a cutting tool roughly equivalent to a 2000-dpi printer.

It was founded in 1988 and is now owned by Sentinel Capital Partners. As of 2016, there are 217 Fazoli's located nationwide. The restaurant chain specializes in Italian-American cuisine and dishes. Carl Howard is the company's president and CEO. Fazoli's in Valdosta, Georgia History In 1988, the concept of the casual Italian-American dinner, Fazoli's, was set. Two years later, the Fazoli's system was established. Fazoli's started with five locations in the Lexington, Kentucky, area. Fazoli's was originally managed by Jerrico Inc. but later was put up for sale and sold to Duskin Co. Ltd so that Jerrico Inc. could focus on Long John Silver's. Duskin Co. Ltd later formed Seed Restaurant Group with the help of Entrepreneur Kuni Toyoda. Once Kuni Toyoda and Duskin Co. Ltd formed Seed Restaurant Group, this group began its ownership of the Fazoli's system. During the mid-1990s, the chain expanded rapidly. By 1992, it had grown to include 35 restaurants within Kentucky, Indiana, and Florida. This almost doubled in 1993 when Fazoli's added 25 more locations. During this time, the operations of Fazoli's increased from $500,000 per restaurant per year in total volume to $1 million per restaurant per year in total volume within five years. This rapid financial success made the expansion of Fazoli's easy and with the start-up cost ranging from $150,000 to $500,000 most locations were able to turn a profit within the first year of opening. In October 2006, Seed Restaurant Group sold the company to Sun Capital Partners for an undisclosed amount. At the time of the sale, Fazoli's had a total of 319 locations, 179 of which were franchised, in 32 states. As part of the deal, Sun Capital replaced Toyoda with McDonald's veteran Robert Weissmueller as Fazoli's president and chief executive officer. In June 2008, Weissmueller retired and was replaced with Carl Howard. When Howard took over, the company was suffering from declining sales and massive store closing as a result of severe cost-cutting measures which were implemented by the previous management. The number of restaurants had been steadily declining after reaching a peak of 400 locations in 2004. In July 2008, a struggling franchisee in Arizona announced that it was closing all 13 of its Fazoli's restaurants in the state. In July 2015, Sun Capital Partners sold the chain to Sentinel Capital Partners for an undisclosed amount. At the time of the sale, Fazoli's had 124 company-owned and 89 franchised locations in 26 states. Fazoli's in Traverse City, Michigan (this location closed in 2018) The company's sole remaining location in Southern Nevada closed in 2016 after 15 years of operation. Corporate overview Fazoli's restaurants operates in 26 states and has more than 200 restaurants. Fazoli's plans to expand overseas to Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman. Fazoli's made a deal with the World Franchise Associates that assures them the ability to build restaurants in those locations. Fazoli's also opened its first college campus location at the Texas Tech University in 2014. The expansion onto the TTU campus is part of the plan to grow the company via non-traditional locations. Corporate headquarters are located on Palumbo Drive in Lexington. Carl Howard has been Chief Executive Office and president since June 2008. Products During the early years before the help of Kuni Toyoda, Fazoli's main product was pizza. Toyoda realized that it was not feasible for Fazoli's to compete with the large pizza chains and the menu needed to focus on pasta. With this switch, the pasta recipes quickly needed to be upgraded. Toyoda spearheaded changes to make the pasta firmer and create larger portions. In the early 2000s, low- carbohydrate diets became popular, decreasing sales and forcing Fazoli's to rethink its menu again. In 2004, the company added eight menu items with 8 grams of fat or less and also added items featuring more vegetables and protein. The company later hired Elizabeth Somer to help with the development of low-calorie and healthy dishes. In 2005, Fazoli's announced that there would no longer be trans fat in its bread sticks. In 2017, Fazoli's announced the launch of its first app-based loyalty program with mobile ordering capabilities. Today, Fazoli's menu does not consist of classic Italian dishes, but of Italian-American dishes, baked pastas, their signature Submarinos sandwiches, and other foods, such as: * Twice Baked Lasagna * Chicken Parmigiano * Italian Deli Trio * Seasonal salads * Meatball da Vinci * The Primo Italiano * Cheese or Pepperoni Pizza * New York Style Cheesecake * Baked Spaghetti * Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo Catering Fazoli's provides catering for any event in participating locations. The catering menu offers Group Meal Deals, Fresh Made Pastas, Oven Baked Pastas, Fresh Chopped Salads, Box Lunches, and much more. There is also a full-service option that includes table service, plates, and plastic ware. Catering may be ordered online or in store and are available for pick-up or delivery in certain locations.

In December 1958 Time magazine praised the translation of Maria Dermo√ªt's The Ten Thousand Things, and named it one of the best books of the year. Whitney Balliett of The New Yorker wrote: > \\"Mrs. Dermout, in the manner of Thoreau and the early Hemingway, is an > extraordinary sensualist. [...] in passages of a startling, unadorned, > three-dimensional clarity; often one can almost touch what she describes.\\" > New York Review Books website. Retrieved 26 October 2011 Biography Dermo√ªt was a Dutch novelist born in Pati, Java, Dutch East Indies, and educated in the Netherlands, who wrote in Dutch. After completing her education she returned to Java, where she married and travelled extensively across Java and the Moluccas with her husband. In 1933 her husband was pensioned, and the couple returned to the Netherlands. Maria Dermo√ªt was widowed in 1952. Dermo√ªt died in The Hague in 1962. She is the subject of the biography Geheim Indi√´. Het leven van Maria Dermo√ªt 1888-1962 (\\"The Secret East Indies. The Life of Maria Dermo√ªt 1888-1962\\") in 2000 by the Indo- European (Dutch-Indonesian) author Kester Freriks. Body of work Dermo√ªt turned to writing early in life, but remained largely unpublished until she was 63. She wrote two novels, both of which were not published until she was in her sixties: The Ten Thousand Things (De tienduizend dingen, 1955) and Days Before Yesterday ‚Äî also published as Just Yesterday (Nog pas gisteren, 1951).Encyclop√¶dia Britannica \\"Her first two novels, Nog pas gisteren (1951; Yesterday) and De tienduizend dingen (1955; The Ten Thousand Things), are fictionalized accounts of her youth. Although written in an economic style, the two novels are rich in details of island life as experienced by both the colonials and the native people\\" There are English translations of her novels by Hans Koning. Some of her short stories were published in translation in magazines such as Vogue during the 1960s. In Dutch, five short-story collections by her were also published. She is viewed as one of the giants among Dutch-Indies literary writers, and The Ten Thousand Things in particular is widely regarded as an idiosyncratic masterpiece. The book has been translated into thirteen languages. As Hans Koning puts it in his Introduction to the New York Review Books edition of the novel: > \\"Dermo√ªt was sui generis, a case all her own. She did not write about her > Indies as a Dutch woman, or as a Javanese or an Ambonese. Hers was a near- > compassionate disdain for the dividing lines, the hatreds and the fears ... > She painted landscapes, still lifes and people in a world of myth and > mystery.\\" Although not conventionally autobiographical, both of her novels draw from Dermo√ªt's own life. In particular, like the central character in The Ten Thousand Things, Dermo√ªt lost her son in violent circumstances (he died in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp). The Javanese childhood experiences and reminiscences described in Days Before Yesterday are based on, but do not mirror, her own childhood in the tropics. Grave headstone Author Oek de Jong appropriately wrote: > \\"Still, Maria Dermo√ªt an author for the happy few. Is she a writer's writer? > Certainly not. She is a storyteller par excellence. Her stories are subtle, > but they are also accessible. Nonetheless she remains an author for the > happy few, equal to the greats of Dutch prose, but much less known than they > are.

Founded in October 1898 by Abbot Bernard Pennings, a Norbertine priest and educator, the school was named after Saint Norbert of Xanten. In 1952, the college became coeducational. , the school's enrollment is 2,165 students. History St. Norbert College was established when Abbot Bernard Pennings, a Dutch immigrant priest from the Premonstratensian Berne Abbey of Heeswijk, the Netherlands, founded the college to train young men for the priesthood. Frances I. Van Dyke, a seminarian, was the first and, at the time, the only student. St. Norbert is the first and only institution of higher learning in the world sponsored by the Premonstratensian order. Abbot Pennings later started a commerce program at the college for lay students before retiring in 1955. St. Norbert's second president, the Rev. Dennis Burke, expanded the college, anticipating the student population would eventually reach 2,000. Robert Christin, who became president in 1968, implemented the current course system and the academic divisional structure. In 1973, Neil Webb, a former faculty member and vice president, became president. Webb established the first permanent endowment for the school. Serving as the college's president from 1983 to 2000, Thomas Manion led the expansion of facilities and the development of additional academic programs. Enrollment topped 2,000. Thomas Kunkel, former dean of the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland, College Park, became the seventh president of the college in 2008. Since then, the college has constructed the Mulva Family Fitness & Sports Center, the Gehl- Mulva Science Center, the Cassandra Voss Center, Michels Commons, Schneider Stadium, the Mulva Library, Gries Hall, Ariens Family Welcome Center and Todd Wehr Hall. Brian J. Bruess, a 1990 graduate of St. Norbert College and former executive vice president and chief operating officer of St. Catherine University in St. Paul, Minnesota, became president in 2017. Although he announced on November 1, 2019, that he would not continue in his position as president after the end of the 2019-2020 academic year, uproar from the college community led to further discussion between Bruess and the SNC Board of Trustees that resulted in a multiyear contract. Four members of the board, including the chair, resigned shortly thereafter. Academics St. Norbert College offers undergraduate programs in more than 40 areas of study, leading to a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Music, or Bachelor of Business Administration degree. A Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree is also offered through a joint effort with the Bellin College of Nursing. The most popular undergraduate majors are Business Administration, Biology and Education. In addition to its undergraduate offerings, St. Norbert College offers three masters-level graduate programs in business administration, theological studies and liberal studies. The Master of Theological Studies department hosts a branch program in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Program studies take place at the Norbertine Abbey of Santa Maria de la Vid in Albuquerque. Students on that campus can earn the full MTS degree. In the fall of 2015, the college began offering an MBA program through its new Donald J. Schneider School of Business & Economics. The Medical College of Wisconsin's Green Bay campus, which serves the northeast Wisconsin region, is located in the new Gehl-Mulva Science Center at St. Norbert. In 2019, Norbert was ranked 145th among \\"National Liberal Arts Colleges\\" by U.S. News & World Report. The college is also ranked 118th among \\"Liberal Arts Universities\\" in Forbes's 2019 list of America's Best Colleges. Mulva Library provides digital and in- person reference services; hosts the Digital Commons, an institutional repository of documents, media, and other materials online; and provides a makerspace with technologies for the academic community. It is the home of the Center for Norbertine Studies, the international center of research on the Premonstratensians and Norbertines. The library also holds the college archives. Campus The campus consists of , much of which borders the Fox River. Students typically walk to classes, even in the winter. The many trees and statues on campus provide a scenic view, especially in fall, when the foliage changes colors. Directly behind the Campus Center is a pavilion and marina where St. Norbert hosts a picnic for students to kick off the school year. This shoreline area is also the venue for a free summer concert series, open to the community. Important social buildings include the Ray Van Den Heuvel Family Campus Center (Campus Center), which includes a fitness center, gymnasium, and diner (Phil‚Äôs Diner) and a reading lounge with a picturesque view overlooking the Fox River. There is also an events hall for movies and public speakers. Special events put on by student groups are also held there, such as comedian appearances and awareness speeches. Old St. Joseph's Church contains a statue/shrine of Saint Joseph that was crowned by Pope Leo XIII in 1891. Novena devotions are held on Wednesday. Much of the campus is located in what is now the St. Norbert College Historic District. Student life Gries Hall =Student housing= More than 75% of students live on campus in residence halls, apartments and townhouses. St. Norbert requires all traditional undergraduate students not registered as commuters to live on campus. Freshman housing includes three traditional residence hall options: Madelaine-Lorraine Hall (co-ed), Sensenbrenner Hall (Co-ed), and Bergstrom Hall (co-ed Honors students). Campus housing options for sophomores include Mary Minahan McCormick Hall, Michels Hall, and Victor McCormick Hall. Upperclassmen enjoy single person dorm rooms such as Burke Hall, the Townhouses and Carriage House (apartment-like housing), college-owned houses and college-owned apartments, including Gries, Xanten and Pr√©montr√© Halls. Involvement fair =Student involvement= There are more than 100 registered student clubs and organizations on campus. St. Norbert encourages its students to become involved in their community through community service and by participating in one of the 15 fraternities, sororities, and independent social groups. The school also has 8 National Honor Society chapters, two student publications, and eight musical and performance ensembles. A major activity for St. Norbert students participate in is the annual \\"Into The Streets\\" community service project that provides service to organizations in De Pere and neighboring communities. This event is staffed by first-year students, staff and faculty, and is part of the First Year Experience program. =Greek life= Greek life at St. Norbert includes four sororities and three fraternities, as well as two Greek governing groups. Greek groups sponsor fund-raising activities, food drives, and benefits to support charities. Greek groups collectively completed a total of 2,117 hours of service and raised $9,638 for their respective philanthropies during the 2015-16 school year. Fraternities There are three fraternities on the St. Norbert campus: Kappa Sigma (ŒöŒ£), Phi Delta Theta (Œ¶ŒîŒò), and Tau Kappa Epsilon (Œ§ŒöŒï).

(\\"Plenty\\"),Sarolta A. Tak√°cs, Vestal Virgins, Sibyls, and Matrons: Women in Roman Religion (University of Texas Press, 2008), p. 56. also known as Opis, a goddess of agricultural resources and wealth. The festival marked the end of harvest, with a mirror festival on December 19 concerned with the storage of the grain.J. Rufus Fears, \\"The Cult of Virtues and Roman Imperial Ideology,\\" Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt II.17.2 (1981), p. 838. The Latin word consivia (or consiva) derives from conserere (\\"to sow\\"). Opis was deemed a chthonic (underworld, inside the earth) goddess who made the vegetation grow. Since her abode was inside the earth, Ops was invoked by her worshipers while sitting, with their hands touching the ground, according to Macrobius (Saturnalia, I:10). Although Ops is a consort of Saturn, she was closely associated with Consus, the protector of grains and subterranean storage bins (silos). Consus is therefore thought to be an alternate name of Saturn in the chthonic aspect as consort. The festival of Consus, the Consualia, was celebrated twice a year, each time preceding that of Ops: once on August 21, after the harvest, and once on December 15, after the sowing of crops was finished. The Opiconsivia festival was superintended by the Vestals and the Flamines of Quirinus, an early Sabine god said to be the deified Romulus. Quirinus was absorbed by, and included in, the first and earliest Capitoline Triad, along with Mars‚Äîthen an agriculture god‚Äîand Jupiter. The main priestess at the regia wore a white veil, characteristic of the vestal virgins. A chariot race was performed in the Circus Maximus. Horses and mules, their heads crowned with chaplets made of flowers, also took part in the celebration. References H. H.

It is the opposite of a diminutive. Overaugmenting something often makes it grotesque and so in some languages, augmentatives are used primarily for comical effect or as pejoratives. Many languages have augmentatives for nouns, and some have augmentatives for verbs.  Germanic languages  = English = In modern English, augmentatives can be created with the prefixes: *over-: e.g., overlord and overqualified. *grand-: e.g., grandmaster and grandparent. *super-: e.g., supermarket and superpower. *mega-: e.g., megastore and megastar. *arch-: e.g., archrival and archangel. Since the early 1990s, the prefix √ºber- or uber- has also frequently been used as a borrowing from German. The suffix -zilla, expressing a monstrous quality, can also be considered an augmentative form. In some parts of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, the prefix \\"auld\\" is used as an augmentative, and a pejorative in some cases. An example of this is using \\"auld'un\\" or \\"auld one\\" to describe one's parents/grandparents. = Dutch = In modern Dutch, augmentatives are usually created with the prefixes: *over-: e.g., overgewicht and oververhitting (\\"overweight\\" and \\"overheating\\") *groot-: e.g., grootmeester and groothandel (\\"grandmaster\\" and \\"wholesaler\\") *super-: e.g., supermarkt and supermacht (\\"supermarket\\" and \\"superpower\\"). *mega-: e.g., megacontract and megabioscoop (\\"a very big contract\\" and \\"a very large movie theater\\") There are also prefixes that can be used for some adjectives: *bloed-: e.g., bloedmooi and bloedeigen (\\"very beautiful\\" and \\"very own\\")Note that Dutch bloed- is unrelated to English bloody. The former is formed in analogy with bloedeigen ('very own'), bloedrood ('very red'), etc. wherein it originally had its proper meaning 'blood' ('of your own blood', and 'blood red') whereas the latter's origin is uncertain but according to the OED might refer to the habits of the aristocracy (those of the blood): bloody drunk. *steen-: e.g., steenrijk and steengoed (\\"very rich\\" and \\"very good\\"; lit. \\"stone rich\\" and \\"stone good\\") *kei-: e.g., keihard and keileuk (\\"very fast/hard/etc.\\" and \\"very fun\\", lit. \\"boulder hard\\" and \\"boulder fun\\") = German = In German, there are different ways to build augmentatives. They are rarely used prefixes: *un-, for instance in Unzahl \\"huge number\\", Unsumme \\"huge sum\\", Unmenge \\"huge quantity\\". Mostly used for negation, however (e.g. Ungl√ºck \\"bad luck\\", Unsinn \\"nonsense\\"), and occasionally in a pejorative sense (Unwetter \\"bad weather\\", Untier \\"monster\\", lit. \\"un-creature\\"). * ur-, for instance, uralt \\"ancient\\" * √ºber-, for instance, √úbermensch (q.v.) * aber-, for instance, abertausend \\"thousands\\". * mega-, for example megageil \\"mega- cool\\" * ultra-, for example ultracool * voll-, for example Vollpfosten \\"idiot\\", lit. \\"total post\\" = Swedish = In Swedish the way to build augmentative is to add one of many prefixes before the word. This can be done on words in most word classes. The most common prefixes are: j√§tte- \\"giant\\", bauta-, mega-. For example: *hus \\"house\\" ‚Üí megahus \\"gigantic house\\" *snabb \\"fast\\" ‚Üí j√§ttesnabb \\"very fast\\" *sten \\"rock\\" ‚Üí bautasten \\"boulder\\" There are many synonyms to j√§tte-, although only when j√§tte- means \\"very\\", not big. Some of these synonyms are: as-, g√∂r-, svin-, skit-, and ur- although, as written above, these do not change the size of a noun but just change e.g. gul \\"yellow\\" to j√§ttegul \\"very yellow\\". The use of prefixes to build augmentatives is quite colloquial and is seldom used in formal text and speech, where adjectives and adverbs are used instead.  Greek language  In Modern Greek the usage of augmentative is very common in everyday speech but not quite as common as diminutive forms. The usage of Augmentative is considered colloquial and it is not present at all in formal speech. There are a variety of augmentative suffixes Fem. -Œ±, -Œ¨œÅŒ±, -Œ¨Œ∫ŒªŒ± Masc. -Œ±œÅŒ¨œÇ, ŒÑ-Œ±œÅŒøœÇ,-Œ±Œ∫ŒªŒ¨œÇ, -Œ±Œ∫ŒªŒ±œÇ Most nouns in their augmentative form are feminine. This means neuter and masculine nouns become feminine and then an augmentative suffix is added. Eg.Œü œÄŒ±ŒØœáœÑŒ∑œÇ-> The player(masc). Œü œÄŒ±ŒπœáœÑŒ±œÅŒ¨œÇ -> The great player(masc.) (Could also be Œ∑ œÄŒ±ŒπœáœÑŒ¨œÅŒ± (fem.)) Eg. (Œó) Œ∫ŒøœçŒ∫ŒªŒ± -> beautiful woman (Œó) Œ∫ŒøœÖŒ∫ŒªŒ¨œÅŒ± -> Very beautiful woman In some neuter cases just changing the original gender of the noun is enough for augmentation to take place Eg. Œ§Œø œÉœÄŒ±Œ∏ŒØ -> The sword Œó œÉœÄŒ¨Œ∏Œ± -> The great sword  Romance languages  = Italian = Italian has several augmentatives: * -one, -ona, found also in several English loanwords from Italian, often via French:Oxford English Dictionary, 3rd edition, s.v. -oon minestrone (< minestra 'soup'); provolone cheese (< provola 'a kind of cheese'); cartone (< carta 'paper') appears in English carton and cartoon; balloon (this may have been formed in Italian, though the usual form is pallone, or in French)Oxford English Dictionary, s.v. balloon); milione 'million' (< mille 'thousand'); Suffixes -accio, -accia, and -astro, -astra, also exist, but they are used to form pejorative words, with no properly augmentative meaning: coltellaccio (< coltello 'knife'; gives English cutlass); the family name Carpaccio. = Portuguese = In Portuguese, the most common augmentatives are the masculine -√£o (sometimes also -z√£o or -zarr√£o) and the feminine -ona (or -zona), although there are others, less frequently used. E.g. carro \\"car\\", carr√£o \\"big car\\"; homem \\"man\\", homenzarr√£o \\"big man\\"; mulher \\"woman\\", mulherona \\"big woman\\". Sometimes, especially in Brazilian Portuguese, the masculine augmentative can be applied to a feminine noun, which then becomes grammatically masculine, but with a feminine meaning (e.g. \\"o mulher√£o\\" instead of \\"a mulherona\\" for \\"the big woman\\"); however, such cases usually imply subtle meaning twists, mostly with a somewhat gross or vulgar undertone (which, nonetheless, is often intentional, for the sake of wit, malice or otherwise; so, mulher√£o actually means not a big woman, but a particularly sexy one). = Romanian = In Romanian there are several augmentative suffixes: -oi/-oaie, -an/-anƒÉ etc. (masculine/feminine pairs). They originate from Latin -≈ç (acc. sg. -≈çnem), the origin of the other Romance augmentative suffixes. The archaic form has survived unchanged in Banat (and in Aromanian) as -on', -oan'e. As in other Romance languages, a feminine base word may have masculine or feminine forms in the augmentative. Examples: * casƒÉ (f.) ‚Üí cƒÉsoi (n.), cƒÉsoaie (f.) * piatrƒÉ (f.) ‚Üí pietroi (n.) * bƒÉiat (m.) ‚Üí bƒÉie≈£oi (m.) * bƒÉiat (m.) ‚Üí bƒÉietan (m.) * fatƒÉ (f.) ‚Üí feti»ôcanƒÉ (f.) = Spanish = In Spanish, -o becomes -√≥n and -a becomes -ona most frequently, but -ote/-ota and -azo/-aza (also meaning -blow) are also commonly seen. Others include -udo/-uda, -aco/-aca, -acho/-acha, -uco/-uca, -ucho/-ucha, -astro/-astra and -ejo/-eja. More detail at Spanish nouns. Slavic languages =Bulgarian= In Bulgarian, as in Russian, mainly with -–∏—â–µ. =Polish= In Polish there is a variety of augmentatives formed with suffixes, for example: ≈ºaba (a frog) ‚Üí ≈ºabucha / ≈ºabsko / ≈ºabisko / ≈ºabula; or kamie≈Ñ (a stone) ‚Üí kamulec / kamior / etc. =Russian= In Russian there is a variety of augmentatives formed with prefixes (including loans from Latin) and suffixes, including -–∏—â–µ and -–∏–Ω for example: –¥–æ–º (the house) –¥–æ–º–∏—â–µ (great house) –¥–æ–º–∏–Ω–∞ (huge house). To provide an impression of excessive qualities the suffix -–≥–∞ can be used for example: –≤–µ—Ç–µ—Ä (the wind), –≤–µ—Ç—Ä—é–≥–∞ (strong wind). =Croatian and Serbian= In Croatian and Serbian there is a variety of augmentative nouns formed with suffixes: * -ina, e.g. brdo, n. (\\"hill\\") + ina ‚Üí brdina * -ƒçina, e.g. majmun, m. (\\"monkey\\") + ƒçina ‚Üí majmunƒçina * -etina, e.g. kuƒáa, f. (\\"house\\") + etina ‚Üí kuƒáetina * -erina, e.g. kuƒáa + erina ‚Üí kuƒáerina * -urina, e.g. ptica, f. (\\"bird\\") + urina ‚Üí ptiƒçurina * -e≈°ina, e.g. glava, f. (\\"head\\") + e≈°ina ‚Üí glave≈°ina * -u≈°tina, e.g. bara, f. (\\"pond\\") + u≈°tina ‚Üí baru≈°tina * -u≈°ina, e.g. pijetao, m. (\\"rooster\\") + u≈°ina ‚Üí pjetlu≈°ina Augmentative nouns are either pejoratives, although distinct pejorative suffixes also exist. All augmentative nouns have female grammatical gender. Some nouns can have their augmentatives formed with different suffixes, for example, see 'kuƒáa' above. In Hrvatska gramatika, Bariƒá et al. do not classify adjectives formed with suffixes which intensify an action or property as augmentatives. The augmentative prefixes for adjectives listed in Hrvatska gramatika are pre- (\\"excessively\\"; or excess of a favorable property), hiper- (\\"hyper-\\"), super- and ultra-. According to Hrvatska enciklopedija, augmentative verbs surpass their base verb with their intensity. However, by defining augmentative verbs as an action done excessively, Hrvatska gramatika only lists pre- (\\"over-\\") as an augmentative verb. Semitic languages =Arabic= Form II of the Arabic verb often has an augmentative sense, which may indicate intensity (intensive) or repetition (frequentative).Mark W. Cowell, A Reference Grammar of Syrian Arabic. Georgetown University Press, 2005. . p. 253 Bantu languages Bantu languages' noun class markers often double as augmentative and diminutive markers, and some have separate classes that are used only as a augmentative or a diminutive. =Chichewa= Chichewa noun class 7 prefix chi- doubles up as augmentative marker. For example, chindege which is a huge plane as opposed to ndege which is just a regular plane. International auxiliary languages = Esperanto = In Esperanto, the -- suffix is included before the final part-of-speech vowel. For example, domo (house) becomes domego (mansion). See Esperanto vocabulary. = Interlingua = Interlingua does not have an augmentative suffix, but international prefixes such as super-, hyper-, mega- can be used as augmentatives. See also Interlingua grammar.

History =Foundation and location= Amilcar was founded in July 1921 by Joseph Lamy and Emile Akar. The name \\"Amilcar\\" was an imperfect anagram of the partners' names. The business was established at 34 rue du Chemin-Vert in the 11th arrondissement of Paris. However, Amilcar quickly outgrew their restricted city-centre premises, and during the middle part of 1924 the company relocated to Saint-Denis on the northern edge of the city. =Early years= The original Amilcar was a small cyclecar. Designed by Jules Salomon and Edmond Moyet, it bore a striking resemblance to the pre-war Le Z√®bre. The vehicle was first exhibited at the Paris Motor Show in October 1921. The business was a leading beneficiary of a cyclecar boom, prompted by a government initiative which held out the promise of a reduced rate of annual car tax, fixed at 100 francs per year, for powered vehicles weighing no more than 350 kg (dry weight, without fuel or water or such extras as a spare tyre/wheel), providing seating for no more than two people and powered by an engine of not more than 1100cc. Once a vehicle exceeded these limits it ceased to be a cyclecar and was instead officially designated a voiturette. The 4-cylinder 903cc Amilcar CC appeared in 1922, with a wheelbase of just . The CC subsequently became available in two further versions; the Amilcar C4 was a slightly longer sports car, while the CS, introduced in 1924, was a brisker sports version with the engine size increased to 1004 cc. The side-valve engine had splash lubrication, and came with a three-speed gearbox. The most famous model of all was the CGS \\"Grand Sport\\" of 1924; this featured a 1074 cc sv engine and four-wheel brakes. This in turn evolved into the more sporty CGSS \\"Grand Sport Surbaiss√©\\". These models were built under license in Germany (as the Pluto) and in Austria (as the Grofri) and in Italy (as Amilcar Italiana). The marque entered automobile racing in the mid-1920s with a batch of supercharged dohc 1100 cc six-cylinder cars that used a roller bearing crankshaft in the full racing version; these vehicles were also available with plain metal bearings, driven by famous race driver Andr√© Morel. Amilcar Racer =Financial challenges and the loss of independence= During the later 1920s the company expanded out of its original comfort zone of small economical cars: the results were mixed. The founders, Akar and Lamy, becoming less involved with the management of the business, were persuaded to conclude, in 1931, a business agreement with Andr√© Bri√®s and Marcel S√©e. S√©e already knew Amilcar from the inside, having in January 1929 been dismissed from a position involved in management of the company. The early 1930s were years of economic crisis in France, and at the end of 1933 a company owned by Bri√®s and S√©e, called \\"Sofia\\" (Societe financiere pour l'automobile), took effective control of Amilcar, which nevertheless continued to function under its existing name. Amilcar M2 (1932) Amilcar P√©gase (1935) Amilcar Compound (ca 1939) Amilcar Compound From 1928 the company offered a light touring car; called the \\"M-Type\\", it featured a side-valve 1200 cc engine and was launched in 1928. It was followed by the M2, M3, and M4 versions. The M-type and its successors continued to be produced through the ensuing years of financial difficulty, offered for sale till 1935, though production probably ended in 1934. 1928 saw the introduction of a straight eight, which was built with an ohc 2.3-liter engine. This, the C8, proved unreliable, and soon disappeared with only a few hundred produced. The acquisition of Amilcar by \\"Sofia\\" in 1933 did not in itself resolve the financial pressures. At the end of August 1934, still faced with disappointing sales volumes, the factory at Saint-Denis closed for the last time, as management struggled to save the business. A new model was clearly needed and in October 1934 the company presented the new 2-litre (12CV) Amilcar P√©gase powered by a 4-cylinder ohv 2150 cc engine supplied by Delahaye. There was also a competition version of the P√©gase with a 2490 cc (14CV) engine. By October 1935, the smaller Amilcar models having been discontinued, the P√©gase, produced under much reduced circumstances at premises in Boulogne-Billancourt, was the only Amilcar model listed. =Another change of control= Recognising the impossibility of sustaining the Amilcar business with a single model, but unsure of how to finance or produce another, management turned to Hotchkiss which had recently taken a large shareholding in \\"Sofia\\", Amilcar's holding company. Hotchkiss had problems of their own at this time, their hugely lucrative armaments business having recently been nationalised by the left-wing Blum government, while their middle-market automobile business was under increasing pressure as volume automakers became more effective in pushing their own ranges upmarket with models such as the Peugeot 402 and the Citro√´n Traction. Henry Mann Ainsworth, the Automobile Director at Hotchkiss, had already been presented, by the high-profile engineer Jean-Albert Gr√©goire, with a promising prototype (at that stage based on an Adler chassis) for a lightweight 7CV category, small, technically advanced family car. It was agreed that the automotive businesses of Hotchkiss and Amilcar would be merged and the prototype would be developed into an Amilcar model that would become the Amilcar Compound. The front-wheel-drive Amilcar Compound was technically advanced in design for its era, featuring a monocoque frame made of a light alloy and independent suspension all around. Its engine at launch was a four-cylinder side-valve unit of 1185 cc. The Compound's ambitious use of aluminium in its body structure, and its front-wheel-drive configuration, meant that production got off to a slow start, and although it was launched in October 1937, 584 of the 681 passenger cars produced date only from 1939, with a further 64 produced during the early months of 1940, before the German invasion of May/June 1940 effectively ended civilian automobile production in the Paris region. Production prototypes for an upgraded Compound with an OHV 1340 cc engine were running by the summer of 1939, and this version was scheduled for an October launch at the 1939 Paris Motor Show, but the motor show was cancelled and the launch was postponed ‚Äì as matters turned out indefinitely ‚Äì due to the intervention of war which France (and Britain) declared against Germany in early September 1939. Production of the Amilcar was not resumed after World War II.  List of important Amilcar models  1921 Amilcar CC racecar.

It is about Isra and the Children of Israel. This sura is part of a series Al- Musabbihat surahs because it begins with the glorification of Allah. Regarding the timing and contextual background of the supposed revelation (asbƒÅb al- nuz≈´l), it is an earlier \\"Meccan surah\\", which means it is believed to have been revealed in Mecca, instead of later in Medina.  Q17:1 The transportation of Muhammad to \\"the farthest Mosque\\".  Nimavard madrasa's entrance tilling, Isfahan, Iran. This surah takes its name from the first verse, which tells the event of the Isra, the transportation of Muhammad during the night from the Great Mosque of Mecca to what is referred to as \\"the farthest Mosque\\". The exact location is not specified, although in Islamic tradition this is commonly taken to be the Noble Sanctuary (Temple Mount) in Jerusalem. Some scholars disagree about this (see Isra and Mi'raj). While the city of Jerusalem (or al Quds) is not mentioned by name anywhere in the Qur'an, it is identified in various Hadith. The first verse refers to Mohammed being taken from the 'Sacred Mosque' to the 'Farthest Mosque': Within Islam, it is generally agreed upon that the 'Farthest Mosque' refers to Masjid al- Aqsa in Jerusalem, despite it being built many years after Mohammed's death, and the 'Sacred Mosque' refers to Masjid al-Haram. The surah also refers to the other prophets, for example, Musa (Moses). This Meccan surah was revealed in the last year before the Hijra. Like all the Meccan surah, it stresses the oneness of Allah, the authority of the prophets. However, the primary theme of the Surah is salah (daily prayers), whose number is said to have been fixed at five during the Miraj which it alludes to. In addition, the Surah forbids adultery, calls for respect for father and mother, and calls for patience and control in the face of the persecutions the Muslim community was facing at the time.  Q17:8 Hell  Verse 17:8 refers to hell and states that those who reject the faith will be punished: However, it also states that Allah is merciful and could forgive. It also refers to the hereafter and states that there is a punishment for not believing in it (Verse 7:10):  Q17:13-15 Day of Judgement  Verses 17:13 to 17:15 tells that fate is in people's hands and tells that what they do will be rewarded or punished for on the Day of Judgement.

It also points out the possible existence of alien life, excluding angels and jinns.  Q17:71 Day of Judgement  Verse 17:71 contains a reference to Yawm al- Qiyamah, the Day of Judgement: In Kitab al-Kafi, Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq was questioned on the interpretation of 17:71 (\\"On that day, We will call forth every people with their Imam...\\") to which he responded it is the Imam that is with them and he is the Mahdi, al-Qa'im of the people of that time.

It included a number of advanced features, including regenerative braking and advanced battery designs, to provide range on a single charge. Development ended because of technology issues and the high cost of batteries. In 1977, the prototype was updated and renamed Electron to become one of automaker's \\"Concept 80\\" show cars. Design =Impetus= Development of the Amitron was prompted by three bills passed by the 89th United States Congress, described collectively as the \\"Electric Vehicle Development Act of 1966,\\" as well as a fourth bill that amended the Clean Air Act of 1963. The legislation provided funding for electric car research in response to the rapidly decreasing air quality caused by automobile emissions. Development of electric vehicles was undertaken by the domestic big three automobile manufacturers, as well as AMC. Electrically powered cars were also seen as a way for the U.S. to reduce its reliance on \\"expensive, undependable oil imports.\\" =Powertrain= American Motors entered into a partnership with Gulton Industries of Metuchen, New Jersey (acquired by Mark IV Industries in 1986) to develop the battery and power handling electronics for the car. Their entry into the electric car market was significantly more advanced than other developments, including two types of batteries for fast and slow power release and charging, as well as regenerative brakes to help extend range. The primary power source consisted of two lithium-nickel-fluoride batteries rated at 150 watt-hours per lb, or 331 watt-hours per kg, with a total capacity of 22.5 kWh. The designers selected lithium for the Amitron because \\"it is both highly reactive (easy to oxidize) and has high electromotive potential.\\" The downside to these batteries is that they have relatively low instantaneous power, too little to provide reasonable acceleration or be able to handle the rapid recharging during regenerative braking. To handle these higher power peaks, a secondary power source consisting of two nickel-cadmium (NiCd, often read ni-cad) batteries was used. These batteries could accelerate the car to in 20 seconds. During cruise, the lithium batteries recharged the ni-cads, which continued to power the motor. The regenerative system would automatically switch the drive motors to generators as the car slowed so that the ni-cads could recharge; thus increasing the range of the car. The regenerative braking control was designed \\"to provide the same brake pedal \\"feel\\" as a conventional car. This was first use of regenerative braking technology in the U.S. automobile industry. All together, the system provided the car with a range of when traveling at . Its total battery weight of only was also light for electric vehicles. The equivalent in lead-acid cells would weigh nearly a ton (907 kg). The entire system was controlled by a solid state power management system. The first road tests of the batteries and powertrain were in 1968 using a converted conventional Rambler American sedan. At the time, AMC's vice president of design, Dick Teague, was working on a car called \\"the Voltswagon\\". The supporters of the Amitron were confident and stated that \\"We don't see a major obstacle in the technology. It's just a matter of time.\\" =Body= The Amitron was designed to minimize power loss by keeping down rolling resistance, wind drag resistance, and vehicle weight. The prototype was a snub-snouted three-passenger urban area vehicle or city car with an overall length of only . Among its unique design features were passenger seats that had air-filled cushions, rather than conventional polyurethane (foam rubber). The car did not feature conventional body side doors, but the canopy of the vehicle was hinged up and backward (\\"clamshell type\\" on rear mounted pivots) for entry and egress. American Motors put more effort into making its prototype electric car attractive than its competitors. \\"The modern looking Amitron was one of the most promising electrics developed in the Sixties.\\" During the December 1967 public introduction of the car, Roy D. Chapin, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of AMC, stated that the Amitron \\"could eliminate many problems that up to this point have made electric-type cars impractical\\". =Potential market= American Motors original plans were to offer the Amitron for sale to commuters and urban shoppers in five years, and Chapin said AMC had discussed the venture with its bankers and creditors and \\"they are about as enthusiastic about it\\". The Amitron was also well received by the public. The new technology was still in the infant stage and it was not expected to be popular \\"until the end of the decade.\\" Competitors were also skeptical of AMC's rapid deployment, stating it would take ten years to have a practical battery. Moreover, research programs to develop clean transportation in the U.S. ceased. The Amitron did not go beyond the prototype stage. The expensive batteries forced AMC to halt further experiments with advanced technology electric vehicles for several years. =Legacy= The rebadged 1977 AMC Electron gained rear-view side mirrors The AMC Pacer was influenced by the Amitron's short, wide dimensions, along with optionally including three front seats. The abruptly terminating rear end of the concept car influenced the AMC Gremlin. American Motors' battery powered vehicle development continued under a partnership with Gould (Gould Electronics after selling its battery operations) that lead to the mass production of the Jeep DJ-5E starting in 1974. This rear-wheel drive mini-delivery van was also known as the Electruck. Regenerative braking was effective at speeds above and the system included current-limiting to prevent overcharging the lead-acid batteries. In 1977, AMC introduced their \\"Concept 80\\" line of experimental vehicles, which included the AM Van, Grand Touring, Concept I, Concept II, and Jeep II. Along with this lineup they renamed the Amitron to be the Electron, added side-view mirrors to the windows, and gave it a fresh paint job. The show car was not driveable because it did not have a power train. The design has been characterized by some observers as \\"hot, sexy, cute and practical.\\" \\"The AMC Amitron had almost 50 years ago all that is still considered indispensable for an electric car if it is supposed to succeed: a decent range, low weight, and a jaunty look.\\" References Further reading External links * Category:AMC vehicles Category:Historic electric vehicles Category:Front-wheel-drive vehicles Category:1960s cars Category:1970s cars Category:Subcompact cars Category:Hatchbacks Category:Electric city cars Category:Battery electric concept cars Category:Proposed electric vehicles ","title":"AMC Amitron"},{"id":"854000","text":"The Vrbas (; ) is a major river with a length of , in western Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Freshwater ecosystems have suffered from an increasing population and the associated development pressures. One of the most valuable natural resources of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia is its freshwater resource, contained by an abundant wellspring and clear rivers. Situated between the major regional rivers (Drina river on the east, Una river on the west and the Sava river) the Neretva basin contains the most significant source of drinking water. The Neretva is notable among rivers of the Dinaric Alps region, especially regarding its diverse ecosystems and habitats, flora and fauna, cultural and historic heritage.

It is the largest karst river in the Dinaric Alps in the eastern part of the Adriatic basin/watershed. Its total length is , of which are in Bosnia and Herzegovina, while the final are in the Dubrovnik-Neretva County of Croatia.

The average discharge at profile ≈Ωitomisliƒái in Bosnia and Herzegovina is /s and at the mouth in Croatia is /s in addition to the Trebi≈°njica River's /s. The Trebi≈°njica River basin is included in the Neretva watershed due to a physical link of the two basins by the porous karst terrain. The hydrological parameters of Neretva are regularly monitored in Croatia at Metkoviƒá. = Sections = Jablanica, summer 2010 Geographically and hydrologically the Neretva is divided into three sections. Its source and headwaters gorge are situated deep in the Dinaric Alps at the base of the Zelengora and Lebr≈°nik mountains, specifically under the Gredelj saddle. The river source is at 1,227 meters above sea level and consists of five small and distinct wellsprings. On its 90 kilometers course through the first section the Neretva cuts two distinct deep and narrow canyons and two distinct wide and fertile valleys, around Ulog and then around Glavatiƒçevo, before it reaches town of Konjic. This section is also better known as the Upper Neretva (), and here river flows generally from east-southeast to north-northwest as do most Bosnia and Herzegovina rivers belonging to the Danube watershed, and covers some with an average elevation of 1.2%. Right below Konjic, the Neretva again expands into a third and largest valley which provided fertile agricultural land before it was flooded by large artificial reservoir, Jablaniƒçko Lake, formed after construction of a Jablanica Dam near town of Jablanica. The Neretva headwaters - First of three distinct canyons, just downstream of Ulog The Neretva rich fresh water karstic aquifer - Second of three distinct canyons, just downstream of Glavatiƒçevo and before Konjic The second section begins from the confluence of the Neretva and the Rama between Konjic and Jablanica where the Neretva suddenly takes almost 180¬∞ degrees turn toward east-southeast and flows the short leg before reaches town of Jablanica, from which point turns again toward south. From Jablanica, the Neretva enters third and the largest canyon on its course, running through the steep slopes mountains of Prenj, ƒåvrsnica and ƒåabulja reaching in depth. Three hydroelectric dams operate between Jablanica and Mostar. When the Neretva expands for the second and final time, it reaches its third section. This area is often colloquially called the \\"Bosnian and Herzegovinian California\\". The last of its course forms wide alluvial delta, before the river empties into the Adriatic Sea.

The upper course of the Neretva river is simply called the Upper Neretva (). It includes numerous streams and well-springs, three major glacial lakes near the river and more lakes scattered across the mountains of Treskavica and Zelengora in the wider area, mountains, peaks and forests, flora and fauna of the area. The Upper Neretva has water of Class I purity and is almost certainly the coldest river water in the world, often as low as 7‚Äì8 degrees Celsius in the summer months. Rising from the base of the Zelengora and Lebr≈°nik Mountain, Neretva headwaters run in undisturbed rapids and waterfalls, carving steep gorges reaching in depth. = Rakitnica River = The Rakitnica is the main tributary of the first section (). The Rakitnica River forms a long canyon, out of its length, that stretches between Bjela≈°nica and Visoƒçica to the southeast from Sarajevo.BHTourism - Rakitnica From the canyon, a hiking trail along the ridge of the Rakitnica canyon drops 800 m below, to the famous village of Lukomir. The village is the only remaining traditional semi-nomadic Bosniak mountain village in Bosnia and Herzegovina. At almost 1,500 m, Lukomir features stone homes with cherry-wood roof tiles. It is the country's highest and most isolated mountain village. The village is inaccessible from the first snows in December until late April and sometimes even later, except by skis or on foot. Middle Neretva Railway bridge over the Grabovica fl. in the Neretva's middle section canyon, cca.1970, 10 yrs. prior formation of artificial lake Railway bridge over the Dre≈æanka fl. in the Neretva's middle section canyon, cca.1970, 10 yrs. prior formation of artificial lake Mostarska Bijela valley, view from 2000 m.a.s.l. Hydrographically the Middle Neretva section begins from town of Konjic, but after the construction of Jablanica Hydroelectric Power Station and flooding of large fertile valley between Konjic and Jablanica, known simply as \\"Neretva\\" since Middle Ages, the new point for hydrographical division became dam of the Jablanica HPP where also is a place of confluence of the rivers Neretva and Rama. Here the Neretva river suddenly takes almost 180¬∞ degrees turn toward east-southeast and flows the short leg before it reach town of Jablanica. From this point it turns again toward south and enters third and the largest canyon on its course, running through the steep slopes of the mountains of Prenj, ƒåvrsnica and ƒåabulja, reaching between in depth. This section is characterized with steep and relatively narrow canyon, and rugged karstic geology and hydrology. Four enormous vales-size rifts appear in the mountainsides forming canyon walls, two from each sides of the river, intersecting with the main canyon almost perpendicularly. The Neretva receives only four small streams in this section, all running through these side-vales, which are relatively short. Going downstream from Jablanica, first two from each side are the Glogo≈°nica stream, its eponymous canyon and small village, at the left, and the Grabovica stream with eponymous canyon and historical village, from the right side. Further downstream two much larger vales appear again on each side, first on the right the stream of Dre≈æanka and its large and steep valley, with two eponymous villages, Donja (Lower) and Gornja (Upper) Dre≈ænica, and than Mostarska Bijela, as one the most pristine vales in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with its eponymous uniquely characteristic subterranean stream, embedded deep into the Prenj mountain, on the left. Although these streams are of low outflow, there are also numerous wellsprings rising on both sides of the canyon at the river banks, with high-capacity discharge. Three large hydroelectric power stations operate in this section of the Neretva, between Jablanica and Mostar, namely Grabovica HPP, Salakovac HPP and Mostar HPP. = Lakes = Jablanica Lake and suspension bridge at Ostro≈æac village Jablanica lake is a large artificial lake on the Neretva river, right below Konjic where the Neretva expands into a wide valley. The river provided fertile, agricultural land before the lake flooded most of it. The lake was created in 1953 after construction of a largegravitational hydroelectric dam near Jablanica in central Bosnia and Herzegovina. The lake has an irregular, elongated shape, and its width varies along its length. The lake is a popular vacation destination.  Lower Neretva and wetlands  Downstream from the confluence of its tributaries, the Trebi≈æat and Bregava Rivers, the valley spreads into an alluvial fan covering . The upper valley, the 7,411 hectares in Bosnia and Herzegovina, is called Hutovo Blato. =Hutovo Blato= Hutovo Blato Hutovo Blato The Neretva Delta has been recognised as a Ramsar site since 1992, and Hutovo Blato since 2001. Both areas form one integrated Ramsar site that is a natural entity divided by the state border. The Important Bird Areas programme, conducted by Birdlife International, covers protected areas in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Since 1995, Hutovo Blato has been protected as Hutovo Blato Nature ParkHutovo Blato Nature Park and managed by a public authority. The whole zone is protected from human impact and provides habitat for many plants and animals. The historical site Old Fortress Hutovo Blato is in the Nature Park. Gornje Blato-Deransko Lake is supplied by the karstic water sources of the Trebi≈°njica River, emerging from bordering hills. It is hydro-geologically connected to the Neretva River through its effluent, the Krupa River, formed out of five lakes (≈†krka, Deranja, Jelim, Orah, Drijen). Large portions are permanently flooded and isolated by wide groves of reedbebds and trees. It represents a more interesting preserved area. Krupa river Krupa River The Krupa River is a Neretva left tributary and the main water current of Hutovo Blato, which carries the waters from Gornje Blato and Svitavsko Lake into the Neretva River. The length of Krupa is with an average depth of . The Krupa does not have a specific source, but is an arm of Deransko Lake. Also, the Krupa is a unique river in Europe, because it flows both ways. It flows both towards and back from its mouth. This happens when a high water level causes Neretva to push Krupa in the opposite direction. = Neretva Delta = Cultivated slots and natural marshes of the complex Neretva Delta Passing towns and villages in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Neretva spills out into the Adriatic Sea, building a wetland delta that is listed under the Ramsar Convention as internationally important. The mouth of the Neretva river near port-town of Ploƒçe, Croatia In this lower alluvial valley in Croatia, the Neretva River splinters into multiple courses, creating a delta covering approximately 12,000 hectares. The delta in Croatia has been reduced by extensive land reclamation projects, reducing the river flows to just three branches from the original twelve. The marshes, lagoons and lakes that once dotted this plain have disappeared and only fragments of the old Mediterranean wetlands survive. Wetlands, marshes and lagoons, lakes, beaches, rivers, hummocks (limestone hills) and mountains comprise the delta, with five protected areas with a total area of 1,620 ha. These are ornithological, ichthyologic and landscape reserves.  Endemic and endangered species  Dinaric karst water systems support 25% of the total of 546 fish species in Europe, many endemic. The Neretva River, together with four other areas in the Mediterranean, has the largest number of threatened freshwater fish species. The degree of endemism in the karst ecoregion is greater than 10%. Multiple fish species have small habitats and are vulnerable, so they are included on the Red List of endangered fish . The Adriatic basin has 88 species of fish, of which 44 are Mediterranean endemic species, and 41 are Adriatic endemic species. More than half of the Adriatic river basin species of fish inhabit the Neretva, the Ombla, the Trebi≈°njica, the Moraƒça Rivers and their tributaries, and more than 30 are endemic. = Invasive species = A pike perch (Sander lucioperca Linnaeus 1758) (also see Sander (genus)) population in the Neretva River watershed was observed in 1990 for the first time. The Rama River, a right tributary of the Neretva, and its Rama Lake received an unknown quantity of this allochthonous species. Population estimates have increased in the Neretva accumulation lakes. This fact confirms previous scientific assumptions of ≈†krijelj (1991, 1995), who predicted the possibility of pike perch displacement (migration) from Ramsko Lake to the Rama River and then further downstream to the river and its lakes. In 1990 the perch population made up 1.95% of the fish population in Rama Lake. Within a decade this rose to 25.42% in the nearby Jablaniƒçko Lake. The fast pace of pike perch population growth and displacements is expected to match the environmental conditions from the mid-ecological valence of this fish. In this sense, it is the established continuous and accelerated growth of the population dynamics of pike perch in Jablaniƒçko Lake, a relatively good representation in Salakovaƒçko Lake and the beginning of growth of population in Graboviƒçko Lake. Parallel with the increase in pike perch is a decrease in indigenous species like European chub also white chub (Squalius cephalus), and the disappearance of rare and endemic species like Adriatic Dace also Balkan dace (Squalius svallize also Leuciscus svallize Heckel & Kner 1858), Neretvan softmouth trout (Salmothymus obtusirostris oxyrhinchus Steind.) and marble trout (Salmo marmoratus Cuv.). Pike perch causes clearly visible, negative effects on the autochthonous species in Jablaniƒçko Lake. In Salakovaƒçko Lake these effects are in progress, although less visible, while in Graboviƒçko Lake it is not yet clearly visible. = Salmonids = Softmouth trout Marble trout Dentex trout Salmonid fish from the Neretva basin show considerable variation in morphology, ecology and behaviour. Among most endangered are three endemic species of trout: Neretvan softmouth trout (Salmothymus obtusirostris oxyrhinchus Steind.), Toothtrout (Salmo dentex) and marble trout ((Salmo marmoratus Cuv.). All three endemic trout species of the Neretva are endangered, mostly due to the habitat destruction or construction of large/major dams (\\"large\\" is higher than 15‚Äì20 m; \\"major\\" is over 150‚Äì250 m). Other problems include hybridization or genetic pollution with introduced, non-native trouts, illegal fishing and poor water and fisheries management. = Cyprinids = The most endangered cyprinids (family Cyprinidae) are endemic. Especially interesting are five Phoxinellus (sub)species that inhabit isolated karstic plains (fields) of eastern as well as western Herzegovina in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which eventually reach the Neretva watershed and/or coastal drainages of south-eastern Dalmatia. * Karst minnow (Phoxinellus metohiensis) is considered Vulnerable (VU). * South Dalmatian minnow (Phoxinellus pstrossii) is threatened, but was marked Data Deficient (DD) and was not designated on IUCN Red List of Threatened Species Version 2009.1. * Dalmatian minnow (Phoxinellus ghetaldii) is considered vulnerable. * Adriatic minnow (Phoxinellus alepidotus) is endemic to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia and occurs in lowland water bodies with little current. It is threatened due to pollution and habitat destruction. It is considered endangered. * Spotted minnow (Phoxinellus adspersus), is endemic in the Tihaljina River, which is fed by underground waters from Imotsko field and is connected to the Trebi≈æat river via the Mlada River. It also occurs in Mostarsko Blato wetlands. Fish were found in the source of the Norin River, a right-hand tributary of the lower Neretva at Metkoviƒá, in Croatia, at Kuti Lake, a left-hand tributary of the lower Neretva, at Imotsko field in Red Lake (Croatia) and the Vrljika river drainage and near Vrgorac in the Matica River system. It is considered vulnerable. * Minnow nase (Chondrostoma phoxinus) is considered Critically Endangered (CR) * Neretvan nase (also Dalmatian nase and Dalmatian soiffe) (Chondrostoma knerii) is endemic to the Neretva. Neretvan nase is mainly distributed in the lower parts and delta, the Krupa River, Nature Park Hutovo Blato wetlands and Neretva Delta wetlands. It occurs in water bodies with little current. It is threatened by habitat destruction and pollution. It is considered Vulnerable (VU). * Adriatic dace also Balkan dace (Squalius svallize also Leuciscus svallize Heckel & Kner 1858) is a vulnerable endemic, although also found in Montenegro and Albania. Adults inhabit water bodies on the low plains, with little current and in lakes. They feed on invertebrates. It is threatened due to pollution, habitat destruction and due to introduction of other species. * Illyrian dace (Squalius illyricus also Leuciscus illyricus Heckel & Kner 1858) inhabits karstic waters of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Albania. It occurs in water courses on low plains, with little current. It feeds on invertebrates. It is stressed by habitat destruction, pollution and introduced species. It is considered Near Threatened (NT). * Turskyi dace (Leuciscus turskyi also Squalius turskyi turskyi and Telestes turskyi) inhabits karstic waters, lake Bu≈°ko Blato and the Krka and ƒåikola rivers. It occurs on the low plains, with little current and in lakes. It feeds on invertebrates. Threats include water abstraction and pollution. It is considered Critically Endangered (CR). * Dalmatian barbelgudgeon (Aulopyge hugeli) inhabits karstic streams of Glamocko field, Livanjsko field and Duvanjsko field, lakes Bu≈°ko Blato, Blidinje and Cetina, Krka and Zrmanja river drainages. It occurs in lentic waters and feeds on plants. The fish is threatened by water pollution and habitat destruction and is considered endangered. It is migratory in Livanjsko field. = Cobitidae = The Neretvan spined loach (Cobitis narentana Karaman, 1928) is an Adriatic watershed endemic that inhabits a narrow area of the Neretva watershed in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina In Bosnia and Herzegovina it inhabits only the lower Neretva and its smaller tributaries like the Matica River. In Croatia it is a strictly protected species and inhabits only the Neretva delta and its smaller tributaries, the (Norin) and lake systems of the Neretva delta (Baƒáina lakes, Kuti, Desne, Modro oko). It is considered Vulnerable (VU). = Neretva delta endemics = The Neretva delta hosts more than 20 endemic species, of which 18 are endemic to the Adriatic watershed, along with three endemic species in Croatia. Nearly half (45%) of the total number of species that inhabit this area are included in one of the categories of threat and are mainly endemic.  Hydroelectric controversy  The benefits brought by hydroelectric dams have come at an environmental and social cost. The waters of the Neretva river with its two main tributaries, the Rama and the Trebi≈°njica, are already harnessed by 9 (nine) Hydroelectric power plants with large dams, four on Neretva main stream, one with a major dam on the Rama tributary, and another three on the Trebi≈°njica River. Narentaschlucht.jpgBefore - the Neretva canyon near Jablanica town (circa 1920), long before Grabovica Dam. Vypustena prehrada Grabovica na Neretve, zatopena byv. zel.jpgAfter - the Neretva canyon flooded by Grabovica Lake (waters discharged) behind the Grabovica Dam. These facilities are as follows: *on the Neretva: Jablanica Hydroelectric Power Station, Grabovica Hydroelectric Power Station, Salakovac Hydroelectric Power Station, Mostar Hydroelectric Power Station; * on the Rama: Rama Hydroelectric Power Station; * on the Trebi≈°njica: Trebinje-1 Hydroelectric Power Station, Trebinje-2 Hydroelectric Power Station, ƒåapljina Hydroelectric Power Station, Dubrovnik Hydroelectric Power Station (in Croatia). There are additional number of hydroelectric power station of various capacity on smaller tributaries, such as Mostarsko Blato Hydroelectric Power Station on the Li≈°tica (downstream from HPP named Jasenica), Peƒá Mlini Hydroelectric Power Station on the Trebi≈æat, and numerous small hydro on the small river tributaries like Tatinac, Tre≈°anica, Neretvica and Du≈°ƒçica, with a proposed small hydro on the rivers Doljanka, Glogo≈°nica, and one abandoned on the Idbar. =Projects in Upper Neretva= The government of the Bosnia and Herzegovina has unveiled plans to build three more hydroelectric power plants with dams over 150.5 metres in height upstream from the existing plants, beginning with Glavaticevo Hydro Power Plant in the village of Glavatiƒçevo, then going upstream to Bjelimiƒái Hydro Power Plant and Ljubuƒça Hydro Power Plant located near the eponymous villages; and another, by the Republic of Srpska, at the Neretva headwaters gorge, near the source of the river. It is similarly opposed by environmental organizations and NGO's, such as Zeleni-Neretva Konjic and the World Wildlife Fund. Bosnia and Herzegovina is preparing a parallel plan to form a large national park to include the entire region of Gornja Neretva (), and have within the park the three hydroelectric plants. The latest idea is that the park should be divided in two, where the Neretva should be excluded from both and would become the boundary between parks. Those who oppose the plan wish to have the area turned into the National Park of Upper Neretva and would leave the park without substantial development.Silenced Rivers: The Ecology and Politics of Large Dams, by Patrick McCully, Zed Books, London, 1996 =The Upper Horizons - Trebi≈°njica= In recent times the Republic of Srpska government finished the project named The Upper Horizons (), a large hydroelectric project that diverted underground waters in the Neretva watershed to the Trebi≈°njica plant and others in the Trebi≈°njica basin. This project was opposed by NGO's in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. They argued that the project would increase salinity levels of every surface and underground water on the right bank of the Neretva, damage internationally recognized Ramsar sites, a protected Nature Park Hutovo Blato in Bosnia and Herzegovina, protected Neretva Delta in Croatia, and important reservoirs of freshwater, plus agricultural lands in the lower Neretva valley. Hydroelectric Power Plant Mostar, upstream from city of Mostar  Cultural and Historical significance  Old stone pedestrian bridge in Konjic = Early history = During antiquity, the Neretva was known as Narenta, Narona and Naro(n),Archeological Museum of NaronaThe Ancient City of Narona Neven Kazazovic, Tajne Neretve and was the inlandAppian and Illyricum by Marjeta ≈†a≈°el Kos,\\" The Ardiaei were certainly also settled in the hinterland, along the Naro River at least as far as the Konjic region,\\" home to the ancient Illyrian tribe of Ardiaei. They became ship builders, seafarers and fishermen. Archaeological discoveries of Illyrian culture dealt both with daily and religious life such as the discovery of ancient Illyrian shipwrecks found in Hutovo Blato, in the vicinity of the Neretva River.Illyria After intense excavations in the area of Hutovo Blato in the autumn of 2008, archaeologists from Bosnia and Herzegovina University of Mostar and Sweden University of Lund found traces of an Illyrian trading post that was more than two thousand years old. The find is unique in a European perspective and archaeologists have concluded that Desilo, as the location is called, was an important trading post of great significance for contact between the Illyrians and the Romans. Archaeological finds include the ruins of a settlement, the remains of a harbour that probably functioned as a trading post, as well as many sunken boats, fully laden with wine pitchers ‚Äì so-called amphorae ‚Äì from the 1st century BC. Archaeologist Adam Lindhagen claimed that it was the most important Illyrian ruin. = Roman period = One of the most significant monuments of Roman times in Bosnia and Herzegovina is Mogorjelo. Located 1 kilometer south of the town of ƒåapljina, Mogorjelo remnants of the old Roman suburban Villa Rustica from the 4th century represents ancient Roman agricultural production and estate, mills, bakeries, olive oil refinery and forges.Mogorjelo on the Vine route of Herzegovina The Villa was destroyed in the middle of the 4th century, during the invasion of western Goths. Surviving residents did not restore it to its original splendor. The name of Mogorjelo is thought to be derived either from the Slavic word for \\"burn\\" (Slavic ‚Äì goriti) or that at the end of the 5th century the church was built on the ruins of the Villa, and was dedicated to St. Hermagor ‚Äì Mogoru.ƒåapljina municipality - Mogorjelo = Middle Ages = In the Early Middle Ages, the South Slavic Narentines held the region. They were known for piracy and resisted Christianization until they were defeated by the Venetians, and then the Byzantines, at the turn of the 10th and 11th centuries. Gabela is a rich archaeological site on the Neretva bank, situated south of ƒåapljina. Along with notable medieval buildings, remains of Old City walls, and a sculpture of a stone lion ‚Äì a symbol of Venetian culture survived. For its remarkable geostrategic position, Gabela was linked to Homer's most famous work ‚Äì the Iliad. = Ottoman period = Stari Most (Old Bridge), 16th century, Mostar The Old Bridge was commissioned by Suleiman the Magnificent in 1557 to replace an older wooden suspension bridge. Construction began in 1557 and took nine years: according to the inscription the bridge was completed in 974 AH, corresponding to the period between 19 July 1566 and 7 July 1567. Memories and legends and the name of the builder, Mimar Hayruddin (student of the Old/Great Sinan (Mimar Sinan / Koca Sinan), the Ottoman architect) were preserved in writing. Charged under pain of death to construct a bridge of such unprecedented dimensions, the architect reportedly prepared for his own funeral on the day the scaffolding was finally removed from the completed structure. Upon its completion it was the widest man-made arch in the world. Associated technical issues remain obscure: how the scaffolding was erected, how the stone was transported from one bank to the other, and how the scaffolding was maintained during construction. On 9 November 1993, during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina it was destroyed by sustained artillery shelling. After the war, immediate plans were raised to reconstruct the bridge as a symbol of peace and ethnic harmony, literally bridging the two sides of the conflict. They attempted to reuse as much original material as possible. Salvage operations, funded by the international community, raised the stones and the remains of the bridge from the river bed. Missing elements or parts that were not usable were cut from the original quarry. Now listed as a World Heritage Site, the bridge was rebuilt under the aegis of UNESCO. Its 1,088 stones were shaped according to the original techniques, at a cost of about ‚Ç¨12 million. The grand opening was held on 23 July 2004. Fortified Poƒçitelj looking downstream the Neretva It is traditional for the town's young men to leap from the bridge into the Neretva. The practice dates back to 1566, the time the bridge was built, and an event was held every summer in front of population. The first recorded instance of someone diving off the bridge is from 1664. In 1968 a formal diving competition was inaugurated and held every summer.Diving Club Mostar Poƒçitelj is situated on a hill near Mostar and is easily accessible by bus. As with many other Bosnian sites, this town is Ottoman in design. It is a historic fortified town with a hostel (caravanserai) and a hamam beneath. A traditional mosque is there. During the Bosnian War Poƒçitelj was badly damaged and most of its residents fled and never returnedWorld Heritage Sites in Bosnia Herzegovina = World War II: Battle of the Neretva = Famous bridge, focal point of the Battle of Neretva The famous Battle of Neretva is a 1969 Oscar-nominated motion picture depicting events from the Second World War and the actual Battle of the Neretva. Codenamed Fall Wei√ü, the operation was a German plan for a combined attack launched in early 1943 against Yugoslav Partisans throughout occupied Yugoslavia. The offensive took place between January and April 1943. The operation used to be known, in socialist Yugoslav times, as the Fourth Enemy Offensive, or as the Battle for the Wounded. At one point during the battle, the Partisans were caught in a pocket with their back to the Neretva River. Near Jablanica, 20,000 Partisans under command of Marshal Josip Broz Tito struggled to save some 4500 wounded comrades and typhus patients together with the Supreme Headquarters and Main Hospital, against some 150,000 Axis combatants.Operation WEISS - The Battle of Neretva Neretva River in Metkoviƒá, Croatia In popular culture Celebrated Bosnian and Herzegovinian poet, Mak Dizdar often used the river Neretva as motif in his poetry, alongside other historical, cultural and natural feature of his native Herzegovina. The famous Battle of Neretva is a 1969 Oscar-nominated motion picture depicting events from the Second World War and the actual Battle of the Neretva. Many folk songs are written or performed with the Neretva as main theme.

William Morris Meredith (June 8, 1799 ‚Äì August 17, 1873) was an American lawyer and politician from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He served as the United States Secretary of the Treasury, during President Zachary Taylor's Administration. Early and family life Born on June 8, 1799 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, William Morris Meredith was the eldest son of William Tuckey Meredith (d. 1844), a successful attorney and after 1814 president of Schuylkill Bank, and who narrowly lost to Nicholas Biddle the presidency of the Bank of the United States. During the year he was admitted to the Pennsylvania Bar, 1795, William Tuckey Meredith married the writer and poet Gertrude Gouverneur Meredith (n√©e Ogden) (d.1828). Gertrude was the niece of Lewis Morris, as well as of Gouverneur Morris, and highly educated and respected in her own right, as well as published in Dennie's Port Folio. The couple ultimately had eleven children. William Tuckey Meredith served on the Philadelphia Common and Select Councils, and on the Vestry of Christ Episcopal Church, among other leadership positions in the city. His brother Jonathan Meredith (d. 1872) was a leader of the Bar in Baltimore, Maryland. William M. Meredith graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1812 (graduation at age 13 not being unusual at the time). After assisting his father in the family's saddlery business, he read law, and was himself admitted to the Pennsylvania Bar. After his mother's death in 1828, William Morris Meredith helped raise his younger siblings. On June 17, 1834, at the age of 35 and after a ten-year engagement, Meredith married the former Catherine Keppele (d. 1854). They had one son (William, b. 1838, later a published essayist and poet) and four daughters: Gertrude Gouverneur Meredith, Euphemia Ogden Meredith, Elizabeth Caldwell Meredith, Catherine Keppele Meredith. Catherine Meredith also helped care for her husband's siblings, and his father when he was disabled by a stroke in 1839. Career Meredith was admitted to the bar in 1817, and began practicing law. He drew considerable public attention, as did his slightly senior colleague James C. Biddle (later his brother-in-law), by questioning the conduct of Judge Frank Hallowell in Commonwealth v. Cook, a murder case in which three black men were charged with killing a boy. During the jury's deliberation, the American Daily Advertiser published an article which defense counsel thought highly biased. The judge allowed counsel to question jurors as to whether they read the article, and when the judge refused to dismiss a juror who said he was offended by Meredith's questioning, complained such that the judge held both lawyers in contempt of court and ordered them jailed for 30 days, despite considerable public sympathy.R.L. Ashurst, William Morris Meredith (1799-1873) The American Law Register (1898-1907) (vol. 55, no. 4), at pp. 208-211, available at https://www.jstor.org/stable/3307164?seq=9#page_scan_tab_contentshttp://hsp.org/sites/default/files/legacy_files/migrated/findingaid1509meredith.pdf at pp. 3-4. Upon their release, they secured release of two of the prisoners in an appeal on double jeopardy grounds. This gained Meredith a reputation for fearlessness and inflexible honesty, and he was elected President of the Philadelphia Bar Association the following year. A Federalist, Meredith was then elected to the Pennsylvania General Assembly, where he served in the minority for five years, from 1824 to 1828, the year of his mother's death (during which his father was grief-stricken and never fully recovered). One of his accomplishments was establishment of a House of Refuge for juvenile offenders, and he served as that institution's manager, and also on the board of the Pennsylvania Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, in which capacity he continued to serve for many years until his death.Ashhurst at 212 Meredith was president of the Philadelphia City Council from 1834 until 1849, and was a delegate to the Pennsylvania Constitutional Convention in 1837. Meredith also served as United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania from 1841 to 1845. During that time, he prosecuted Alexander Holmes for manslaughter in the William Brown case. A successful attorney, particularly after he secured termination of the German Lutheran Church's interment rights in Franklin Square in Commonwealth v. Allmyer,Ashurst at 215 Meredith owned the Wheatland Estate in Lancaster, Pennsylvania from May 1845 until December 1848 before selling it to future President James Buchanan. The Zachary Taylor Administration, 1849 Daguerreotype by Mathew Brady From left to right: William B. Preston, Thomas Ewing, John M. Clayton, Zachary Taylor, William M. Meredith, George W. Crawford, Jacob Collamer and Reverdy Johnson, (1849). President Zachary Taylor, wanting a Pennsylvania Whig for his cabinet, appointed William M. Meredith to be the 19th Secretary of the Treasury. He began his term in office on March 8, 1849. Meredith strongly opposed the free trade legislation passed the year before under his predecessor Robert J. Walker. He felt that there was a need to protect the American workman, who was subject to competition from poorly paid European labor. Meredith's principal contribution in office was his Annual Report of 1849 in which he set forth an elaborate argument for a protective tariff. Meredith depicted on the 5th issue 10-cent Fractional currency note. The increase in the public debt due to the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and the acquisition of California gave Meredith additional argument for raising revenue through higher import duties, but no action was taken on the tariff during Meredith's term. He also recommended a revision of the Coast Survey Code, which had not been changed since its implementation in 1806. The Coast Survey had seen great expansion and improvement with the introduction of steam powered ships and was in need of revision. Meredith resigned from his office as Secretary of the Treasury, upon President Taylor's death in 1850. Civil War and later legal career Meredith was elected Pennsylvania's attorney general in the 1860 election, and served for two terms (from 1861 until 1867). In 1861, as a delegate to a Peace Conference, he worked unsuccessfully to prevent the southern states from seceding from the Union. His brother Sullivan Amory Meredith had served in the Mexican War, and became a Brigadier General of Union Volunteers, commissioned in 1862, and the brothers helped assure Pennsylvania met its quota of troops. His son William served for a brief period as secretary to Major General George A. McCall, but his stutter and problems with cataracts caused him to resign that position. William Meredith later served as a member of a commission working out the settlement of the Alabama claims, in 1870. The following year, President Ulysses Grant asked Meredith to travel to Geneva as senior counsel for the United States in an international arbitration proceeding, but he declined the position due to ill health. His last political post was as President of the 1872 Republican National Convention. Death and legacy Meredith died in Philadelphia in August 1873, at the age of 74. His wife, Catherine had died in 1854. Both are interred at the Christ Church Burial Ground in Philadelphia. The Historical Society of Pennsylvania holds the Meredith family papers.http://hsp.org/sites/default/files/legacy_files/migrated/findingaid1509meredith.pdf A Philadelphia school was named in his honor in 1931, and remains active today.http://webgui.phila.k12.pa.us/schools/m/meredith-school Meredith received one of only two 1849 Double Eagles while serving as Treasury Secretary. That 1849 Double Eagle is a pattern coin. The other coin is on display at the Smithsonian Institution. The coin was auctioned as part of his estate but its subsequent whereabouts are unknown.http://www.coinfacts.com/double_eagles/liberty_no_motto_double_eagles/1849_double_eagle.htm References External links * Biographical sketch of William M Meredith, The American Law Register, Vol. 55, No. 4, Apr 1907 * The Meredith Family Papers, including William M.

The new company, consisting of a consolidation of firms from throughout the United States, was incorporated in New Jersey. ATF was the dominant American manufacturer of metal type from its creation in 1892 until at least the 1940s; it continued to be influential into the 1960s. Many fonts developed by American Type Founders in its period of dominance, including News Gothic, Century Schoolbook, Franklin Gothic, Hobo and Bank Gothic, are still in everyday use. Type founding before ATF By the beginning of the final decade of the nineteenth century, type founding was in a state of crisis. With the introduction of the Linotype, which could cast whole lines of body type in-house, demand for hand-set type was down. Throughout the late 1880s prices had been maintained by an informal cartel of foundries, but as the number of foundries increased, and then with the invention of hot metal type, prices dropped dramatically. Additionally, type at this time was not standardized, either to body size or to base line, and printers resented the incompatibility of types from different foundries. Leaders in the industry, notably Joseph W. Phinney of the Dickinson Type Foundry in Boston, set up a committee to address these problems, eventually recommending consolidation.Cost, Patricia. The Bentons: How an American Father and Son Changed the Printing Industry. Cary Graphic Arts Press, 2011. . Consolidation and early years 1896 advertisement in Will H. Bradley's magazine, Bradley, His Book ATF's 1923 specimen book explains that its goal is to 'discourage unhealthy competition' in the printing industry. By the late 1880s, there were some 34 foundries in the United States. In 1892, 23 foundries were brought together to form the American Type Founders Company.Consuegra, David, American Type Design & Designers, Allworth Press, New York City, p. 263. Key to the success of this merger was the inclusion of MacKellar, Smiths, & Jordan Co. of Philadelphia, with assets of over $6 million, the Cincinnati Type Foundry of Henry Barth, which brought with it the patents to his Barth Typecaster, and Benton, Waldo Foundry of Milwaukee, which included Linn Boyd Benton and his all-important Benton Pantograph which engraved type matrices directly instead of using punches and allowed the optical scaling of type. With the inclusion of the Barth Caster and the Benton Pantograph, ATF immediately became the largest and the most technologically advanced foundry in the world. Conditions for the first few years were chaotic: while 12 foundries ceased separate operations immediately member foundries continued to operate as if they were independent firms. Real consolidation did not begin until 1894, when Robert Wickham Nelson, principal owner of the Throne Typesetting Machine Company and a new stockholder in ATF, became general manager. He immediately began to liquidate unprofitable ventures, eliminate duplications, and force the various branches to do business under the ATF name instead of retaining their former ones. Linn Boyd Benton's son, Morris Fuller Benton, was given the job of purging obsolete and duplicated type faces from the catalogs, and standardizing the point size and base-line of the types made. Nelson, realizing that display and advertising type (rather than the body type that was set so efficiently by the new line- casters) would be the mainstay of the foundry type business, immediately began an extensive advertising campaign and commissioned the production of new type designs. Joseph W. Phinney was put in charge of the design department and he supervised the introduction of Cushing, Howland, Bradley, and the William Morris inspired Satanick and Jenson Oldstyle, the last of these being hugely successful. Young Benton was then commissioned to finish Lewis Buddy's Elbert Hubbard inspired Roycroft, another successful introduction. While Phinney often used free-lance designers, like Will Bradley, T.M. Cleland, Walter Dorwin Teague, Frederic Goudy, and Oz Cooper, the bulk of ATF's catalog through the 1930s was the creation of Morris Fuller Benton. Though he never became well known, even within the printing industry, Benton enjoyed a record of successful type introductions unparalleled by anyone, much to the profit of ATF. Benton, though he did not invent either idea, was the most successful designer of revivals of historical type designs (such as his re-cutting of Bodoni and Garamond) and he perfected the creation of \\"type families\\" (such as Century or most successfully Cheltenham) where a basic face would be offered in italic, light, bold, extended and condensed variations. Another key player at ATF at this time was the advertising manager (and informal corporate historian) Henry Lewis Bullen, who created a typographic library of historical examples for designers to draw upon. This collection was turned over to Columbia University's Rare Book and Manuscript Library in 1936. The books form the core of the book arts collection at Columbia. There is also an archive of ATF materials in Columbia's special collections. In 1901, Nelson consolidated casting operations in a purpose-built factory in Jersey City and the branches remained only as distribution centers. By the 1920s, ATF had offices in 27 American cities and Vancouver, British Columbia, where it sold not only type, but pressroom supplies and printing presses (their own Kelly line and those of other manufacturers) as well. It printed large specimen books, with many examples of good layout as examples for the advertising market. In 1923, at a cost of $300,000, ATF produced its largest and most superlative type catalog. Sixty thousand of these opulent books, printed extensively in color, were distributed, and to this day they are considered to be masterpieces of the art of letterpress printing. The first paragraph of its preface boasted: > The printing of 1923 is greatly superior to that of 1900. It has better > style, more attractiveness and greater power and dignity...This great > improvement has not come to pass without direction. There has been, in fact, > very deliberate direction. There has been constant and forward thinking on > behalf of the printing industry by the American Type Founders Company, which > has a well defined policy with regard to the types it is making and has been > making during the last quarter century. In what position, may we ask, would > the printing industry be to-day without the great type families, known to > fame as Cheltenham, Century [long list follows] and others? Are there > anywhere any other type families? Would not your typography be barren in > appearance and much less profitable to the advertisers if these great type > designs had not been developed? There can be but one answer. By the time Nelson died in 1926, ATF seemed to be on the path to permanent profitability. Nelson's successor as president, Frank Belknap Berry (originally one of the founders of the Cleveland Type Foundry), was unpopular with the board and he was soon replaced by Joseph F. Gillick, whose first move was to shut down ATF's subsidiary Barnhard Brothers & Spindler in Chicago and bring their casting operations to Jersey City. Though the years immediately after Nelson's passing were disappointing, 1929 was the most profitable in ATF history.Pankow, David, \\"The Rise and Fall of ATF,\\" Journal of the American Printing History Association, Vol. 22, #1/2  Letterpress manufacturing  From 1914 to 1959 ATF manufactured letterpresses. During the 1920s and 1930s they also sold presses made by Chandler & Price, Laureate, and Thomson National Company. = Kelly Presses = When William M. Kelly (1869‚Äì1949), an employee in the sales department, proposed a design of automatic cylinder press, Nelson immediately authorized the project. The Kelly Style B Press, a three-roller, two-revolution, flat-bed cylinder press with automatic feeder and jogger was introduced in 1914 to great success. By 1923 more than 2,500 Kelly Presses had been sold and the next year production was shifted from Jersey City to a large new factory in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Several models were developed and, by 1949, more than 11,000 Kelly presses had been sold. * Kelly Series B, 17 √ó 22\\" press sheet, produced 1914‚Äì1937 * Kelly Model #2, 22 √ó 34\\" press sheet, introduced in 1921 * Kelly Automatic Jobber, 13 √ó 19.5\\" press sheet, introduced in 1923\\"Specimen Book and Catalog\\", American Type Founders, Jersey City, New Jersey, 1923, pp. 893-94.

These presses continued to be made and sold by the Golding Press Division of ATF until 1927, when the division was sold off to Thomson National Company.Golding Printing Presses , American Amateur Press Association (retrieved 7 October 2010) = Klymax Feeder = In addition to selling presses made by Chandler & Price, ATF produced the Klymax Feeder, which turned C&P;'s hand-fed Gordon jobber press into an automatically fed press.\\"Specimen Book and Catalog\\", American Type Founders, Jersey City, New Jersey, 1923, pp. 898-99. As such presses were ubiquitous, sales of this feeder were robust throughout the 1920s. = Little Giant = In the post-war years, ATF produced the Little Giant Automatic Cylinder Press, a smaller (12\\" x 18\\" sheet size), more compact press of much more modern design than the Kelly presses.\\"ATF Printers Catalog / EX48\\", American Type Founders, Elizabeth, New Jersey, (1948?), p. 150. Production of this press ceased in 1959.\\"The Miehle Vertical\\" by Fred Williams, Type & Press, Summer 1982 (retrieved from Amalgamated Printers' Association on 3 November 2011) Depression and bankruptcy Unfortunately for ATF, unlike printing consumables (like paper and ink), which must be purchased anew for each job, type wears slowly and its purchase can be postponed in hard times, while capital investment in new presses simply dries up, and so ATF was especially hard hit by the Depression. Also, the company had been over-extended in the boom years, too much credit had been extended to the trade, inventories were bloated, and the corps of executives (many left over from pre-consolidation days) were older and without vision. With the financial downturn after 1929 ATF began to see serious distress. In 1931 hours were cut at the factories. The following year, sales were down another 25% and salaries were cut. When major accounting errors showed that company to be even less profitable than was thought, Gillick was forced to resign. Thomas Roy Jones, a businessman with no experience in type founding, replaced Gillick. By 1933 the situation was desperate. Sales of type were less than 30% of 1926 levels while purchases of Kelly presses had plummeted to a mere 6.8% of what they had been. In October 1933 Jones filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy. ATF was placed under the control of its creditors (chiefly consisting of several banks) and drastic measures were taken. Operations were consolidated, the Jersey City plant was closed and the typecasting operations moved to the Kelly plant in Elizabeth. Salesmen were put on a commission basis. Inventories were cut, faces discontinued, and production of several models of Kelly press as well as the Klymax Feeder was shut down. ATF was released from court supervision in 1936 and in 1938 a sales study was made making the following observations: the Kelly press was obsolete, body type was now the exclusive province of line-casters and display type would have to be the mainstay of type production, almost half of what ATF was selling was other manufacturers products that could easily be made in their own facilities, the acquisition of or merger with another firm in the letterpress industry would be desirable, as offset was a rising technology ATF needed to invest in that business. Offset presses In 1938, ATF purchased the Webendorfer-Wills Company and began producing their models of offset press. ATF sold these presses under the Chief name, marketing a Little Chief, Chief, and Big Chief. Large press (as opposed to duplicator) production continued until the late 1970s when the 25\\" Profiteer was discontinued as the basic Webendorfer design became obsolete. Once again, ATF had made the mistake they had with the Kelly press of complacently taking profits from a successful product, not investing in improvements, and eventually seeing this product become irretrievably overtaken by the competition. Beginning in the 1970s, arrangements to sell large offset presses under the Chief name were made with other manufacturers, first with MAN Roland and then with Solna. War work and postwar direction During the Second World War, the ATF plant in Elizabeth was converted almost entirely over to military production. Barth Casters were used to make firing pins and ATF operated two plants in Newark making ordnance. After the war, ill-conceived efforts were made to diversify. A furniture manufacturer, Dystrom Corporation, was acquired. A competitor, Lanston Monotype, was purchased in 1969, but nothing came of this, the assets being sold off later to M&H; Typefounders. The decline of foundry type in this period might well be illustrated by the size of ATF specimen books. While the magnificent 1923 catalog was typical of its day at 1148 pages, subsequent editions were ever smaller. The 1934 catalog was only 207 pages, while the 1941 catalog was only slightly smaller at 191 pages. By 1956 the \\"descriptive index of types\\" was down to only 24 pages, but this recovered a little by 1966's catalog of 30 pages. The last ATF catalog, published in 1976 and distributed right to the end, was down to only 14 pages and, by the 1980s, came with an insert listing the faces that were no longer available. Some innovations did take place during this period however. The brilliant lettering artist Charles H. Hughes was engaged to produce a new version of the popular Century Type that would reproduce the same in offset and letterpress and the result was the lovely Century Nova (1965).\\"Century Nova, New Typeface, Shown at Premiere in Milwaukee,\\" Inland Printer, November 1965, p. 176. ATF also produced the first optically scanning typeface, OCR-A font, in 1969 and this remains the standard on printed bank checks to this day. Photocomposition A venture was made into photocomposition with the ATF Typesetter. Introduced in 1958, the first model was the \\"A\\". Not many were produced because the character fit left much to be desired.http://rocbor.net/typo/PhotoCompo/ATF.htm The most common model was the \\"B\\". Character fit was improved by expanding the Friden Flexowriter \\"Justowriter\\" escape mechanism to seven units.Underwood, Richard G., Production and Manufacturing Problems of American University Presses, Association of American University Presses, 1960. The first seven-unit typeface designed for the ATF Typesetter was a version of Baskerville by Tommy Thompson. The last and most advanced model based on the Friden mechanism was the \\"B-8\\", where an 18-increment system, was achieved by means of a series of electro-mechanical relays that could add one or two increments which were one- third of a unit to selected characters,U. S. Patent 3,333,668 without changing the basic mechanical escape mechanism of the model \\"B\\", except that it was scaled back to six units. This achieved an 18-unit system like that of the Monotype, but a single unit was called an \\"increment\\", while a group of three units was called a \\"unit\\" because those were the units dealt with in the Justowriter mechanism which previous models of the ATF Typesetter used exclusively. ATF also was the authorized sales agent in the United States and several other countries for another film setting machine, the Hadego, which was a headliner, manufactured in the Netherlands from 1951, under license from its inventor, Hans de Goeij.Arthur T. Turnbull, Russel N. Baird, The Graphics of Communication: Typography, Layout, Design, Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, 1968Herman Soblick, Photocomposition Buyers' Guide and Reference Handbook, Quad Publishing Co. Inc., 1964 The last phototypesetter designed and produced by ATF was the Photocomp 20, so named because of its rated speed of twenty 11-pica newspaper lines per minute. It featured four stepper motors (1) to move the film across, (2) to move the type disk, (3) to advance the film to the next line, and (4) to set the size of one unit of escapement. Type disks contained four fonts, each including 17 pi characters. Its controller was the first ATF controller utilizing integrated circuits in place of relays. Circuitry was based on Motorola DTL integrated circuits. Machine styling of the Photocomp 20 was by Richard Arbib. Only 17 machines were sold: one in Vienna Austria, and the remainder in North America. ATF produced type disks with all their popular type faces. These disks were concentric rings of fonts on a transparent plastic material in negative form. Usually these disks contained roman, italic and bold versions of the same face. There was even a disk with the only Canadian type design at the time, called \\"Cartier\\". The ATF Phototypesetter was sold worldwide‚Äîin Canada, Germany, Italy, Denmark, France, Belgium, England, etc. In Denmark, several newspapers were produced on ATF Phototypesetters by a company named \\"Reprodan\\". As technology improved, ATF failed to keep pace and eventually the line was discontinued. Duplicators In the mid-1950s the small offset (duplicator) market was dominated by Addressograph-Multilith's Multi-1250 almost without competition. A study undertaken by Whitin Machine Works, a manufacturer of textile making machinery looking to expand out of an industry depressed by the introduction of synthetic fabrics, suggested that \\"quick printing\\" done with duplicators was a growing market. Whitin thus acquired ATF in 1957, began to manufacture a small (10 x 15\\" sheet size) duplicator at their Whitinsville, Massachusetts facility, and to market this under the name ATF Chief 15. The basic design was by Louis Mestre, and it incorporated many large press features as he had free use of Webendorfer patents. As it gave large press performance, it was an immediate success with commercial printers (who were disdainful of duplicators), and the Chief line remained the best of the small presses until the introduction of Heidelberg's T-Offset in the late 1980s. A larger Chief 17 was introduced in the 1960s and the 1970s saw \\"common blanket\\" two color models of both the 15 and 17. Both Chief models were made and sold in Europe by Gestetner Cyclograph Company, and were also marketed in the United States by the Itek and Ditto corporations.\\"Is it a Chief?\\", Product Bulletin #38, San Diego Printing Parts & Supply, Spring, 1989. Though the Chief could produce superlative work, unlike the highly popular A.B. Dick 350, it required a skilled operator. Unfortunately for ATF, the quick printing industry had less use for such quality work and more need of a \\"fast and dirty\\" duplicator like the 350 and so its market penetration was limited. In 1966 White Consolidated Industries acquired the Whitin Machine Works and with it control of A.T.F,. ATF later purchased the competing Davidson line of duplicators and changed their name to ATF-Davidson. Breaking their pattern of low investment in upgrading technology, ATF actually developed improved models of the Davidson and this line remained competitive right to the end. The Davidson however, was an unusual design (with two, rather than the usual three cylinders) and its popularity remained limited. Divestiture of the foundry By the 1980s the foundry in Elizabeth, New Jersey was down to only six employees and duplicator manufacture was the principle business of ATF-Davidson. In 1986 foundry was sold off to Kingsley Machines, a maker of foil-stamping type, and the merged company was renamed Kingsley/ATF. Immediately a bid was made to enter the field of digital typography with a software subsidiary being set up in Tucson. With its enormous library of type, and its patents on the optical scaling of type, a digital library of ATF types seemed to be a good investment. As the original drawings of the faces were mostly lost, these fonts had to be scanned from brass matrices, a daunting prospect. The work was well done, but slow, and only four faces (Wedding Text, Thompson Quill Script, Bernhard Fashion, and T.M. Cleland's border designs) were ever issued before Kingsley/ATF sought bankruptcy protection in 1993. An auction was held on 23 August 1993 and all the assets of the foundry were sold off, most of the priceless matrices going to scrap dealers. ATF designs remain the property of Kingsley Holding Corporation and are now licensed through Adobe and Bitstream. ATF's factory is now an apartment block. Though ATF is now defunct, some of their original type casting machines and matrix engraving equipment are still in use at The Dale Guild Type Foundry in Howell, New Jersey. This equipment was saved through efforts coordinated by Theo Rehak, the last person trained to run these machines at ATF's Elizabeth, New Jersey facility. ATF-Davidson and successor corporations By the early 1980s, the Chief line needed updating and a crash program was undertaken to produce a press that could compete with the A.B.Dick 9800 series. The SuperChief was thus introduced in 1986 with many flaws. Most of these were worked out, and the basic design was re-launched in 1988 as the X-Press line. Unfortunately, this was too late to save the reputation of the Chief line and the company shut down in July 1990. After a period of confusion, Jim Hughes of Printer's Parts Store purchased the assets of the company and operated under the name of ATF-Graphic Products, selling presses that were on hand and supplying spare parts. Wishing to revive the Davidson line of presses, the Chief line was sold off to Jim Wheet who now supplies parts for existing presses under the name ATF Services Inc.,http://www.atfservices.com/ ATF Services Inc. homepage while it is unclear if Printer's Parts remains interested in reviving the Davidson line of presses.

He also states that the Pacific States Typefoundry became part of the firm while Annenberg (Annenberg, Maurice, \\"TYPE FOUNDRIES OF AMERICA AND THEIR CATALOGS,\\" Oak Knoll Press, New Castle, Delaware, 1994.) says explicitly that they did not. Consuegra also lists a \\"Standard Type Foundry,\\" and an \\"Illinois Type Foundry,\\" for which no further information can be found.

In contrast to the Liberation Front, the Activists Alliance solely and specifically served to gay and lesbian rights, declared themself politically neutral and wanted to work within the political system. Some early members included Jim Owles, Marty Robinson, Tom Doerr, Kay Lahusen, Arthur Bell, Arthur Evans, Bill Bahlman, Vito Russo, Jim Coles, David Thorstad, Michael Giammetta and Morty Manford (son of Jeanne Manford). GAA's first president was Jim Owles.  History  The group was incorporated by Hal Weiner, Esq., of Coles & Weiner, a two-person firm, after Weiner defended Sylvia Rivera in a criminal court proceeding where she had been arrested in Times Square while obtaining signatures on a petition for the first proposed LGBTQ legislation in the New York City Council, Intro 475, and charged with soliciting for the purpose of sex, rather than exercising a civil right to petition. The corporate certificate was rejected by the New York State Division of Corporations and State Records, on the grounds that the name was not a fit name for a New York corporation because of the connotation in which the word \\"gay\\" was being used, and that the corporation was being formed to violate the sodomy laws of New York. It took five years to win the right to incorporate under that name. The founding members,7 men and one woman, of the Gay Activists Alliance were dissatisfied members of the Gay Liberation Front. The group members wanted to form a \\"single issue, politically neutral [organization], whose goal would be to \\"secure basic human rights, dignity and freedom for all gay people.\\" The political neutrality and single-themedness stood in contrast to the Gay Liberation Front, which allied itself with the radical Black Panther Party, criticized the Vietnam War and had a hard left- wing, anti-capitalistic stance. GAA was most active from 1970 to 1974. In one action in March 1970, the GAA organized protests against the police raid on the Snake Pit bar in Greenwich Village and the injuries suffered by Diego Vi√±ales in the resulting chaos. These protests helped spark interest in the upcoming Christopher Street Liberation Day events already planned for . This event, scheduled to commemorate the first anniversary of the Stonewall riots was the first Pride march celebration in the United States. They published the Gay Activist newspaper until 1980. GAA first met at the Church of the Holy Apostles (9th Ave. & 28th St.) Their next New York City headquarters, the Firehouse at 99 Wooster Street in Soho, was occupied in May 1971 and burned down by arsonists on October 15, 1974. \\"By 1980 GAA had begun to sound like the Gay Liberation Front in 1969. After Activists met to officially disband the Alliance a year later...\\" GAA members performed zaps (first conceived by Marty Robinson), raucous public demonstrations designed to embarrass a public figure or celebrity while calling the attention of both gays and straights to issues of LGBT rights. Some of their more visible actions included protests against an anti-gay episode on the popular TV series Marcus Welby, M.D., many zaps of Mayor John Lindsay at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and later at Radio City Music Hall, a zap against Governor Nelson Rockefeller (the \\"Rockefeller 5\\"), a zap at the Marriage License Bureau demanding marriage rights for gays, a zap against Fidelifacts, which provided anti-gay information to employers, a zap at the NYC Taxi Commission (which required gay cab drivers to get an OK from a psychiatrist before being employed), and a zap at the New York Daily News, which printed a scurrilous editorial attacking \\"queers, lezzies, pansies, call them what you will.\\" Four were arrested. Although, GAA was nominally non-violent, zaps could sometimes involve physical altercations and vandalism. GAA co-founder Morty Manford got into scuffles with security and administration during his successful effort to found the student club Gay People at Columbia University in 1971, as well as at a famous protest against homophobia at the elite Inner Circle event in 1972. GAA was associated with a series of combative zaps against homophobic politicians and anti-gay activists in the summer of 1977. Although Time magazine derided them as \\"Gay goons\\", the actions succeeded in keeping the conservative backlash of the late-1970s out of New York state. The GAA Firehouse on Wooster Street also served as a community center and had extremely popular dances that helped fund the organization. The stairwell was decorated with a photomontage agitprop mural created by the British artist Mario Dubsky (1939‚Äì85) and the American painter John Button (1929‚Äì82) both of whom were early victims of AIDS. The Mural was destroyed in the fire that destroyed the centre in 1974. The symbol of the Gay Activists Alliance was the lower case Greek letter lambda (Œª).  Gay Activist Alliance Committees  The Gay Activist Alliance formed multiple sub-committees that allowed the organization to intensely focus on multiple gay and lesbians issue at one time. The committees were named after the issue they were devoted to. The following list of several different sub-committees illustrate the wide-ranging topics the subcommittees covered: Political projects, police power, municipal fair employment law, fair tax, municipal government committee, state government, legal committee, news, leaflets and graphics, fundraising, social affairs, orientations, speakers bureau and agitprop committee.Manuscripts and Archives Division, Thcocke New York Public Library, Astor, Lenox and Tilden Foundations, Gay Activists Alliance Records, \\"Gay Activist Alliance Committee.\\" = Firehouse Committee = This committee was dedicated to the upkeep of the Firehouse, which became its headquarters in 1971.

The purpose of this committee was, \\"to recommend strategy to GAA for demonstrations and lobbying in order to effect passage in the City Council.\\" = Police Power = Similar to the Municipal Fair Employment Law sub-committee, this sub-committee recommended strategies to the rest of the GAA for resisting oppression and discrimination against the gays and lesbian committee. = Political Projects = This committee oversaw all other political sub-committees in the GAA, because this sub-committee's purpose was to recommend the formation of new sub-committees, and also changes in mandates to pre-existing political sub-committees. = Social Affairs = This sub-committee was in charge of organizing and hosting various social events in order to unite the gay and lesbian community. More importantly, it helped raise money for the GAA from admission fees to the social events. = Youth Information Service = This sub-committee is just one example of the Gay Activist Alliance's commitment to gay and lesbian youth. The Youth Information Service was dedicated to offering representative of the GAA to speak, \\"on the topic of Gay Liberation for youthful or youth-orientated groups or organizations especially including high schools and colleges.\\"  See also  * List of LGBT rights organizations * Gay liberation * Gay Liberation Front  References  Further reading =Archival resources= * Gay Activists Alliance Records, 1970‚Äì1983 (11 linear feet) are housed at New York Public Library Manuscripts and Archives Division. * Several collections relating to the Gay Activists Alliance can be found at the Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Community Center's National History Archive in New York City.

Background Godfrey was born in Toronto, Ontario. His father, Senator John Morrow Godfrey (June 28, 1912 ‚Äì March 8, 2001), was a Canadian pilot, lawyer and politician. John Godfrey graduated from Upper Canada College in 1960. In 1961, he attended the Neuch√¢tel Junior College in Neuch√¢tel, Switzerland. In 1965, he received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Trinity College, University of Toronto and in 1967, he received a Master of Philosophy from Balliol College, Oxford and Doctor of Philosophy (DPhil) from St Antony's College, Oxford in 1975. He worked as an economist, historian and journalist. In the mid-1970s Godfrey was a history professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax. He served as president of the University of King's College from 1977-87. From 1987 to 1991 he was editor of the Financial Post.  Politics  He was elected to the House of Commons of Canada as the Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for the Toronto area riding of Don Valley West in the 1993 election, and was re-elected in each subsequent vote until his retirement from federal politics in 2008. During the 1995 Quebec referendum, Godfrey had an acquaintance perform a psychiatric evaluation of separatist leader Lucien Bouchard. In 1996, he and fellow Liberal MP Peter Milliken introduced the Godfrey‚ÄìMilliken Bill a parody of the American Helms‚ÄìBurton Act. The gesture received extensive media coverage including in the United States, where Godfrey was featured on the CBS program 60 Minutes. From 1996 to 2004, Godfrey served as a Parliamentary Secretary under Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien.  Minister of State for Infrastructure and Communities  In 2003, Paul Martin succeeded Chr√©tien as Liberal leader and prime minister. Following the subsequent 2004 election, Godfrey, among other key Martin allies, was appointed to the Cabinet in the role of Minister of State for Infrastructure and Communities. In this role, he was primarily responsible for overseeing the \\"New Deal for Cities\\", Federation of Canadian Municipalities relationship, and other initiatives in Canadian federal-municipal relations. This role was considered a keystone of Martin's industrial strategy. According to Auditor General of Canada Sheila Fraser, Canada lags far behind the US and UK in municipal performance audits for government, in applying its own statements to procurement, and in direct federal standards applying to municipal operations. Godfrey was tasked with dealing with these substantial problems, a role complicated by the fact that, constitutionally, provinces in Canada have formal jurisdiction over cities and municipalities, and have blocked most necessary changes in funding and operations. This is markedly different from in the US where the General Accounting Office has applied specific accounting standards, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency has required specific upgrades to city emergency responses. As in major American cities, federal support of a municipal emergency response is a problem of particular concern in Godfrey's home city of Toronto, following the SARS outbreak, the August 2003 blackout and smog and snow crises. Toronto is also considered to be the primary target for any asymmetric warfare/terrorist attack on Canada. As an additional complexity, Canadian cities faced with gridlock and smog problems due to commuting and urban sprawl, now face Kyoto Accord requirements to cut greenhouse gas output. To deal with these problems, on a national level, Godfrey was directly involved in negotiations regarding climate change auditing and other municipal performance indicators that would apply at least to cities in Canada, and eventually to all municipalities.  Liberal leadership  On February 3, 2006, CBC Newsworld's Don Newman announced on air that Godfrey was planning a run for the Liberal Party leadership.(.ram) Godfrey declared his candidacy on Goldhawk Live on March 19, shortly after the rules and convention date were set. Media reaction was positive, but competed with coverage of Ashley MacIsaac, who declared his intention to run to the Halifax Daily News the next day. In the early stages of the campaign he was recurrently cited as exemplar of intellectualism in the race, being one of three former university professors in the running. Name-recognition remained a challenge, but Godfrey received plaudits in the Canadian blogosphere for his performance in the first all-candidates meeting at the Liberal Party of Alberta convention on April 8. On April 12, 2006, Godfrey announced his withdrawal from the race, due to concerns about his health. On October 20, 2006, Godfrey announced his support for Bob Rae for the federal Liberal leadership. He made the announcement at the National Press Club, on the occasion of a speech by Rae on the environment. Leaving politics Godfrey announced in November 2007, that he would be resigning his seat in parliament on July 1, 2008 and would leave earlier if an election were called before that date. He subsequently delayed his resignation date until August 1. The Conservative Party alleged that the Liberals chose to delay the by-election for financial reasonsIvison, John, \\"Liberal war chest on credit\\", National Post, July 9, 2008.

Retrieved 23 Sept 2011. Radiocarbon dating shows that it was occupied from 3700 BC to 2800 BC, earlier than the similar houses in the settlement at Skara Brae on the Orkney Mainland.Wickham-Jones (2007) p. 40. The site The farmstead consists of two adjacent rounded rectangular thick-walled buildings with very low doorways facing the sea. The larger and older structure is linked by a low passageway to the other building, which has been interpreted as a workshop or a second house. They were constructed on an earlier midden, and were surrounded by midden material which has protected them. There are no windows; the structures were presumably lit by fire, with a hole in the roof to let out smoke. Though they now stand close to the shore, they would have originally lain inland. The shore shows how the local stone splits into thin slabs, giving a ready source of construction material. Looking back through the low entrance doorway into the main house, a visitor's backpack gives an idea of scale. The main house now looks out over the sea. The walls still stand to an eaves height of , and the stone furniture is intact giving a vivid impression of life in the house. Fireplaces, partition screens, beds and storage shelves are almost intact, and post holes were found indicating the roof structure. Evidence from the middens shows that the inhabitants were keeping cattle, sheep and pigs, cultivating barley and wheat and gathering shellfish as well as fishing for species which have to be line caught using boats. Finds of finely-made and decorated Unstan ware pottery link the inhabitants to chambered cairn tombs nearby and to sites far afield including Balbridie and Eilean Domhnuill. The name Howar is believed to be derived from Old Norse word haugr meaning mounds or barrows. The site is in the care of Historic Scotland.

He served one term in the United States House of Representatives and the United States Secretary of the Treasury from December 21, 1968 until January 20, 1969, in President Lyndon B. Johnson's cabinet. He was a member of the Democratic Party  Early life and career  Barr was born in Bicknell, Indiana, on January 17, 1918, the son of Oscar Lynn Barr and Stella Florence Walker. He graduated from DePauw University, and married the former Beth Ann Williston in Indianapolis on September 3, 1939; they had five children: Bonnie Barr Gilliom, Cherry Ann Barr, Joseph Williston Barr, Elizabeth Eugenia Barr LoSasso and Lynn Hamilton Barr Fineberg. He was a member of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and earned a master's degree in economics from Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1941. He served in the United States Navy from 1942 to 1945, during World War II, with subchaser duty in the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean. He received a Bronze Star for sinking a submarine off Anzio Beach. After Barr returned from the war, he engaged in the operation of grain elevators, theaters, real estate and publishing businesses.  Political career  In 1958, he defeated Charles B. Bronson for a seat in Congress from Indiana's 11th congressional district, a Republican stronghold. He was aided by Democratic gains that increased the party's majority from 35 to 129 seats. During his time in the House, he became friends with then-Senator John F. Kennedy. He served only one term before being defeated for re-election in 1960. After his electoral defeat, President Kennedy appointed him as the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Congressional Relations. In 1963, he was appointed Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Barr served as the Undersecretary of the Treasury from 1965 to 1968, during the administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson. When Henry H. Fowler resigned in December 1968, Johnson named Barr as the Secretary of the Treasury with a recess appointment, effective for the remainder of Johnson's term in office. His 28 days in the position was the shortest term of any Treasury Secretary. Given his short period in office, his signature appears only on the one-dollar bill.  Later years  After leaving office, he was named as the vice chairman of American Security and Trust Company. He than served as the president and the chairman from 1969 to 1974 and the chairman of Federal Home Loan Bank in Atlanta, Georgia from 1977 to 1981. Barr died of a heart attack in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, and was interred in Leeds Episcopal Church Cemetery in Hume, Virginia.

The perfective aspect is distinguished from the imperfective aspect, which presents an event as having internal structure (such as ongoing, continuous, or habitual actions). The term perfective should be distinguished from perfect (see below). The distinction between perfective and imperfective is more important in some languages than others. In Slavic languages, it is central to the verb system. In other languages such as German, the same form such as ich ging (\\"I went\\", \\"I was going\\") can be used perfectively or imperfectively without grammatical distinction.Comrie, Aspect (1976), p. 8 In other languages such as Latin the distinction between perfective and imperfective is made only in the past tense (e.g., Latin veni \\"I came\\" vs. veniebam \\"I was coming\\", \\"I used to come\\").Comrie, Aspect (1976), p. 71. However, perfective should not be confused with tense‚Äîperfective aspect can apply to events in the past, present, or future. The perfective is often thought of as for events of short duration (e.g., \\"John killed the wasp\\"). However, this is not necessarily true‚Äîa perfective verb is equally right for a long-lasting event, provided that it is a complete whole, e.g., Tarquinius Superbus regnavit annos quinque et viginti (Livy) \\"Tarquin the Proud reigned for 25 years.\\"Comrie \\"Aspect\\" (1976), pp. 16ff. It simply \\"presents an occurrence in summary, viewed as a whole from the outside, without regard for the internal make-up of the occurrence.\\"Fanning,B.M. Verbal Aspect in New Testament Greek at 97. Oxford:Clarendon, 1990. The perfective is also sometimes described as referring to a \\"completed\\" action, but it would be more accurate to say that it refers to an action or situation that is seen as a complete whole, e.g., the Russian perfective future \\"I shall kill you\\" refers to an event that has not yet been completed.Comrie, Aspect (1976) p. 18. The essence of the perfective is an event seen as a whole. However, most languages that have a perfective use it for various similar semantic roles‚Äîsuch as momentary events and the onsets or completions of events, all of which are single points in time and thus have no internal structure. Other languages instead have separate momentane, inchoative, or cessative aspects for those roles, with or without a general perfective. Equivalents in English English has neither a simple perfective nor imperfective aspect; see imperfective for some basic English equivalents of this distinction. When translating into English from a language that has these aspects, the translator sometimes uses separate English verbs. For example, in Spanish, the imperfective sab√≠a can be translated \\"I knew\\" vs. the perfective supe \\"I found out\\", pod√≠a \\"I was able to\\" vs. pude \\"I succeeded\\", quer√≠a \\"I wanted to\\" vs. quise \\"I tried to\\", no quer√≠a \\"I did not want to\\" vs. no quise \\"I refused\\". The Polish perfective aspect is translated into English as a simple tense and the imperfective as a continuous; for example the imperfective \\"oglƒÖda≈Çem\\" is translated into \\"I was watching\\", while the perfective \\"obejrza≈Çem\\" is translated into \\"I watched\\". Such distinctions are often language-specific.  Marking  Languages may mark perfective aspect with morphology, syntactic construction, lexemes/particles, or other means. * Older Germanic languages: the aspect prefixes ge- (in Old English), gi- (in Old Saxon and Old High German), and ga- (in Gothic) indicate perfective aspects of verbs.Todd B. Krause and Jonathan Slocum, \\"Gothic Online, Lesson 8.\\" * Thai: the aspect marker ‡∏Ç‡∏∂‡πâ‡∏ô , grammaticalized from the word for \\"ascend,\\" indicates a certain type of underconstrained perfective aspect when it follows a main verbKoenig, J.-P., & Muansuwan, N. (2000). How to End Without Ever Finishing: Thai Semi- Perfectivity. JOURNAL OF SEMANTICS. 17, 147-184. Perfective vs. perfect The terms perfective and perfect should not be confused. A perfect tense (abbreviated ' or ') is a grammatical form used to describe a past event with present relevance, or a present state resulting from a past situation. For example, \\"I have put it on the table\\" implies both that I put the object on the table and that it is still there; \\"I have been to France\\" conveys that this is a part of my experience as of now; and \\"I have lost my wallet\\" implies that this loss is troublesome at the present moment. A perfect tense does not necessarily have to be perfective in aspect. For example, \\"I have been waiting here for an hour\\" and \\"I have been going to that doctor all my life\\" are perfect but also imperfective in aspect. There are some languages, however, such as Modern Greek, where the perfect tense is always perfective.Comrie, Aspect (1976), pp. 61ff See also * Ancient Greek verbs: Meanings of the tenses * Chinese grammar: Aspects * Grammatical aspect in Slavic languages Notes  External links  * Greek tenses Category:Grammatical aspects ","title":"Perfective aspect"},{"id":"854028","text":"The imperfective (abbreviated or more ambiguously ) is a grammatical aspect used to describe a situation viewed with interior composition. The imperfective is used in language to describe ongoing, habitual, repeated, or similar semantic roles, whether that situation occurs in the past, present, or future. Although many languages have a general imperfective, others have distinct aspects for one or more of its various roles, such as progressive, habitual, and iterative aspects. The imperfective contrasts with the perfective aspect, which is used to describe actions viewed as a complete whole. English English is an example of a language with no general imperfective. The English progressive is used to describe ongoing events, but can still be used in past tense, such as \\"The rain was beating down\\". Habitual situations do not have their own verb form (in most dialects), but the construction \\"used to\\" conveys past habitual action, as in I used to ski. Unlike in languages with a general imperfective, in English the simple past tense can be used for situations presented as ongoing, such as The rain beat down continuously through the night. A contrast between the progressive and imperfective is seen with stative verbs. In English, stative verbs, such as know, do not use the progressive (*I was knowing French is ungrammatical), while in languages with an imperfective (for instance, French), stative verbs frequently appear in the imperfective. African American Vernacular English does have an imperfective aspect for present tense formed by adding \\"be\\" before the present continuous of a verb, such as \\"he be working\\", or \\"they be eating\\". This is however, considered non-standard in formal conversation. Other languages Verbs in Slavic languages have a perfective and/or an imperfective form. Generally, any of various prefixes can turn imperfectives into perfectives; suffixes can turn perfectives into imperfectives. The non- past imperfective form is used for the present, while its perfective counterpart is used for the future. There is also a periphrastic imperfective future construction.√ñsten Dahl, 1985. Tense and Aspect Systems. Blackwell. The imperfective aspect may be fused with the past tense, for a form traditionally called the imperfect. In some cases, such as Spanish, Portuguese and Modern Greek, this is because the imperfective aspect occurs only in the past tense; others, such as Georgian and Bulgarian, have both general imperfectives and imperfects. Other languages with distinct past imperfectives include Latin and Persian. Perfective The opposite aspect is the perfective (in Ancient Greek, generally called the aorist), which views a situation as a simple whole, without interior composition. (This is not the same as the perfect.) Unlike most other tense‚Äìaspect category oppositions, it is typical for a language not to choose either perfective or imperfective as being generally marked and the other as being generally unmarked. In narrative, one of the uses of the imperfective is to set the background scene (\\"It was midnight. The room was dark. The rain was beating down. Water was streaming in through a broken window. A gun lay on the table.\\"), with the perfective describing foregrounded actions within that scene (\\"Suddenly, a man burst into the room, ran over to the table, and grabbed the gun.\\"). English does not have these aspects. However, the background-action contrast provides a decent approximation in English: :\\"John was reading when I entered.\\" Here 'entered' presents \\"the totality of the situation referred to [...]: the whole of the situation is presented as a single unanalysable whole, with beginning, middle, and end all rolled into one; no attempt is made to divide this situation up into the various individual phases that make up the action of entry.\\"Bernard Comrie, 1976. Aspect. Cambridge University Press This is the essence of the perfective aspect: an event presented as an unanalyzed whole. 'Was reading', however, is different. Besides being the background to 'entered', the form 'reading' presents \\"an internal portion of John's reading, [with] no explicit reference to the beginning or to the end of his reading.\\" This is the essence of the imperfective aspect. Or, to continue the quotation, \\"the perfective looks at the situation from the outside, without necessarily distinguishing any of the internal structure of the situation, whereas the imperfective looks at the situation from inside, and as such is crucially concerned with the internal structure of the situation, since it can both look backwards towards the start of the situation, and look forwards to the end of the situation, and indeed it is equally appropriate if the situation is one that lasts through all time, without any beginning and without any end.\\" This is why, within the past tense, perfective verbs are typically translated into English as simple past, like 'entered', whereas imperfective verbs are typically translated as 'was reading', 'used to read', and the like. (In English, it is easiest to illustrate aspect in the past tense. However, any tense is possible: Present \\"John is reading as I enter\\", future \\"John will be reading when I enter\\", etc.: In each tense, the aspectual distinction is the same.) This aspectual distinction is not inherent to the events themselves, but is decided by how the speaker views them or wishes to present them. The very same event may be described as perfective in one clause, and then imperfective in the next. For example, :\\"John read that book yesterday; while he was reading it, the postman came,\\" where the two forms of 'to read' refer to the same thing. In 'John read that book yesterday', however, John's reading is presented as a complete event, without further subdivision into successive temporal phases; while in 'while he was reading it', this event is opened up, so that the speaker is now in the middle of the situation of John's reading, as it is in the middle of this reading that the postman arrives. The perfective and imperfective need not occur together in the same utterance; indeed they more often do not. However, it is difficult to describe them in English without an explicit contrast like \\"John was reading when I entered.\\" =Combination= The two aspects may be combined on the same verb in a few languages, for perfective imperfectives and imperfective perfectives. Georgian and Bulgarian, for example, have parallel perfective-imperfective and aorist-imperfect forms, the latter restricted to the past tense. In Bulgarian, there are parallel perfective and imperfective stems; aorist and imperfect suffixes are typically added to the perfective and imperfective stems, respectively, but the opposite can occur. For example, an imperfect perfective is used in Bulgarian for a simple action that is repeated or habitual:\\"Bulgarian\\", Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics, ed. 2 Here each sitting is an unanalyzed whole, a simple event, so the perfective root of the verb 'sat' is used. However, the clause as a whole describes an ongoing event conceived of as having internal structure, so the imperfective suffix -eshe is added. Without the suffix, the clause would read simply as In the evening he sat on the veranda.

The shape of Ze is very similar to the Arabic numeral three and the Cyrillic letter E . The new letter is called —ç. History and shape Most Russian typewriters like this one were manufactured without the digit 3 as the letter Ze could be used instead. Ze is derived from the Greek letter Zeta (Œñ Œ∂). In the Early Cyrillic alphabet its name was (zemlja), meaning \\"earth\\". The shape of the letter originally looked similar to a Greek or Latin letter Z with a tail on the bottom (). Though a majuscule form of this variant () is encoded in Unicode, historically it was only used as caseless or lowercase.Ponomar Project. The Complete Character Range for Slavonic Script in Unicode. In the Cyrillic numeral system, Zemlja had a value of 7. Medieval Cyrillic manuscripts and Church Slavonic printed books have two variant forms of the letter Zemlja: –∑ and . Only the form was used in the oldest ustav (uncial) writing style; –∑ appeared in the later poluustav (half-uncial) manuscripts and typescripts, where the two variants are found at proportions of about 1:1. Some early grammars tried to give a phonetic distinction to these forms (like palatalized vs. nonpalatalized sound), but the system had no further development. Ukrainian scribes and typographers began to regularly use –ó/–∑ in an initial position, and otherwise (a system in use till the end of the 19th century). Russian scribes and typographers largely abandoned the widespread use of the variant in favor of –∑ in the wake of Patriarch Nikon's reforms. They still used the older form mostly in the case of two –ó's in row: (the system in use till the mid-18th century). The civil (Petrine) script knows only one shape of the letter: –ó/–∑. However, shapes similar to Z/z can be used in certain stylish typefaces. In calligraphy and in general handwritten text, lowercase –∑ can be written either fully over the baseline (similar to the printed form) or with the lower half under the baseline and with the loop (for the Russian language, a standard shape since the middle of the 20th century).

Pencil and watercolour by John Ruskin. (1845) The Ca' d'Oro or Palazzo Santa Sofia is a palace on the Grand Canal in Venice, northern Italy. One of the older palaces in the city, its name means \\"golden house\\" due to the gilt and polychrome external decorations which once adorned its walls. Since 1927, it has been used as a museum, as the Galleria Giorgio Franchetti. It has long been regarded as the best surviving palazzo in Venetian Gothic architecture, retaining all the most characteristic features, despite some losses. On the facade, the loggia-like window group of closely spaced small columns, with heavy tracery with quatrefoil openings above, uses the formula from the Doge's Palace that had become iconic. There are also the byzantine- inspired decoration along the roofline, and patterning in fancy coloured stone to the flat wall surfaces. The smaller windows show a variety of forms with an ogee arch, capped with a relief ornament, and the edges and zone boundaries are marked with ropework reliefs. History The palace was built between 1428 and 1430 for the Contarini family, who provided Venice with eight Doges between 1043 and 1676. The architects of the Ca d'Oro were Giovanni Bon and his son Bartolomeo Bon. Following the fall of the Venetian Republic in 1797, the palace changed ownership several times. In 1846, Alessandro Trubetzkoi, purchased the palace, which was in a ruinous state, as a gift for ballet dancer Marie Taglioni. The reckless renovation of the architect resulted in his imprisonment under charges of vandalism. In the end, many of the Gothic features, including the stairway of the inner courtyard and the balconies which overlooked the courtyard, were removed. In 1894, the palace was acquired by its last owner, baron Giorgio Franchetti; throughout his lifetime, he amassed an important art collection and personally oversaw its extensive restoration, including the reconstruction of the stairway and the Cosmatesque courtyard with ancient marbles. In 1916, Franchetti bequeathed the Ca' d'Oro to the Italian State. It is now open to the public as a gallery: Galleria Giorgio Franchetti alla Ca' d'Oro. Description The principal fa√ßade of Ca' d'Oro facing onto the Grand Canal is built in the Bons' floral Venetian Gothic style. Other nearby buildings in this style are Palazzo Barbaro and the Palazzo Giustinian. This linear style favoured by the Venetian architects was not superseded by Venetian Renaissance architecture until the end of the 15th century, or later. On the ground floor, a recessed colonnaded loggia gives access to the entrance hall (portego de mezo) directly from the canal. Above this colonnade is the enclosed balcony of the principal salon on the piano nobile. The columns and arches of this balcony have capitals which in turn support a row of quatrefoil windows; above this balcony is another enclosed balcony or loggia of a similar yet lighter design. The palace has (like other similar buildings in Venice) a small inner courtyard. The neighboring palace is Palazzo Giustinian Pesaro.  Museum  An exhibition hall on the second floor of the building The gallery houses the collection of works of art collected by Giorgio Franchetti in his life. Following the donation to the Italian State in 1916 and in preparation for the museum, the Franchetti collection was accompanied by some state collections from which most of the bronzes and sculptures on display come from, as well as numerous Venetian and Flemish paintings . Among the most valuable works are the San Sebastiano by Andrea Mantegna and the Portrait of Marcello Durazzo by Antoon van Dyck. In addition to the exhibition rooms, the museum houses various laboratories for the conservation and restoration of works of art.

In the Early Cyrillic alphabet its name was (kako), meaning \\"as\\". In the Cyrillic numeral system, Ka had a value of 20. Form The Cyrillic letter Ka looks very similar, and corresponds to the Latin letter K. In some fonts, Cyrillic Ka is generally differentiated from its Latin and Greek counterparts by drawing its diagonal spurs with curves instead of straight lines. In other fonts, the lowercase form of Ka has the vertical bar elongated above x-height, thus resembling the Latin lowercase K.

Pronunciation It is a so- called iotated vowel, pronounced in isolation as , like the pronunciation of in \\"human\\". After a consonant, no distinct sound is pronounced, but the consonant is softened. The exact pronunciation of the vowel sound of in Russian depends also on the succeeding sound because of allophony.

History Apart from the form I-O, in early Slavonic manuscripts the letter appears also in a mirrored form O-I (). It is the latter form that is probably the original, precisely displaying the Greek combination omicron-iota (ŒøŒπ). At the time that the Greek alphabet was adapted to the Slavonic language giving rise to the Cyrillic alphabet, it denoted the close front rounded vowel in educated Greek speech.

A leading proponent of Stalinism in Poland for nearly a decade after the Soviet takeover, Kott renounced his Communist Party membership in 1957 following the anti-Stalinist Polish October of 1956. He defected to the United States in 1965. He is regarded as having considerable influence upon Western productions of Shakespeare in the second half of the 20th century.Jan Kott Dies; Helped Recast Shakespeare  Article from The Washington Post  HighBeam Research Life Born in Warsaw in 1914 to a Jewish family, Kott was baptized into the Catholic Church at the age of five. He became a communist in the 1930s, and took part in the defense of Warsaw. In June 1939 he married Lidia Steinhaus, the daughter of the mathematician and educator Hugo Steinhaus. In September 1939, Kott fought in the Polish army in its futile campaign against the German invasion and then, after a period in Lvov, returned to Nazi-occupied Warsaw. After World War II he became known initially as the editor-in-chief of the literary magazine Ku≈∫nica and as Poland's leading theorist of Socialist realism. In 1949, as the communist authorities tightened their control over all aspects of life, Kott obtained a position as a professor in Wroc≈Çaw and moved away from political life. He praised Joseph Stalin, but mostly concentrated on theater. In 1951, during the darkest period of Soviet terror, Kott published an ideological manifesto about the role of theater, entitled \\"O teatr godny naszej epoki\\" (For theater worthy of our times), in which he demanded a \\"new\\" theater subservient to the Party and its ideology. Historian Teresa Wilniewczyc noted, that his zeal for totalitarian control over the world of Polish culture was \\"far more than was required\\". Only after the Stalin era came to an end, did he become its ardent critic (March 1956). He renounced his membership of the communist party in 1957. In 1964 he was one of the signatories of the so-called Letter of 34 to Prime Minister J√≥zef Cyrankiewicz regarding freedom of culture. =Later career= Kott traveled to the United States in 1965 on a scholarship from the Ford Foundation. He lectured at Yale and Berkeley, but spent the years 1969 to 1983 teaching at Stony Brook University until he retired. The Polish authorities refused to extend his passport after three years, at which point he decided to defect. As a result, he was stripped of his professorship at Warsaw University. A poet, translator, and literary critic, he became one of the more prolific essayists of the Polish school in America. He died in Santa Monica, California after a heart attack in 2001.Jan Kott Dies; Helped Recast Shakespeare  Article from The Washington Post  HighBeam Research As a theatrical reviewer, Kott received praise for his readings of the classics, and above all of Shakespeare. In his influential volume Shakespeare, Our Contemporary (1964), he interpreted the plays in the light of philosophical and existential experiences of the 20th century, augmented with his own life's story. This autobiographical accent became a hallmark of his criticism, as exemplified in his collection of essays on theater, The Gender of Rosalind. Kott sought to juxtapose Shakespeare with Eug√®ne Ionesco and Samuel Beckett, but his greatest insight came from the juxtaposition of Shakespeare with his own life. He took a similar approach to his reading of Greek tragedy in The Eating of the Gods. Reportedly, Peter Brook's film King Lear and Roman Polanski's Macbeth (both made in 1971) were influenced by Kott's view of Shakespearean high tragedy in relation to the 20th-century \\"nightmare of history\\". Another Kott collection of essays, The Memory of the Body: Essays on Theatre and Death, extended his influence beyond theater in the English-speaking world. Kott wrote many books and articles published in American journals such as The New Republic, Partisan Review and The New York Review of Books. Aside from Shakespeare and Greek tragedy, he also wrote about Japanese theater, Tadeusz Kantor and Jerzy Grotowski. He translated works by Jean-Paul Sartre, Denis Diderot, Eug√®ne Ionesco and Moli√®re into Polish and English.

The screenplay by Jay Cocks is based on the life and career of Cole Porter, from his first meeting with his wife, Linda Lee Thomas, until his death. It is the second biopic about the composer, following 1946's Night and Day. Plot As he is about to die, Porter's life flashes before him in the form of a musical production staged by the archangel Gabriel in the Indiana theater where the composer first performed on stage. He recalls the night he met his wife, Linda Lee Thomas, a recent divorcee and stunning beauty. From the start, they click and become a devoted couple. Linda is well aware that Cole is gay. Her first husband was abusive to her, but, as she confesses to him on their wedding day, Cole is completely different. Because he loves her and is publicly affectionate, Linda tolerates his extramarital dalliances. During their marriage, Cole's career flourishes. Linda begins the tradition of presenting Cole with a custom designed and engraved Cartier cigarette case at the opening of each new show. To cheer Linda after she experiences a miscarriage, the couple move to Hollywood. After an initial period of excitement, Cole's flings become too overt and indiscreet and they create tension. Cole is photographed in an amorous embrace with another man in the restroom of a gay nightclub. Both he and Linda are blackmailed into paying a large sum to suppress publication of the pictures. When he shrugs off the blackmail, she goes to Paris, leaving him bereft. It is not until Cole is seriously injured in a horseback riding accident that Linda returns to his side, willing to forgive, but still finding difficulty in coping with his extramarital affairs. She is eventually diagnosed with emphysema, and in an attempt to provide Cole with a new partner once she is gone, she introduces him to her decorator and estate advisor. The match is successful. When Linda dies in 1954, Cole is devastated. He continues working until 1958, however, until degeneration of his bad leg finally requires amputation, affecting his creative output. He never writes again, but does participate in productions of his earlier works. Cole dies in 1964 at age 73.

Production Although Porter was a passable singer at best, director Irwin Winkler cast Kevin Kline, winner of two Tony Awards and two Drama Desk Awards for his musical performances on Broadway, as the composer. He stayed in character by limiting his vocal range. Most of his singing was recorded live on the set, and the actor played the piano himself in the scenes where Porter plays. According to Winkler's commentary on the DVD release of the film, he had considered numerous actresses for the role of Linda when Ashley Judd's agent advised him she was interested in the part. Winkler was certain her salary demand would exceed that allowed by the budget, but the actress was so anxious to portray Linda she was willing to lower her usual asking price. Judd is twenty years younger than Kline, although the composer's wife was eight years older than he. Filming locations included Chiswick House and Luton Hoo. The film premiered at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival. It was shown at the CineVegas International Film Festival, the Sydney Film Festival, and the San Francisco International Lesbian and Gay Film Festival before going into limited release in the US.

Critically, the film had a mixed reception. It garnered a score of 53 from Metacritic and a 48% rating from review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. Roger Ebert gave the film 3.5 out of a possible four stars. He wrote, for his review in the Chicago Sun- Times, that De-Lovely \\"...brings [...] a worldly sophistication that is rare in the movies\\". Larry King said: \\"Far and away the best musical biography ever made.\\" In his review in The New York Times, Stephen Holden called the film \\"lethally inert\\" and \\"lifeless and drained of genuine joie de vivre\\" and added, \\"It didn't have to be like this. In their highly stylized ways, All That Jazz (Bob Fosse's morbidly manic screen autobiography), Ken Russell's surreal portraits of composers or any of Federico Fellini's libidinous self- explorations have delved deeply into the muck of artistic creativity. Sadly, the daring and imagination required to go below the surface are nowhere to be found in De-Lovely.\\" Ruthe Stein of the San Francisco Chronicle said, \\"The movie never gels ‚Äì despite Kline's nuanced performance, the stars' exquisite period clothes designed by Armani, and, of course, Porter's great songs. Director Irwin Winkler's highly stylized technique is difficult to connect with emotionally. His film also suffers from shockingly sloppy editing for a studio production. If nothing else, the composer . . . deserves a movie that has rhythm. But De- Lovely lurches along like a car with a missing spark plug.\\" In Rolling Stone, Peter Travers rated the film three out of a possible four stars and commented, \\"In voice, manner, patrician charm and private torment, Kevin Kline is perfection as legendary composer Cole Porter . . . At its best, De-Lovely evokes a time, a place and a sound with stylish wit and sophistication.\\" Steve Persall of the St. Petersburg Times graded the film C- and observed, \\"The movie is actually an ugly compilation of clashing cinematic styles occasionally salvaged by musical numbers that essentially are part of the problem. You can't make a good movie about a 1930s composer using a 1970s film conceit while hiring 21st century recording artists to perform Porter's classic songs. A tribute CD, maybe, but not a movie . . . [it] plays like a cabaret review rather than a motion picture, a sublime collection of songs linked by scripted banter barely scratching the surface of its subject. Not delightful, not delicious, just disappointing.\\"St. Petersburg Times review Billboard reported that the film \\"has inspired a Cole Porter renaissance on Top Jazz albums\\". By the end of July 2004, the film's soundtrack reached 4‚Äì3 on Top Soundtracks and 77‚Äì58 on The Billboard 200. The film also boosted chart numbers for the then-recently released compilations albums: The Very Best of Cole Porter, Ultra Lounge: Cocktails With Cole Porter, and It's De Lovely - The Authentic Cole Porter Collection.

It is often but not always an extended journey,\\"Travel or hike carrying one's belongings in a backpack: [e.g.] a week's backpacking in the Pyrenees, [or] he has backpacked around the world\\" (New Oxford American Dictionary). and may or may not involve camping outdoors. In North America tenting is common, where simple shelters and mountain huts, widely found in Europe, are rare. In New Zealand, tramping is the term applied though overnight huts are frequently used.H. W. Orsman, The Dictionary of New Zealand English. Auckland: Oxford University Press, 1999. Hill walking is an equivalent in Britain (but this can also refer to a day walk), though backpackers make use of all kinds of accommodation, in addition to camping. Backpackers use simple huts in South Africa. Trekking and bushwalking are other word used to describe such multi- day trips. Backpacking as a method of travel is a different activity, which mainly uses public transport during a journey which can last months. Definition A backpacker during the California Gold Rush Backpacking is an outdoor recreation where gear is carried in a backpack. This can include food, water, bedding, shelter, clothing, stove, and cooking kit. Given that backpackers must carry their gear, the total weight of their bag and its contents is a primary concern of backpackers. Backpacking trips range from one night to weeks or months, sometimes aided by planned resupply points or drops. Accommodations The Pocosin cabin along the Appalachian trail in Shenandoah National Park Backpacking camps are usually more spartan than campsites where gear is transported by car or boat. In areas with heavy backpacker traffic, a hike-in campsite might have a fire ring (where permissible), an outhouse, a wooden bulletin board with a map and information about the trail and area. Many hike-in camps are no more than level patches of ground free of underbrush. In remote wilderness areas hikers must choose their own site. Established camps are rare and the ethos is to \\"leave no trace\\" when gone. In some regions, varying forms of accommodation exist, from simple log lean-to's to staffed facilities offering escalating degrees of service. Beds, meals, and even drinks may be had at Alpine huts scattered among well-traveled European mountains. Backpackers there can walk from hut-to-hut without leaving the mountains, while in places like the Lake District or Yorkshire Dales in England hill-walkers descend to stay in Youth hostels, farmhouses or guest houses. In the more remote parts of Great Britain, especially Scotland, bothies exist to provide simple (free) accommodation for backpackers. On the French system of long distance trails, Grande Randonn√©es, backpackers can stay in g√Ætes d'etapes, which are simple hostels provided for walkers and cyclists. There are some simple shelters and occasional mountain hut also provided in North America, including on the Appalachian trail. Another example is the High Sierra Camps in the Yosemite National Park. Long-distance backpacking trails with huts also exist in South Africa, including the 100 km plus Amatola Trail, in the Eastern Cape Province. Backpacking (trekking) is also popular in the Himalayas, where porters and pack animals are often used.  Equipment  A backpacker's modern lightweight dome tent near Mount Anne in a Tasmanian Wilderness area Backpacking gear begins with (1) a suitable backpack, proper both in size and fit. Backpacks in general fall into one of four categories: frameless, external frame, internal frame, and bodypack. (2) Clothing and footwear appropriate for expected conditions. (3) Sufficient food. (4) Some form of sleep system such as a sleeping bag and, perhaps, a foam pad. (5) Survival gear. A shelter appropriate to expected conditions is typically next. Practical items not already mentioned - cook kit, stove, container for water, a means of purifying it - are characteristically but not always taken in some form. Depending on the trip ready-to-eat foods may suffice and suitable water be found along the way. More minimalist backpackers find ways to do with less. Weight is always critical. A rule of thumb suggests a fully loaded backpack should weigh no more than 25% of a person's weight. Every single item is scrutinized, many removed the first time a pack is hefted. Lightweight gear is widely available, which may or may not sacrifice utility and durability but will almost always cost more. A wide variety of items utilizing carbon fiber, lightweight alloys, specialty plastics, and impregnated fabrics are available. = Water = canteen with nested canteen cup and cover Proper hydration is critical to successful backpacking. Depending on conditions - which include weather, terrain, load, and the hiker's age and fitness - a backpacker needs anywhere from 1/2 to 2 gallons (2 to 8 liters), or more, per day. At per water is exceptionally heavy. It is impossible to carry more than a few days' supply. Thus provisions for adequate water on a backpacking trip must be made in advance, which generally means filtering or purifying natural water supplies. Even in most seemingly pristine areas water needs treatment before consumption to protect against waterborne diseases carried by bacteria and protozoa. The chief treatment methods include: * Boiling over fire, stove, or other heat source * Treatment with chemicals such as chlorine or iodine * Filtering (often used in conjunction with chemical treatments) * Treatment with ultraviolet light Water may be stored in appropriate bottles or collapsible plastic bladders. Hydration packs are increasingly popular. =Food= Baking oatcakes on a gas-fueled backpacking stove Backpacking is energy intensive. It is essential enough food is taken to maintain both energy and health. As with gear, weight is critical. Consequently, items with high food energy, long shelf life, and low mass and volume deliver the most utility. Satisfaction is another consideration, of greater or lesser importance to all hikers. Only they can decide whether it's worth the effort (and trade-off against other gear) to carry fresh, heavy, or luxury food items. The shorter the trip and easier the conditions the more feasible such treats become. In all cases, both kit and fuel necessary to prepare and serve foodstuffs selected is part of the equation. Small liquid and gas fueled campstoves and ultralight cooking pots are the norm. Increasingly campfires are prohibited. Cooking in the outdoors using a heated stone While most backpackers consume at least some specially prepared foods, many mainly rely on ordinary low moisture household items, such as cold cereal, oatmeal, powdered milk, cheese, crackers, sausage, salami, dried fruit, peanut butter, pasta, rice, and commercially packaged dinner entrees. Popular snacks include trail mix, easily prepared at home; nuts, energy bars, chocolate, and other forms of candy for quick energy and satisfaction. Jerky and pemmican are high- energy and lightweight. Coffee, tea, and cocoa are common beverages. Domestic items are typically repackaged in zippered plastic bags. Canned or jarred food, except for meats or small delicacies, is avoided: their containers and moist contents are usually heavy, and the metal or glass must be packed out. Food dehydrators are popular for drying fruit, jerky, and pre-cooked meals. Many hikers use freeze-dried precooked entrees for hot meals, quickly reconstituted by adding boiling water. An alternative is Ultra High Temperature (UHT) processed food, which has its moisture retained and merely needs heating with a special, water-activated chemical reaction. MRE packets: beef teriyaki and meatloaf with gravy These have roots in the U.S. military's MRE, and eliminate the need for a stove, fuel, and water. Against this, they are heavy, the water is already in the food, and they require their own fuel. Still, they have some attractions. They: * Do not need to be rehydrated or heated, useful where flames are prohibited and water is scarce. * Are very durably packaged * Contain a full meal complete with snack and dessert in every package * Offer a great deal of variety in each meal, including condiments * Individually package their components, allowing some to be stored accessibly and eaten on the move MREs can be difficult to find in retail stores, though a good selection is often available in a (U.S.) military surplus store. Specialized cookbooks are available on trailside food and the challenges inherent in making it. Some focus on planning meals and preparing ingredients for short trips. Others on the challenges of organizing and preparing meals revolving around the bulk rationing prevalent in extended trail hikes, particularly those with pre-planned food drops.  Skills and safety  A bear-resistant food storage canister Trekking route 14 in Zerfenti (Ethiopia) * Survival skills can provide peace of mind and may make the difference between life and death when the weather, terrain, or environment turns unexpectedly for the worse. * Navigation and orienteering are useful to find the trailhead, then find and follow a route to a desired sequence of destinations, and then an exit. In case of disorientation, orienteering skills are important to determine the current location and formulate a route to somewhere more desirable. At their most basic, navigation skills allow one to choose the correct sequence of trails to follow. In situations where a trail or clear line-of-sight to the desired destination is not present, navigation and orienteering allow the backpacker to understand the terrain and wilderness around them and, using their tools and practices, select the appropriate direction to hike. Weather (rain, fog, snow), terrain (hilly, rock faces, dense forest), and hiker experience can all impact and increase the challenges to navigation in the wilderness. * First aid: effectively dealing with minor injuries (splinters, punctures, sprains) is considered by many a fundamental backcountry skill. More subtle, but maybe even more important, is recognizing and promptly treating hypothermia, heat stroke, dehydration and hypoxia, as these are rarely encountered in daily life. * Leave No Trace is the backpacker's version of the golden rule: To have beautiful and pristine places to enjoy, help make them. At a minimum, don't make them worse. * Distress signaling is a skill of last resort.  Related activities  =Winter backpacking= bivouac in Germany. Winter backpacking requires a higher level of skill and generally more specialized gear than in other seasons. Skis or snowshoes may be required to traverse deep snow, or crampons and an ice axe where needed. Winter sleeping bags and tents are essential, as are waterproof, water-repellent, and moisture dissipating materials. Cotton clothing retains moisture and chills the body, both particularly dangerous in cold weather. Winter backpackers stick to wool or synthetic fabric like nylon or polypropylene, which hold less moisture and often have specialized wicking properties to dissipate sweat generated during aerobic activities. Layering is essential, as wet clothes quickly sap body heat and can lead to frostbite or hypothermia. A winter bivouac can also be made in a snow cave. It has thermal properties similar to an igloo and is effective both at providing protection from wind and low temperatures. A properly made snow cave can be 0 ¬∞C (32 ¬∞F) or warmer inside, even when outside temperatures are ‚àí40 ¬∞C (‚àí40 ¬∞F). It is constructed by excavating snow so that its entrance tunnel is below the main space in order to retain warm air. Construction is simplified by building on a steep slope and digging slightly upwards and horizontally into the snow. The roof is domed to prevent dripping on the occupants. Adequate snow depth, free of rocks and ice, is needed ‚Äî generally is sufficient. A quinzhee is similar, but constructed by tunneling into mounded snow rather than by digging into a natural snow formation. =Fastpacking= Fastpacking is a recreational activity that combines lightweight backpacking with running, and, on steep slopes, hiking.

He was also known for the unusual bat he played with throughout much of his career. Known as \\"Excalibur\\", the shoulders of the bat were planed down to form a conical rather than rectangular shape. Cairns was a swing bowler with an unorthodox 'front on' action. He took 130 Test Match wickets and 89 ODI wickets. He took ten wickets in New Zealand's first ever win on English soil, at Headingley in 1983. Domestic career In a domestic match, for Otago v Wellington, he hit 110, his only first-class century, in 51 balls hitting 9 sixes in an hour. He scored 928 Test Match and 987 ODI runs at more than a run a ball. International career He was a member of both the one- day and Test New Zealand teams between 1974 and 1985. He also appeared for Central Districts, Northern Districts and Otago in New Zealand domestic cricket. He was also the professional for Bishop Auckland in the North Yorkshire and South Durham League in the North East of England. =Record hitting= New Zealand were favourites coming into the finals of the World Series Cup, a tournament heavily hyped as a chance for New Zealand to gain 'revenge' after the 'underarm' incident in 1980/81. The 1982/83 series saw New Zealand achieve an impressive run of victories in the ten match qualifying round with Australia and England. This included three consecutive wins over Australia and a famous match in Adelaide, where two world records were broken on the same day. New Zealand scored a world record 297‚Äì6, in beating England's 296‚Äì5. Cairns set the scene for a dramatic run chase with 49 off 24 balls, which included three sixes off the English spinners. However, it took a match- winning seventh-wicket partnership of 121 by Jeremy Coney (47 not out) and 'Man of the Match' Richard Hadlee (79), to bring New Zealand home for an 'impossible' victory, watched by nearly 1.5 million Kiwis on television, almost half the population and a record for a sporting telecast at the time. After a rain-affected First Final in Sydney, New Zealand went to the MCG one- nil down in the best of three finals series. Without the injured Hadlee (who missed both Finals), New Zealand had collapsed, beaten and demoralised, at 44‚Äì6, chasing Australia's score of 302‚Äì8. Dennis Lillee, who had just waved off New Zealand's last recognised batsman, awaited the arrival of Cairns. Lillee's first ball was a bouncer that hit Cairns on the head. The batsman's response was to hit two sixes in three balls off Ken MacLeay, before hitting two consecutive sixes off Rodney Hogg, and in the next over, doing the same to Lillee. The highlight was undoubtedly a one-handed shot off Lillee, which soared over the fine leg fence. Cairns' dismissal was an anti-climax; out for 52, offering a simple catch to Steve Smith at cover off the bowling of Geoff Lawson. \\"He backs off again and thrashes that one! And that's cleared Graeme Wood's head at mid-off! That's the sixth one! That must be an incredible bat he's got! It must be made of extremely good English willow.\\" > \\"Very heavy English willow ! And there goes Excalibur into action again! > Straight over the top of long-off, one of the most difficult shots in the > book and umpire Tony Crafter's arms are growing heavy, he's been putting > them above his head so often he's getting tired!\\" \\\\- TCN Nine commentators Ian Chappell and Frank Tyson, 13 February 1983. New Zealand eventually lost the match by 149 runs, and the Finals series 2‚Äì0, to an Australian team that had been markedly inferior in the preceding qualifying stages of the competition. Despite Cairns' heroics (he also hit a spectacular six over cover off Lawson in the First Final at the SCG) Richard Hadlee's absence from both finals was probably the reason for New Zealand's 'shattered dream'. Nevertheless, the New Zealand team, and Cairns in particular, received unprecedented adulation when they returned home for a three-match series against England, who had lost the Ashes 2-1 and had failed to make the WSC Finals in their recently completed Australian tour. England were desperate to salvage something from their tour down under and 'The Rothmans Cup' was the last prize on offer. New Zealand whitewashed the hapless 'Poms', winning with three memorable performances to sold-out crowds in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch. Cairns was again the star. He hit sixes in all three games, with one of them leaving Wellington's Basin Reserve and ending up in a busy street outside the ground. In the 1983/84 home series against England Cairns took his best test figures of 7-143 off 45 overs in the first test at the Basin Reserve, Wellington. After New Zealand's modest first innings total of 219, Cairns took the first five English wickets with only 115 on the board, which put the home side in a strong position on day two. However, a spectacular sixth wicket, 232 run, partnership between Ian Botham (138) and Derek Randall (164) put the visitors in command on day three with New Zealand facing a tough battle over the remaining two days to save the test. At 402‚Äì8, only 158 runs ahead of England early on day five, defeat for New Zealand seemed likely when Cairns joined Jeremy Coney (174*) at the wicket. In perhaps Cairns' finest test innings, (64), he shared a record ninth wicket partnership of 118 with Coney who went on to score his long-awaited, maiden test century. Cairns, although hitting 10 fours and a six, played a rearguard innings best remembered for its uncharacteristic grit and controlled determination, which helped New Zealand achieve a famous draw against the odds. The New Zealand total of 537 was a record against England and it set the foundation for an emphatic second test win by an innings and 132 runs at Lancaster Park, Christchurch, where the visitors failed to reach 100 in either innings. After a drawn third test at Eden Park, Auckland, New Zealand achieved its first test series win over England. =Injury and playing= Cairns suffered a horrific injury when he came out to bat without a helmet against Pakistan in the Third Test in Dunedin in 1984/85. He was felled by a sickening blow to the back of the head from 19-year-old paceman Wasim Akram. After retiring hurt, Cairns was hospitalised with a suspected hairline fracture of the skull and complained of 'dizzy spells' for months afterwards. In testament to his courage, Cairns was 'padded up', this time with a helmet, ready to return to the crease, as New Zealand fought another famous rearguard action to win the test and series. History showed he was not required as Jeremy Coney (111*), this time supported by number eleven Ewen Chatfield (21*), took New Zealand to victory by two wickets. Cairns recovered to play in the World Championship of Cricket in Sydney and Melbourne in February 1985. A highlight for Cairns was his fine innings against eventual champions India in the semi-final at the SCG (39 out of a total of 206, but with no sixes). In March he left for his last major tour as a frontline player for New Zealand, a harrowing trip to the West Indies where New Zealand lost heavily against the often brutal fast bowling of the homeside. Cairns played in only the first two tests of the four test series taking only five wickets at an average of 63.00. At aged 36 his decline as an international player seemed inevitable. =Later career= His final series for New Zealand was a personal anti-climax for this immensely popular cricketer. The historic 1985/86 test series win in Australia saw Cairns play only in the deciding third test in Perth. Although playing in his usual spirited fashion, Cairns failed to take a wicket, nor score a run, in this his final international game. Despite Cairns' disappointment, New Zealand won by six wickets to take the series 2‚Äì1, and it was fitting, considering his unselfish service to New Zealand cricket since 1974, that Cairns was part of this 'ultimate' triumph. Still a sentimental crowd favourite, he was nevertheless left out of the New Zealand World Series Cup squad which returned to Australia in January 1986. This unpopular decision, albeit inevitable due to injury and loss of form, spelled the end of his international career. Like long standing captain Geoff Howarth at the beginning of the summer, Cairns was forced into retirement, and somewhat controversially denied the dignity of choosing his own 'time to go'. Personal life Cairns has been profoundly deaf since age 17, which he blamed on working in noisy conditions. In December 2009 he was fitted with a cochlear implant. He is the Ambassador for The National Foundation for the Deaf Inc. and is instrumental in raising awareness for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing communities. Cairns was the subject of an episode of the TVNZ production This is your life in 1998 which was presented by Paul Holmes. Following his retirement from cricket, Cairns concentrated on his golf skills and became a low-handicap golfer known for his extremely long drives. After relocating to Gisborne, he met and later married Carol Edwards, who died in 2008 from cancer. He represented Poverty Bay-East Coast at New Zealand Masters tournaments.

Once seen as a marginal form of travel undertaken only through necessity, it has since become a mainstream form of tourism. While backpacker tourism is generally a form of youth travel, primarily undertaken by young people during gap years, it is also undertaken by older people during a career break or retirement. Backpackers tend to be from Europe, the English-speaking world and Asia. Characteristics Backpacker tourism generally, but does not always, include: * Traveling mostly via public transport. * Using inexpensive lodging such as hostels or homestays. * A longer duration trip when compared with conventional vacations. * An interest in meeting locals as well as seeing sights. * An interest in meeting other travelers. * Backpacker tourism may also include working in various countries for short stints, depending on work permit laws. It can also be undertaken by digital nomads, people who work using technology while living a nomadic lifestyle. * A search for authenticity. Backpacking is perceived not only as a form of tourism, but a means of education. Backpackers want to experience what they consider the \\"real\\" destination rather than a packaged version often associated with mass tourism. History People have travelled for thousands of years with their possessions on their backs, but usually out of need rather than for recreation. In the 17th century, Italian adventurer Giovanni Francesco Gemelli Careri was likely one of the first people to engage in backpacker tourism. The modern popularity of backpacking can be traced, at least partially, to the hippie trail of the 1960s and 1970s, which in turn followed sections of the old Silk Road. Some backpackers follow the same trail today. Since the late-20th century, backpackers have visited Southeast Asia in large numbers =Benefits= A 2018 study of over 500 backpackers conducted by researchers at Sun Yat-sen University and Shaanxi Normal University in China and Edith Cowan University in Australia showed that for Westerners, backpacking leads to acquired capabilities like effective communication, decision-making, adaptability, and problem solving, all of which contribute to an increase in self-efficacy, and for Chinese backpackers, acquiring skills like time and money management, language development, stress management, and self-motivation provided the biggest increase in self-efficacy. For many low-income communities in the developing world, the economic benefits of hosting backpackers outweigh their negative impacts. Since backpackers tend to consume local products, stay in small guest houses, and use locally owned ground transport, more of their expenditure is retained in-country than in conventional mass tourism. businesses that cater to backpackers are usually locally owned and profits tend to be retained within the country rather than flowing overseas to international hotel groups. =Criticism= Backpacker tourism of the hippie trail has been criticized for possibly encouraging urban liberal minorities while insulting Islamic traditionalist theology, possibly leading to the Islamic reawakening in the late 1970s. Even though one of the primary aims of backpacking is to seek the \\"authentic\\", the majority of backpackers spend most of their time interacting with other backpackers, and interactions with locals are of \\"secondary importance\\". Backpacker tourism has been criticized for the transformation of some sleepy towns, such as the creation of the Full Moon Party on Ko Pha-ngan in Thailand, which includes \\"scores of topless teenagers urinating into the ocean\\". Variants Flashpacking and Poshpacking refer to backpacking with more money and resources. The words combine backpacking with flash, a slang term for being fancy, or posh, an informal adjective for upper class. Begpacking combines begging and backpacking in reference to individuals who beg (ask directly or indirectly for money), solicit money during street performances, or vend (sell postcards or other small items) as a way to extend their overseas travel. The trend has drawn criticism for taking money away from people in actual need, with one known begpacker barred from entering Singapore. Begpacking is most common in Southeast Asia and is a growing trend in South America and South Korea.

Asriel is a member of the aristocracy in a parallel universe dominated by the Church. He is described as being \\"a tall man with powerful shoulders, a fierce dark face, and eyes that seem to flash and glitter with savage laughter\\". Possessed of enormous determination and willpower, he is fierce in nature and commands great respect in both the political and academic spheres, being a military leader and a fellow of Jordan College in his world's version of the University of Oxford. Naming Asriel is one variant spelling of the Hebraic name Azrael, who, in the Jewish and Muslim tradition is mentioned in the counting of the tribes.http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0426.htm \\"Azrael\\" is also traditionally believed to be the Angel of Death in some sects of Islam, as well as some Hebrew lore.Shri Guru Granth Sahib, Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 165, \\"Azraa-eel, the Angel of Death, shall crush them like sesame seeds in the oil-press.\\" His d√¶mon is called Stelmaria, a snow leopard. History within the novel Prior to the beginning of the trilogy, Lord Asriel had been a highly respected member of the 'Brytish' aristocracy. He had been an explorer and did work in \\"experimental theology\\", through which he acquired much power, land, and money. After having an affair with another politician's wife, Marisa Coulter, that resulted in the birth of Lyra, his life changed. Mrs Coulter's husband, Edward Coulter, attacked Lyra and her foster mother intending to harm and possibly murder Lyra. Lord Asriel intervened and killed Coulter. When the church found out, Asriel was tried and lost all property. Six-month-old Lyra was sent to a convent. Lord Asriel, who hated the church, arrived one day and took Lyra to his alma mater, Jordan College, where she was placed in the care of the Master and brought up believing Asriel to be her uncle, rather than her father. At the beginning of the trilogy, Lord Asriel visits Jordan College where he is almost poisoned by the Master. Asriel is saved by Lyra, who has secretly been watching the Master pour the poison into Lord Asriel's wine glass. Asriel is giving a Lecture to the Fellows of Jordan College hoping to raise money for an expedition. In the lecture he uses photograms of Dust and a city in the sky, as well as a severed head that he says is Stanislaus Grumman's. He travels to Svalbard but is imprisoned and guarded by the bear warriors known as the panserbj√∏rne, led by Iofur Raknison. This action has been ordered by the General Oblation Board, which is headed by his ex-lover, Marisa Coulter. He receives hospitable treatment, and waits for a child on whom to perform intercision (a process to detach a child's d√¶mon that often results in the child's death). He is hoping to open a window in the aurora in order to travel into a different universe. Eventually a child arrives, Roger Parslow, unwittingly brought by Lyra. Asriel enters Citt√†gazze and, after a battle, allies himself with the rebel angels under Xaphania. He travels to an empty world and builds an enormous basalt fortress, gathering armies from many different worlds to start his rebellion against the Kingdom of Heaven. Ruta Skadi finds him, and he tells her his plan, and gets her clan's support in the war. Later, he has his allies, King Ogunwe and Lord Roke, find and rescue Lyra from Mrs Coulter. They capture Mrs Coulter, but Lyra and Will escape with two of Lord Roke's agents. Lord Asriel then attends to Mrs Coulter and tries to influence Lyra and Will, as they hold the key to renewing the Dust flow. Lord Asriel lets Mrs Coulter escape in an 'Intention Craft' and has Lord Roke follow her to gain information from the Consistorial Court of Discipline. They learn that the Church has made a bomb to kill Lyra, and Lord Asriel rescues Mrs Coulter just in time. He destroys Saint-Jean Les Eaux (the location of the bomb) with his Intention Craft. Lyra survives, and Lord Asriel has his army search for her and Will's d√¶mons so the Authority's armies will be unable to control them. When Lord Asriel finds that the bomb has blown a hole under all the worlds into the abyss, he devises a plan to defeat the Authority's powerful Regent, Metatron. As his forces fight the armies of the Authority and the Church, Mrs Coulter tricks Metatron into trying to kill Lord Asriel and to take Lyra's d√¶mon. As they are standing on the edge of the abyss, Lord Asriel and Mrs Coulter sacrifice themselves, falling into the abyss and taking Metatron with them. All three are condemned to fall through the abyss for eternity. Lyra and Marisa Coulter Marisa Coulter was Edward Coulter's wife. Lyra, the product of Marisa's affair with Lord Asriel, was born when Marisa was just 21. Lyra resembled Asriel rather than Edward Coulter, so Mrs Coulter gave her to Asriel, who placed their daughter with a gyptian woman, later revealed to be Ma Costa. When Edward Coulter found out about the affair, he went to kill the baby Lyra, but Asriel fought and killed Edward. Asriel had his wealth and status taken away, and Lyra was placed in a convent. Asriel, outraged, took Lyra from the convent, and placed her at Jordan College, and ordered the Master to never allow Mrs Coulter to contact Lyra. However, Marisa eventually turns up, intending to take Lyra north. Lyra agrees, but escapes when she discovers Mrs Coulter's intentions for the stolen children, as the head of the Oblation Board. When Lyra is kidnapped and taken to Bolvangar, Marisa races in to rescue her just as Lyra and Pantalaimon are about to be severed. In the film adaptation, she comforts Lyra and tells her she is her mother. Horrified, Lyra escapes once again, and this time she seeks out Lord Asriel to deliver the alethiometer. Unknowingly, Lyra leads her friend, Roger, to his death at the hands of Asriel, as Asriel requires the energy release of severing a child from their daemon in order to open the rift between the worlds. At this time Mrs Coulter and Lord Asriel briefly meet, but Asriel leaves her to continue his campaign while Mrs Coulter hesitates. Lord Asriel and Mrs Coulter meet once again in Amber Spyglass, when Mrs Coulter is captured by Asriel's men. He rescues her once as well and takes her back to his adamant tower. She and Asriel join forces to defeat Metatron, the powerful regent of the Authority, simply to give Lyra, their child, a chance to live. They die together in a chasm between worlds to destroy Metatron. Personality and appearance Lord Asriel is perhaps one of the best examples of a man who believes that the ends justify the means. Though he willingly sacrifices people, even children, to achieve his goal, he does not hesitate to give his own life in the course of achieving it. He acts not for selfish gain but to achieve a world which, in his eyes, is the best possible world for humanity. He appears at first as a cold-hearted and seemingly unapproachable person, domineering to his servants and stern to his peers and niece. He shows little emotion, though several times throughout the story he displays sadness and regret for what is necessary, and in the end he shows his love for his child and his former lover, Marisa Coulter, appearing particularly angry when he thinks that fate has brought him Lyra to use as his \\"sacrifice\\" to bridge worlds. John Faa also refers to help that Asriel has given to the gyptians in the past, including defending the gyptian way of life in Parliament and diving into fierce waters to rescue drowning men. In La Belle Sauvage Asriel repays Malcolm Polstead for the loan of his canoe by arranging for it to receive a thorough make-over by gyptian boat- makers to make it a sturdier vessel, and later trusts Malcolm to protect Lyra until he can arrange suitable protection for her. Asriel is an intimidating presence, both physically and intellectually; he appears equally adept at outmanoeuvring his adversaries using his considerable wits and academic knowledge as he is at achieving his objectives through brute strength. He is a tall, broad and powerful man, with Lyra noting that in rooms he has the air of a \\"wild animal held in a cage too small for it\\". In the film adaption he has a beard, though no mention is made of it in the books. He is also mentioned to have lively, \\"black\\" eyes, glittering with \\"savage laughter\\", indicating that beneath his cold and harsh appearance he is really a man with powerful emotions. As one of the characters remarks, he accomplishes things in his relatively short lifetime that some would not be able to do in hundreds of years. Stage, film and television characterisations Daniel Craig as Lord Asriel in the film The Golden Compass. From December 2003 to March 2004, London's Royal National Theatre staged an adaptation of His Dark Materials in which Lord Asriel was played by Timothy Dalton. Daniel Craig played the role of Lord Asriel in the 2007 film adaptation The Golden Compass with Nicole Kidman playing Marisa Coulter.His Dark Materials: The Golden Compass (2007) IMDb (Accessed 18 July 2006) James McAvoy plays the role in the BBC television adaptation.

She is the former lover of Lord Asriel and is usually called \\"Mrs Coulter\\". Description Mrs Coulter is described as being 35 years old in the third novel, The Amber Spyglass. She is described as appearing \\"beautiful and young\\" with \\"sleek black hair\\" that \\"framed her cheeks\\" and slim,Pullman, 1995, p.66 though later accounts of her describe her as having blonde or \\"golden\\" hair. Such details of a character's physical appearances are uncommon in His Dark Materials. There is a reference in Lyra's Oxford to Mrs Coulter having written an academic work called 'The Bronze Clocks of Benin'. In the books she is portrayed as an elegant and cool-minded sophisticate with social savoir faire, but she is also calculating, power-hungry and ruthless. She has political connections, and is highly placed and trusted in the Church's hierarchy, who give her a large degree of autonomy. She arranges for Iorek Byrnison, the heir to the throne of the Armoured bears to be exiled, and plots to dominate the new king, turning the bears into her subordinates. When Lyra is in danger in Bolvangar, her maternal instincts override her other loyalties and she rescues Lyra, although in the second book of the trilogy she still expresses no qualms about killing her to prevent the Fall.The Subtle Knife p. 328: \\"What will you do to her? What will you do?\\" \\"Why, I shall have to destroy her\\", said Mrs Coulter, \\"to prevent another Fall. Why didn't I see this before? It was too large to see\\". However, by the third book she finds herself torn, ultimately feigning loyalty to betray the Church and finally giving up her life for Lyra's sake. Metatron, the Regent of the Authority describes her character in \\"the most searching examination Marisa Coulter had ever undergone\\", stripping away \\"all shelter and deceit\\" and describing that he sees:The Amber Spyglass, p.419. : \\"Corruption and envy and lust for power. Cruelty and coldness. A vicious probing curiosity. Pure, poisonous, toxic malice. You have never from your earliest years shown a shred of compassion or sympathy or kindness without calculating how it would return to your advantage. You have tortured and killed without regret or hesitation; you have betrayed and intrigued and gloried in your treachery. You are a cess- pit of moral filth\\". Despite this, Metatron describes her as lovelier than any wife he had, and he wishes to take her as his consort. This is her final deception as by this point she intends to betray Metatron himself in order to safeguard her daughter. She describes her self-perception to Asriel just prior to their joint sacrifice:The Amber Spyglass, p. 426-7 : \\"I told him I was going to betray you, and betray Lyra, and he believed me because I was corrupt and full of wickedness. I wanted him to find no good in me and he didn't. There is none. But I love Lyra. Where did this love come from? I don't know; it came to me like a thief in the night, and now I love her so much my heart is bursting with it. All I could hope was that my crimes were so monstrous that the love was no bigger than a mustard seed in the shadow of them, and I wished I'd committed even greater ones to hide it more deeply still\\". Mrs Coulter's d√¶mon takes the form of a golden monkey with long fur, who is not named in the books, but was given the name \\"Ozymandias\\" in the radio adaptation. The golden monkey is shown to be capable of going much further from Mrs Coulter than other d√¶mons are able to separate from their humans. How the golden monkey can go so far from Mrs Coulter is not explained, Mrs Coulter has not undergone any of the processes which enable other humans to achieve such separation. Her final act in the trilogy occurs when she is reconciled with Asriel, and they together drag Metatron into an endless abyss, the three thus ceasing to exist. Relationship with Lyra Belacqua  In the beginning of the book The Northern Lights Marisa Coulter seems to have a keen interest in Lyra. It is then revealed that Coulter is in fact Lyra's mother by her love affair with Lord Asriel (her title of \\"Mrs\\" comes from her marriage to Edward Coulter, who died before the events in the books.) In Northern Lights it is stated by John Faa that she fell in love with Asriel as soon as they met. Although throughout most of the series Lyra hates and fears her mother, Mrs Coulter repeatedly saves Lyra. At the beginning of The Northern Lights Mrs Coulter saves Lyra from the Gobblers by taking her out of Oxford, and nearing the end of The Northern Lights, Mrs Coulter yet again saves Lyra from having her daemon cut away (a process known as intercision). A distraught Mrs Coulter cries out for Lyra, and Lyra passes out. When Lyra suddenly opens her eyes again, she is lying in a soft, comfortable bed. Mrs Coulter immediately reassures Lyra she's safe and, on her daughter's instruction, explains to her gently why children have to be intercised at such a young age, commenting on their \\"unhappy thoughts and feelings\\". Mrs Coulter is ultimately forced to make choice between Lyra and the church when it is revealed that Lyra is the new \\"Eve\\" whose death will be sought by the Church to prevent original sin re- entering the world. Coulter takes Lyra to a cave and keeps her drugged there at the beginning of The Amber Spyglass and ultimately saves Lyra at the end of The Subtle Knife.

He played college football for Notre Dame, where he won the Heisman Trophy. He spent sixteen years with the Los Angeles/Oakland Raiders, during which he established himself as one of the NFL's greatest wide receivers of all time. Brown has also played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. In 2015, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. High school and college career Before his college career at Notre Dame, Brown played for Woodrow Wilson High School in Dallas, the same school as 1938 Heisman Trophy winner Davey O'Brien. Brown's receipt of the 1987 Heisman Trophy gave Woodrow the distinction of being the first high school in the country to have produced two Heisman Trophy winners. Amazingly, Tim didn‚Äôt play football as a freshman at Woodrow, because he was forbidden to do so by his mother. Instead, he played in the Woodrow band during that first year. But he joined the Woodrow football team as a sophomore, although he initially tried to hide that fact from his mom. She later found out about it when the band leader called his house asking why he was no longer at band practices.The Washington Post via the L.A. Times. ‚Äú.‚Äù September 27, 1987. Despite his outstanding contributions to Woodrow's football program, the team fared poorly, posting only a 4‚Äì25‚Äì1 record over his three years as a starter. Nevertheless, Brown was heavily recruited by major colleges. His five official visits were to Notre Dame, Nebraska, Oklahoma, nearby SMU and Iowa.BlueandGold.com // No. 4: Tim Brown While at Woodrow, Brown also was a standout track athlete. He was one of the state's top performers in the 400-meter dash, with a PR of 47.14 seconds, and he cleared 7.42 meters in the long jump event. Brown chose the University of Notre Dame and played there from 1984‚Äì1987, earning the nickname \\"Touchdown Timmy.\\" In his first year, he set a freshman record with twenty-eight receptions. As a junior, he set a record with 1,937 all-purpose yards. Offensively he ran for 254 yards with 2 TD and caught 45 passes for 910 yards with 5 TD. During 1987, Brown caught 34 passes for 846 yards, returned 34 punts for 401 yards, rushed for 144 yards, gained 456 yards on 23 kickoff returns, and scored eight touchdowns. Brown finished his career at Notre Dame with 137 receptions for 2,493 yards, a school record 5,024 all-purpose yards, and 22 touchdowns. However, just as in high school, Brown's team achieved limited success, with a 25‚Äì21 record over his four seasons, and an 0‚Äì2 record in bowl games. But in the year after Brown graduated (1988), Notre Dame won the national title. Brown made the College Football All-America Team twice and won the 1987 Heisman Trophy, becoming the first wide receiver ever to win that award. As of 2020, Woodrow Wilson High School is still the only public high school with two Heisman Trophy winners. When Brown graduated, he held 19 individual school records. In 1989, Brown and Davey O'Brien were inducted together as members of the initial class of the Woodrow Wilson High School Hall of Fame, created in celebration of the school's 60th Anniversary. In 2009, Brown was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. Tim Brown at an autograph signing in 2004. In January 2012, Brown received the Silver Anniversary Award from the NCAA in recognition of his myriad athletic and professional accomplishments. NFL career Brown was selected by the Los Angeles Raiders with the 6th pick of the 1988 NFL Draft. In his first NFL season, he led the league in kickoff returns, return yards, and yards per return average. Though it took time for him to fill into the role as the team's #1 receiver, catching just 147 passes in his first five seasons, he went on to rack up 9 consecutive 1,000-yard seasons from 1993-2001. He also led the NFL in punt returns in 1994, and receptions in 1997. In March 1994, Brown was offered and signed a free-agent offer-sheet with the Denver Broncos. The Raiders matched the offer soon thereafter. He was voted to the Pro Bowl nine times, in 1988 and 1991 as a kick returner, and in 1993-97, 1999 and 2001 as a receiver. In 2001, Brown would later play alongside another well-known wide receiver, Jerry Rice. On December 9, 2001, Brown returned a punt 88 yards for a touchdown in a home game against the Kansas City Chiefs, making him the oldest player in NFL history to score a touchdown on a punt return. In 2002, he passed Gene Upshaw to become the Raiders' all-time leader in games played with 224. He also set Raiders franchise records for receptions, receiving yards, and punt return yards. Brown was released by the Raiders before the 2004 season, as he did not want to accept a smaller role in the offense. He was signed shortly thereafter by the Buccaneers (coached by former Raider head coach Jon Gruden). The move was controversial, considering that Brown had always been a fan favorite in the Oakland area and was much admired by many current and former Raiders players and staff over the sixteen years he spent with the Raider organization. He was the last of the Los Angeles Raiders to remain with Oakland. On September 27, 2004, in his first game at Oakland since being signed by Tampa Bay, Brown reached 100 career receiving touchdowns, tying him (with Steve Largent) for 3rd on the NFL's all-time career receiving touchdown list at that time (behind former teammate Jerry Rice [197] and Cris Carter [130]). He received a standing ovation from the Oakland Raider crowd. In 2005, Brown signed a one-day contract with the Raiders to retire with the team. The July 18 news conference was attended by two Raiders officials and only one active Raider, wide receiver Jerry Porter. Brown retired with 14,934 receiving yards, the second-highest total in NFL history, 1,094 receptions (3rd), and 100 touchdown catches (3rd-Tied). Brown also gained 190 rushing yards, 3,320 punt-return yards (5th in NFL history), 3 fumble-return yards, and 1,235 yards returning kickoffs. This gave him a total of 19,682 combined net yards, ranking him #5 among the NFL's all-time leaders at the time of his retirement. He also scored 105 total touchdowns (100 receiving, 1 rushing, 3 punt returns, 1 kickoff return). Brown is the only player ever to retire in the NFL's top five leaders for both receiving and return yards. Brown became eligible for enshrinement in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2010, but was not selected that year. He was considered a long shot to get in on his first try, as there was a logjam of accomplished receiver candidates, including Jerry Rice (Brown's former teammate), Cris Carter and Andre Reed. On January 7, 2012 and again on January 11, 2013, Brown was selected as a finalist for enshrinement in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, but was not chosen. On January 31, 2015, Brown was selected for enshrinement in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on August 8, 2015.http://www.mercurynews.com/raiders/ci_28609968/raiders-receiver-tim- brown-savors-his-time-at Post-NFL career Brown was in the movie Little Giants, and is co-host on FSN Pro Football Preview with former players Jason Sehorn, Eddie George and NFL Insider Jay Glazer. Brown is also a representative for YorHealth. In 1995, Brown became the National Chairman of Athletes & Entertainers for Kids and the related 9-1-1 for Kids. These efforts have helped over five million children and teens through mentoring and educational programs. As of 2013, Brown has been the General Manager and Co- Owner of the Texas Revolution of the Champions Indoor Football League in his home state of Texas and was an analyst for ESPN College Football. Brown also hosts a weekly sports-talk show on WRDI.http://www.thefanmichiana.com Brown currently lives in Cedar Hill, Texas. NASCAR Brown started a NASCAR racing team as part of their Drive for Diversity program. He was recruiting African American sponsors to fund the venture, and has worked out a technical alliance with Roush Fenway Racing, who will provide support to the upstart team. Brown hopes to eventually find a black, Hispanic, or woman driver to be the star of his team in order to bring an element of diversity to what is a white- dominated sport. However, the plan never successfully began. Relationship with Raiders owner Al Davis Since joining the Raiders, Brown had a complicated relationship with the Oakland Raiders and late owner Al Davis. During a 2009 interview with Sportsradiointerview.com Brown commented on his former boss: > ‚ÄúMeeting Al (Davis) was pretty unique. I found out five or ten minutes after > my first practice there that he hated African-American athletes from Notre > Dame. And they literally told me that. They literally told me that because > we‚Äôre known for using our education more than our athletic ability that he > thought that I would be one of these guys that would basically take the > money and run. I don‚Äôt know if that was a ploy to get me amped up, but it > certainly worked.\\" In 2000, Brown was dining in an Oakland restaurant with former Raiders Chester McGlockton and Sean Jones. During their meal, Brown found himself unable to approach or speak to Davis. Brown told a reporter, \\"I was saddened by that because I don't know anybody who I've dealt with for twelve years who I can't say hello to in that situation. I was saddened that the situation is where it is.\\" On August 5, 2004, the Raiders held a press conference with Brown and Davis which stated that Brown was leaving the Raiders. Davis and Brown professed mutual respect for one another and both men expressed a desire for Brown to return to the Raiders someday. On July 19, 2005, Brown officially retired but the Raiders did not hold a press conference at the team headquarters. Instead, Brown held his own press conference in an Oakland hotel ballroom. Davis did not attend the conference because he had a \\"scheduling conflict\\". Davis did allow Brown to sign a ceremonial $765,000 contract with the Raiders so he could retire as an Oakland Raider. Brown's 2004 departure from the Raiders eventually became acrimonious, and the outspoken receiver often criticized Davis, senior assistant Michael Lombardi and coach Norv Turner publicly for conspiring to make him expendable. Former teammates Marcus Allen, Lincoln Kennedy and Chester McGlockton attended the press conference. For the Raiders, Amy Trask, the Raiders' chief executive officer who had Brown sign the ceremonial contract, Marc Badain, a finance executive and Mike Taylor, the team's director of public relations, were on hand. At the time, Raiders receiver Jerry Porter was also in attendance. Lincoln Kennedy stuck up for the absence of Davis stating \\"It's not his style; he'll probably invite Tim up to his office, or out to dinner later on. But this? This is not his style.\\" Recent history suggested that Davis was possibly out of touch with the football world prior to his death in 2011 because the Raiders had suffered through seven straight losing seasons (2003‚Äì2009) since losing to Tampa Bay in Super Bowl XXXVII. Brown disagreed, stating \\"In a lot of peoples‚Äô minds, Al is out of touch, but nothing is further from the truth. He is still quite lucid.\\" Career records *First wide receiver to win the Heisman Trophy. *NFL rookie-season record for most combined yards gained, with 2,317 (1988). *NFL record 10 consecutive seasons with at least 75 receptions *NFL record for consecutive seasons with at least 5 touchdowns receptions (11) - shared with Marvin Harrison, Don Hutson, Cris Carter, Terrell Owens, Frank Gore and Jerry Rice *NFL record for being the oldest player ever to score a touchdown on special teams - (35 years, 140 days) 85-yard punt return *NFL record for most consecutive games with two receptions (147 games, 1993‚Äì2002) *NFL record for being the oldest player with 12+ receptions in a single game - (36 years, 97 days): 10/27/02 @ KC Chiefs, 13 receptions, 144 receiving yards *NFL record for consecutive starts by a wide receiver: 176 *Only player to have 1,600 receiving yards against four different teams (Broncos, Chiefs, Chargers, Seahawks) *Holds the following team records with the Los Angeles/Oakland Raiders ** **Touchdowns (104) **Receiving (14,734 yards, 1,070 receptions, 99 touchdowns) **Punt return (3,272 punt-return yards, 320 punt returns, 3 punt returns for touchdowns) **All-purpose yards (19,431) **Yards from scrimmage (14,924) Notes and references External links  * Tim Brown profile by the Oakland Raiders * Oakland Raiders biographies covering 2002, 1988-1997 Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:African-American players of American football Category:All-American college football players Category:American Conference Pro Bowl players Category:American football wide receivers Category:American Pentecostals Category:College Football Hall of Fame inductees Category:Heisman Trophy winners Category:Los Angeles Raiders players Category:Notre Dame Fighting Irish football players Category:Oakland Raiders players Category:Players of American football from Texas Category:Sportspeople from Dallas Category:Tampa Bay Buccaneers players Category:People from DeSoto, Texas Category:College football announcers Category:Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees ","title":"Tim Brown (American football)"},{"id":"854063","text":"Cantharellus cibarius (Latin: cantharellus, \\"chanterelle\\"; cibarius, \\"culinary\\") is a species of golden chanterelle mushroom in the genus Cantharellus. It is also known as girolle (or girole). It grows in Europe from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean Basin, mainly in deciduous and coniferous forests. Due to its characteristic color and shape, it is easy to distinguish from mushrooms with potential toxicity that discourage human consumption. A commonly eaten and favored mushroom, the chanterelle is typically harvested from late summer to late fall in its European distribution. Chanterelles are used in many culinary dishes, and can be preserved by either drying or freezing. An oven should not be used when drying it because can result in the mushroom becoming bitter. Taxonomy At one time, all yellow or golden chanterelles in North America had been classified as Cantharellus cibarius. Using DNA analysis, they have since been shown to be a group of related species known as the Cantharellus cibarius group or species complex, with C. cibarius sensu stricto restricted to Europe. In 1997, the Pacific golden chanterelle (C. formosus) and C. cibarius var. roseocanus were identified, followed by C. cascadensis in 2003 and C. californicus in 2008. Description The mushroom is easy to detect and recognize in nature. The body is wide and tall. The color varies from yellow to dark yellow. Red spots will appear on the cap of the mushroom if it is damaged. Chanterelle mushrooms have a faint aroma and flavour of apricots. Care should be taken not to confuse this species with the deadly Omphalotus illudens.

They are organised by leading dance teaching organisations, such as the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing (ISTD),ISTD www.istd.org the International Dance Teachers Association (IDTA),IDTA www.idta.co.uk and other organisations. The examinations are a way for a young dancer to mark his or her progress in the art of dance. They have been extremely popular since their introduction in the early 1930s. They are not a form of professional qualification. Professional qualifications are also offered by the same organisations, and they are much more extensive and demanding. During a medal test, a dancer will either dance alone (ballet) or be partnered by their teacher (ballroom). An examiner, appointed by the examining body, will observe the performance, and mark it. It is usual for dance teacher organisations to print guidelines for the figures or routines to be tested.By 'figure' is meant \\"a completed set of steps\\". Moore, Alex 1986. Ballroom dancing. 9th edition, Adam & Charles Black, London. Definitions of terms, p30. Figures, given a name, such as 'whisk' or 'spin turn', are amalgamated into a routine.An amalgamation: \\"A combination of two or more figures\\" (Moore). More generally: a sequence of figures which a couple intends to dance. The examining body prescribes a syllabus of figures from which the routines are formed. The syllabus and detailed instructions for performing the dances are published or specified by the examining body, and available for purchase as books or pamphlets. The instructor will have prepared an amalgamation of figures suitable for each level of medal. The lower levels of examination generally consist mainly of basic figures, such as the natural turn in the Waltz, which demonstrate clear understanding of the technique of the dance in question. Higher levels will include more complex figures, but will usually also require at least some fundamentals, to demonstrate that the lower levels have been built upon. The standard of dance expected at tests goes up at each level. Depending upon the level and style of the examination, a student might be asked to demonstrate anywhere from one to five different dances, all within one discipline, such as 'Standard', or 'Latin American'. That is because medals are awarded within disciplines. For example, at Bronze level, a Latin American dance student might be asked to dance Cha-cha-cha, Samba and Rumba, whilst the same student would definitely be asked to dance all five International Latin dances at Gold level. A single dance will take up around 60 to 90 seconds; the entire exam, allowing for short breaks between routines, will be between five and ten minutes, depending on the number of dances. Typically, a studio will have a large number of candidates, all examined on the same day. There is a separate set of tests for student dance teachers, which involves a) dancing b) explaining theory c) demonstrating the ability to teach, including the ability to demonstrate steps of both male and female partners. These are not medal tests, but are often adjudicated in a similar setting by the same examiners on the same day.Since a test day uses resources, there is a natural tendency to maximise the throughput, though not so far as to compromise the standards of the examination body.

Every species is capable of regeneration, from bacteria to humans. Regeneration can either be complete where the new tissue is the same as the lost tissue, or incomplete where after the necrotic tissue comes fibrosis. At its most elementary level, regeneration is mediated by the molecular processes of gene regulation and involves the cellular processes of cell proliferation, morphogenesis and cell differentiation. Regeneration in biology, however, mainly refers to the morphogenic processes that characterize the phenotypic plasticity of traits allowing multi-cellular organisms to repair and maintain the integrity of their physiological and morphological states. Above the genetic level, regeneration is fundamentally regulated by asexual cellular processes. Regeneration is different from reproduction. For example, hydra perform regeneration but reproduce by the method of budding. The hydra and the planarian flatworm have long served as model organisms for their highly adaptive regenerative capabilities. Once wounded, their cells become activated and restore the organs back to their pre-existing state. The Caudata (\\"urodeles\\"; salamanders and newts), an order of tailed amphibians, is possibly the most adept vertebrate group at regeneration, given their capability of regenerating limbs, tails, jaws, eyes and a variety of internal structures. The regeneration of organs is a common and widespread adaptive capability among metazoan creatures. In a related context, some animals are able to reproduce asexually through fragmentation, budding, or fission. A planarian parent, for example, will constrict, split in the middle, and each half generates a new end to form two clones of the original. Echinoderms (such as the sea star), crayfish, many reptiles, and amphibians exhibit remarkable examples of tissue regeneration. The case of autotomy, for example, serves as a defensive function as the animal detaches a limb or tail to avoid capture. After the limb or tail has been autotomized, cells move into action and the tissues will regenerate. In some cases a shed limb can itself regenerate a new individual. Limited regeneration of limbs occurs in most fishes and salamanders, and tail regeneration takes place in larval frogs and toads (but not adults). The whole limb of a salamander or a triton will grow again and again after amputation. In reptiles, chelonians, crocodilians and snakes are unable to regenerate lost parts, but many (not all) kinds of lizards, geckos and iguanas possess regeneration capacity in a high degree. Usually, it involves dropping a section of their tail and regenerating it as part of a defense mechanism. While escaping a predator, if the predator catches the tail, it will disconnect. Ecosystems Ecosystems can be regenerative. Following a disturbance, such as a fire or pest outbreak in a forest, pioneering species will occupy, compete for space, and establish themselves in the newly opened habitat. The new growth of seedlings and community assembly process is known as regeneration in ecology. Cellular molecular fundamentals Pattern formation in the morphogenesis of an animal is regulated by genetic induction factors that put cells to work after damage has occurred. Neural cells, for example, express growth-associated proteins, such as GAP-43, tubulin, actin, an array of novel neuropeptides, and cytokines that induce a cellular physiological response to regenerate from the damage. Many of the genes that are involved in the original development of tissues are reinitialized during the regenerative process. Cells in the primordia of zebrafish fins, for example, express four genes from the homeobox msx family during development and regeneration. Tissues \\"Strategies include the rearrangement of pre-existing tissue, the use of adult somatic stem cells and the dedifferentiation and/or transdifferentiation of cells, and more than one mode can operate in different tissues of the same animal. All these strategies result in the re-establishment of appropriate tissue polarity, structure and form.\\" During the developmental process, genes are activated that serve to modify the properties of cell as they differentiate into different tissues. Development and regeneration involves the coordination and organization of populations cells into a blastema, which is \\"a mound of stem cells from which regeneration begins\\". Dedifferentiation of cells means that they lose their tissue-specific characteristics as tissues remodel during the regeneration process. This should not be confused with the transdifferentiation of cells which is when they lose their tissue-specific characteristics during the regeneration process, and then re-differentiate to a different kind of cell. In animals = Arthropods = Arthropods are known to regenerate appendages following loss or autotomy. Regeneration among arthropods is restricted by molting such that hemimetabolous insects are capable of regeneration only until their final molt whereas most crustaceans can regenerate throughout their lifetimes. Molting cycles are hormonally regulated in arthropods, although premature molting can be induced by autotomy. Mechanisms underlying appendage regeneration in hemimetabolous insects and crustaceans is highly conserved. During limb regeneration species in both taxa form a blastema following autotomy with regeneration of the excised limb occurring during proecdysis. Limb regeneration is also present in insects that undergo metamorphosis, such as beetles, although the cost of said regeneration is a delayed pupal stage. Arachnids, including scorpions, are known to regenerate their venom, although the content of the regenerated venom is different than the original venom during its regeneration, as the venom volume is replaced before the active proteins are all replenished. =Annelids= Many annelids (segmented worms) are capable of regeneration. For example, Chaetopterus variopedatus and Branchiomma nigromaculata can regenerate both anterior and posterior body parts after latitudinal bisection. The relationship between somatic and germline stem cell regeneration has been studied at the molecular level in the annelid Capitella teleta. Leeches, however, appear incapable of segmental regeneration. Furthermore, their close relatives, the branchiobdellids, are also incapable of segmental regeneration. However, certain individuals, like the lumbriculids, can regenerate from only a few segments. Segmental regeneration in these animals is epimorphic and occurs through blastema formation. Segmental regeneration has been gained and lost during annelid evolution, as seen in oligochaetes, where head regeneration has been lost three separate times. Along with epimorphosis, some polychaetes like Sabella pavonina experience morphallactic regeneration. Morphallaxis involves the de-differentiation, transformation, and re- differentation of cells to regenerate tissues. How prominent morphallactic regeneration is in oligochaetes is currently not well understood. Although relatively under-reported, it is possible that morphallaxis is a common mode of inter-segment regeneration in annelids. Following regeneration in L. variegatus, past posterior segments sometimes become anterior in the new body orientation, consistent with morphallaxis. Following amputation, most annelids are capable of sealing their body via rapid muscular contraction. Constriction of body muscle can lead to infection prevention. In certain species, such as Limnodrilus, autolysis can be seen within hours after amputation in the ectoderm and mesoderm. Amputation is also thought to cause a large migration of cells to the injury site, and these form a wound plug. =Echinoderms= Tissue regeneration is widespread among echinoderms and has been well documented in starfish (Asteroidea), sea cucumbers (Holothuroidea), and sea urchins (Echinoidea). Appendage regeneration in echinoderms has been studied since at least the 19th century. In addition to appendages, some species can regenerate internal organs and parts of their central nervous system. In response to injury starfish can autotomize damaged appendages. Autotomy is the self-amputation of a body part, usually an appendage. Depending on severity, starfish will then go through a four-week process where the appendage will be regenerated. Some species must retain mouth cells to regenerate an appendage, due to the need for energy. The first organs to regenerate, in all species documented to date, are associated with the digestive tract. Thus, most knowledge about visceral regeneration in holothurians concerns this system. =Planaria (Platyhelminthes)= Regeneration research using Planarians began in the late 1800s and was popularized by T.H. Morgan at the beginning of the 20th century. Alejandro Sanchez-Alvarado and Philip Newmark transformed planarians into a model genetic organism in the beginning of the 20th century to study the molecular mechanisms underlying regeneration in these animals. Planarians exhibit an extraordinary ability to regenerate lost body parts. For example, a planarian split lengthwise or crosswise will regenerate into two separate individuals. In one experiment, T.H. Morgan found that a piece corresponding to 1/279th of a planarian or a fragment with as few as 10,000 cells can successfully regenerate into a new worm within one to two weeks. After amputation, stump cells form a blastema formed from neoblasts, pluripotent cells found throughout the planarian body. New tissue grows from neoblasts with neoblasts comprising between 20 and 30% of all planarian cells. Recent work has confirmed that neoblasts are totipotent since one single neoblast can regenerate an entire irradiated animal that has been rendered incapable of regeneration. In order to prevent starvation a planarian will use their own cells for energy, this phenomenon is known as de-growth. =Amphibians= Limb regeneration in the axolotl and newt has been extensively studied and researched. Urodele amphibians, such as salamanders and newts, display the highest regenerative ability among tetrapods. As such, they can fully regenerate their limbs, tail, jaws, and retina via epimorphic regeneration leading to functional replacement with new tissue. Salamander limb regeneration occurs in two main steps. First, the local cells dedifferentiate at the wound site into progenitor to form a blastema. Second, the blastemal cells will undergo cell proliferation, patterning, cell differentiation and tissue growth using similar genetic mechanisms that deployed during embryonic development. Ultimately, blastemal cells will generate all the cells for the new structure. Axolotls can regenerate a variety of structures, including their limbs After amputation, the epidermis migrates to cover the stump in 1‚Äì2 hours, forming a structure called the wound epithelium (WE). Epidermal cells continue to migrate over the WE, resulting in a thickened, specialized signaling center called the apical epithelial cap (AEC). Over the next several days there are changes in the underlying stump tissues that result in the formation of a blastema (a mass of dedifferentiated proliferating cells). As the blastema forms, pattern formation genes - such as HoxA and HoxD - are activated as they were when the limb was formed in the embryo. The positional identity of the distal tip of the limb (i.e. the autopod, which is the hand or foot) is formed first in the blastema. Intermediate positional identities between the stump and the distal tip are then filled in through a process called intercalation. Motor neurons, muscle, and blood vessels grow with the regenerated limb, and reestablish the connections that were present prior to amputation. The time that this entire process takes varies according to the age of the animal, ranging from about a month to around three months in the adult and then the limb becomes fully functional. Researchers at Australian Regenerative Medicine Institute at Monash University, have published that when macrophages, which eat up material debris, were removed, salamanders lost their ability to regenerate and formed scarred tissue instead. In spite of the historically few researchers studying limb regeneration, remarkable progress has been made recently in establishing the neotenous amphibian the axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) as a model genetic organism. This progress has been facilitated by advances in genomics, bioinformatics, and somatic cell transgenesis in other fields, that have created the opportunity to investigate the mechanisms of important biological properties, such as limb regeneration, in the axolotl. The Ambystoma Genetic Stock Center (AGSC) is a self-sustaining, breeding colony of the axolotl supported by the National Science Foundation as a Living Stock Collection. Located at the University of Kentucky, the AGSC is dedicated to supplying genetically well-characterized axolotl embryos, larvae, and adults to laboratories throughout the United States and abroad. An NIH-funded NCRR grant has led to the establishment of the Ambystoma EST database, the Salamander Genome Project (SGP) that has led to the creation of the first amphibian gene map and several annotated molecular data bases, and the creation of the research community web portal. Anurans can only regenerate their limbs during embryonic development. Once the limb skeleton has developed regeneration does not occur (Xenopus can grow a cartilaginous spike after amputation). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) appear to be required for a regeneration response in the anuran larvae. ROS production is essential to activate the Wnt signaling pathway, which has been associated with regeneration in other systems. Limb regeneration in salamanders occurs in two major steps. First, adult cells de- differentiate into progenitor cells which will replace the tissues they are derived from. Second, these progenitor cells then proliferate and differentiate until they have completely replaced the missing structure. = Hydra = Hydra is a genus of freshwater polyp in the phylum Cnidaria with highly proliferative stem cells that gives them the ability to regenerate their entire body. Any fragment larger than a few hundred epithelial cells that is isolated from the body has the ability to regenerate into a smaller version of itself. The high proportion of stem cells in the hydra supports its efficient regenerative ability. Regeneration among hydra occurs as foot regeneration arising from the basal part of the body, and head regeneration, arising from the apical region. Regeneration tissues that are cut from the gastric region contain polarity, which allows them to distinguish between regenerating a head in the apical end and a foot in the basal end so that both regions are present in the newly regenerated organism. Head regeneration requires complex reconstruction of the area, while foot regeneration is much simpler, similar to tissue repair. In both foot and head regeneration, however, there are two distinct molecular cascades that occur once the tissue is wounded: early injury response and a subsequent, signal-driven pathway of the regenerating tissue that leads to cellular differentiation. This early- injury response includes epithelial cell stretching for wound closure, the migration of interstitial progenitors towards the wound, cell death, phagocytosis of cell debris, and reconstruction of the extracellular matrix. Regeneration in hydra has been defined as morphallaxis, the process where regeneration results from remodeling of existing material without cellular proliferation. If a hydra is cut into two pieces, the remaining severed sections form two fully functional and independent hydra, approximately the same size as the two smaller severed sections. This occurs through the exchange and rearrangement of soft tissues without the formation of new material. =Aves (birds)= Owing to a limited literature on the subject, birds are believed to have very limited regenerative abilities as adults. Some studies on roosters have suggested that birds can adequately regenerate some parts of the limbs and depending on the conditions in which regeneration takes place, such as age of the animal, the inter-relationship of the injured tissue with other muscles, and the type of operation, can involve complete regeneration of some musculoskeletal structure. Werber and Goldschmidt (1909) found that the goose and duck were capable of regenerating their beaks after partial amputation and Sidorova (1962) observed liver regeneration via hypertrophy in roosters. Birds are also capable of regenerating the hair cells in their cochlea following noise damage or ototoxic drug damage. Despite this evidence, contemporary studies suggest reparative regeneration in avian species is limited to periods during embryonic development. An array of molecular biology techniques have been successful in manipulating cellular pathways known to contribute to spontaneous regeneration in chick embryos. For instance, removing a portion of the elbow joint in a chick embryo via window excision or slice excision and comparing joint tissue specific markers and cartilage markers showed that window excision allowed 10 out of 20 limbs to regenerate and expressed joint genes similarly to a developing embryo. In contrast, slice excision did not allow the joint to regenerate due to the fusion of the skeletal elements seen by an expression of cartilage markers. Similar to the physiological regeneration of hair in mammals, birds can regenerate their feathers in order to repair damaged feathers or to attract mates with their plumage. Typically, seasonal changes that are associated with breeding seasons will prompt a hormonal signal for birds to begin regenerating feathers. This has been experimentally induced using thyroid hormones in the Rhode Island Red Fowls. =Mammals= Spiny mice (Acomys cahirinus pictured here) can regenerate skin, cartilage, nerves and muscle. Mammals are capable of cellular and physiological regeneration, but have generally poor reparative regenerative ability across the group. Examples of physiological regeneration in mammals include epithelial renewal (e.g., skin and intestinal tract), red blood cell replacement, antler regeneration and hair cycling. Male deer lose their antlers annually during the months of January to April then through regeneration are able to regrow them as an example of physiological regeneration. A deer antler is the only appendage of a mammal that can be regrown every year. While reparative regeneration is a rare phenomenon in mammals, it does occur. A well-documented example is regeneration of the digit tip distal to the nail bed. Reparative regeneration has also been observed in rabbits, pikas and African spiny mice. In 2012, researchers discovered that two species of African Spiny Mice, Acomys kempi and Acomys percivali, were capable of completely regenerating the autotomically released or otherwise damaged tissue. These species can regrow hair follicles, skin, sweat glands, fur and cartilage. In addition to these two species, subsequent studies demonstrated that Acomys cahirinus could regenerate skin and excised tissue in the ear pinna. Despite these examples, it is generally accepted that adult mammals have limited regenerative capacity compared to most vertebrate embryos/larvae, adult salamanders and fish. But the regeneration therapy approach of Robert O. Becker, using electrical stimulation, has shown promising results for rats and mammals in general. Some researchers have also claimed that the MRL mouse strain exhibits enhanced regenerative abilities. Work comparing the differential gene expression of scarless healing MRL mice and a poorly-healing C57BL/6 mouse strain, identified 36 genes differentiating the healing process between MRL mice and other mice. Study of the regenerative process in these animals is aimed at discovering how to duplicate them in humans, such as deactivation of the p21 gene.Humans Could Regenerate Tissue Like Newts By Switching Off a Single Gene However, recent work has shown that MRL mice actually close small ear holes with scar tissue, rather than regeneration as originally claimed. MRL mice are not protected against myocardial infarction; heart regeneration in adult mammals (neocardiogenesis) is limited, because heart muscle cells are nearly all terminally differentiated. MRL mice show the same amount of cardiac injury and scar formation as normal mice after a heart attack. However, recent studies provide evidence that this may not always be the case, and that MRL mice can regenerate after heart damage. Humans The regrowth of lost tissues or organs in the human body is being researched. Some tissues such as skin regrow quite readily; others have been thought to have little or no capacity for regeneration, but ongoing research suggests that there is some hope for a variety of tissues and organs. Human organs that have been regenerated include the bladder, vagina and the penis. As are all metazoans, humans are capable of physiological regeneration (i.e. the replacement of cells during homeostatic maintenance that does not necessitate injury). For example, the regeneration of red blood cells via erythropoiesis occurs through the maturation of erythrocytes from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow, their subsequent circulation for around 90 days in the blood stream, and their eventual cell-death in the spleen. Another example of physiological regeneration is the sloughing and rebuilding of a functional endometrium during each menstrual cycle in females in response to varying levels of circulating estrogen and progesterone. However, humans are limited in their capacity for reparative regeneration, which occurs in response to injury. One of the most studied regenerative responses in humans is the hypertrophy of the liver following liver injury. For example, the original mass of the liver is re-established in direct proportion to the amount of liver removed following partial hepatectomy, which indicates that signals from the body regulate liver mass precisely, both positively and negatively, until the desired mass is reached. This response is considered cellular regeneration (a form of compensatory hypertrophy) where the function and mass of the liver is regenerated through the proliferation of existing mature hepatic cells (mainly hepatocytes), but the exact morphology of the liver is not regained. This process is driven by growth factor and cytokine regulated pathways. The normal sequence of inflammation and regeneration does not function accurately in cancer. Specifically, cytokine stimulation of cells leads to expression of genes that change cellular functions and suppress the immune response. Adult neurogenesis is also a form of cellular regeneration. For example, hippocampal neuron renewal occurs in normal adult humans at an annual turnover rate of 1.75% of neurons. Cardiac myocyte renewal has been found to occur in normal adult humans, and at a higher rate in adults following acute heart injury such as infarction. Even in adult myocardium following infarction, proliferation is only found in around 1% of myocytes around the area of injury, which is not enough to restore function of cardiac muscle. However, this may be an important target for regenerative medicine as it implies that regeneration of cardiomyocytes, and consequently of myocardium, can be induced. Another example of reparative regeneration in humans is fingertip regeneration, which occurs after phalange amputation distal to the nail bed (especially in children) and rib regeneration, which occurs following osteotomy for scoliosis treatment (though usually regeneration is only partial and may take up to 1 year). Yet another example of regeneration in humans is vas deferens regeneration, which occurs after a vasectomy and which results in vasectomy failure. = Reptiles = The ability and degree of regeneration in reptiles differs among the various species, but the most notable and well-studied occurrence is tail-regeneration in lizards. In addition to lizards, regeneration has been observed in the tails and maxillary bone of crocodiles and adult neurogenesis has also been noted. Tail regeneration has never been observed in snakes. Lizards possess the highest regenerative capacity as a group. Following autotomous tail loss, epimorphic regeneration of a new tail proceeds through a blastema-mediated process that results in a functionally and morphologically similar structure. = Chondrichthyes = Studies have shown that some chondrichthyans can regenerate rhodopsin by cellular regeneration, micro RNA organ regeneration, teeth physiological teeth regeneration, and reparative skin regeneration. Rhodopsin regeneration has been studied in skates and rays. After complete photo-bleaching, rhodopsin can completely regenerate within 2 hours in the retina. White bamboo sharks can regenerate at least two-thirds of their liver and this has been linked to three micro RNAs, xtr-miR-125b, fru-miR-204, and has-miR-142-3p_R-. In one study two thirds of the liver was removed and within 24 hours more than half of the liver had undergone hypertrophy. Leopard sharks routinely replace their teeth every 9‚Äì12 days and this is an example of physiological regeneration. This can occur because shark teeth are not attached to a bone, but instead are developed within a bony cavity. It has been estimated that the average shark loses about 30,000 to 40,000 teeth in a lifetime. Some sharks can regenerate scales and even skin following damage. Within two weeks of skin wounding the mucus is secreted into the wound and this initiates the healing process. One study showed that the majority of the wounded area was regenerated within 4 months, but the regenerated area also showed a high degree of variability.

She was reported missing by her husband, and the search gained national attention before her husband confessed to the crime. Biography Lori was the adopted daughter of Thelma and Herald Soares, formerly of Fullerton, California. Herald Soares was a Spanish and Portuguese teacher for Sunny Hills High School and was also a native of Piracicaba, Brazil. He met Thelma when they both served as missionaries for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in Rio de Janeiro. Lori's parents divorced in 1987 and Thelma and Lori relocated to Orem, Utah the following year. Lori and Mark both attended Orem High School, about 40 miles (about 64 kilometers) south of Salt Lake City. =Disappearance= At 10:49 a.m. on July 19, 2004, Mark Hacking called 9-1-1 to report his wife Lori missing. She was 27 years old at the time. Mark told police she had left home early for a customary jog in the Memory Grove and City Creek Canyon area northeast of downtown Salt Lake, but had not returned home or arrived at work. A woman who said she had seen Lori near the grove that day later withdrew her claim.KSL News According to some family members, Hacking had told them she was about five weeks pregnant when she vanished. She was planning a move to North Carolina, where her husband had said he was about to start medical school at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. However, police say Mark had never completed his undergraduate degree at the University of Utah as he led family and friends to believe, and that the medical school had no record of him having ever applied.\\"Lies Catch Up to Mark Hacking\\" Shortly after his wife's disappearance, Mark was reportedly found running naked through the streets, and was admitted to hospital for mental evaluation. While in the hospital, Mark engaged a locally prominent defense attorney, D. Gilbert Athay.\\"Hacking retains lawyer\\" =Mark Hacking arrested= On August 2, 2004, Mark was arrested on suspicion of the aggravated murder of his wife. Police believed that he acted alone, killing Lori in their apartment with a .22-caliber rifle while she was asleep and disposing of her body in a dumpster. They found blood in several places in the couple's apartment, including on a knife located in the bedroom and on the headboard of the bed, as well as in Lori's car. In addition, Scott and Lance Hacking, Mark's brothers, claimed that Mark confessed to murdering his wife after they confronted him on July 24, 2004.KSL News First-degree murder charges were filed against Mark Hacking on August 9, 2004. On October 1, 2004 at approximately 8:20 a.m. (Mountain Daylight Time) searchers found human remains in the Salt Lake County landfill. By that afternoon, police had confirmed that the remains were those of Lori Hacking. According to an interview with the CSI division in Salt Lake City, the sum total of Lori's remains were two teeth and a piece of bone the size of a quarter, which is believed to have come from her shoulder blade.. Searchers also found the carpet that Mark admitted to rolling her body into, before placing it in the dumpster. On October 29, 2004, Mark pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder, despite pleas from the victim's brother, Paul Soares, to \\"save your family the grief and cost [and] plead guilty to murder.\\"KSL News According to investigators, on the night of July 18, Lori discovered that virtually everything Mark had told her about his background was false, learning that he had never graduated from the U of U, and had never applied to medical school. She wrote him a note telling him that she planned to leave him. Rather than risk a divorce, Hacking killed her. =Guilty plea= On April 15, 2005, Hacking pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in exchange for prosecutors dropping other charges. On June 6, 2005, Hacking was sentenced six years to life in prison, the maximum possible sentence under Utah law at the time. Under Utah's system of indeterminate criminal sentences, first-degree felony murder brings a mandatory five years to life, but because Hacking had used a firearm, the minimum was increased by a year. In July 2005, the Utah Board of Pardons declared that Mark Hacking would not receive a parole hearing until 2035, meaning that Hacking will have to serve a minimum of 30 years in prison. Board chairman Mike Sibbett stressed that a hearing was not a guarantee of a release date. He stated that there were a number of aggravating factors in Hacking's case, including the fact he covered up Lori's murder by disposing of her body and falsely claiming she was missing. Upon hearing this news, Lori's mother Thelma Soares issued this statement: \\"While it is a terrible waste of his life, [the decision] lifts a great burden from my mind and heart. The six- year minimum imposed by law is an insult not only to Lori and the baby, but to me and my family as well. I thank the members of the State Board of Pardons and Parole for their diligence and sense of justice in dealing with this tragic case. My faith in our justice system has been upheld.\\" =Afterward= The Soares family removed the name \\"Hacking\\" from Lori's headstone. \\"We just felt that Mark obviously didn't want her anymore\\", said her mother. Lori's married name was replaced with the Portuguese word \\"Filhinha\\", which translates to \\"little daughter.\\"\\"Lori Soares‚Äô family removes married name from headstone\\" The initial sentence caused a widespread public outcry, with many believing six years to life was far too lenient. Paul Boyden, the executive director of the Utah Statewide Association of Prosecutors, urged the Utah Sentencing Commission to raise the minimum sentence for first-degree murder to 15 years. In Utah, prison sentences are indeterminate, with a minimum and maximum time frame. The offender must serve the entire sentence unless the Board of Pardons releases him sooner. Boyden said most people didn't understand this scheme, and added that it caused \\"a public perception problem\\" for the state. Sibbett noted that most inmates convicted of murder have to wait between 18 and 35 years to be even considered for parole, and Hacking's actions pushed it to \\"the higher level\\" of the spectrum. On March 20, 2006, Utah House Bill 102, also known as \\"Lori's Law\\", was signed into law. It stipulates that people convicted of first-degree murder in Utah must serve at least 15 years before they can even be considered for a parole hearing. In June 2006, prison officials in Utah discovered that Hacking was selling personal items, including autographs, a hand tracing, various prison forms, and magazines, on an online site called \\"Murder Auction\\". Officials later announced that Hacking had agreed to discontinue selling anything online.\\"Mark Hacking Agrees to Quit Selling Murder Memorabilia\\" Associated Press as quoted by foxnews.com, June 18, 2006. On June 6, 2005, Mark Hacking's father read a statement from his family that he said would be their final statement to the press about the murder. The statement clarified several events leading up to Mark's confession and conviction. The statement ended by quoting Mark: \\"I know prison is where I need to be. I will spend my time there doing all I can to right the many wrongs I have done, though I realize complete atonement is impossible in this life. I have a lot of healing and changing to do, but I hope that some day I can become the man Lori always thought I was. To the many people I have hurt, I am more sorry than you could ever know. Every day my soul burns in torment when I think of what you must be going through. I wish I could take away your pain. I wish I could take back all the lies I have told and replace them with the truth. I wish I could put Lori back into your arms. My pain is deserved; yours is not. From the bottom of my heart, I beg for your forgiveness. There is no such thing as a harmless lie no matter how small it is. You may think a lie only hurts the liar, but this is far from the truth. If you are traveling a path of lies, please stop now and face the consequences. Whatever those consequences, they will be better than the pain you are causing yourself and others.\\" Deseret Morning News  Hacking family statement  Media  A dramatization of the murder of Lori Hacking was televised by an Escape series, produced by Bellum Entertainment Group, true crime episode of Corrupt Crimes: \\"Deadly Rampage at Fort Hood\\", S1 E104, aired: 12 July 2016.

Situated on the side of the Montg√≥ Massif, behind a wide bay and sheltered between two rocky headlands, the town has become a very popular small seaside resort and market town. Half of its resident population and over two thirds of its annual visitors are foreigners. History The area was first inhabited in prehistoric times, 30,000 years ago by cave dwellers on Montg√≥. Subsequent residents have included Stone and Bronze-age peoples, Romans, Greeks, Phoenicians, Visigoths, Germanic, Carthaginians, and Moors. Roman fishing boats used the port, and there is evidence that dates the Roman occupation of X√†bia to the 2nd century BC, it makes X√†bia the oldest known Roman site on the coast with a commercial port for fish and minerals. In the 6th century AD, Christian Visigoth monks came to X√†bia and founded the monastery of Sant Mart√≠, which likely gave its name to the cape in the area named Cap San Mart√≠. Hermenegild, son of the Visigoth king Leovigild of Toledo, sought refuge in the Monastery after angering his father by marrying a Christian girl. When his father's troops arrived to arrest him all but one monk fled to Portichol; Hermenegild and the old monk were killed. Several people with Visigoth names still live in the area. There is little left of the Moors and their culture, other than some inscribed gravestones and ceramics. They had controlled the area from about 714 AD until they (the Moriscos) were finally expelled from the Alicante region in 1609. The hermitage of Popol dates to the 14th century. In the 16th and 17th centuries pirate raids were prevalent, so a wall was built around the town for protection. The wall was later torn down, and today a replica exists in its place in certain sections. Geography X√†bia is situated in the north of the province, on the easternmost point of the Mediterranean coast. The island of Ibiza lies some to the east, and it can be seen on clear days. Flat, fertile agricultural land stretches for miles inland, criss-crossed by small streams and used primarily for growing citrus and olive trees. The coastline of X√†bia features four capes; Cabo de San Antonio, Cap de la Nau (the largest), Cap Negre and Cap Mart√≠. The Montg√≥ Massif, which shelters X√†bia, is the highest summit of the region standing at a height of over 750m.

Whilst the history of the harbour stretches back to the 15th century, the first jetty was built in 1871 and it became an important gateway for the export of raisins. The raisin trade collapsed at the end of the 19th century, and the settlement became only a fishing harbour. The modern harbour was built in the 1950s and 1960s. The nautical club has been in the central area of the harbour since 1963.

Statue of Hayes and two other Olympic gold medalists (Matt McGrath and Bob Tisdall) in Nenagh, Co Tipperary, Ireland John Joseph \\"Johnny\\" Hayes (April 10, 1886 ‚Äì August 25, 1965) was an American athlete, a member of the Irish American Athletic Club, and winner of the marathon race at the 1908 Summer Olympics. Hayes' Olympic victory contributed to the early growth of long- distance running and marathoning in the United States. He was also the first man to win a marathon at the now official standard distance of 26 miles 385 yards when Olympic officials lengthened the distance to put the finish line in front of the Royal Box (the 1896 and 1904 Olympic marathons had been less than 25 miles long). Biography Born in New York City to a family of Irish emigrants (from Nenagh in Co. Tipperary), Johnny Hayes is probably best known for winning the controversial marathon race at the London Olympics. Hayes is one of only three male American athletes to win the Olympic Marathon, (the other two being Thomas Hicks in 1904 and Frank Shorter in 1972). In 1905 he had joined Bloomingdale Brothers as an assistant to the manager of the sporting goods department. At night he trained on a cinder track on the roof of the Bloomingdales building in New York. He was promoted to manager of the department after returning from his Olympic victory.New York Times: 25 July 1908. Hayes started his athletics career with a fifth-place finish at the 1906 Boston Marathon, running for the St. Bartholemew Athletic Club in a time of 2:55:38.1910 Mecca Cigarettes Champion Athlete and Prize Fighter Series trading card. wingedfist.com He improved on that the following year by finishing third in Boston with a time of 2:30:38 and winning the inaugural Yonkers Marathon. In 1908 he finished second, 21 seconds behind Thomas Morrissey in the Boston Marathon with a time of 2:26:04 and thus qualified for the Olympic Games held in London that same year.2008 Boston Marathon Media Guide. The British Olympic Association wanted to start the race in front of Windsor Castle and finish in front of the royal reviewing stand at the White City Stadium. As a result, the distance was 42 km and 195 m. It took until 1921 for the IAAF to codify that distance as the official length of the marathon. Prior to this, races were usually about 25 miles (40 km). 1908 Olympic victory At the race itself, Dorando Pietri from Italy was the first to enter the stadium. But Pietri had depleted himself to open a more than 10 minute lead over the field, and was suffering extreme fatigue and dehydration. When he entered the stadium, he took the wrong path and when umpires redirected him, he fell down for the first time. He got up with their help, in front of 75,000 spectators. Pietri fell four more times, and each time the umpires helped him up. He managed to finish the race first, with a time of 2h 54min 46s. During all these stumbles, and the direct aid from the officials, Hayes had now entered the stadium, finishing the race second, with a time of 2h 55min 18s. Hayes running in the White Stadium near the finish line Pietri was disqualified after the US officials filed a protest. Despite the official result, Pietri achieved much more fame than Hayes, when Queen Alexandra awarded him a special silver cup. All of the Olympic officials were British, and the Pietri incident joined a list of other controversial calls in the 1908 Olympics, prompting the International Olympic Committee to start appointing judges from a wide variety of countries instead of only the host country. After the dramatic Olympic battle between Pietri and Hayes, public interest was such that a match race was organized by professional promoters in November, 1908 at Madison Square Garden. The race was won by Pietri by 75 yards. A second match race was held on March 15, 1909 and again Pietri won. Both Pietri and Hayes turned professional after the Olympics, and achieved great fame. Hayes was a trainer for the US 1912 Olympic team. He later taught physical education and was a food broker. Johnny Hayes died in Englewood, New Jersey. The Shore Athletic Club of New Jersey (Shore AC) holds the Johnny Hayes collection as lifetime trustees. Included in the collection are numerous trophies as well as the 1908 Olympic gold medal for the marathon. This represents the first Olympic gold medal to be won at the modern marathon distance of 26 miles, 385 yards. Johnny Hayes was a guest on the television show \\"I've Got A Secret\\" as one of five former Olympic champions which aired October 13, 1954. In 2002, three statues honoring Olympic champions with links to Nenagh, Matt McGrath, Johnny Hayes and Bob Tisdall, were unveiled in front of the Nenagh Courthouse.

Le Bontemps de Carnaval de Chaumont was updated and republished in 1660. The language used contrasts the French spoken by the king's messengers with the Champenois of the local inhabitants.

Unstan ware is the name used by archaeologists for a type of finely made and decorated Neolithic pottery from the 4th and 3rd millennia BC. Typical are elegant and distinctive shallow bowls with a band of grooved patterning below the rim,Henshall 1985, p. 88 a type of decoration which was created using a technique known as \\"stab-and- drag\\". A second version consists of undecorated, round-bottomed bowls.Laing 1974, p. 51 Some of the bowls had bits of volcanic rock included in the clay to make them stronger. Bone tools were used to burnish the surfaces to make them shiny and impermeable.Castleden 1987, p. 82 Unstan ware is named after the Unstan Chambered Cairn on the Mainland of the Orkney Islands,Ritchie 1985, p. 48 a fine example of a stalled chambered tomb in a circular mound, where the style of pottery was first found in 1884. Unstan ware is mostly found in tombs, specifically tombs of the Orkney-Cromarty type.Henshall 1985, p. 110 These include the Tomb of the Eagles at Isbister on South Ronaldsay, and Taversoe Tuick and Midhowe on Rousay.Ritchie 1995, p. 54 Unstan ware has been found occasionally at sites in Orkney other than tombs; for example, the farmstead of Knap of Howar on Papa Westray.Ritchie 1995, p. 52 Although more recent excavations in Orkney have found Unstan ware to be a more common feature in a domestic context than previously thought, challenging the interpretation of Unstan ware being mainly from tombs.Jones et al 2016, p. 375 and in the Western Isles, as at Eilean Domhnuill.Henshall 1972, p. 177 Unstan ware may have evolved into the later grooved ware style. This interpretation was originally based primarily on a presumed evolution in pottery styles, from Unstan ware to grooved ware, seen at the settlement of Rinyo on Rousay. D.V. Clarke claimed in 1983 that his investigations at Rinyo had debunked this sequence.Clarke 1983, pp. 49-51 John Hedges is another primary proponent of what might be termed the \\"cultural coexistence\\" hypothesis, suggesting that although Unstan ware may predate grooved ware, the cultures associated with these styles of pottery lived side by side across Orkney for centuries.Hedges 1984, p. 117 In this interpretation of the evidence, grooved ware is associated with the builders of the Maeshowe class of chambered tomb. The geographic distribution in Orkney of the two pottery types is as follows: grooved ware is found on Mainland, Sanday, and North Ronaldsay, with Unstan ware found on Mainland and the remaining islands, especially Rousay and Eday.Hedges 1984, pp. 118-119 Hedges sums up his view this way: > What is important is an understanding that the neolithic population of > Orkney can be divided into two major parts on the basis of some elements of > their material cultures. It is probable that they originated from different > areas and...there is no difficulty in imagining their ability to > coexist.Hedges 1984, p. 114 However, he also notes: > One point that should be made at the outset is that there is no discernable > difference in the culture- in the social anthropological sense- of the > Grooved Ware and Unstan Ware people...it is only apparent from limited > aspects of material culture and the evidence...shows it to have been > subordinate to a tribal level of unity which took in the whole of > Orkney.Hedges 1984, p. 127 See also * Prehistoric Orkney * Ring of Brodgar * Standing Stones of Stenness * Maeshowe * World Heritage Sites in Scotland * Timeline of prehistoric Scotland Unstan ware from Taversoe Tuick.

Remaining Western Auto store, Newport, Tennessee. Western Auto Supply Company--known more widely as Western Auto--was a specialty retail chain of stores that supplied automobile parts and accessories. It operated approximately 1200 stores across the United States. It was started in 1909 in Kansas City, Missouri, by George Pepperdine and Don Abnor Davis. Pepperdine later founded Pepperdine University. Western Auto was bought by Beneficial Corporation in 1961; Western Auto's management led a leveraged buyout in 1985, leading three years later to a sale to Sears. Sears sold most of the company to Advance Auto Parts in 1998, and by 2003, the resulting merger had led to the end of the Western Auto brand and its product distribution network. History Western Auto originally started as a mail order business for replacement auto parts. The first retail store was established in 1921, and grew quickly as automobiles became increasingly more common. At one point, there were over 1,200 company-owned stores nationwide, usually located in metropolitan areas, and more than 4,000 associate stores (private, franchised, \\"dealer\\" locations), usually located in small towns. The associate store program was the first of its type, pioneering the way for modern day franchise operations. The company had five regional distribution centers in the United States, with the North Carolina one serving its stores in Puerto Rico. =Brand names= Western Auto was known for its Western Flyer (bicycle) and Performance Radial GT (tire) brands. Other Western Auto private labeled brands popular with consumers included \\"Davis Tires\\" (likely named for Don A. Davis, a Western Auto founder), \\"Tough One\\" Batteries, \\"Wizard\\" Tools, \\"TrueTone\\" electronics and \\"Citation\\" appliances. Western Auto was also the parent company of Auto America and Parts America stores, as well as acquiring National Tire Warehouse (NTW) stores. They also used the \\"Wizard\\" name on outdoor equipment such as lawn mowers and tillers and also a line of outboard engines and boats for a short time. =Firearm sales= Sometime in the 1940s or 1950s, or possibly earlier, Western Auto started selling rifles and shotguns in its catalogues. As with other chains at the time, such as Sears, Roebuck and Co., Montgomery Ward, and J.C. Penney, Western Auto's firearms were sold under a proprietary brand. Often called \\"store brand\\" firearms, they were produced by reputable name brand manufacturers, such as O.F. Mossberg & Sons, Remington Arms, Savage Arms, Winchester Repeating Arms Company, and High Standard Manufacturing Company. Western Auto firearms sold under the \\"Revelation\\" brand name, and were generally models from the brands Savage, Marlin Firearms, or Mossberg. Other than markings, Revelation models were identical to standard production models. They were the most basic models produced by the various manufacturers, and featured plain birch or walnut stocks. However, metal bluing remained good and nearly all models were provided with iron sights and mounting provisions for scopes. Once valued lower than \\"name brand\\" equivalents, store-brand rifles, shotguns, and revolvers have essentially reached price parity with their more universal counterparts. Firearms were one of many lines added to the store in a product diversification effort. By the end of the 1950s Western Auto was very much like a Sears store, even equipped with a catalog order center. Auto parts composed only a small percentage of the company's sales by the mid-1960s and had all but disappeared by the 1970s. =Beneficial= In 1961, Western Auto was sold to the Beneficial Finance Corporation. Beneficial retained ownership until 1985, when the company was purchased in a leveraged buyout led by Western Auto management and Wesray Capital Corporation. =Streamlining business operations= In the early 1980s, in response to the success of Wal-Mart, Western Auto Retail converted all of the company-owned stores to what it called \\"FLAG\\" stores, which sold exclusively automotive parts and accessories. These stores were largely located in more urbanized areas much like their successors today. Western Auto Wholesale strongly urged its associate stores to become at least 50% automotive, but most refused because the customer base of their locations, in \\"small town America\\", demanded a wider range of merchandise. This disagreement by the associate stores would later save the company. In February 1986, Western Auto purchased 40 White Stores in Texas from Canadian Tire for US$24.5 million. In February 1987, Western Auto purchased Wheeling, West Virginia-based Tire America. In October of that year, it purchased Dale City, Virginia-based National Tire Warehouse. =Sears Roebuck & Co. purchase= In 1988, Sears Roebuck purchased Western Auto from Wesray Capital. In 1995, Western Auto went into a buying spree involving two unrelated business transactions by acquiring 84 auto parts stores in Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia and Tennessee from the bankrupted Nationwise Automotive chain in October for an undisclosed amount and later acquired Wheels Discount Auto Supply and its 82 auto parts stores in New York and Pennsylvania at the end of the year from its then owner Fay's Drug for $37 million. Alternate Link via ProQuest. Also during 1995, Sears began to convert the Western Auto stores to the new parts-only Parts America format by eliminating the automotive service bays. By 1998, Sears almost finished converting the 600 remaining company owned Western Auto stores into Parts America branded stores. By the beginning of 1997, fewer than 850 company-owned stores remained. At that point, the associate stores were the bread and butter of the company, with their more diversified name-brand lines including appliances, electronics, hardware, bicycles, go-karts and outdoor equipment/parts, and their reach into small-town America. Sears removed National Tire Warehouse and Tire America from Western Auto to form a new company called National Tire and Battery, which Sears kept until 2003. From 1991 until the end of the 1997 season, Western Auto sponsored NASCAR Hall of Fame driver Darrell Waltrip's Winston Cup race team. The specialty retailer also sponsored Al Hofmann's Funny Car in NHRA from 1994 to 1997. =Advance Auto Parts merger= After weeks of speculation in 1998, parent company Sears sold the remnants of Western Auto to Advance Auto Parts of Roanoke, Virginia. The business deal was not quite what experts in the after-market automotive industry expected. Specifically in return, Sears Roebuck became \\"one of the largest shareholders\\" after obtaining a 40% stake in Advance Auto Parts, and by merging their two store networks, which included Western Auto's wholesale and retail operations. More precisely, the existing store network of Advance Auto Parts, comprising 915 stores in 17 U.S. states, merged with 590 U.S.-based Parts America Stores in addition to 40 Western Auto stores in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The merger between Western Auto and Advance Auto substantially expanded Advance's network to over 1,500 retail stores in 36 states. Additionally, Sears Roebuck received a cash payment of $175 million USD, while Advance Auto's investors provided a further $70 million USD directly to Advance. Freeman Spogli & Co. organized an investment fund that was among the group of investors that provided Advance with the $70 million cash infusion. Despite the 40% acquisition by Sears Roebuck, both companies maintained their Standard & Poor's \\"single-'B'-plus corporate credit rating\\". Analysts continued to speculate on the \\"financial flexibility\\" of Advance Auto at the time expecting the company to \\"take advantage of other opportunistic acquisitions\\". A few of the associate stores converted to Sears Dealer stores. The remainder of the company-owned stores, located primarily in the eastern United States, were then converted into Advance stores. The remaining associate stores were promised a great and long future in the tradition of Western Auto, a promise that was not kept. Advance gave little support to the associate store operation and as a result most dealers found themselves purchasing 70%+ of their merchandise from other suppliers and simply using the Western Auto name. Demise of the Western Auto distribution network In October 2003, Advance Auto notified the Western Auto Supply Company that by January 2004 it \\"would no longer supply merchandise and services to the stores in its distribution network\\". This decision brought an end to the Western Auto brand name after nearly a century in business. Some Western Auto store owners knew that such a decision by Advance Auto was inevitable after noticing \\"a trend of discontinued brands, lack of computer point-of-sale system updates, and shipments of fewer and fewer types of merchandise\\". Advance Auto Parts' spokesman, Shelia Stuewe, speaking on the matter stated \\"that the logistics of distributing appliances, home and garden supplies, auto parts and hardware to over 300 independent dealers scattered across 33 states became too much for the company to continue.\\" =Use of Western Auto name= Dealer stores were permitted by Advance Auto Parts a license to use the Western Auto name until 2006. After 2006, stores were to cease using the Western Auto name, however many stores continue to use the name illegally. At this time, no storefront is licensed to use the name Western Auto or fly the Western Auto sign. Advance Auto Parts remains the owner of the registered trademarks and name \\"Western Auto\\" and enforces infringements on the name, but it is unknown if they have future plans for the name. Advance also owns the name Western Auto Supply Company which is registered in Virginia.http://www.bizapedia.com/wv/WESTERN- AUTO-SUPPLY-COMPANY.html The Western Auto name was used by Advance Auto Parts in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, where it was the largest such chain, until 2006 when the last company-owned store in St. Croix was closed. All of the other stores in the division were gradually converted to Advance stores. The building that once housed its corporate headquarters, located at 2107 Grand Boulevard in Kansas City, Missouri, was transformed into loft condominiums; the Western Auto sign remains atop the building. The sign was relit on July 13, 2018 at 8:45pm Central time, having been refurbished with funding from the current condo association.

Typically they are fought in costume and commemorate some event or tradition of the Middle Ages, and thus often involve horse racing, archery, jousting, crossbow shooting, and similar medieval sports. Once purely a matter of local rivalries, many have now become events staged with an eye to visitors and foreign tourists. The Palio di Siena in July 2010 The oldest extant palio is the Palio di Ferrara, but the Palio di Siena is the one that has been running for a longer time without interruption and it is definitely the better known internationally.

Biletnikoff (born February 23, 1943) is a former gridiron football player and coach. He was a wide receiver for the Oakland Raiders in the American Football League (AFL) and National Football League (NFL) for fourteen seasons and later an assistant coach with the team. He retired as an NFL player after the 1978 season, and then played one additional season in the Canadian Football League (CFL) for the Montreal Alouettes in 1980. While he lacked the breakaway speed to be a deep-play threat, Biletnikoff was one of the most sure-handed and consistent receivers of his day, with a propensity for making spectacular catches. He was also known for running smooth, precise pass routes. He is a member of both the Pro Football Hall of Fame (1988) and College Football Hall of Fame (1991). Biletnikoff attended Florida State University, where he played college football for the Florida State Seminoles football team and earned consensus All-America honors after leading the country in receiving yards and receiving touchdowns as a senior. The Biletnikoff Award, given annually to the most outstanding receiver in NCAA Division I FBS, is named in his honor. Through his AFL and NFL career, Biletnikoff recorded 589 receptions for 8,974 yards and 76 touchdowns, and had a then-league-record 10 straight seasons of 40 or more receptions. He accomplished these numbers at a time when teams emphasized running over passing. With the Raiders, Biletnikoff played in the second AFL-NFL World Championship game‚Äîretroactively known as Super Bowl II‚Äîand in Super Bowl XI, in which he was named the game's MVP in a victory over the Minnesota Vikings. A four-time Pro Bowl selection, he also played two AFL All-Star games, three AFL title games, and five AFC championship games. Early years Biletnikoff was born and raised in Erie, Pennsylvania, the son of Natalie (Karuba) and Ephriam Biletnikoff. All four of his grandparents were Russian immigrants.1920 United States Federal Census, 1930 United States Federal Census In Erie, Biletnikoff attended what was then Technical Memorial High School, now Central Tech, whose athletic field now bears his name. In high school, Biletnikoff excelled in football, basketball, baseball, and track. He was a champion high jumper and earned All-City honors in basketball and baseball. His younger brother Bob was a starting quarterback for the Miami Hurricanes in the mid-1960s. College Turning down other notable offers, Biletnikoff chose to attend Florida State University in Tallahassee. He missed several games during his first varsity season in 1962 with a broken foot. He played on both sides of the ball his junior season, leading the team in receptions and interceptions. That year, he returned an interception 99 yards for a touchdown off a pass thrown by George Mira of the Miami Hurricanes, a record which stood until 1987, when Deion Sanders broke it by one yard. As a senior in 1964, Biletnikoff led the nation with 1,179 receiving yards and 15 touchdowns, and finished second in receptions (70) and scoring (90). One of his touchdowns came in the first quarter against the Florida Gators, which helped the Seminoles earn their first victory in the in-state rivalry, 16‚Äì7. The Seminoles finished the year with a 36‚Äì19 victory over Oklahoma in the Gator Bowl, in which Biletnikoff set school records with 13 receptions for 194 yards and four touchdowns. He was a consensus pick for the 1964 College Football All-America Team, receiving first-team honors from four official selectors: the Associated Press, Central Press Association, Football Writers Association of America, and Newspaper Enterprise Association. He was Florida State's first consensus All-American in football. Biletnikoff compiled 100 receptions for 1,655 yards and 20 touchdowns in his career with the Seminoles, which at the time were all school records. While in college Fred also joined the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. Professional career After graduating from FSU, he was selected by the Oakland Raiders in the second round of the 1965 AFL Draft, 11th overall and by the Detroit Lions in the third round of the 1965 NFL Draft, the 39th overall selection. Biletnikoff signed with the Raiders, where he played for fourteen seasons. With Oakland, he was nicknamed \\"Coyote\\", and \\"Doctor Zhivago\\" because of his Russian heritage. In 1966, he caught his first touchdown pass, thrown by quarterback Tom Flores, who later became the Raiders' head coach the season after Biletnikoff was released by the team. Although he lacked the breakaway speed to be a deep threat, Biletnikoff's precise pass routes and sure hands made him one of the most consistent receivers of his day, and a favorite target of Raiders quarterbacks Daryle Lamonica and Ken Stabler. \\"I like catching passes\\", he explained. \\"And I like playing outside. I would be lost if I were ever told to do anything on a football field except catch passes.\\" Through his career he recorded 589 receptions, and had a league record 10 straight seasons of 40 or more receptions from 1967 to 1976, since surpassed by many players. Following the retirement of Charley Taylor, Biletnikoff spent the 1978 season (his last) as the NFL's active leader in career receiving yards, and retired ranked 5th all- time.Career receiving yards, 1978 leaderboard Biletnikoff popularized the use of Stickum, an adhesive that many players applied to their hands to assist with catching and gripping the ball. He would apply the substance all over his body and uniform prior to a game, a practice that was later picked up by Raiders cornerback Lester Hayes after Biletnikoff introduced him to it. The use of Stickum was banned by the NFL in 1981. In his rookie season, Biletnikoff played primarily on special teams. He did not see playing time on offense until the seventh game of the year, against the Boston Patriots, in which he caught seven passes for 118 yards. His production increased significantly with Oakland's acquisition of quarterback Daryle Lamonica in 1967. That year, he caught 40 passes for 876 yards and five touchdowns and led the league with an average of 21.9 yards per reception. He was invited to play in the 1967 AFL All-Star Game. In that year's AFL championship game, Biletnikoff had two receptions for 19 yards in the Raiders' 40‚Äì7 blow-out win over the Houston Oilers. In Super Bowl II against the Green Bay Packers, he caught two passes for 10 yards as the Raiders were defeated 33‚Äì14. Biletnikoff recorded his only 1,000-yard receiving season in 1968, when he caught 61 passes for 1,037 yards and six touchdowns. The following season, in 1969 he caught a career-high 12 receiving touchdowns. He was an AFL All-Star for the second time and earned first-team All-AFL honors from the Associated Press, the Newspaper Enterprise Association, Pro Football Writers of America, The Sporting News, Pro Football Weekly, and the New York Daily News. The AFL merged into the National Football League in 1970. In his first five seasons in the NFL, Biletnikoff was invited to four Pro Bowls. A highly productive receiver in the postseason, Biletnikoff left the NFL as the all-time leader in postseason receptions (70), receiving yards (1,167), and receiving touchdowns (10) accumulated over 19 postseason games. He recorded over 100 receiving yards in a postseason five times. In the 1968 American Football League playoffs, he had 14 receptions for 370 yards and four touchdowns through two games. In the 1976‚Äì77 NFL playoffs, Biletnikoff recorded 13 receptions for 216 yards and a touchdown. This included four catches for 79 yards to set up three Oakland scores in the Raiders' 32‚Äì14 victory in Super Bowl XI, for which he was named Super Bowl MVP. Biletnikoff was released by the Raiders prior to the 1979 season. After a year off, he played one season in the Canadian Football League for the Montreal Alouettes in 1980. In his lone CFL season, Biletnikoff caught 38 passes, second-most on the team, for 470 yards and four touchdowns. Coaching career and later life Biletnikoff began his career in coaching soon after his retirement from playing. He served on the coaching staff of Orange Glen High School (1982), Palomar College (1983), Diablo Valley College (1984), Oakland Invaders (1985), Arizona Wranglers (1986), and Calgary Stampeders (1987‚Äì88). In January 2007, Biletnikoff retired as the wide receivers coach for the Oakland Raiders, which had been his role for 18 seasons starting in 1989. In February 1999, Biletnikoff's daughter, Tracey, was found strangled to death at age 20 in Redwood City, California. Tracey's boyfriend, Mohammed Haroon Ali, was convicted of first-degree murder in 2012 after admitting he strangled her with a T-shirt at a drug and alcohol treatment center during an argument over whether he had relapsed. He was sentenced to 55 years to life imprisonment. Biletnikoff called Ali an \\"animal\\" after the sentencing, and said his hatred for him would never go away. In 2015, Biletnikoff founded Tracey's Place of Hope in Loomis, California, a shelter for domestic violence victims and substance abuse treatment for females ages 14 to 18. Honors Biletnikoff was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1988. In 1999, Biletnikoff was ranked number 94 on The Sporting News' list of the \\"100 Greatest Football Players\\". He was voted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1991. The Fred Biletnikoff Award, awarded annually by the Tallahassee Quarterback Club Foundation to the nation's outstanding receiver in NCAA Division I FBS since 1994, is named in his honor. In 2016, Biletnikoff was named the Walter Camp Man of the Year by the Walter Camp Football Foundation in recognition of his public service and his contributions to football.

Prior to 1871 many German counties organized various local census records, however most of the results did not survive World War II. The 1895 census is the first Volksz√§hlung (German People count) to be published in the Statistik des Deutschen Reiches yearly, with copies surviving. It gives detailed info on population, property, religion and nationality in all German territories. However, the record was organized at the peak of the Kulturkampf campaign and it is openly criticized for understating the number of Catholics in most of the areas. Also, the accuracy of the population figures published from the 1895 German census for the Polish territories was \\"adjusted\\" to show that the ratio of ethnic Germans to ethnic Poles was much higher than it actually was. The Polish language was banned from usage in administration and education and the data for numbers of Polish speakers was lowered. This is attributed to the official push to Germanize the areas and to legitimize the century of occupation.

He was a founding member of three noteworthy English folk-rock bands: Fairport Convention, Steeleye Span and The Albion Band. Hutchings has overseen numerous other projects, including records and live theatre, and has collaborated on film and television projects. History =Early career= Hutchings was born in Southgate, London England, but moved to Muswell Hill while still a child. As a teenager he became involved in the skiffle and blues movements and formed several groups, including 'Dr K's Blues Band' in 1964. He met guitarist Simon Nicol in 1966 when they both played in the 'Ethnic Shuffle Orchestra'. They rehearsed on the floor above Nicol's father's medical practice in a house called \\"Fairport\\" and lent its name to the group they formed together as Fairport Convention in 1967 with Richard Thompson, which soon included Martin Lamble, Judy Dyble and Iain Matthews.B. Hinton, and G. Wall, Ashley Hutchings: The Guv'nor & the Rise of Folk Rock, (London: Helter Skelter, 2002), =Fairport Convention= Hutchings played on the band's first four albums. The first three, Fairport Convention (1968), What We Did on Our Holidays (1969) and Unhalfbricking (1969), largely consisted of American singer/songwriter material and original songs in a similar style. Hutchings' restrained but powerful bass style is one of the characteristics of the band in this period. The focus of the band changed with the introduction of Dave Swarbrick into the line up, who brought a virtuosity on the fiddle and a wealth of traditional tunes. This prompted Hutchings to carry out research in the English Folk Dance & Song Society Library at Cecil Sharp House which resulted in the pioneering classic Liege and Lief (1969), seen by many as the foundation of British folk rock. Hutchings was, however, increasingly unhappy with the direction of the band, as most members wanted to return to their older format. As a result, in 1969 he left to focus on more traditional projects.P. Humphries, Meet on the Ledge ‚Äì a History of Fairport Convention, (London, Eel Pie Publishing Ltd, 1982), =Steeleye Span= Hutchings' new band Steeleye Span was formed by putting together two established folk duos Tim Hart and Maddy Prior with Terry and Gay Woods. The Woodses departed the band shortly after the release of their debut album, Hark! The Village Wait (1970) and were replaced by singer/guitarist Martin Carthy and fiddler Peter Knight. The resulting line-up toured small concert venues, and recorded two highly regarded albums Please to See the King (1971) and Ten Man Mop, or Mr. Reservoir Butler Rides Again (1972), both providing electric versions of traditional songs. The bringing in of manager Jo Lustig who pushed for a more commercial sound was probably what prompted the more traditionally minded Carthy and Hutchings to leave the band, which continued with changes of line- up and achieved considerable mainstream success.Hinton, B. and Wall, G. (2002) Ashley Hutchings: The Guv'nor & the Rise of Folk Rock. London: Helter Skelter, =The Albion Country Band, Morris On and Etchingham Steam Band= By this point the ever active Hutchings already had other projects underway. He had gathered together the first incarnation of what has been the major outlet for his work, the Albion Country Band, to provide backing for his then wife Shirley Collins on her solo collection, No Roses (1971). Some of these personnel co-operated with him for the album Morris On (1972), an affectionate electric tribute to Morris Dancing and others joined him in his next project the Etchingham Steam Band from 1974‚Äì6. When this dissolved without releasing a record he returned to the Albion Band in 1976, which, with many bewildering line-up changes, continued to record and tour regularly until 2002.Brian Hinton & Geoff Wall, Ashley Hutchings: Always Chasing Rainbows, (Stick It in Your Ear, 2007) =Other projects= Outside of the Albion Band, Hutchings has been a frequent guest on the albums of a wide variety of folk artists. He has also continued to pursue a diversity of projects, some alone and some with groupings of more or less stability and continuity. The Morris on project has spawned several sequels across his career: Son of Morris On (1976), Grandson of Morris On (2002) and Great Grandson of Morris On (2004). There have also been several other dance projects including, with John Kirkpatrick and other artists, The Compleat Dancing Master (1974), Rattlebone & Ploughjack (1976) and Kickin' Up the Sawdust (1977). In 1984, Hutchings wrote and toured with a one-man show about folk song collector Cecil Sharp, which resulted in the album An Hour with Cecil Sharp and Ashley Hutchings, (1986).P. Humphries, Meet on the Ledge, Fairport Convention, the Classic Years, (Virgin, 2nd ed, 1997), p. 150, From this point he often combined writing and narration with his music, as in By Gloucester Docks I Sat Down and Wept: A Love Story (1987), which was produced as a live show and album in 1990. He produced an album of spoken-word material as A Word in Your Ear (1991) another themed album combining music and narration with Judy Dunlop, as Sway with Me (1991). In the late 1980s he toured with the Ashley Hutchings All Stars, leading to a live album, As You Like It (1988). With Phil Beer and Chris While he provided the sound track for the TV series The Ridge Riders which resulted in an album \\"Ridgeriders: Songs of the Southern English Landscape\\" (HTD, 1995), a short tour and another live album Ridgeriders in Concert (Talking Elephant, 1996). In the 1990s he returned to his own musical roots of skiffle and rock and roll, touring and recording with the Ashley Hutchings Big Beat Combo, which resulted in the album Twangin' and a Traddin' (1994). He also returned to his interest in dance, in addition to continuing the Morris on project, he formed the Ashley Hutchings Dance Band to produce A Batter Pudding for John Keats (1996). Other projects include with Malcolm Rowe, the truly eclectic Folk Your Way to Fitness (1997), Street Cries (2001), and Human Nature (2003). =Rainbow Chasers, Albion Christmas and the Lark Rise Band= After the suspension of the Albion Band as a full time group in 2002 Hutchings put together another small group of up and coming folk musicians under the title Rainbow Chasers resulting in three albums, Some Colours Fly (2005), A Brilliant Light (2005) and Fortune Never Sleeps (2006). In 2008 he formed The Lark Rise Band to perform and record music from his most successful show, resulting in the album, Lark Rise Revisited (2008). He continues to tour in the Christmas season with the Albion Christmas Band and is plans future projects with ex-Albion Band member Ken Nicol. =Recognition= His career has been celebrated with the release of archive series, The Guv'nor and Burning Bright (2005) a boxed set of four CDs, which contain many rare and previously unreleased recordings. In 2006 Hutchings received the prestigious Good Tradition trophy at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards in recognition of his contributions to the genre and in 2007 he shared the special award for 'Most influential Folk Album of all time' for Liege and Lief. On 12 December 2013 Hutchings was presented with the Gold Badge Award of the English Folk Dance and Song Society at an Albion Christmas Band concert held at Kings Place, London.Folk Rock Pioneer Ashley Hutchings Honoured, , retrieved on 14 December 2013 He was awarded the MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours of 2015, for services to folk music. =Personal life= Hutchings married the British folksinger Shirley Collins in 1971 but divorced around 1978.America Over the Water, 2004, SAF Publishing, p. 186, He and Judy Dunlop have a son, Blair Dunlop, born on 11 February 1992.

Her father, Allan Prior, was co-creator of the police drama Z-Cars. She was married to Steeleye bass guitarist Rick Kemp and their daughter, Rose Kemp, is also a singer. Their son, Alex Kemp, is, like his father, a guitarist and has deputised for his father playing bass guitar for Steeleye Span. She was part of the singing duo 'Mac & Maddy', with Mac MacLeod. She then performed with Tim Hart and recorded two albums with him, before they helped to found the group Steeleye Span, in 1969. She left Steeleye Span in 1997, but returned in 2002, and has toured with them since. With June Tabor she was the singing duo Silly Sisters. She toured with the Carnival Band, in 2007, and with Giles Lewin and Hannah James, in 2012 and 2013. She has released singles and albums as a solo artist, with these bands and in several collaborations. She runs an Arts Centre called Stones Barn, in Bewcastle, in Cumbria, which offers residential courses. Early life Born in Blackpool, Prior moved in her teens to St Albans, where she befriended the young Donovan Leitch and Mac MacLeod in The Cock pub. She later formed a duo with MacLeod called 'Mac & Maddy'. She became a roadie for visiting American musicians, including Reverend Gary Davis. They gave her useful advice about singing English folk songs instead of American songs. Her father, Allan Prior, was co-creator of the police drama Z-Cars, and wrote Stookie, a 6-part series for television, about a boy with his arm in a sling. Maddy sang the title song, which was released as a single in 1985. It reappeared on the Steeleye Span album A Rare Collection 1972 ‚Äì 1996. Singing career After a brief stint with Mac MacLeod in 'Mac & Maddy' (another act formed at The Cock pub), by 1966 she began performing with Tim Hart, another St Albans resident, and together they recorded two albums before becoming founding members of Steeleye Span in 1969. They were the backbone of the group until the early 1980s when ill-health forced Hart into semi-retirement. Prior plays the tambourine, spoons and ukulele, and always gives a sprightly performance of her individual dances. In 1974 Ralph McTell wrote \\"Maddy Dances\\" in her honour, included on his album Easy. Prior married bassist Rick Kemp, though they have since divorced. The singer Rose Kemp is their daughter. Prior has recorded session work, albums of her own songs and eclectic styles from medieval (with The Carnival Band), through British folk rock ‚Äî Steeleye Span and Maddy Prior appeared on television with a regular BBC 4 programme Electric Folk ‚Äî prog- rock and traditional songs, including session work on Mike Oldfield's Incantations. She left Steeleye Span in 1997 but returned in 2002. The 1999 album The Journey was recorded in 1995, when Maddy was still in the band, but not released until four years later. She was also one half of the duo Silly Sisters, which helped to boost June Tabor's career. Since 2003 Prior has run and hosted an Arts Centre called Stones Barn in Cumbria. Working with fellow singers and performers like Abbie Lathe and daughter Rose Kemp, Prior has offered residential courses focusing on singing, meditation, cookery and performance. Other events, hosted by other teachers, include classical Indian dances, painting and drumming. Prior campaigns on behalf of the charity Cancer Research UK. Recent tours and albums Maddy Prior took to the road with The Carnival Band in May 2007 for their \\"Music for Tavern and Chapel\\" tour. They celebrated the 300th anniversary of one of the key influences on their work, Charles Wesley. She made a guest appearance with The Levellers at the Solfest Festival in Cumbria in August 2007. On recent albums Troy Donockley has been a co-producer. In December 2007 the album Ringing The Changes was issued. It is a collection of songs written by the band. In 2008 Maddy Prior appeared at the BBC's \\"Electric Proms\\". Steeleye Span toured the Eastern US, Australia and the UK beginning in 2009. With Giles Lewin and Hannah James, Prior completed two successful UK tours, in the spring and autumn of 2012, with a third, in autumn 2013. In November and December 2013 Prior toured with Steeleye Span, on the Wintersmith Tour, following the release in October of their album Wintersmith, a collaborative project based on the novel of the same name by Sir Terry Pratchett. A short tour with The Carnival Band in November and December, featuring carols and seasonal music, has become a regular fixture for Prior in recent years. Awards In 2001 Maddy Prior was awarded the MBE for services to folk music. In 2014 she received an Honorary Fellowship from the University of Cumbria.

It is one of the most readily recognized of all the edible mushrooms and highly sought after. Each fruit body begins as a tightly compressed, grayish sponge with lighter ridges, and expands to form a large yellowish sponge with large pits and ridges raised on a large white stem. The pitted yellow-brown caps measure broad by tall, and are fused to the stem at its lower margin, forming a continuous hollow. The pits are rounded and irregularly arranged. The hollow stem is typically long by thick, and white to yellow. The fungus fruits under hardwoods and conifers during a short period in the spring, depending on the weather, and is also associated with old orchards, woods and disturbed grounds Taxonomy and naming The fungus was originally named Phallus esculentus by Carl Linnaeus in his Species Plantarum (1753), and given its current name by Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries in 1801. Morchella esculenta is commonly known by various names: morel, common morel, true morel, morel mushroom, yellow morel, sponge morel, Molly Moocher, haystack, and dryland fish. In Nepal it is known as Guchi chyau. The specific epithet is derived from the Latin esculenta, meaning \\"edible\\". The scientific name Morchella esculenta has been applied to many similar yellow morels throughout the world. In 2014 Richard et al. used DNA analysis to restrict the M. esculenta name to a single species of yellow morel commonly found in Europe and also reported from China. Other species of yellow morel, including those in North America, have received new scientific names. Description The cap is pale brownish cream, yellow to tan or pale brown to grayish brown. The edges of the ridges are usually lighter than the pits, and somewhat oval in outline, sometimes bluntly cone- shaped with a rounded top or more elongate. Caps are hollow, attached to the stem at the lower edge, and typically about broad by tall. The flesh is brittle. The stem is white to pallid or pale yellow, hollow, and straight or with a club-shaped or bulbous base. It is finely granular overall, somewhat ridged, generally about long by thick. In age it may have brownish stains near the base. It has a passing resemblance to the common stinkhorn (Phallus impudicus), for which it is sometimes mistaken. Yellow morels are often found near wooded areas. Centipedes sometimes make their home inside these morels; infested morels usually have a hole in the top. =Microscopic characteristics= The spores range from white to cream to slightly yellow in deposit, although a spore print may be difficult to obtain given the shape of the fruit body. The spores are formed in asci lining the pits‚Äîthe ridges are sterile. They are ellipsoidal, smooth, thin-walled, translucent (hyaline), and measure 17.5‚Äì21.9 by 8.8‚Äì11.0 ¬µm. The asci are eight-spored, 223‚Äì300 by 19‚Äì20 ¬µm, cylindrical, and hyaline. The paraphyses are filamentous, cylindrical, 5.8‚Äì8.8 ¬µm wide, and hyaline. The hyphae of the stem are interwoven, hyaline, and measure 5.8‚Äì9.4 ¬µm wide. The surface hyphae are inflated, spherical to pear-shaped, 22‚Äì44 ¬µm wide, covered by a network of interwoven hyphae 11‚Äì16.8 ¬µm wide with recurved cylindrical hyphal ends. =Development= Fruit bodies have successfully been grown in the laboratory. R. Ower was the first to describe the developmental stages of ascomata grown in a controlled chamber. This was followed by in-depth cytological studies by Thomas Volk and Leonard (1989, 1990). To study the morel life cycle they followed the development of ascoma fruiting in association with tuberous begonias (Begonia tuberhybrida), from very small primordia to fully developed fruit bodies. Young fruit bodies begin development in the form of a dense knot of hyphae, when suitable conditions of moisture and nutrient availability conditions have been reached. Hyphal knots are underground and cup-shaped for some time, but later emerge from the soil and develop into a stalked fruiting body. Further growth makes the hymenium convex with the asci facing towards the outer side. Because of the unequal growth of the surface of the hymenium, it becomes folded to form many ridges and depressions, resulting in the sponge or honeycomb appearance. Similar species Morchella esculenta is probably the most familiar of the morels. In contrast to M. angusticeps and its relatives, the caps are light- colored throughout development, especially the ridges, which remain paler than the pits. M. crassipes is sometimes confused with M. esculenta. According to Smith (1975), the two are distinct, but young forms of M. crassipes are difficult to separate from M. esculenta. The two are similar in color, but M. crassipes is larger, often has thin ridges, and sometimes has a stem base that is enlarged and longitudinally grooved. Stinkhorns (esp. Phallus impudicus) have also been confused with morels, but specimens of the former have a volva at the base of the stem, and are covered with gleba‚Äîa slimy, foul-smelling spore mass. See also Gyromitra esculenta, which is similar in appearance but poisonous. Habitat and distribution Drawing by von Albin Schmalfu√ü, 1897 Group of morels, Illinois, USA Fruit bodies are sometimes solitary, but more often in groups, on the ground in a variety of habitats. A preference for soil with a limestone base (alkaline) has been noted, but they have also been found in acid soils. The mushroom is usually found in early spring, in forests, orchards, yards, gardens and sometimes in recently burned areas. In North America, it is sometimes referred to as the \\"May mushroom\\" due to its consistent fruiting in that month, but the time of fruiting varies locally, from February to July. It is typically the last morel species to fruit in locales where more than one species are found. For example, in northern Canada and in cooler mountainous regions, morels typically do not appear until June. It has been suggested that the springtime fruiting may be due to their ability to grow at low temperatures to the exclusion of competition, a conclusion later corroborated by experiments correlating spore germination to soil temperatures. One author suggests the acronym PETSBASH may be used to remember the trees associated with morels: pine, elm, tulip, sassafras, beech, ash, sycamore, and hickory. In North America, it is widely distributed, but especially common in eastern North America and the Midwest. David Arora notes that \\"large crops can also be found around the bases of dying (but not quite dead) elms attacked by Dutch elm disease.\\" The species has been named state mushroom of Minnesota, and was the first state mushroom of any state. It can also be found in Brazil and Bulgaria. In Jammu and Kashmir wild mushrooms, locally known as Himalayan wild mushroom, Gucchi, Morchella conica and Morchella esculenta, are gathered and supplied as medical remedy.JK Medicinal Plants Introduction Centre Cultivation Due to the mushroom's prized fruit bodies, several attempts have been made to grow the fungus in culture. In 1901, Repin reported successfully obtaining fruit bodies in a cave in which cultures had been established in flower pots nine years previously in 1892. More recently, small scale commercial growers have had success growing morels by using partially shaded rows of mulched wood. The rows of mulch piles are inoculated with morel mushroom spores in a solution of water and molasses which are poured over the piles of mulch and then they are allowed to grow undisturbed for several weeks. A solution of wood ashes mixed in water and diluted is subsequently poured over the rows of wood mulch which triggers fruiting of the morels. Morels are known to appear after fires and the alkaline conditions produced by wood ash mixed with water initiate fruit body formation for most species of morels. Uses =Edibility= Harvested morels Morchella esculenta, like all morels, are among the most highly prized of all edible mushrooms. Raw morels have a gastrointestinal irritant, hydrazine, but parboiling or blanching before consumption will remove it. Old fruit bodies that show signs of decay may be poisonous. The mushrooms may be fried in butter or baked after being stuffed with meats and vegetables. The mushrooms may also be dried by threading the caps onto string and hanging them in the sun; this process is said to concentrate the flavor. One study determined the main nutritional components to be as follows (on a dry weight basis): protein 32.7%, fat 2.0%, fiber 17.6%, ash 9.7%, and carbohydrates 38.0%. In one isolated case in Germany, six people were reported to have developed neurologic effects between 6‚Äì12 hours after consumption. The effects included ataxia and visual disturbances, and lasted up to a day before disappearing without enduring effects. =Bioactive compounds= Both the fruit bodies and the mycelia of M. esculenta contain an uncommon amino acid, cis-3-amino-L-proline; this amino acid does not appear to be protein bound. In addition to M. esculenta, the amino acid is known to exist only in M. conica and M. crassipes. Industrial applications; solid state-fermentation Solid- state fermentation is an industrial process to produce enzymes and to upgrade the values of existing foods, especially oriental foods. Solid-state fermentation is a process whereby an insoluble substrate is fermented with sufficient moisture but without free water. Solid-state fermentation, unlike that of slurry state, requires no complex fermentation controls and has many advantages over submerged liquid fermentation. M. esculenta has shown promise in degrading starch and upgrading the nutritional value of cornmeal during solid-state fermentation. M. esculenta mycelia is able to bind to and inhibit the effects of furanocoumarins, chemicals found in grapefruit that inhibit human cytochrome p450 enzymes and are responsible for the \\"grapefruit/drug\\" interaction phenomenon.

Taxonomy The family Agaricaceae was published by French botanist Fran√ßois Fulgis Chevallier in 1826. It is named after the type genus Agaricus, originally circumscribed by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 work Species Plantarum. In his authoritative 1986 classification of the Agaricales, Rolf Singer divided the Agaricaceae into four tribes distinguished largely by spore color: Leucocoprineae, Agariceae, Lepioteae, and Cystodermateae. Genera once classified in the families Tulostomataceae, Battarreaceae, Lycoperdaceae, and Mycenastraceae have since been moved to the Agaricaceae based on molecular phylogenetics studies. According to a standard reference text, the Agaricaceae contains 85 genera and 1340 species. Description Agaricaceae species use a wide variety of fruit body morphology. Although the pileate form (i.e., with a cap and stipe) is predominant, gasteroid and secotioid forms are known. In pileate species, the gills are typically thin, and free from attachment to the stipe. Caps are scurfy to smooth, and range from roughly flat to umbonate. They typically have a centrally attached stipe and a membrane-like partial veil. The species formerly classified in the family Lycoperdaceae are also known as the \\"true puffballs\\". Their fruiting bodies are round and are composed of a tough skin surrounding a mass of spores. When they mature, the skin splits open and they release their spores. The spore print color of Agaricaceae species is highly variable, ranging from white to greenish to ochraceous to pink or sepia; rusty-brown or cinnamon brown colours are absent. Microscopically, the spore surface ranges from smooth to ornamented, and the presence of a germ pore is variable. Amyloidity (i.e. sensitivity to staining in Melzer's reagent) is also variable. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are usually small, four- spored, and may have interspersed cystidia. Genera The extinct genus Coprinites is one of four known Agaricaceae genera in the fossil record. Others include Aureofungus, Protomycena, and Archaeomarasmius. Archaeomarasmius leggeti, from Atlantic Coastal Plain amber, is 90‚Äì94 Ma); the other fossil genera are from Dominican amber and date to 15‚Äì20 Ma. The family currently includes the following genera: *Agaricus *Attamyces *Barcheria *Bovista *Calbovista previously in family Lycoperdaceae. *Calvatia *Chamaemyces *Chlorophyllum *Clarkeinda *Coniolepiota *‚Ä†Coprinites *Coprinus *Cystoagaricus *Disciseda *Endoptychum *Eriocybe *Gyrophragmium *Handkea *Heinemannomyces *Hymenagaricus *Lepiota *Leucoagaricus *Leucocoprinus *Lycoperdon *Macrolepiota *Melanophyllum *Micropsalliota *Montagnea *Podaxis *Ripartitella *Rugosospora *Sericeomyces *Smithiomyces *Tulostoma *Verrucospora Ecology The Agaricaceae are widely distributed. Most species are saprobic and prefer grassland and woodland habitats. Genera Leucoagaricus and Leucocoprinus are known to be cultivated by fungus-growing ants in ant- fungus mutualism. Economic significance The genus Agaricus includes some species that are cultivated commercially throughout the world. The common \\"button mushroom\\", Agaricus bisporus, is the most widely cultivated edible mushroom. Agaricus blazei is a well-known medicinal mushroom used for a number of therapeutic and medicinal purposes. Several species are poisonous, such as some Lepiota, Agaricus sect. Xanthodermatei and Chlorophyllum species .

Singh rebelled against the party leader Charu Majumdar in 1971, provoking a split. In April 1973, Singh's party was reorganised. History Santosh Rana had broken with Charu Majumdar in 1971, and later joined Singh's group. In 1974 the Chandrapulla Reddy-led Andhra Pradesh Committee of Communist Revolutionaries merged with Singh's CPI(ML).Mohanty, Manoranjan. Revolutionary Violence.

New Delhi: Sterling Publishers, 1977. pp. xx, 120 When the Bihar movement was launched by Jayaprakash Narayan in 1974, Singh's CPI(ML) decided to lend support to it.

Under the Emergency Singh's CPI(ML) formulated a three-tier united front line, calling for the formation of a 'revolutionary united front' (consisting of communist revolutionaries, working towards a unified revolutionary communist party), a 'proletarian united front' based on working class struggles (and which could include the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Socialist Unity Centre of India (Communist)) and a 'democratic front' which would unite forces working for restoration of democratic rights. Within the framework of the 'democratic front' work, party cadres began participating in joint protests with non-left opposition groups at the time.Mohanty, Manoranjan. Revolutionary Violence. A Study of the Maoist Movement in India. New Delhi: Sterling Publishers, 1977. p. xxiii-xxiv After the defeat of Indira Gandhi in the 1977 Lok Sabha elections, the situation for the party was relaxed somewhat. Singh asserted that although the class character of the new Janata Party government was the same as the Gandhi government, he appreciated differences like improvement of civil liberties and weakening of Soviet influence. On 9 April 1977 S.N. Singh signed an appeal along with Khokan Majumder (Unity Committee, CPI(ML)), Suniti Kumar Ghosh (COC, CPI(ML)) and Apurba Roy (UCCRI(ML)), calling for the unconditional release of 12 000 revolutionary prisoners. During the anti-Emergency struggle, the Janata Party had promised to release political prisoners. Once in power however, they had back-tracked on that promise. Singh was involved in negotiations to secure the release of prisoners.Mohanty, Manoranjan. Revolutionary Violence. A Study of the Maoist Movement in India. New Delhi: Sterling Publishers, 1977. p. xxv- xxvi Singh's CPI(ML) was the first major ML-factions that opened up for participating in elections, which became a controversial issue. On 10 April 1977 Singh declared the willingness to contest elections at a press conference.Singh, Prakash. The Naxalite Movement in India. New Delhi: Rupa & Co., 1999. p. 100. The Calcutta District committee denounced the move. Other ML-factions saw as the new line as treachery.On 14 May 1977 Aburpa Roy, Khokan Majumder and Suniti Kumar Ghosh issued a statement claiming that Singh was turning his party into a social democratic party and for being a 'surrenderist'. Santosh Rana was denounced by his own wife on the issue of electoral participation. Pro-Charu Majumdar factions were even more stern in their condemnations. Mohanty, Manoranjan. Revolutionary Violence. A Study of the Maoist Movement in India. New Delhi: Sterling Publishers, 1977. p. xxvi- xxvii In 1971 Santosh Rana was elected to the West Bengal state assembly from the Gopiballavpur constituency (one of the areas were CPI(ML) had started armed struggle following the model of the Naxalbari uprising). Rana got 13401 votes (25,67%), which was enough to defeat the CPI(M), Indian National Congress and Janata Party candidates. Singh's CPI(ML) were also able to register the party name Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) with the Election Commission of India, but the registration was later lost. Post-1984 period Around 1980 Singh's group appeared as the strongest ML-faction, but with the exit of Chandrapulla Reddy and other splits the party shrunk. In 1984 a severe split occurred, with the loyalists of Singh opposed to the group of Santosh Rana and Vaskar Nandy. The Singh faction levelled the following accusation: \\"In our organisation also, Nandy‚Äôs close associates established contacts with a foreign voluntary agency and a native voluntary agency financed by Western monopoly capital, keeping it secret from the POC and the general secretary of the party, S N Singh. They established contact with Rural Aid Consortium of Tagore Society which is financed by West European countries and the USA and with one Danish Organisation on the Plea of providing relief to the people of Gobiballabpur in West Bengal and some areas in Bihar. Lakhs of rupees were received for digging tanks, constructing school building opening a sewing training center and distributing chickens and cattle to the needy. It also came to our notice that money was being received by some of our leaders from the Lutheran Church. When it came to light to the PCC members, an intense ideological struggle burst forth in the party on this issue.\\" (Our differences with Nandy-Rana group, PCC-CPI(ML), p. 29) The group of Rana came to win a majority in the leadership (the provisional central committee) and Singh's followers formed a new committee (and de facto a new party). Singh died shortly afterwards. Rana's group differentiates themselves from other ML- factions through their emphasis on antifascism. Rana considers the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as a fascist danger for India. PCC, CPI(ML) gives the advice to their followers to vote for parties like CPI(M) or even the Indian National Congress in constituencies were no revolutionary communist candidate is available. Ahead of the 2004 Lok Sabha elections the party participated in the united front of revolutionary communists initiated by Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Red Flag and Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist). In the Bodo-dominated areas in Assam, the party works through a mass organization called United Reservation Movement Council of Assam. PCC, CPI(ML) and URMCA are opponents of the Bodo nationalist movements. In the Lok Sabha elections in 2004 the URMCA candidate in Kokrajhar got 205 491 votes (21,25%). In the 1999 election the URMCA candidate had gotten 246 942 votes (27,75%) in the same constituency. PCC, CPI(ML) publishes For a New Democracy as its central organ.

It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell. A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotating about its axis. The axis of the shell may be either horizontal or at a small angle to the horizontal. It is partially filled with balls. The grinding media are the balls, which may be made of steel (chrome steel), stainless steel, ceramic, or rubber. The inner surface of the cylindrical shell is usually lined with an abrasion-resistant material such as manganese steel or rubber lining. Less wear takes place in rubber lined mills. The length of the mill is approximately equal to its diameter. The general idea behind the ball mill is an ancient one, but it was not until the industrial revolution and the invention of steam power that an effective ball milling machine could be built. It is reported to have been used for grinding flint for pottery in 1870. Working In case of continuously operated ball mill, the material to be ground is fed from the left through a 60¬∞ cone and the product is discharged through a 30¬∞ cone to the right. As the shell rotates, the balls are lifted up on the rising side of the shell and then they cascade down (or drop down on to the feed), from near the top of the shell. In doing so, the solid particles in between the balls and ground are reduced in size by impact. Applications Ball mills are used for grinding materials such as coal, pigments, and feldspar for pottery. Grinding can be carried out wet or dry, but the former is performed at low speed. Blending of explosives is an example of an application for rubber balls. For systems with multiple components, ball milling has been shown to be effective in increasing solid-state chemical reactivity. Additionally, ball milling has been shown effective for production of amorphous materials. Description Benchtop ball mill Laboratory scale ball mill High-energy ball milling A ball mill, a type of grinder, is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores, chemicals, ceramic raw materials and paints. Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis, partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium. Different materials are used as media, including ceramic balls, flint pebbles, and stainless steel balls. An internal cascading effect reduces the material to a fine powder. Industrial ball mills can operate continuously, fed at one end and discharged at the other end. Large to medium- sized ball mills are mechanically rotated on their axis, but small ones normally consist of a cylindrical capped container that sits on two drive shafts (pulleys and belts are used to transmit rotary motion). A rock tumbler functions on the same principle. Ball mills are also used in pyrotechnics and the manufacture of black powder, but cannot be used in the preparation of some pyrotechnic mixtures such as flash powder because of their sensitivity to impact. High-quality ball mills are potentially expensive and can grind mixture particles to as small as 5 nm, enormously increasing surface area and reaction rates. The grinding works on the principle of critical speed. Critical speed can be understood as that speed after which the steel balls that are responsible for the grinding of particles start rotating along the direction of the cylindrical device, thus causing no further grinding. Ball mills are used extensively in the mechanical alloying process in which they are used for grinding and for cold welding, producing alloys from powders.Mechanical Alloying Technology, Institute of Materials Processing A section cut thru of ball mills The ball mill is a key piece of equipment for grinding crushed materials, and it is widely used in production lines for powders such as cement, silicates, refractory material, fertilizer, glass ceramics, etc., as well as for ore dressing of ferrous and non-ferrous metals. The ball mill can grind ores and other materials, wet or dry. There are two kinds of ball mills according to their ways of discharging material: grate type, and overfall type. Many types of grinding media are suitable for use in a ball mill, each material having its own specific properties and advantages. Key properties of grinding media are size, density, hardness, and composition. * Size: The smaller the media particles, the smaller the particle size of the final product. The grinding media particles should be substantially larger than the largest pieces of material to be ground. * Density: The media should be denser than the material being ground. It becomes a problem if the grinding media floats on top of the material to be ground. * Hardness: The grinding media needs to be durable enough to grind the material, but, where possible, not so tough that it also wears down the tumbler. * Composition: Various grinding applications have special requirements. Some of these requirements are based on some of the grinding media being in the finished product, while others are based on how the media will react with the material being ground. * Where the color of the finished product is important, the color and material of the grinding media must be considered. * Where low contamination is important, the grinding media may be selected for ease of separation from the finished product (e.g., steel dust produced from stainless steel media can be magnetically separated from non-ferrous products). An alternative to separation is to use media of the same material as the product being ground. * Flammable products have a tendency to become explosive in powder form. Steel media may spark, becoming an ignition source for these products. Either wet- grinding, or non-sparking media such as ceramic or lead must be selected. * Some media, such as iron, may react with corrosive materials. For this reason, stainless steel, ceramic, and flint grinding media may each be used when corrosive substances are present during grinding. The grinding chamber can also be filled with an inert shield gas that does not react with the material being ground, to prevent oxidation or explosive reactions that could occur with ambient air inside the mill. Advantages of the ball mill Ceramic ball mill before 1945 Thiem&Towe; Halle. Property of Faculty of Chemistry, Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology Ball milling boasts several advantages over other systems: the cost of installation and grinding medium is low; the capacity and fineness can be adjusted by adjusting the diameter of the ball; it is suitable for both batch and continuous operation; it is suitable for open and closed- circuit grinding; it is applicable for materials of all degrees of hardness.  Varieties  Aside from common ball mills there is a second type of ball mill called a planetary ball mill. Planetary ball mills are smaller than common ball mills and mainly used in laboratories for grinding sample material down to very small sizes. A planetary ball mill consists of at least one grinding jar which is arranged eccentrically on a so-called sun wheel. The direction of movement of the sun wheel is opposite to that of the grinding jars (ratio: 1:‚àí2 or 1:‚àí1). The grinding balls in the grinding jars are subjected to superimposed rotational movements, the so-called Coriolis forces. The difference in speeds between the balls and grinding jars produces an interaction between frictional and impact forces, which releases high dynamic energies. The interplay between these forces produces the high and very effective degree of size reduction of the planetary ball mill.

The language used is a stylised combination of both literary and colloquial registers of Taiwanese Hokkien. Its earliest form adopted elements of folk songs from Zhangzhou, Fujian, China. The story elements are traditionally based on folk tales of the southern Fujian region, though in recent years stories are increasingly set in Taiwan locales. Taiwanese opera was later exported to other Hokkien-speaking areas. Taiwanese opera is considered as the embodiment of Taiwanese history and tradition because the political identity crisis of Taiwan shaped its development. History =Origin= Taiwanese opera is the only form of Han traditional drama known to have originated in Taiwan, specifically the Yilan. In the early stages, most Han immigrants in Yilan were from Zhangzhou, Fujian, bringing with them the Hokkien Zhangzhou dialect.Note: source of the western terms Amoy ([eÀ®À©muiÀßÀ•]) and Quemoy ([kimÀßÀßmuiÀßÀ•]). Koa-√° were story-telling ballads spoken in Hokkien. Each line could have five or seven characters, and every four lines constituted a paragraph.Taiwanese Opera WebDex =Formation= Jinge (Èå¶Ê≠å) is the forerunner of Taiwanese opera. As early as seventeenth century, immigrants from southern Fujian, China brought Jinge, the popular folk songs that set the poetry in local dialect to Taiwan. Around nineteenth century, amateur singers in Gilan modified Jinge and gradually developed a new style called Kua-a (). Other than Jinge, Taiwanese opera absorbed the styles of formal operas including Peking opera, Luantan opera (‰∫ÇÂΩàÊà≤), Siping opera (ÂõõÂπ≥Êà≤), Liyuan opera (Ê¢®ÂúíÊà≤), and Gaojia opera (È´òÁî≤Êà≤). Between 1923 and 1949, Peking opera troupes from Shanghai and Fujian toured Taiwan. Some actors stayed in Taiwan and became performing directors of Taiwanese operas. The influences of Peking operas can be seen in repertory, gesture, movement, percussion music and costume. Fighting themes and acrobatic movements became standards in the operas. =Early development= Taiwan was under Japanese rule from 1895 to 1945. In the early stage, Japan government allowed the local customs to develop without much interference and Taiwanese opera continued to thrive. In Ho-yi Lin‚Äôs book ‚ÄúTaiwanese Opera‚Äù, she describes how Taiwanese opera took root in China. She stated, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs worth noting that in 1928, the San Le Hsuan troupe (‰∏âÊ®ÇËªíÁè≠), on a pilgrimage to Wu Wang Temple in southern Fujian, performed with great success in Bai-chiao (ÁôΩÁ§Å) and Xiamen‚Ä¶ In succession, Taiwanese troupes such as Ni Sheng, Ni Kuan, Dan Feng, Mu Dan and Tun Yi also performed in Fujian province.‚Äù First decline: 1936‚Äì1945 After the Pacific War broke out, the Japanese government changed the previous policy and implemented a K≈çminka policy that encouraged Japanisation. During this period, the Japanese government prohibited the public performance of Taiwanese opera. Even though many troupes were disbanded and Taiwanese opera witnessed its first decline, local people still tried to perform Taiwanese operas in secrecy. Taiwanese opera, also known as wangguodiao (‰∫°ÂúãË™ø; literally, \\"music from a dying nation\\") provided an outlet for Taiwanese people to search for their identify and fight for the \\"in-betweenness\\" of cultural influences of Taiwan, Japan and China. Some dissidents like the \\"Ruiguang Theater Troupe from Ruifang in northern Taipei Prefecture premiered its own \\"new drama\\".\\" (Lee Daw-Ming, 158) Japanisation forbade traditional Taiwanese opera, this troupe would simply perform \\"new drama\\" which was a modern variation of Taiwanese opera, with modern costumes. The \\"New Drama movement\\" fever finally subsided in 1940.\\" (Lee-Daw-Ming, 158)Lee Daw-Ming, Historical Dictionary of Taiwan Cinema =Golden period: 1945‚Äì1962= After Taiwan was handed to the Republic of China, Taiwanese opera was revived and more than one hundred troupes were formed within a year. In 1949, there were over five hundred registered troupes. Taiwanese operas entered into its golden age. During this time, Chen Cheng-san (Èô≥ÊæÑ‰∏â) founded ‚ÄúKung Le She‚Äù (Êã±Ê®ÇÁ§æ) troupe and became the first person to use written scripts for performance. He commissioned Chen Shou-jing to write scripts of \\"Broken Dreams of the Red Chamber\\" (Á¥ÖÊ®ìÊÆòÂ§¢). Even during its golden period, Taiwanese opera continued to face challenges and adapt to the changes in political and cultural environment. The rise of the new broadcasting medias including radio, film and television show, the influence and popularity of western pop songs and movies drew the general public‚Äôs attention and presented serious competition. During the martial law from 1949 to 1987, the KMT government revived the Mandarin Promotion Council and discouraged or, in some cases, forbade the use of Hokkien and other dialects. This and the shift of political environment provided little support for the Taiwanese-language based art form. The indoor performances decreased and opera troupes experimented performing on radio, film and television and large outdoor settings. =Transformation= Starting in 1954, Taiwanese operas performed on radios. In 1955, Chen Cheng-san filmed the first white and black movie of Taiwanese Opera ‚ÄúXue Pin-Gui and Wang Bao-chuan‚Äù (ËñõÂπ≥Ë≤¥ËàáÁéãÂØ∂Èáß) and the premier was a huge success. In 1962, Taiwan Television was established and started broadcasting Taiwanese operas. In 1982, Chinese Television System (CTS) Taiwanese Opera Troupe performed in Mandarin (instead of Hokkien). Televised operas are similar to soap operas and greatly increased the popularity of Taiwanese operas. However, certain traditional elements are lost because television shows feature less singing and body movements. In the early 1980s Taiwanese opera was brought to the television audience, with I√ª‚Åø Lƒì-hoa as its popular face.Yanqiu Chen, Ying zhi hong : Prima Donna of Taiwanese opera. (Taipei: Xhi Shi, 2005), 10. The artistic elements remained largely traditional, however. Taiwanese opera, like other forms of Chinese opera and theatre around the world, often traditionally uses cross-dressed performers (Âèç‰∏≤; f«énch√πan; h√≥an-chh√≤an), specifically women portraying men's roles in the case of Taiwanese opera. Modern and experimental forms show some propensity for syncretism. Western instruments such as the saxophone and guitar have been used in some performances. Loose Western adaptations have included Nikolai Gogol's The Government Inspector. Perhaps due to the influence of the Taiwanese localisation movement, stories set in Taiwan, as well as aboriginal characters and stories, have been developed in recent years. Taiwanese forms of the Hakka tea-picking opera show some influence. Fans of the opera attribute its continuing relevance to a willingness of performers to adapt to modern times in terms of style and artistic diversity. Second decline Ming Hwa Yuan Arts and Culture Group Taiwanese opera's success in movie and television industry ironically becomes one of cause that eventually leads to the decline of indoor staged performances. Chen Shen-Fu, a general producer of the Ming Hwa Yuan Arts and Culture Group, said: \\"Although we know everything they do is for survival, that is not right. They are doing something that will kill the life of the opera.\\" Other factors include political policy and social structure changes and western influences. Tsai summarised the period of decline: > The main social changes were the rise of many forms of entertainment in the > 1960s and the transformation of society from agricultural to industrial and > commercial in the 1970s. Government policies that were detrimental to > Taiwanese opera were 1) the promotion of only national theatre ‚Äì Peking > Opera, 2) standardisation of plays, and 3) Limitations on religious > performances and on the use of dialects. =Future= Taiwanese opera is considered as the embodiment of Taiwanese history and tradition and the political identity crisis of Taiwan shaped its development. Taiwanese opera's history reflects the growth and changes in Taiwan society starting from the earlier immigration influences, oppression under the K≈çminka movement, to little state support during the martial law era and the transformations of modern medias. Taiwanese opera struggles to remain its vitality. The refined operas in modern concert halls establish a new direction of Taiwanese opera development. One of the notable troupes is Ming Hwa Yuan Arts and Culture Group (MHY): > In 1983, MHY was the first among other folk theatres to appear on the stage > of a national theatre, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall. A more telling example is > in 1989 when MHY got permission to perform in the Zhihang airforce base. In > the past, only Beijing opera had been considered proper enough to tour > military bases. Three years later, MHY toured military schools. The > audience's response was far more enthusiastic than it was for Beijing opera. This transformation also reflects on the opera storylines. The traditional plots are historical and heroic events, legends and myths. Taiwanese operas gradually added more romantic elements. The intense drama and the love-hate relationships are the focuses of the televised operas. Legend of the White Snake is a typical story that combines the myth, religion, and romance. Performance elements Originally there are three roles in Taiwanese opera, Sheng, Dan, and Chou. Later, as Taiwanese opera began to incorporate more styles from other major operas, it gradually expanded to include eight major characters. =Male leads = Sheng (Áîü). These characters are gentle and brave. * (ËÄÅÁîü) * (Â∞èÁîü) * (ÂâØÁîü): Supporting actor * (ÂèçÁîü) * (Ê≠¶Áîü): martial artist is an older male lead. Old shengs have a chaste and decent disposition.

During high school, Saunderson and Belleville High School classmate Juan Atkins were fans of DJ Charles \\"The Electrifying Mojo\\" Johnson. Atkins and May soon became serious about mixing others' music and creating their own, but Saunderson pursued other goals first, studying telecommunications and playing American football at Eastern Michigan University. Atkins had begun recording with Cybotron in 1981, but it was not until 1987 that May followed suit and made a record. Initially concentrating on becoming a DJ, Saunderson was inspired to create his own music after watching the six-month-long process as Atkins and May completed \\"Let's Go.\\" =Kreem= Atkins shared his technical expertise with Saunderson, and those early sessions led to a track called \\"Triangle Of Love.\\" \\"I used to wake up in the middle of the night, go into my studio ‚Äì which was in the next room ‚Äì and lay down the ideas as they came to me.

In 1987 he recorded a backing track in his home studio, but needed lyrics and a female vocalist. His friend, Chicago house producer Terry ‚ÄòHousemaster‚Äô Baldwin suggested Paris Grey. \\"Paris agreed, flew into Detroit, came up with lyrics and ‚ÄòBig Fun‚Äô was born.\\" Saunderson filed away the tape until, months later, UK dance entrepreneur Neil Rushton came to Detroit in search of music for a compilation album, Techno - The New Dance Sound Of Detroit for Virgin Records. Rushton included \\"Big Fun\\" on the album. It was soon released as a single and became a worldwide smash, only to be outsold by Inner City's follow-up single, \\"Good Life.\\" A debut album, Paradise, soon followed. Over the years, and after three albums, Inner City had nine Top 40 hits in the UK and two Top 20 albums, with combined sales of more than six million. =E-Dancer= The E-Dancer project Saunderson creates music that is \\"more underground.\\" The first E-Dancer album, 'Heavenly,' was released in 1998 to critical acclaim; Spin named it ‚Äúone of the ten best albums you‚Äôve never heard.‚Äù The Reese Bassline The bassline of Saunderson's 1988 track \\"Just Want Another Chance\\" (released under his \\"Reese\\" pseudonym on Incognito Records) became very influential in the jungle and drum and bass music genres.Reynolds, Simon.

Born in Dervock, County Antrim, Ireland, McArthur was recognised as a promising athlete as a teenager, but he didn't pursue an athletics career until after emigrating to South Africa in 1901 at the age of 20. After joining the Johannesburg Police Force in 1906, McArthur begun to take athletics seriously. Soon he had won the Transvaal half and one mile championships, the five mile track championship and also two national cross country championships. McArthur ran his first marathon late in the 1908 season, and surprisingly beat the Olympic silver medalist Charles Hefferon. He also won the national one and ten mile championships. The Stockholm Olympic marathon took place in sweltering heat. Representing South Africa in the event, McArthur and his teammate Christian Gitsham ran together and soon took the lead. Confident of victory, Gitsham stopped for water, expecting his colleague to join him, as agreed. Instead McArthur ran on, stretching his lead and taking him to certain victory over Gitsham by 58 seconds. In the next season, McArthur injured his foot in an accident and was forced to retire from athletics. He ran six marathon races (including the Olympic marathon) throughout his career and never lost one.

Corrections' role and functions were defined and clarified with the passing of the Corrections Act 2004. In early 2006, Corrections officially adopted the MƒÅori name Ara Poutama Aotearoa. History The Department of Corrections was formed in 1995, by the Department of Justice (Restructuring) Act 1995. Prior to this prisons, the probation system and the courts were all managed by the Department of Justice. The new Act gave management of prisoners, parolees and offenders on probation to a new Department of Corrections while leaving administration of the court system and fines collection with the Ministry of Justice. The intention was to enable the new Department to improve public safety and assist in the rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders. In 2000, an approach based on enhanced computerised access to information about offenders was tried. The new chief executive of the department, Mark Byers, introduced a $40 million scheme designed to reduce reoffending called Integrated Offender Management (IOM). At the time it was described as \\"the biggest single initiative the department has undertaken to reduce reoffending\\". Seven years later, Greg Newbold said the scheme was an expensive failure and described it as \\"another wreck on the scrapheap of abandoned fads of criminal rehabilitation.\\" In 2012, the government revealed it would spend $65 million over the next four years on reducing criminal reoffending. It will go towards additional alcohol and drug treatment, increased education, skills training and employment programmes for prisoners. Corrections Minister Anne Tolley and Associate Corrections Minister Dr Pita Sharples said the 'reprioritised' operational funding was aimed at reducing reoffending by 25 per cent by 2017.Budget 2012: $65m on reducing reoffending, NZ Herald, 21 May 2012 =Prison Privatisation= The use of private prisons has also been tried, stopped and reintroduced. New Zealand's first privately run prison, the Auckland Central Remand Prison, also known as Mt. Eden Prison, opened under contract to Australasian Correctional Management (ACM) in 2000. In 2004, the Labour Government, opposed to privatisation, amended the law to prohibit the extension of private prison contracts. A year later, the 5-year contract with ACM was not renewed.Fact Sheet 54 ‚Äì Private Prisons ‚Äì Ideology or evidence led? Howard league for Penal Reform.

Numerous scandals surrounding the Mt Eden Prison led to Serco's contract not being renewed there. On 16 July 2015, footage of \\"fight clubs\\" within the prison emerged online and was reported by TVNZ. Serco was heavily criticized for not investigating until after the footage was screened. On 24 July 2015, Serco's contract to run the Mount Eden prison was revoked and operation was given back to the New Zealand Department of Corrections.Serco admits 'fight club' reports came months ago, The New Zealand Herald, 20 July 2015 Serco was ordered to pay $8 million to the New Zealand government as a result of problems at Mount Eden Prison while it was under Serco's management.

Rethinking Crime and Punishment spokesman Kim Workman supported the proposals but said it would be difficult to achieve the change given the \\"very high imprisonment rate\\" in New Zealand. On 22 November 2019, it was reported that the Department of Corrections had adopted a policy of referring to prisoners as \\"men in our care\\" and \\"clients.\\" Staff were also instructed to address prisoners by their first names instead of surnames. The Minister of Corrections Kelvin Davis confirmed that this was part of the Sixth Labour Government's H≈çkai Rangi strategy to address the high rate of MƒÅori reoffending and imprisonment by \\"humanising\\" prisoners. The Government's decision was criticised by Corrections staff and the Leader of the Opposition Simon Bridges as \\"political correctness\\" and \\"being soft on crime.\\" Structure The Department comprises three service arms and four other groups. The service arms are prisons, community probation, and rehabilitation and reintegration and each arm used to have separate internal processes, infrastructure and support staff. As of May 2012 the newly appointed chief executive, Ray Smith proposed merging the three service arms into one team. Smith said the segregated infrastructure \\"creates replication of work, is inefficient and has resulted in an overly layered structure.\\" * Prison Services operates the Department's 19 prisons. *Juvenile youth justice residences: These are residences that are set across New Zealand for youth who have been sentenced by the youth court and for youth who are awaiting trial.

All prisoners who are over eighteen are screened for mental illness and if they are mild to moderate then they will be referred to resources to help them. Prisoners are also more likely to commit suicide or self-harm in prison than the general population. Inmates are interviewed when they arrive to prison to see if they are at risk of committing suicide or self-harming themselves. For inmates who are prone to suicide and self-harm they have fourteen programs to help them and have specific cells which are under twenty-four hours of observation.

In 2014, prison numbers went up (to 8,700) rather than down, due to more offenders being held on remand.

He was son of Khujista Akhtar, the fourth son of Bahadur Shah I. With the help of the Sayyid brothers, he ascended the throne at the young age of 17. He later got rid of them with the help of Asaf Jah I ‚Äì Syed Hussain Ali Khan was murdered at Fatehpur Sikri in 1720 and Syed Hassan Ali Khan Barha was fatally poisoned in 1722. Muhammad Shah was a great patron of the arts, including musical, cultural and administrative developments. His pen-name was SadƒÅ Rangƒ´la (Ever Joyous) and he is often referred to as \\"Muhammad Shah Rangila\\", also sometimes as \\"Bahadur Shah Rangila\\" after his grand father Bahadur Shah I. Although he was a patron of the arts, Muhammad Shah's reign was marked by rapid and irreversible decline of the Mughal Empire. The Mughal Empire was already decaying, but the invasion by Nader Shah of Persia and the subsequent sacking of Delhi, the Mughal capital, greatly accelerated the pace. The course of events not only shocked and mortified the Mughals themselves, but also other foreigners, including the British. Early life Muhammad Shah was born in 1702 in Ghazna (in modern-day Afghanistan) to Prince Khujista Akhtar, during the reign of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. His grandfather Bahadur Shah I defeated and eliminated his own brother Muhammad Azam Shah on 19 June 1707 at the Battle of Jajau. During another war of succession, following the death of Bahadur Shah, his father was killed, and the 12-year-old prince and his mother were imprisoned by his uncle Jahandar Shah but spared from death. The prince was handsome and quick to learn, and his mother took good care of his education. After the overthrow of Farrukhsiyar in 1719, several Mughal Emperors briefly ascended the throne, but the Sayyid Brothers eventually chose the 17-year-old Muhammad Shah as emperor. Reign On 29 September 1719, Muhammad Shah was given the title Abu Al-Fatah Nasir-ud-Din Roshan Akhtar Muhammad Shah and enthroned in the Red Fort. His mother was given an allowance of 15 thousand rupees monthly for her needs, but the Sayyid Brothers kept the new emperor under strict supervision. The Mughal Grand Vizier Syed Hassan Ali Khan Barha and his brother the Mughal commander and chief Syed Hussain Ali Khan Barha were well aware that Asaf Jah I and his companions Qamaruddin Khan, Zain ud-din Ahmad Khan intended to dissolve their administration. The Sayyid Brothers quickly nominated an amateur, Prince Muhammad Ibrahim, who proclaimed himself Mughal Emperor, but he was quickly defeated by the new loyalists of the young Muhammad Shah on 13 November 1720. The Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah with his Falcon visits the imperial garden at sunset on a palanquin. On 9th of October 1720, Syed Hussain Ali Khan Barha, the commander and chief of the most elite Mughal Army, was assassinated in his encampment in Toba Bhim. The Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah took direct command of his forces. Asaf Jah I was then dispatched to gain complete control of six Mughal provinces in the Deccan, and Muhammad Amin Khan Turani was assigned as the Mansabdar of 8,000. He was sent to pursue the Mughal Grand Vizier Syed Hassan Ali Khan Barha, who was defeated at the Battle of Hasanpur by Turani, Mir Muhammad Amin Irani and Muhammad Haider Beg. He was captured by Muhammad Shah on 15 November 1720 and executed two years later. Previously the emperor had to fight Muhammad Ibrahim, but young Muhammad Shah defeated him on 13 November 1720. The fall of the Sayyid Brothers marked the beginning of the end of the Mughal Empire's direct control over its dominions in the Deccan. In the year 1721, young Muhammad Shah married the daughter of the previously deposed Mughal Emperor Farrukhsiyar. On 21 February 1722, Muhammad Shah appointed the Asaf Jah I as Grand Vizier. He advised Muhammad Shah to be \\"as cautious as Akbar and as brave as Aurangzeb\\". Asaf Jah I resigned his post as the Grand Vizier when Muhammad Shah expressed negligence towards his administration. Asaf Jah I appointed commander Ewaz Khan as the master of the garrison at Aurangabad, and much of his logistical duties were carried out by Inayatullah Kashmiri. Asaf Jah I left the imperial court in disgust. In 1723 he set out on an expedition to the Deccan, where he fought Mubariz Khan, the Mughal Subedar of the Deccan, who kept the ravaging Marathas at bay. Taking advantage of Mubariz Khan's conventional weaknesses, Asaf Jah I defeated and eliminated his opponent during the Battle of Shakar kheda. Asaf Jah I then established the Nizam of Hyderabad in 1725. Diwan of the Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah During this time, the Mughal-Maratha Wars (1728‚Äì1763) would cause irreparable devastation to the inhabitants of the ill- administered Mughal Empire. Despite efforts to counter the rise of rebellions in 1724, by the Nawab of Awadh Saadat Ali Khan and the Mughal Subedar in Bangalore, Dilawar Khan (r.1726‚Äì1756), who established a well-protected bastion in the Malabar Coast. Muhammad Ali Khan the Mughal Faujdar of Rangpur and his stern ally Deena Narayan were ambushed out of Koch Bihar by Upendra Narayan a Hindu Bihari and Mipham Wangpo (r.1729‚Äì1736) the ruler of Bhutan. Ali Muhammad Khan Rohilla had established the barons of Rohilakhand. The Nawab of Bhopal, Yar Muhammad Khan Bahadur, also ratified by the Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah in 1728, countered ceaseless raids by the Marathas in Malwa and nearly began to lose half of his territories in the year 1742. Muhammad Shah eventually learned the skills of statesmanship after removing his three incompetent advisors, namely Koki Jee (his foster sister), Roshan-ud-Daula (his mercantile friend) and Sufi Abdul Ghafur of Thatta (his spiritual teacher). In the Punjab region, the Sikhs were at war with Mughal Subedars, and the hit-and-run tactics of the Sikh warriors caused devastation. In Ajmer, Ajit Singh carved out a vast territory and allied himself with the renegade Marathas. While in the Deccan the Marathas had ruined Mughal fortifications and were already on the warpath. All this greatly contributed to the decline of the Mughal Empire. In 1737, the Marathas under Baji Rao I annexed Gujarat, Malwa and Bundelkhand, and raided the Mughal capital Delhi. In 1739, Nader Shah of Persia, lured by the wealth and weakness of the Mughals, took advantage of a rebellion on his eastern borders near Kandahar and initiated a campaign against the Mughal Empire capturing Ghazni, Kabul, Lahore, and Sindh. He then advanced against Muhammad Shah and defeated him at the Battle of Karnal. The Persians, having crushed the Mughal armies in less than three hours, marched upon and sacked Delhi, hoarding priceless treasures that were taken back to Persia. This event weakened the Mughals significantly, paving the path for more invaders and eventually the East India Company. In 1748, Ahmad Shah Durrani of Afghanistan invaded the Mughal Empire. Heir apparent Ahmad Shah Bahadur, Grand Vizier Qamaruddin Khan and his son Muin ul-Mulk, Intizam-ud-Daula and Safdarjung were sent with 75,000 men after the defeat of Shahnawaz Khan in Lahore. At the Battle of Manupur (1748), Durrani's 12,000 men were defeated, and he was forced to retreat. There was a great rejoicing for this event throughout the Mughal Empire. =Cultural developments= Horde\\", contextually the exalted Urdu Language) written in Nasta ølƒ´q script Battalionese language\\") title in Nasta ølƒ´q script Baagh e Naazir was built by Muhammad Shah the year 1748. While Urdu (derived from Zuban-i Urd≈´-yi Mu øall√° or in local translation Lashkari Zaban, shortened to Lashkari) was already in use before Muhammad Shah's reign, it was during his reign that it became more popular among the people and he declared it as the court language, replacing Persian. During Muhammad Shah's reign, Qawwali was reintroduced into the Mughal imperial court and it quickly spread throughout South Asia. Muhammad Shah is also known to have introduced religious institutions for education such as Maktabs. During his reign, the Quran was translated for the first time in simple Persian and Urdu. Also, during his reign, the formal Turkic dress, normally worn by the high Mughal nobility since Mughals originally hailed from Samarqand, was replaced by the Sherwani. Mohammad Shah was a patron of the performing arts, almost at the cost of administrative priorities, paving the way for the disintegration of governance. While Mughal political power did decline in his reign, the Emperor encouraged the arts, employing master artists such as Nidha Mal (active 1735‚Äì75) and Chitarman, whose vivacious paintings depict scenes of court life, such as Holi celebrations, hunting and hawking.Princes and Painters in Mughal Delhi, 1707‚Äì1857, Asia Society exhibition The Mughal court of the time had musicians such as Niyamat Khan, also known as Sadarang, and his nephew Firoz Khan (Adarang), whose compositions popularised the musical form of Khyal.Niyamat Khan composed Khyal for his disciples and he never performed Khyal.

Later Mughal- Maratha wars Elephants pushing Mughal artillery cannons drawn also by bullocks. After Asaf Jah I left Delhi, the Marathas, who had already expanded up to the river Narmada, invaded the rich province of Malwa in the beginning of 1723. The Mughal Emperor entrusted its defence to its governor, who failed him. By winter of the same year, they reached Ujjain, the capital of Malwa. In 1725, the governorship of Gujarat was transferred to Sarbuland Khan. Enraged by the authority of the Mughal Emperor, the Marathas invaded Gujarat but were routed by Sarbuland Khan and his forces. This was mainly because most of the Maratha forces, including their leader Baji Rao I, were at the time fighting the Asaf Jah I in Hyderabad. The war with Hyderabad, however, proceeded favourably for the Marathas. In 1728, during February, the Asaf Jah I was decisively defeated at the Battle of Palkhed. In the year 1728, the Marathas led by Baji Rao I and his brother Chimnaji Appa invaded the Mughal province of Malwa and challenged the Mughal Subedar Girdihar Bahadur, who led a fairly large Mughal Army during the Battle of Amjhera. Both Girdihar Bahadur and his trusted cousin Daya Bahadur were defeated and killed. On 29 November, Chimnaji Appa went on to besiege the remnants of the Mughal Army of Malwa during a failed Siege of Ujjain. In the year 1731, Asaf Jah I the Nizam of Hyderabad had managed to secure the defections of influential Maratha leaders, such as Trimbak Rao Dabhade and Sanbhoji who threatened to abandon the Marathas and join the forces with the Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah instead. This move was considered unacceptable by Baji Rao I and his brother Chimnaji Appa who led a large well armed Forces of Marathas to intercept Trimbak Rao Dabhade and Sanbhoji during the Battle of Dabhoi, where the defecting factions were all defeated, overrun and killed. Baji Rao I then attacked Gujarat with full force and finally drove out Sarbuland Khan by 1735. An elephant and its mahout in service of the Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah. In the year 1736, Siddi's of Murud-Janjira set out to recapture Raigarh from the forces of Baji Rao, on 19 April 1736, Chimnaji attacked the gathering forces in the encampments of the Siddi's during a battle near Riwas, when the confrontation ended, 1500 Siddi's including their leader Siddi Sat were killed. Peace was concluded in September 1736, but the Siddi's were confined to Janjira, Gowalkot and Anjanvel. In the year 1737, Asaf Jah I the Nizam of Hyderabad led a large Mughal Army to assist the Nawab of Bhopal Yar Muhammad Khan Bahadur but was instead besieged inside the city of Bhopal by 80,000 Marathas led by Baji Rao I. The Battle of Bhopal continued until Safdarjung and his relief forces were driven away by Malhar Rao Holkar. With the following peace negotiations, Asaf Jah I agreed to the peace treaty ratified by the Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah that granted Malwa to the Marathas. In the year 1737 the Maratha chieftain Baji Rao I attacked the Mughal imperial capital at Delhi, and defeated a well trained Mughal Army led by Amir Khan Bahadur, but was forced to withdraw when the Mughal sent substantially well armed reinforcements fought major skirmishes with the Marathas on the outskirts of Delhi. Baji Rao I and his Marathas fled southeast to Badshshpur, where he corresponded with the Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah, who ratified peace by agreeing the handover of Malwa to the Marathas. Among the loyal tributaries of the Mughal Empire was Meenakshi, the queen of the Madurai Nayaks in Dindigul Fort, she had assisted Mughal forces in the Carnatic several times against the Marathas. In the year 1740, Dost Ali Khan to Nawab of the Carnatic and Chanda Sahib faced the task of expelling the Marathas under Raghoji I Bhonsle, authorised by Shahu. Dost Ali Khan lost his life on 20 May 1740 at the Battle of Damalcherry in defence of Arcot and its populace, which was eventually looted and plundered. Chanda Sahib along with his garrison was captured and imprisoned in Satara. Chanda Sahib and his forces ferociously defended their rightful reams during the Siege of Trichinopoly and almost all the territories of the Nawab of the Carnatic despite being outnumbered substantially by the Marathas, their daunting efforts soon attracted the attention of the curious French East India Company official named Joseph Fran√ßois Dupleix. dissatisfied by the Maratha occupation of the territories of the Nawab of the Carnatic, Asaf Jah I led an expedition to liberate the Carnatic he was joined by Sadatullah Khan II and Anwaruddin Muhammed Khan together they recaptured Arcot and initiated the Siege of Trichinopoly (1743), which lasted five months and forced the Marathas led by Murari Rao Ghorpade to evacuate the Carnatic. In the year 1747, the Marathas led by Raghoji I Bhonsle, began to raid, pillage and annex the territories of the Nawab of Bengal Alivardi Khan. During the Maratha invasion of Orissa, its Subedar Mir Jafar completely withdrew all forces until the arrival of Alivardi Khan and the Mughal Army at the Battle of Burdwan where Raghoji I Bhonsle and his Maratha forces were completely routed. The enraged Nawab of Bengal Alivardi Khan then dismissed the shamed Mir Jafar. However, four years later Orissa was ceded over to the Marathas by the Mughal Emperor. Mughal Army The Mughal Army before the year 1739 comprised 200,000 cavalry and 1,500 elephants, the Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah used eight thousand pieces of artillery, which were drawn by elephants and oxen. Invasion of Nader Shah Nader Shah finds his troops had been killed in rioting. From On 13 February 1739 the Persians under the military genius Nader Shah, the commander of the Afsharids, had deposed the former Safavid dynasty, then defeated Persia's arch rival, the Ottoman Empire several times, and had therefore secured the western front. Now his eyes turned upon the wealthy but weakened Mughal Empire. In the year 1739, Nader Shah invaded the Mughal Empire, and defeated Muhammad Shah during the Battle of Karnal in less than three hours, and then marched upon the Mughal capital Delhi, and after a chain of events, he completely sacked and looted it, and occupied much of the northern regions of the Mughal Empire. =Tensions with Persia= Nader Shah wanted to subdue Afghan rebels led by the Ghilzai tribe particularly in the region around Kandahar. ASIN: B0006ETWB8. See Google Books search. He therefore requested the assistance of the Muhammad Shah to close the frontiers around Kabul and the Indus Valley so that the rebels may not flee or seek refuge. Muhammad Shah gave a confirming reply to Nader Shah but didn't do any thing practically, because the local Subedars and Faujdars sympathised with the Afghan and rejected Persian rule. The Afghan rebels eventually did flee to the Mughals. Outraged by this, Nader Shah sent an ambassador to Muhammad Shah, demanding deliverance of the fugitives. The Mughal Emperor did not provide a positive response and kept the Persians marginalised from Delhi for an entire year. Nader Shah became furious with Muhammad Shah. He had now found himself two reasons of why to invade the Mughal Empire; one, that the Mughals didn't deliver the Afghan rebels to him, and two, he knew that the Mughals were weak, but still extremely wealthy. =Invasion of the Mughal Empire= On the basis of the above reasons, Nader Shah decided to invade the Mughal Empire, by starting to attack from Afghanistan. In May 1738 he attacked Northern Afghanistan. In the same month, he captured Ghazni, in June he captured Kabul and in September Jalalabad also fell to him. In November he surrounded the fortress of Peshawar and razed it to the ground after the Battle of Khyber pass. Finally in January 1739, he captured Lahore, after completely subduing the forces of the Mughal viceroy, Zakariya Khan Bahadur and his 25,000 elite Sowars, by the river Chenab the Afsharid forces soon encountered bands of Sikh rebels whom Nader Shah predicted would clearly benefit after his invasion. Muhammad Shah with the Persian invader Nader Shah Now Nader Shah had captured territory all the way up to Attock, and Muhammad Shah and his courtiers could not close their eyes from further danger. They finally understood that the Persian emperor was not the sort of enemy that could be bought off with the loot of a province. Furthermore, he had devastated the area he just conquered. The cities of Wazirabad, Emanabad and Gujrat were not only sacked but razed to the ground. Near Larkana the Afsharid forces completely routed the Mughal Army of the Nawab of Sindh, Main Noor Mohammad Kalhoro, and later captured him and his two sons. In February 1739, Nader Shah captured Sirhind and moved towards the field of Karnal, a battle destined to be fateful to the Mughal rulers. On 13 February, the battle of Karnal was fought. Emperor Muhammad Shah had over a hundred thousand force against Nader Shah's 55,000 men but was still decisively defeated in less than three hours. In the event, the Khan Douran died and wrote a will that the Mughal and Afsharid emperors should not meet, but Nader Shah should be turned back from there at all costs. But the Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah believed that he had no other choice but to surrender to Nader Shah on 26 February in the Afsharid encampments, thirteen days after the Battle of Karnal. The Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah handed over the keys of the Delhi gate and marched as a captive with Nader Shah to Delhi, which was then completely plundered. After entering Delhi, Nader Shah claimed to occupy the Mughal Empire out of religious devotion and that if \\"the wretched Marathas of the Deccan\\" moved towards Delhi, he might \\"send an army of victorious Qizilbash to drive them to the abyss of Hell\\". In fact Nader Shah had delivered catastrophe from which the Mughal Empire itself never recovered and the subjects of the emperor were outraged by the ascendancy of the Afsharids.Muhammad Latif, The History of the Panjab (Calcutta, 1891), p. 200. Provinces of the Mughal Empire in the year 1740 At first, things were cordial among the two emperors. However rumours spread throughout Delhi that Nader Shah was assassinated. The masses attacked the Persian force and killed some soldiers. Nader Shah, furious, ordered to massacre the populace, and at least 30,000 people died. The Emperor and Asaf Jah I had to beg Nader Shah for mercy and thus he stopped the massacre and turned to looting the Mughal treasury. The famous Peacock Throne, the Daria-i-Noor diamond and unimaginable wealth was looted. In addition, elephants, horses and everything that was liked was taken. Muhammad Shah also had to hand over his daughter Jahan Afruz Banu Begum as a bride for Nader Shah's youngest son. Asaf Jah I retired to Deccan after installing his eldest son Intizam-ud-Daula as a major commander in the Mughal Army Digital Library of India Accessed 7 January 2012 After the whole event, Muhammad Shah was crowned as emperor by Nader Shah himself on 12 May, and he ceded the area west of river Indus to Nader Shah, although the Kalhora Nawabs of Sindh continued to fight the invading Afsharids. Nader Shah then took the Koh-i-Noor diamond and the other aforementioned famous treasures, and he and his Persian forces started to return to Persia. =Aftermath= Nader Shah's invasion destroyed what was left of the Mughal Empire and neared it to its end. After the invasion, the Mughals rapidly disintegrated. The weakness of the Mughal Army was clearly elaborated after this invasion. The Nawabs clearly could not even relieve their captured city of Delhi, which was the seat of their authority. The Mughals were completely looted of their wealth, and rebellions and disloyalty became commonplace. Foreign relations Following Nader Shah's invasion, Persia's arch rival the Ottoman Empire, quickly exploited the void that was created at their Eastern borders as almost all Persian units were deployed in the Mughal Empire. During that period Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah closely observed the actions of the Ottomans, and also cooperated with the Ottoman ambassador Haji Yusuf Agha until the emperor's death in 1748 after the victory of the Mughal Army at the Battle of Manupur (1748) against yet another foe (Ahmad Shah Durrani). Marriages The Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah and his family Emperor Muhammad Shah had four wives. His first wife and chief consort was his first-cousin, Princess Badshah Begum, the daughter of Emperor Farrukhsiyar and his first wife, Gauhar-un-Nissa Begum. He married her after his accession on 8 December 1721 at Delhi, and gave her the title Malika-uz-Zamani (Queen of the Age) by which she was popularly known. On this occasion there was a great ceremony lasting for weeks. She bore him his first son, Shahriyar Shah Bahadur, who died young in 1726. She was his most influential wife and exercised her opinions on him. Later, Muhammad Shah took a second wife, Sahiba Mahal. His third wife was a dancing girl, Udham Bai, who bore him his future successor, Ahmad Shah Bahadur on 23 December 1725. Upon his birth, he was taken from her and was lovingly brought up by Badshah Begum, who considered him her own son. It was through Badshah Begum's efforts that Ahmad Shah was able to ascend the throne upon Muhammad Shah's death in 1748. Muhammad Shah married his fourth (and last) wife, Safiya Sultan Begum later on. Badshah Begum died on 14 December 1789 Muhammad Shah had three sons and three daughters. In 1748 when Ahmad Shah Abdali attacked and deposed Muhammad Shah, his son Anwer Ali escaped to his grand aunt Princess Jahanara Begum & hid in a place in Arrah, Bihar which was infested with bears which was later named as Bhaluhipur. Ahmad Shah Durrani married Hazrat Begum the daughter of the deceased Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah and Sahiba Mahal in the year 1757. Death Funeral. The victory of the Mughal Army during the Battle of Manupur (1748) came with a heavy price many fell in battle. Initially this was kept a secret. However, when the news reached the Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah, he could not speak, suddenly became sick, and did not come out of his apartments for three days. During this period he fasted. His guards could hear him crying out loud and saying: \\"How could I bring about anyone as faithful as he? (Asaf Jah I)\\". He died due to grief on 16 April 1748, his funeral was attended by visiting Imams from Mecca.name=\\"Mughal-Ottoman relations Sharif of Mecca\\" In popular culture * In the 2010 historical TV series Maharaja Ranjit Singh telecasted on DD National, the character of Muhammad Shah is portrayed by Rishikesh Sharma.

Setting themselves clearly apart from the phonograph industry, they founded their own record company (APRIL Records) and cooperatively organized the distribution. ‚ÄúMusic distributed by the musicians‚Äù was the primary guiding principle. There were no European models to imitate, although the Filmverlag der Autoren [Authors‚Äô Film Publishing Company] was surely groundbreaking at the beginning. Established several years previously, it had succeeded in marginally pushing back the market power of the Anglo-American media flood so the filmmakers who belonged to it could make a living for themselves. The start of APRIL Records was extraordinarily successful and attracted much attention. After CBS threatened to take legal action, its name was changed to ‚ÄúSchneeball‚Äù [‚ÄúSnowball‚Äù] in 1977. The situation was quite difficult, but samplers entitled ‚ÄúApril ist Schneeball‚Äù [‚ÄúApril is Snowball‚Äù] enabled it to remain recognizable in the music and media landscapes. The name was chosen to express the energy in the center of the music spectrum and the expansion and development along its margins. Many others subsequently used APRIL Records as a model. Within a short time, numerous bands wanted to be part of it. (Other artists who published at Schneeball are Real Ax Band, Munju, Checkpoint Charlie, Moira, and Hammerfest.) An important cooperating partner for distribution via bookstores was the Trikont label ‚ÄúUnsere Stimme‚Äù [‚ÄúOur Voice‚Äù], which had sprouted from Trikont Buchverlag [Trikont Book Publishing Company]. At the same time, the ‚ÄúUmsonst und drau√üen‚Äù [‚ÄúFree and Outdoors‚Äù] festival movement developed as an organizational form for noncommercial music festivals. New labels were founded, including, for example, NO FUN, Zickzack, Eigelstein, Subup, and Trikont. The distribution was taken over by EfA(Energie f√ºr Alle) [Energy for Everyone] at the beginning of the 1980s. Schneeball Oper 1 und 2 [Snowball Operas 1 and 2] were developed as a new cooperative project by the musicians from the various bands. This showed that a mutual willingness existed to collaborate beyond the horizons of each individual band. The distribution structure became increasingly independent, but this autonomy unfortunately proved detrimental to the interests of the producing artists. Consequently, Efa and INDIGO Musikvertrieb [INDIGO Music Distribution] separated in 1992. Schneeball‚Äôs most productive era was already over by the mid 1980s. The reasons were manifold. Ton Stein Scherben broke up. Rio Reiser began a solo career at Sony. At EMBRYO too, many years of collaboration among the musicians and composers Christian Burchard, Roman Bunka and Uve M√ºllrich came to an end after a trip to India ‚Äì but not before the releases of the double LP ‚ÄúEMBRYO‚Äôs Reise‚Äù [‚ÄúEMBRYO‚Äôs Trip‚Äù], a road movie, and a music documentary film ‚ÄúVagabundenkarawane‚Äù [‚ÄúCaravan of Vagabonds‚Äù] by Werner Penzel and Nico Humpert. EMBRYO‚Äôs dissidents hived off, joined forces with Hartmut Bremer, and co-founded the EXIL [EXILE] label, likewise at INDIGO. Christian Burchard formed EMBRYO anew with different personnel. Sparifankal switched to a new label and a new distributor. A great die-off of the pioneering German bands began, and no one wept to see the trailblazers disappear. Punk, Neue deutsche Welle, disco: the audience‚Äôs orientations had changed. Othmar Schreckeneder, EMBRYO‚Äôs producer since 1972, continued to publish audio recordings until the mid 1990s on the Schneeball label with EMBRYO and its guest musicians from diverse cultures and countries. He also published radio plays for Bayerischer Rundfunk [Bavarian Radio] (Ernst Jandl, Grace Yoon) and works by artists such as Eugen de Ryck, Chris Karrer, and Amon D√º√ºl II. EMBRYO switched to Trikont, thus remaining under Indigo‚Äôs distribution. Only Schreckeneder continued to use the label for occasional new releases, e.g. Charlie Mariano with Rama Mani in 2005 or Peter Michael Hamel with Thomas Gundermann in 2014. Schneeball was the trailblazer of the ‚ÄúIndependent Label‚Äù movement, which conquered its place in the global music industry.

Rise to power  Mohammad Shah succeeded Fath Ali Shah by Armin Mehrabi Mohammad Shah was son of Abbas Mirza, the crown prince and governor of Azerbaijan, who in turn was the son of Fat‚Ä≤h Ali Shah Qajar, the second Shah of the dynasty. At first, Abbas Mirza was the chosen heir to the Shah. However, after he died, the Shah chose Mohammad to be his heir. After the Shah's death, Ali Mirza, one of his many sons, tried to take the throne in opposition to Mohammad. His rule lasted for about 40 days. Nonetheless, he was quickly deposed at the hands of Mirza Abolghasem Ghaem Magham Farahani, a politician, scientist, and poet.  Reign  = Politics and the military = Ali was forgiven by Mohammad, who had then become Shah. A supporter of Mohammad, Khosrow Khan Gorji, was awarded with the governorship of Isfahan, while Farahani was awarded the position of chancellorship of Persia by Shah at the time of his inauguration. He was later betrayed and executed by the order of the Shah in 1835, at the instigation of Hajj Mirza Aghasi, who would become the Ghaem Magham's successor and who greatly influenced Mohammad's policies. One of his wives, Malek Jahan Khanom, Mahd-e Olia, later became a large influence on his successor, who was their son. He also tried to capture Herat twice. To try to defeat the British, he sent an officer to the court of Louis-Philippe of France. In 1839, two French military instructors arrived at Tabriz to aid him. However, both attempts to capture the city were unsuccessful (Siege of Herat (1838) and Anglo-Persian War). Towards the end of Mohammad Shah's short reign, British officials petitioned for a farman or decree against the slave trade. In 1846, the British Foreign Office sent Justin Sheil to Persia to negotiate with the Shah on the slave trade. At first the Shah refused to limit either slavery or the slave trade on the grounds that the Quran did not forbid it and he could not forbid something that the Quran deemed legal. Further the Shah asserted that banning the slave trade would reduce converts to Islam. However, in 1848, Mohammad Shah made a small concession and issued a farman banning the maritime trade of slaves.J.B. Kelly, 'Britain and the Persian Gulf 1795-1880 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1968) Mohammad was known to be somewhat sickly throughout his life, and he finally died at the age of 40 of gout in Mohammadieh Palace, now known as Bagh-e Ferdow.

Mohammad fell into the influence of Russia and attempted to make reforms to modernize and increase contact with the West.

Other artwork during this time includes a number of small-scale paintings on lacquer. During Mohammad's reign, the religious movement of B√°bism began to flourish for the first time.

With eleven albums reaching the number one in the German record charts, BAP is one of the most successful rock acts in their home country. Nearly all of BAP's lyrics are written in K√∂lsch, the dialect of Cologne, or more precisely in a K√∂lsch-influenced derivation of Eifelplatt, a regional variant of the Ripuarian language spoken in the nearby rural Eifel. Niedecken's most prominent musical influences, especially early in his career, were Bob Dylan, the Kinks, Bruce Springsteen, the Rolling Stones, and Wolfgang Ambros.  History  The group was founded in 1976 under the name Wolfgang Niedecken's BAP in Cologne, (Germany) by Wolfgang Niedecken and Hans Heres. In 1981, they released their most famous song \\"Verdamp lang her\\" (English: Damn long time ago), in which Niedecken describes regrets he has about his relationship with his then recently deceased father. The band's name \\"BAP\\" derived from \\"BAPP\\", both, a play-on-words on the K√∂lsch word \\"Papp\\" (related to the German word dad), but pronounced differently, and Niedecken's then-times nickname. Niedecken translated a collection of Bob Dylan's lyrics to German for his 1995 solo album Leopardefell.

David Teniers the Elder, Village Feast, Panel Accademia Carrara, Bergamo David Teniers the Elder (158229 July 1649), Flemish painter, was born at Antwerp. Biography Venus Visiting Vulcan‚Äôs Forge, The National Museum of Western Art, Tokyo Having received his first training in the painter's art from his brother Juliaen, he studied under Rubens in Antwerp, and subsequently under Elsheimer in Rome; he became a member of the Antwerp guild of painters in 1606. Though his ambition led him at times to try his skill in large religious, historical and mythological compositions, his claim to fame depends chiefly on his landscapes and paintings of peasants carousing, of kermesse scenes and the like, which are marked by a healthy sense of humour, and which are not infrequently confused with the early works of his son David. There is a large painting by the elder Teniers at St Paul's church in Antwerp, representing the Works of Charity. At the Vienna Gallery are four landscapes painted by Teniers under the influence of Elsheimer, and four small mythological subjects, among them Vertumnus and Pomona, and Juno, Jupiter and Io. The National Gallery has a characteristic scene of village life, Playing at Bowls, a Conversation of three men and a woman, and a large Rocky Landscape. Other examples of his work are to be found at the galleries of St Petersburg, Madrid, Brussels, Munich, Dresden and Berlin (The Temptation of St Anthony). Teniers also achieved success as a picture dealer, and is known to have attended the fair of St Germain in Paris in 1635, with a large number of paintings by himself and by his four sons. He died at Antwerp in 1649.

The bluffs are contained within the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Site. The bluffs stretch northwest to southeast over from the Western Bluff near the town of Mole Creek to the Millers Bluff, approximately west of Campbell Town.Lloyd, p.1 During the late 19th century the Tiers were known as the Great Western Range.Whitworth, p.91 Features The Central Highlands, or Tasmanian central plateau, was uplifted from the lower Meander Valley, most probably in the Eocene epoch though possibly earlier, forming the Tiers' escarpment.Fish and Yaxley, p.253 The plateau's north-east boundary, which ranges from -, originated in extensive Tertiary faulting.Fish and Yaxley, p.293 This escarpment divides the high, rocky, sparsely inhabited central plateau from the fertile lower land of the Meander Valley and the northern midlands. The edge of the tiers have prominent cliffs and columns of Jurassic dolerite. The highest peak in the tiers is the Ironstone Mountain. Unlike most of the bluffs this mountain is not visible from the Meander Valley, but is south of the escarpment. The escarpment has a distinct concave profile. Cliffs and scree slopes are common features.Fish and Yaxley, p.294 The dolerite is so prominent as the older rocks that overlay them are softer and have been eroded away.

Life The beach at Scheveningen, painted 1658. Oil on canvas. Staatliche Museen, Kassel Adriaen did not want to become a marine painter so he was trained in the studio of Jan Wynants, the landscape painter. There he made the acquaintance of Philip Wouwerman, who is believed to have aided him in his studies of animals, and to have exercised a powerful and beneficial influence upon his art. Having made exceptionally rapid progress, he was soon employed by his master to introduce figures into his landscape compositions, and he rendered a similar service to Hobbema, Ruisdael, Verboom and other contemporary artists. According to Houbraken, he died while in collaboration with Jan van der Heyden and Frederik de Moucheron, painting animals on their paintings. Adriaan vanden Velde biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature Agony in the Garden His favourite subjects were scenes of open pasture land, with sheep, cattle and goats, which he executed with dexterity, with much precision of touch and truth of draughtsmanship, and with clear silvery colouring. He painted a few small winter scenes with skaters, and several religious subjects, such as the Descent from the Cross, for a Roman Catholic hidden church in Amsterdam and The Migration of Jacob (1663, Wallace Collection). In addition to his paintings, of which nearly two hundred have been catalogued, he executed about twenty etchings, several of which appear from their dates to have been done in his fourteenth year. They are distinguished by directness of method and by delicacy and certainty of touch. Van de Velde lived in Kalverstraat, near the Regulierspoort.

Intrepid was built in France in 1798 for Napoleon's Egyptian expedition. The vessel was sold to Tripoli, which she served as Mastico. The bomb ketch was one of several Tripolitan vessels which captured on 31 October 1803 after the American frigate had run fast aground on uncharted Kaliusa reef some five miles (8 km) east of Tripoli.U.S.Navy, DANFS, Intrepid, page article Capture , a schooner with Lt. Stephen Decatur in command, captured Mastico on 23 December 1803 as it was sailing from Tripoli to Constantinople under Turkish colors and without passports. After a time- consuming search for a translator, the ketch's papers and the testimony of an English ship master who had been in Tripoli to witness her role in operations against Philadelphia convinced the commander of the American squadron, Commodore Edward Preble, that Mastico was a legitimate prize. He took her into the U.S. Navy and renamed her Intrepid. Destruction of USS Philadelphia Burning of the Frigate Philadelphia in the Harbor of Tripoli by Edward Moran (1897) Intrepid depicted in foreground Meanwhile, Philadelphia lay in Tripoli Harbor threatening to become Tripoli's largest and most powerful corsair. Preble decided that he must destroy the frigate before the enemy could fit her out for action against his squadron. In order to take the Tripolitans by surprise, he assigned the task to the only ship which could be sure of passing as a North African vessel, Intrepid. He appointed Lieutenant Stephen Decatur captain of the ketch on 31 January 1804 and ordered him to prepare her for a month's cruise to Tripoli in company with . Preble's orders directed Decatur to slip into harbor at night, to board and burn the frigate, and make good his retreat in Intrepid, unless it then seemed feasible to use her as a fire ship against other shipping in the harbor. In the latter case, he was to escape in boats to Syren which would await just outside the harbor. Intrepid and Syren set sail 2 February and arrived off Tripoli five days later. However, bad weather delayed the operation until 16 February. That evening Syren took station outside the harbor and launched her boats to stand by for rescue work. At 7 o'clock Intrepid entered the harbor and 2¬Ω hours later was alongside Philadelphia. When hailed, they claimed to be traders who had lost their anchor in the late gale, and begged permission to make fast to the frigate till morning. Guards suddenly noticed the ketch still had her anchors and gave the alarm. Leaving a small force commanded by Surgeon Lewis Heermann on board Intrepid, Decatur led 60 of his men to the deck of the frigate. A brief struggle, conducted without firing a gun, gave the Americans control of the vessel enabling them to set her ablaze. Decatur, the last man to leave the burning frigate, remained on board Philadelphia until flames blazed from the hatchways and ports of her spar deck. When he finally left the ship, her rigging and tops were afire. Shore batteries opened up on Intrepid as she escaped only to be answered from abandoned Philadelphia when her guns discharged by the heat of the conflagration. When Lord Nelson, then blockading Toulon, heard of Intrepid feat, he is said to have called it \\"the most bold and daring act of the age\\".See, Leiner, Frederick C., \\"Searching for Nelson‚Äôs Quote\\", USNI News, United States Naval Institute, February 5, 2013, setting forth the evidence for and against that quote. Intrepid returned to Syracuse on 19 February, and the next day her crew returned to their original ships. The ketch remained in Syracuse with only a midshipman and a few men on board while the squadron was at sea during the next few months. She became a hospital ship on 1 June and continued this duty through July. She departed Syracuse on 12 August for Malta, where she took on board fresh supplies for the squadron and departed on 17 August. She rejoined the squadron off Tripoli on 22 August.MacKenzie, 1846 pp. 64‚Äì74 Fire ship A week later she began to be fitted out as a \\"floating volcano\\" and was to be sent into the harbor and blown up in the midst of the corsair fleet close under the walls of Tripoli. The vessel was loaded with 100 barrels of powder and 150 fixed shells, the fuses leading to the explosives were calculated to burn for 15 minutes. Carpenters of every ship were pressed into service and she was ready on 1 September, but unfavorable weather delayed the operation until 4 September. That day, Lieutenant Richard Somers assumed command of the fire ship. Volunteers for the mission also included Midshipman Henry Wadsworth and ten seamen.MacKenzie, 1846 p. 114\\"Colimore (2011), page article Shortly after Intrepid got underway, Midshipman Joseph Israel arrived with last-minute orders from Commodore Preble and insisted on accompanying the expedition. Two of the fastest rowing vessels were chosen to assist in the mission and return the volunteers from the mission. At eight o'clock on 4 September Intrepid got underway with Argus, Vixen, and Nautilus serving as escorts up to the point by the rocks near the harbor's entrance, remaining there to watch and pick up the returning rowing boats and return the crew from their mission.Waldo, 1821 pp. 100‚Äì101 As Intrepid approached the enemy fleet they were discovered and fired upon by carronades from the overlooking shore batteries. At 8:30 before Intrepid could get to its final position it exploded, lighting up the entire scene and sending the hull, yards and rigging and exploding shells in all directions, killing all on board. The anxious crews of the awaiting squadron were shaken by the concussion of the great explosion but at this time could not determine the exact fate of the mission. They remained there the entire night with the hope that the rowing vessels would return with the volunteers, but by morning their hopes turned to despair when the light of day finally revealed what had happened. Commodore Preble later concluded that an attempt was made by intercepting boarding vessels, and that Somers decided to destroy the vessel, himself, and his crew to avoid capture and enslavement, but there was no way of knowing the exact events which resulted in the explosion.MacKenzie, 1846 pp. 114‚Äì117Waldo, 1821 pp. 135‚Äì136 Aftermath The remains of the 13 sailors on the ship washed ashore the next day after the explosion and were dragged through the street by angry locals. The bodies were buried in an unmarked mass grave outside Tripoli. In 1949, the Libyan government unearthed the remains and moved them to the current cemetery. Rear Admiral Richard H. Cruzen, veteran of two expeditions to Antarctica, represented the U.S. Navy at the ceremony unveiling the monument to the fallen sailors on April 2, 1949.http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/OnlineLibrary/photos/sh- usn/usnsh-s/cl120-m.htm Since then, the Libyan government has maintained the grave site, although sometimes has allowed maintenance of the site to deteriorate. On 17 December 2011, US defense chief Leon Panetta visited the cemetery in Tripoli and placed a wreath at the grave site. The US has no plans to repatriate the remains to the US.Cloud, David S., \\"Wreath Laid For Sailors Killed In 1804\\", Los Angeles Times, 18 December 2011, p. 7.

Life and work Philips Wouwerman was one of the most versatile and prolific artists of the Dutch Golden Age. Embedded in the artistic environment and tradition of his home town of Haarlem, Wouwerman made an important and highly influential contribution to the canon of seventeenth-century Dutch painting. His pictures were in demand during his lifetime, and even more sought after in the 18th century. Throughout Europe, formerly princely art collections like in Dresden and St. Petersburg still bear witness to this widespread admiration of Wouwerman's art. Battle scene Born in Haarlem in 1619, the son of a now altogether obscure painter named Pouwels Joostsz. Wouwerman, little is known about the artistic schooling of Wouwerman. According to Cornelis de Bie, he studied with Frans Hals (1581/85‚Äì1666), but the particular style of Hals didn't leave a footmark on his oeuvre.Duparc, Frederik J. \\"Wouwerman, Philips.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Retrieved February 23, 2014 Apart from a short stay in Hamburg at the end of the 1630s, Wouwerman seemed to have lived in Haarlem during his whole artistic career and died as a prosperous member of the community at the age of 48. He joined the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke in 1640 and here took on several official posts in the years to come.Philips Wouwerman in the RKD Wouwerman also worked as an estate agent in his home town, as many documents in Haarlem archives mentioned the artist in this context. Wouwerman started his artistic career with simple depictions of everyday life in the tradition of the bamboccianti by Pieter van Laer (1592/99‚Äìafter 1642). His paintings of the mid-1640s often feature a diagonal slope of land, a tree which functions as a repoussoir, and figures accompanied by horses. Over the next thirty years he developed an individual style, treating a wide range of subjects from genre and landscape to military and religious scenes (equestrian scenes, hunting and hawking parties, landscapes with travellers, cavalry battles and military encampments, peasants festivities etc.). He is noted for his skill in the depiction of horses of all breeds seen in motion. The art historian Frederik J. Duparc calls Wouwerman \\"undoubtedly the most accomplished and successful 17th-century Dutch painter of horses\\". The masterpieces from his best period (around 1650‚Äì1660) are of indisputably high quality, beautifully combining imaginary southern landscapes and a typically Dutch atmosphere. Wouwerman's paintings are characterized by subdued colours, a cool atmosphere and a wealth of witty, anecdotal details. He died in Haarlem. Courtyard with a farrier shoeing a horse The first retrospective exhibition of Philips Wouwerman's work took place in Kassel, Gem√§ldegalerie Alte Meister, and in The Hague, The Royal Picture Gallers Mauritshuis, 2009/2010. Family At an early age, Wouwerman married Anna Pietersz. van Broeckhoff with whom he had ten children. They lived on the Bakenessergracht in a house that was also lived in by Haarlem painters Cornelis Gerritsz Decker and Hendrik de Meijer. Seven of the Wouwerman children survived and, after the death of their mother in 1670, accepted a substantial inheritance. Output About 800 pictures were listed in John Smith's Catalogue raisonn√© (1829/1842) as the work of Philip Wouwerman. In Hofstede de Groot's enlarged Catalogue (1908) the number exceeds to 1200. In Birgit Schumacher's recently published Catalogue raisonn√© (2006), only about 570 pictures were listed as authentic works, as many of the pictures mentioned by Hofstede de Groot were actually painted by countless followers and imitators all over Europe. Jan and Pieter Wouwerman, the younger brothers of Philips, were often regarded as close followers whose pictures seemed to have been frequently attributed to Philips. The white horse The oeuvre of Pieter (1623‚Äì1682) clearly manifests the influence of Philips with regard to the range of subjects, but regarding the artistic style, Pieter had quite one of his own. And Jan (1629‚Äì1666) was a rather autonomous landscape painter. Out of the countless followers, some of the most gifted artists working in Wouwerman's style are worth mentioning: Jan van Huchtenburgh (1647‚Äì1733), the brothers Jan Frans (1683‚Äì1750) and Joseph van Bredael (1688‚Äì1739) as well as Carel van Falens (1683‚Äì1733). His registered pupils were Johannes van der Bent, Hendrick Berckman, Eduard Dubois, Nicolas Ficke, Barent Gael, Anthony de Haen, Emanuel Murant, Matthias Scheits, Kort Withold, and his brothers.

The diocese covers the City and County of Bristol and the ceremonial counties of Gloucestershire, Somerset, and Wiltshire, an area of . Thus it stretches from Stow in the Wold in the north to Minehead and Watchet in the South. The most north-westerly parishes are in the Forest of Dean, while Marlborough near Swindon is one of the most easterly. The City of Bristol, of which Clifton is a suburb, is the largest centre of population within the Diocese; Swindon is the next biggest. Other well-known cities and towns include Bath, Wells, Cheltenham, Gloucester, Salisbury, Taunton and Weston-super-Mare. The Clifton Diocese makes up part of the Catholic Association Pilgrimage. The diocese was erected in 1850; from then until 1911 it was in the ecclesiastical province of Westminster, and has been in the province of Birmingham since then. Statistics The Diocese has 107 Parishes, or the equivalent. Many have chapels-of-ease or other Mass centres, adding a total of 99 chapels.

History The English Reformation suppressed the Catholic hierarchy in England by the mid-16th century. In 1622 the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith created an apostolic vicariate for the whole of England, which was divided into four districts in 1688. The Western District, comprising the whole of Wales and the present Dioceses of Plymouth and Clifton, was by far the poorest. The hierarchy was restored in 1850 by Pope Pius IX, and the Western District was created the Diocese of Clifton, so-called because the Ecclesiastical Titles Act 1851 (repealed 20 years later by the Ecclesiastical Titles Act 1871) made it illegal for Catholic dioceses to use the same title as current or former Anglican dioceses, despite the fact that the Diocese of Clifton had its Cathedral Church within the City of Bristol. The apostolic vicar William Joseph Hendren was appointed as the first bishop. In 1830, in an attempt to ensure a supply of priests for the district, Bishop Peter Baines, the Vicar-Apostolic, had bought the Prior Park estate near Bath and had established there a school and a seminary, now Prior Park College. Although an academic success the college was a financial disaster. Bishop Hendren resigned in 1851 realising his inability to do anything about the huge debts on the college. His successor, Bishop Thomas Burgess, died in 1854 without doing anything to solve the problem. A Decree of the Sacred College promulgated on 22 December 1855 prevented the appointment of a new Bishop of Clifton until the problems of the college had been solved. Instead, an administrator was appointed who would manage the affairs of the diocese until a bishop was appointed. He was Archbishop Errington, Co-Adjutor to Cardinal Wiseman the Archbishop of Westminster. He arrived at Prior Park at the end of October 1855, but was not able to do anything to preserve the college. A Court Order was enforced against the college for non-payment of rent, and the contents of the college were sold by auction, and the premises vacated. The problem of Prior Park having been settled, a new Bishop of Clifton was appointed. William Clifford, the second son of Lord Clifford of Chudleigh in Devon, was consecrated by Pope Pius IX on 15 February 1857, and enthroned at the pro-cathedral on 17 March 1857. For the next 36 years he guided the diocese to prosperity. Clifton Cathedral The pro-cathedral had an unfortunate history. Work on the building started in 1834 but ceased the following year when the foundations failed. The half-finished building was abandoned in 1843 when a second attempt to reinforce the foundations again failed. Bishop William Ullathorne, Vicar- Apostolic from 1846 to 1848, had a roof placed on the half-finished building so that it could be used as a church, but Bishop Clifford, with the advice of the architect Charles Hansom, had it converted into a reasonable pro- cathedral. He also re-purchased Prior Park and re-opened the school and the seminary, much of the expense being found by the bishop's family. Bishop Clifford died in 1893. His successor, Bishop William Brownlow, was consecrated in 1894 and died in 1901. Brownlow's successor, Bishop George Ambrose Burton, a priest of the Diocese of Hexham and Newcastle, was Bishop of Clifton for the next 29 years. An outstanding scholar, he was an authority on ancient manuscripts and catalogued the documents which now form the basis of the Diocesan Archives. He saw the magnificent Benedictine Downside Abbey completed, and he welcomed a second Benedictine community when the convert community from Caldey Island came to the diocese to settle at Prinknash Abbey. Bishop William Lee, who had been secretary to Bishop Burton, succeeded him in 1931. During his 16 years as bishop, he founded 72 new parishes and Mass Centres. His successor, Bishop Joseph Rudderham, a priest of the Diocese of Northampton, was consecrated at Clifton on 26 July 1949. The financial demands made on the people of the diocese to provide new schools to comply with the provisions of the 1944 Education Act resulted in expenditure of ¬£332,000 between 1949 and 1960. In spite of these demands, the building of a new cathedral was undertaken in 1968. On the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul, 1973, in the presence of a vast gathering of religious and civic dignitaries, Bishop Rudderham took possession of the current Clifton Cathedral. Bishop Rudderham resigned his See in August 1974 and died in retirement in February 1979.

Biography He was born Yisruel Yehoyshye Zinger, the son of Pinchas Mendl Zynger, a rabbi and author of rabbinic commentaries, and Basheva Zylberman. He was the brother of author Isaac Bashevis Singer and novelist Esther Kreitman. He married Genia Kuper. His eldest son, Yasha, died of influenza before the family's emigration to America. His younger son, Joseph Singer, was the translator for both his father's works and his uncle's, Isaac Bashevis Singer. Joseph, a painter and writer like his father, married June Flaum Singer, who went on to become a writer. They had four children: Sharon Salinger, Brett Singer, I.J. Singer and Valerie Singer. The three daughters followed in the family business and are also published poets and novelists. Singer contributed to the European Yiddish press from 1916. In 1919, he and his wife Genia went to the Soviet Union , where he found work on a newspaper, The New Times, and was considered one of the \\"Kiev Writers\\". Then they moved to Moscow, where he published articles and stories. After two hard years, in 1921, they returned to Warsaw. In 1921, after Abraham Cahan noticed his story Pearls, Singer became a correspondent for the American Yiddish newspaper The Forward. His short story Liuk appeared in 1924, illuminating the ideological confusion of the Bolshevik Revolution. He wrote his first novel, Steel and Iron, in 1927. In 1934 he emigrated to the United States to write for The Forward. Eventually, Israel Joshua invited his younger brother, future Nobel prize winner Isaac Bashevis Singer to the United States and engineered for him a job with The Forward. \\"Had it not been for Joshua, Abraham Cahan would have fired him\\", Singer's wife Genia later confessed to Bashevis' son Israel Zamir. He died of a heart attack at age 50 in New York City, 258 Riverside Drive on February 10, 1944.

National Gallery, London Isaac van Ostade (bapt. June 2, 1621 ‚Äì buried October 16, 1649) was a Dutch genre and landscape painter. Biography Van Ostade was born in Haarlem. He began his studies under his brother, Adriaen, with whom he remained until 1641, when he started his own practice. At an early period he felt the influence of Rembrandt, and this is apparent in a Slaughtered Pig of 1639, in the gallery of Augsburg. He soon found a style more suited to his own inclinations. He produced pictures in 1641‚Äì1642 on the lines of his brother ‚Äì amongst these, the Five Senses, which Adrian afterwards represented by a Man reading a Paper, a Peasant tasting Beer, a Rustic smearing his Sores with Ointment and a Countryman sniffing at a Snuff-box. A specimen of Isaac's work at this period may be seen in the Laughing Boor with a Pot of Beer, in the museum of Amsterdam; the cottage interior, with two peasants and three children near a fire, in the Berlin museum; a Concert, with people listening to singers accompanied by a piper and flute player, and a Boor stealing a Kiss from a Woman, in the Lacaze collection at the Louvre. The interior at Berlin is lighted from a casement in the same Rembrandtesque style as Adrian's interior of 1643 at the Louvre. He received low prices for this kind of painting, in which he could only remain subordinate to his brother. Gradually he abandoned Adriaen's cottage subjects for landscapes in the fashion of Esaias van de Velde and Salomon van Ruysdael. Once only, in 1645, he reverted to the earlier mode, when he produced the Slaughtered Pig, with a boy puffing out a bladder, in the museum of Lille. Isaac's progress in his new path was greatly facilitated by his previous experience as a figure painter; and, although he now selected his subjects either from village high streets or frozen canals, he gave fresh life to the scenes by depicting animated groups of people with a refined and searching study of picturesque contrasts. He did not live long enough to bring his art to the highest perfection. He died on 16 October 1649 in Haarlem, having painted about 400 pictures (see H. de Groot, 1910). The first manifestation of Isaac's surrender of Adriaen's style is apparent in 1644 when the skating and sledging scenes were executed which we see in the Lacaze collection and the galleries of the Hermitage, Antwerp and Lille. Three of these examples bear the artists name, spelled Isack van Ostade, and the dates of 1644 and 1645. The roadside inns, with halts of travellers, form a compact series from 1646 to 1649. This is the last form of Isaac's art and has very distinct peculiarities. The air which pervades his composition is warm and sunny, yet mellow and hazy, as if the sky were veiled with a vapour coloured by moor smoke. The trees are rubbings of umber, in which the prominent foliage is tipped with touches hardened in a liquid state by amber varnish mediums. The same principle applied to details such as glazed bricks or rents in the mud lining of cottages gives an unreal and conventional stamp to them. These quirks are overcome by his broad contrasts of light and shade and the masterly figures of horses, riders, travellers, rustics, quarrelling children, dogs, poultry and cattle. A favorite place is always given to the white horse, which seems as invariable an accompaniment as the grey in the skirmishes and fairs of Philip Wouwerman. Isaac displays the best qualities in winter scenes. The absence of foliage, the crisp atmosphere and the calm air of cold January days, unsullied by smoke or vapour, preclude the use of the brown tinge, and leave the painter no choice but to ring the changes with a great variety of opal tints. Then the figures emerge with masterly effect on the light background. Amongst the roadside inns it is worth noting those in the collections of Buckingham Palace, the National Gallery, London, the Wallace Collection and Holford collections in England, the Louvre, Berlin, Hermitage and Rotterdam museums and the Rothschild collection at Vienna. The finest of the ice scenes is the famous one at the Louvre. For paintings and etchings see Les Fr√©res Ostade, by Marguerite van de Wiele (Paris, 1893).

From 1921, he ceased to sign his name as Augustin, thereafter using the signature Tin Ujeviƒá. Biography Ujeviƒá was born in Vrgorac, a small town in the Dalmatian hinterland, and attended school in Imotski, Makarska, Split and Zagreb. He completed Classical Gymnasium in Split, and in Zagreb he studied Croatian language and literature, classical Philology, Philosophy, and Aesthetics. In 1909, while studying literature, his first sonnet \\"Za novim vidicima\\" (Towards New Horizons) appeared in the journal Mlada Hrvatska (Young Croatia). After the assassination attempts on the ban Slavko Cuvaj in 1912, Ujeviƒá became active in the Nationalist youth movement and was repeatedly imprisoned. On the eve of the First World War, he lived briefly in Dubrovnik, ≈†ibenik, Zadar, Rijeka and for a longer time in Split. The crucial period for his political and poetic consciousness was his visit to Paris (1913‚Äì19). After the death of A.G. Mato≈° in 1914, Ujeviƒá published an essay about his teacher in the literary magazine Savremenik. That same year the anthology of poetry inspired by Mato≈°, \\"Hrvatska mlada lirika\\" (Croatian Young Lyrics) brought together the work of 12 young poets, including 10 poems by Tin Ujeviƒá. Also in that year, Ujeviƒá joined the French Foreign Legion, though he left again after 3 months at the urging of Frano Supilo. In 1919, Ujeviƒá returned to Zagreb. Around that time he wrote two autobiographical essays \\"Mrsko Ja\\" (Hateful Me, 1922) examining his political beliefs, which he described as disenchanted, and \\"Ispit savjesti\\" (Examination of Conscience, published in 1923 in the journal Savremenik), which he himself called a \\"sleepwalking sketch\\". It is considered to be one of the most moving confessional texts in Croatian literature, in which an author mercilessly examines their own past. Ujeviƒá lived from 1920‚Äì26 in Belgrade, then he moved between Split and Zagreb, back to Belgrade, then to Split again. In 1920 his first anthology of poetry \\"Lelek sebra\\" (Cry of a slave) was published in Belgrade, and in 1922 his poem \\"Visoki jablani\\" (High Poplars) appeared in the journal Putevi (Roads). He was well-known in bohemian circles in Belgrade and a frequent guest at Hotel Moskva and Skadarlija. During the years 1930‚Äì37, Ujeviƒá lived in Sarajevo, then 1937‚Äì1940 in Split, finally moving back to Zagreb, where he lived until his death in 1955. \\"Zelenu granu s tugom ≈æuta voƒáa...\\" Ujeviƒá's famous poem. From 1941 to 1945 he did not publish a single book, earning his living as a journalist and translator. Ujeviƒá held a post in the Independent State of Croatia as a translator, and continued to publish some material. For this reason, he was forbidden by the Yugoslav government from continuing with his literary career for several years.Tin Ujeviƒá profile , knjiga.hr; accessed 29 April 2015.Fischer, Wladimir. \\"Die vergessene Nationalisierung. Eine synchrone und diachrone Analyse von Ritual, Mythos und Hegemoniek√§mpfen im jugoslavischen literaturpolitischen Diskurs von 1945 bis 1952.\\" Dipl. Thesis. Universit√§t Wien, 1997. Print. In the last days of 1950 a selection of his work was published in Zagreb, under the title \\"Rukovet\\" (\\"Handful\\"). Ujeviƒá died on 12 November 1955 and is buried at Mirogoj Cemetery in Zagreb.Augustin Ujeviƒá  Legacy  In addition to his poetry, Tin Ujeviƒá also wrote essays, short stories, serials (feuilletons), studies on foreign and domestic authors, and he translated philosophical discussions from many foreign languages. He translated numerous works of poetry, novels and short stories into Croatian (Edgar Allan Poe, Walt Whitman, Marcel Proust, Joseph Conrad, Benvenuto Cellini, George Meredith, Emile Verhaeren, Arthur Rimbaud, Andr√© Gide, among others). He wrote more than ten books of essays, poetry in prose and meditations ‚Äî but his enduring strength lies chiefly in his poetic works. At first a follower of Silvije Strahimir Kranjƒçeviƒá and more especially A.G. Mato≈°, Ujeviƒá soon moved on and developed his own independent voice. He preferred the French and American modernists such as Charles Baudelaire, Arthur Rimbaud and Walt Whitman, whose work he translated. His first collections Lelek sebra, and Kolajna, inspired by his years in Paris, are considered the peak of modern Croatian lyrical poetry. From those original first books grew a body of work that is a classic of Croatian literature, and according to the British poet Clive Wilmer, \\"Tin Ujeviƒá was one of the last masters of European Symbolism\\". Poet and writer Anne Stevenson says his \\"melancholy, turn-of-the-century lyricism\\" is comparable to that of Thomas Hardy, of Edward Thomas, and of early Yeats\\". British poet Richard Berengarten, who has translated some of Ujeviƒá's best works into English, writes > \\"Although Tin's major achievement is as a lyricist, his oeuvre is much > broader than lyric alone. He was a writer of profound and discerning > intellect, broad and capacious interests, inquisitive appetite and eclectic > range.\\" There are some 380 records about Tin Ujeviƒá's works in the catalogue of the National and University Library in Zagreb, and part of his literary heritage is preserved in the Library‚Äôs Manuscripts and Old Books Collection. Ujeviƒá published his writings in all renowned newspapers and journals, in which numerous articles about Ujeviƒá were published, and part of that material in digital format is available at the Portal of Digitized Croatian Newspapers and Journals. The Tin Ujeviƒá Award is the most prestigious poetry award in Croatia. In 2003, the Jadrolinija ferry, MV Tin Ujeviƒá was named for the poet. In 2005, Hrvatska Po≈°ta issued a stamp in their series of Famous Croats: Tin Ujeviƒá on the 50th anniversary of his death. By 2008, a total of 122 streets in Croatia were named after Ujeviƒá, making him the ninth most common person for whom streets were named in Croatia.

Biography Jacobus was born in Dordrecht, and learned the art of engraving from his father. In 1707 he moved to Amsterdam, where for years he helped his father with his magnum opus, his art historical work The Great Theatre of Dutch Painters (1718‚Äì1721). When his father died he assisted his mother with the last proofs of the manuscript before publishing. With this project he started his portraits of Netherlandish celebrities, that are today in many cases the only likenesses left of these people. He was influenced by studying the works of Cornelis Cort, Jonas Suyderhoef, Gerard Edelinck and the Visschers. He died, aged 81, in Amsterdam. Works Houbraken devoted himself almost entirely to portraiture. His work became famous through his collaboration with the historian Thomas Birch and artist George Vertue, on the project entitled, Heads of Illustrious Persons of Great Britain, published in parts in London from 1743 to 1752. After that, during the years 1752‚Äì59 he worked with the historian Jan Wagenaar (1709‚Äì1773) on his 21 part Vaderlandsche historie, working for the publisher Isaac Tirion in Amsterdam. With this project of biographies of celebrated figures, he annotated his work with notes about the original paintings. Among his best works are scenes from the comedy of \\"De Ontdekte Schijndeugd\\", executed in his eightieth year, after Cornelis Troost, who was called by his countrymen the Dutch Hogarth. Houbraken also engraved the portraits for Jan van Gool's Nieuwe schouburg der Nederlantsche kunstschilders (Den Haag, 1750‚Äì51). Legacy His oeuvre of more than 400 portrait engravings form an important record for art provenance. His portraits were often set in an oval frame, with a subtitle with the subject's claim to fame. Under that in small letters, he placed his notes about the original oil portrait. Some examples: File:Jacob Dircksz de Graeff, Gravur von Jacobus Houbraken.jpgJ.

A glitch however meant that papers printing in color received the political version while those in black and white received its tamer counterpart.\\"Double Trouble for Syndicated Cartoonist: Alternative text for a gay marriage Bizarro panel fails to reach some newspapers.\\", AP in Los Angeles Times, August 14, 2005. In 2002, Piraro became a vegan. His activism is visible in Bizarro, often incorporating vegan and animal cruelty themes into his cartoons. In an interview, he stated, \\"If you look at my strip over the years, I‚Äôve always had a form of animal sympathy and animal rights.\\" Piraro has also incorporated an entire section devoted to veganism on his website, detailing his reasons for becoming a vegan, and other vegan-related information. In 2007, Piraro designed a limited edition T-shirt for endangeredwear.com to raise money for the Woodstock Farm Animal Sanctuary, a non-profit organization committed to ending the systematic abuse of animals used for food.

Life Edelinck was born in Antwerp, where he received his early training under the engravers Gaspar Huybrechts (1619‚Äì1684) and Cornelius Galle the Younger. He went to Paris in 1666, where he worked with his fellow Fleming Nicolas Pitau the elder. To improve himself further he subsequently studied under Fran√ßois de Poilly, Robert Nanteuil, and Philippe de Champaigne. These masters likewise had soon done all they could to help him onwards, and Edelinck ultimately took the first rank among line engravers. Philippe de Champaigne His excellence was generally acknowledged; and having become known to Louis XIV he was appointed, on the recommendation of Le Brun, teacher at the academy established at the Gobelins manufactory for the training of workers in tapestry. He was also entrusted with the execution of several important works.Britanicca 1911 In 1677 he won admission to the Acad√©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture) with his Portrait of Philippe de Champaigne, engraved after a self- portrait.Grund 2006, vol. 5, p. 65. Work Alexander and Hephaistion visit the family of Darius in their tent after the battle of Issus, engraved by G√©rard Edelinck from a painting by Charles le Brun The work of this great engraver constitutes an epoch in the art. His prints number more than four hundred. Edelinck stands above and apart from his predecessors and contemporaries in that he excelled, not in some one respect, but in all respects, that while one engraver attained excellence in correct form, and another in rendering light and shade, and others in giving color to their prints and the texture of surfaces, he, as supreme master of the burin, possessed and displayed all these separate qualities, in so complete a harmony that the eye is not attracted by any one of them in particular, but rests in the satisfying whole. Edelinck was especially good as an engraver of portraits, and executed prints of many of the most eminent persons of his time. Among these are those of Le Brun, Rigaud, Champaigne, Nanteuil, La Fontaine, Colbert, John Dryden, Descartes, Jean-Baptiste Lully, etc. He died at Paris in 1707. His younger brother Jean, and his son Nicholas, were also engravers. Works Among his most famous works are: *Holy Family, after Raphael *Penitent Magdalene, after Charles le Brun *Alexander at the Tent of Darius, after Le Brun *Combat of Four Knights, after Leonardo da Vinci *Christ surrounded with Angels, after Le Brun *St. Louis praying, after Le Brun *St Charles Borromeo before a crucifix, after Le Brun Notes References * Gr√ºnd, publisher (2006).

During this journey, local press often referred to the Mobro 4000 as the \\"Gar-barge\\". Chartered by entrepreneur Lowell Harrelson and Long Island mob boss Salvatore Avellino, it set sail on March 22 from Islip, New York, escorted by the tugboat Break of Dawn and carrying 3,168 tons of trash headed for a pilot program in Morehead City, North Carolina, to be turned into methane. The barge was docked at Morehead City, until a WRAL-TV news crew, acting on a tip, flew by helicopter to the coast to investigate. Action News 5 Reporter Susan Brozek broke the story on the 6 p.m. news on April 1, 1987, and North Carolina officials began their own investigation, which resulted in an order for the Mobro to move on. The barge then proceeded along the coast looking for another place to offload and continued to meet stiff resistance. The Mexican Navy denied it entrance to their waters. It made it as far south as Belize, again being rejected, before returning to New York. Upon arrival it was met with a temporary restraining order and a heated legal battle preventing it from docking. Eventually, in October, the trash was incinerated in Brooklyn and the resulting ash was buried in a landfill in Islip, where it originated. Legacy At the time, the Mobro 4000 incident was widely cited by environmentalists and the media as emblematic of the solid-waste disposal crisis in the United States due to a shortage of landfill space: almost 3,000 municipal landfills had closed between 1982 and 1987. It triggered much national public discussion about waste disposal, and may have been a factor in increased recycling rates in the late 1980s and after. It was this that caused it to be included in an episode of Penn & Teller: Bullshit! (season 2, episode 5) in which they debunk many recycling myths. According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, the Mobro 4000 incident was caused by a combination of poor decision making by local Islip public officials and short-term difficulties triggered by changing environmental regulations. In popular culture The backstory of the garbage ball in episode 1x08 of Futurama, \\"A Big Piece of Garbage\\", draws directly from this event. Singer Sally Timms included a song about the incident, \\"Junk Barge\\", written by Dave Trumfio, in her 1995 album To the Land of Milk and Honey. A children's book about the incident, Here Comes the Garbage Barge, by Jonah Winter, was published in 2010. In Tully, character Marlo compares her prepartum body to the Mobro 4000. In Don Dellilo's Underworld, protagonist Nick Shay and his coworkers at his Waste Management Company make frequent allusions to the Mobro 4000. In season three of the TV series Wiseguy (1989), there is an episode titled Battle Of The Barge where a waste disposal company has a similar problem with being unable to unload a garbage barge.

He spent the last 12 years of his life in Italy, where he was known as Cornelio Fiammingo. Biography Print of Bernard van Orley, made by Cornelis Cort in the 16th century. Born in Hoorn or Edam, Cort may have been a pupil of Dirck Volckertsz Coornhert in the 1550s in Haarlem. His first known engravings were published in Antwerp around 1553, though it is thought that he remained working in the Northern Netherlands. The publisher was Hieronymous Cock, under whom Cort may have apprenticed as well. A letter of 1567 from Dominicus Lampsonius to the artist Titian described Cock as Cort's master. Plates, which Cort produced for Cock were inscribed with Cort's name only after he left his apprenticeship with Cock. The Battle of Zama by Cornelis Cort Cort moved to Venice and lived in the house of Titian in 1565 and 1566. He produced engravings based on Titian's works. Among these are the well-known copperplates of \\"St Jerome in the Desert\\", the \\"Magdalen\\", \\"Prometheus\\", \\"Diana and Actaeon\\", and \\"Diana and Calisto\\". From Italy he wandered back to the Netherlands, but he returned to Venice soon after 1567, proceeding thence to Bologna and Rome, where he produced engravings from all the great masters of the time. In Rome he founded the well-known school in which, as Bartsch tells us, the simple line of Marcantonio was modified by a brilliant touch of the burin, afterwards imitated and perfected by Agostino Carracci in Italy and Nicolaes de Bruyn in the Netherlands. Before visiting Italy, Cort had been content to copy Michael Coxcie, Frans Floris, Heemskerk, Gillis Mostaert, Bartholomeus Spranger and Stradanus. In Italy he gave circulation to the works of Raphael, Titian, Polidoro da Caravaggio, Baroccio, Giulio Clovio, Muziano and the Zuccari. Cort visited Florence between 1569 and 1571 probably working for the Medici family. He returned to Titian in Venice in 1571-1572. He spent the last year of his life in Rome, where he died. His connection with Cock and Titian is pleasantly illustrated in a letter addressed to the latter by Dominick Lampson of Li√®ge in 1567. Cort is said to have engraved upwards of one hundred and fifty-one plates.

He was a pupil of Jan van Scorel, and adopted his teacher's Italian-influenced style. He spent the years 1532‚Äì6 in Italy. He produced many designs for engravers, and is especially known for his depictions of the Wonders of the World. Biography =Early life= Family of Pieter Jan Foppesz. - painted before Heemskerck left for Italy in 1532. Heemskerck was born in the village of Heemskerk, North Holland, halfway between Alkmaar and Haarlem. He was the son of a farmer called Jacob Willemsz. van Veen. According to his biography by Karel van Mander, he began his artistic training with the painter Cornelius Willemsz in Haarlem, but was recalled to Heemskerk by his father to work on the family farm. However, having contrived an argument with his father he left again, this time for Delft, where he studied under Jan Lucasz, before moving on to Haarlem, where he became a pupil of Jan van Scorel, learning to paint in his teacher's innovative Italian-influenced style.. Translated from a biography in Het Schilder-boeck, Haarlem, 2020 (available as a Dutch online text from the DBNL; a more modern translation is in The Lives of the Netherlandish and German Painters, H. Miedema, ed. 1994-9) Heemskerck then went to lodge at the home of the wealthy curate of the Sint-Bavokerk, Pieter Jan Foppesz (whose name van Mander writes as Pieter Ian Fopsen). They knew each other because Foppesz owned land in Heemskerk. The artist painted him in a now famous family portrait, considered the first of its kind in a long line of Dutch family paintings.retrieved July 2009 Families in beeld, - Frauke K.

Hilversum,2002, Verloren, His other works for Foppesz included two life size figures symbolising the Sun and the Moon on a bedstead, and a picture of Adam and Eve \\"rather smaller but (it is said) after living models\\". His next home was in the house of a goldsmith, Justus Cornelisz, on the edge of Haarlem. Before setting off for Italy on a Grand Tour in 1532, Heemskerck painted a scene of St. Luke painting the Virgin for the altar of St. Luke in the Bavokerk. An inscription, incorporated into a tromp l'oeil label on the painting begins \\"This picture is a remembrance from its painter, Marten Heemskerck; he has here dedicated his labours to St Luke as a proof of regard to his associates in his profession, of which that saint is patron\\". \\"Ter eeren S. Lucas heeft hy't bedreven/Dus ghemeen ghesellen heeft hy mede bedacht.\\" =Italy= He travelled around the whole of northern and central Italy, stopping at Rome, where he had letters of introduction from van Scorel to the influential Dutch cardinal William of Enckenvoirt. It is evident of the facility with which he acquired the rapid execution of a scene- painter that he was selected to collaborate with Antonio da Sangallo the Younger, Battista Franco and Francesco de' Rossi (Il Salviati) on the redecoration of the Porta San Sebastiano at Rome as a triumphal arch (5 April 1536) in honour of Charles V. Giorgio Vasari, who saw the battle-pieces which Heemskerk then produced, said they were well composed and boldly executed. While in Rome where he made numerous drawings of classical sculpture and architecture, many of which survive in two sketchbooks now in the Kupferstichkabinett Berlin. He was to use them as source material throughout the rest of his career. Among these are the Capitoline Brutus, van Heemskerck being the first known artist to make a sketch of this now famous bust. =Later career= On his return to the Netherlands in 1536, he settled back at Haarlem, where he became president of the Haarlem Guild of Saint Luke (in 1540), married twice (his first wife and child died during childbirth), and secured a large and lucrative practice. The alteration in his style, brought about by his experience of Italy was not universally admired. According to van Mander, \\"in the opinion of some of the best judges he had not improved it, except in one particular, that his outline was more graceful than before\\". He painted large altarpieces for his friend, the art maecenas and later catholic martyr of the Protestant Reformation, (also known as Musius). Muys had returned from a period in France to the Netherlands in 1538 and became prior of the St. Agatha cloister in Delft (later became the Prinsenhof).Cornelis Musius in NL Wikipedia This lucrative and high-profile work in Delft earned Heemskerck a commission for an altarpiece in the Nieuwe Kerk (Delft) for their Guild of St. Luke. In 1553 he became curate of the Sint-Bavokerk, where he served for 22 years (until the Protestant reformation). In 1572 he left Haarlem for Amsterdam, to avoid the siege of Haarlem which the Spaniards laid to the place. Engravings He was one of the first Netherlandish artists to make drawings specifically for reproduction by commercial printmakers. He employed a technique incorporating cross-hatching and stippling, intended to aid the engraver. Maarten van Heemskerck, \\"Les ruines de la Casa dei Crescenzi\\" =Wonders of the World= Heemskerck produced designs for a set of engravings, showing eight, rather than the usual seven wonders of the ancient world. His addition to the conventional list was the Colosseum in Rome, which, unlike the others, he showed in ruins, as it was in his own time, with the speculative addition of a giant statue of Jupiter in the centre.Kerrich 1829, p.105 They were engraved by Philip Galle and published in 1572.

He painted a crucifixion for the Riches Claires at Ghent (now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent) in 1543, and an altar-piece for the Drapers' Company at Haarlem, finished in 1546 and now in the gallery of the Hague. They show how Heemskerck studied and repeated the forms which he had seen in the works of Michelangelo and Raphael at Rome, and in the frescoes of Andrea Mantegna and Giulio Romano in Lombardy, but he never forgot his Dutch origin or the models first presented to him by Scorel and Jan Mabuse. In 1550, Heemskerck painted a large, now dismembered triptych, the remains of which are today divided between the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Strasbourg (Adam and Eve/Gideon and the Fleece), and the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen (The Visitation). As late as 1551, he then produced a copy from Raphael's Madonna of Loreto (Frans Hals Museum). In 1552, he painted a view of a bull race inside the Colosseum of Rome (Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille). A Judgment of Momus, dated 1561, in the Gem√§ldegalerie, Berlin, shows that he was well acquainted with anatomy and fond of florid architecture. Two altar-pieces which he finished for churches at Delft in 1551 and 1559, one complete (St. Luke painting the Virgin), the other a fragment, in the museum of Haarlem, a third of 1551 in the Brussels Museum, representing Golgotha, the Crucifixion, the Flight into Egypt, Christ on the Mount, and scenes from the lives of St. Bernard and St. Benedict, are all fairly representative of his style. There is a Crucifixion in the Hermitage Museum of Saint Petersburg, and two Triumphs of Silenus in the gallery of Vienna. Other pieces of varying importance are in the galleries of Rotterdam, Munich, Cassel, Brunswick, Karlsruhe, Mainz, Copenhagen, Strasbourg and Rennes. =Parrots= this first altarpiece before he left Haarlem for Italy in 1532. It was cut down and sawn in two, and has since been rejoined, but is still short. The parrot was at the top. Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts, Rennes). In this painting, the parrot is held by the baby Jesus. In his depiction of Saint Luke painting the Virgin, which Heemskerck painted twice for two painter's guilds, there is some confusion in the literature about a parrot. In both paintings he painted a parrot, but the parrot in a cage has been sawn off the first painting and is no longer visible.Het Schilderboek: Het Leven Van De Doorluchtige Nederlandse En Hoogduitse Schilders. Carel van Mander, with notes, 1995. . Death In Amsterdam he made a will, which has been preserved. It shows that he had lived long enough and prosperously enough to make a fortune. At his death, he left money and land in trust to the orphanage of Haarlem, with interest to be paid yearly to any couple who should be willing to perform the marriage ceremony on the slab of his tomb in the cathedral of Haarlem. It was a superstition in Catholic Holland that a marriage so celebrated would secure the peace of the dead within the tomb. Reputation Heemskerck was widely respected in his own lifetime and was a strong influence on the painters of Haarlem in particular. He is known (along with his teacher Jan van Scorel) for his introduction of Italian art to the Northern Netherlands, especially for his series on the wonders of the world, that were subsequently spread as prints. Karel van Mander devoted six pages to his biography in his Schilder-boeck.

P. Donleavy. The story is set in Dublin, Ireland, in post-war 1947. Upon its publication, it was banned both in Ireland and the United States of America by reason of obscenity. Background Donleavy's friend and fellow writer Brendan Behan was the first person to read the completed manuscript. The book was rejected by numerous publishers, but The Manchester Guardian published some extracts from it, calling the book a \\"comic triumph\\". Subsequently, Behan told Donleavy about Olympia Press, a Paris-based English-language publisher that had produced works by Samuel Beckett, and Donleavy succeeded in getting the book published by them, but was angered when he discovered that it had done so under its pornography imprint. In his 1994 autobiography The History of The Ginger Man, Donleavy wrote, \\"I smashed my fist upon its green cover format, published as it was in the pseudonymous and pornographic Traveller‚Äôs Companion Series, and I declared aloud, 'If it's the last thing I ever do, I will avenge this book.'\\" Donleavy and the owner of Olympia Press, Maurice Girodias, became embroiled in decades of legal cases, The Guardian noting: \\"Twenty years later, the two parties were still suing each other, under the guise of phantom companies ‚Äì Donleavy was 'The Little Someone Corporation' ‚Äì with no end in sight. Girodias had declared himself bankrupt, and was preparing to buy back the title of his beloved Olympia Press at an auction in Paris. Donleavy learned of the sale and sent his wife to France with a large sum in cash. When bidding went over $8,000, Girodias ran out of money. The mysterious woman (as Girodias saw her) made a final bid, and the Olympia Press belonged to Donleavy.\\" Reception The Ginger Man has sold 45 million copies worldwide and has never been out of print. It was named one of the 100 Best Novels of the 20th Century by the Modern Library in 1998. The book was reprinted in 2001, and republished on by Grove Press. In 1958, Norman Podhoretz, the editor of Commentary, noted in The New York Times that, \\"In recent months a large number of remarkably accomplished first novels by Americans have appeared, all of them bearing the usual exclamations of enthusiasm from the publishers on their dust jackets. What is most surprising, some of them ‚Äì notably William Humphrey's Home From the Hill and J. P. Donleavy's The Ginger Man ‚Äì justify the excitement. [‚Ä¶] What really makes The Ginger Man a vital work is the fact that it both reflects and comments dramatically on the absurdities of an age clinging to values in which it simply cannot believe and unable to summon up the courage to find out what its moral convictions really are\\". Writing in The Guardian in 2004, James Campbell judged that, \\"The Ginger Man still reads well today, once one becomes accustomed to its headlong rush of style, its frequent verbless sentences, the switch of tenses and the manic swing between first and third persons as it lunges to catch the protagonist's babbling thoughts [‚Ä¶] In other places, the prose hops along alliteratively, with hints of Joyce and Dylan Thomas. Many chapters end with a snatch of verse, a habit that began in Donleavy's first book and became his signature tune\\". In the 2010 reissue of The Ginger Man, Jay McInerney noted in the introduction that the book \\"has undoubtedly launched thousands of benders, but it has also inspired scores of writers with its vivid and visceral narrative voice and the sheer poetry of its prose\\". Adaptations Donleavy wrote a stage adaptation of The Ginger Man, directed by Philip Wiseman, which opened in London in September 1959, with Richard Harris playing Dangerfield. In October, the play opened in Dublin, also starring Harris, and was closed after three performances, due to the play's offensiveness according to the Dublin critics, and following protests from the Catholic Church. All this is recorded by Donleavy in the 1961 Random House publication of the play with an essay by Donleavy, \\"What They Did in Dublin with The Ginger Man (a play)\\". The BBC produced a 90-minute made-for- television version of the play, directed by Peter Dews, and aired on 23 March 1962 in the United Kingdom. Ann Bell played Marion Dangerfield, Ronald Fraser as Kenneth O'Keefe, Ian Hendry as Sebastian Balfe Dangerfield, and Margaret Tyzack was Miss Frost. (1962) Donleavy asked director George Roy Hill to film the novel (the two of them, along with Gainor Crist, had been at Trinity together), but Hill felt that he would lose perspective because the project would be too close to his heart and his time as a young man at Trinity. In 2005 there was reportedly discussion with actor Johnny Depp about starring in a film based on the novel. Rumors of getting the project started surfaced every year or two since 1998, including Depp traveling to Dublin to work on a script with Donleavy, and Depp enlisting Shane MacGowan for a part, but it never seemed to get going. In 2006 it appeared things were taking shape, with Depp selecting a director, Laurence Dunmore (The Libertine). Apparently, interest waned with the success of Pirates of the Caribbean. Depp returned to Ireland to meet with Donleavy again in the summer of 2008. As recently as June 2009, Donleavy was still hopeful that Depp would start the project in earnest. The book also inspired songs of the same name, the first recorded by Geoff Muldaur, Fritz Richmond, and John Sebastian on the 1964 Elektra The Blues Project (EKL-264). (However, the liner notes for this album indicate that the song was a tribute to Richmond.) A second was written and recorded by Australian singer-songwriter Brian Cadd and was released as the first single from his self-titled debut album, released in October 1972.

Entries include William McGonagall, a notoriously bad poet, and Teruo Nakamura, a soldier of the Imperial Japanese Army who fought for Japan in World War II until 1974. The original edition included an application to become a member of the Not Terribly Good Club of Great Britain; however, this was taken out in later editions because the club received over 20,000 applications and closed in 1979 on the grounds that, \\"Even as failures, we failed\\" (but not before Pile himself had been expelled from it for publishing a bestseller). The American version of the book was misprinted by the publishers, who left out half the introduction. As a consequence, later versions of the book came out with an erratum slip longer than the entire introduction. In his second book The Return of Heroic Failures, published in 1988, Stephen Pile reports that Taiwanese pirates were not aware of this and did not include the erratum slip. The second book was published in the USA under the title Cannibals in the Cafeteria. The second book came out in Greece in 1992 although the first one had never been published there. In fact, this second book was named \\"Œó Œ§ŒïŒßŒùŒó Œ§ŒóŒ£ ŒëŒ†ŒüŒ§Œ•ŒßŒôŒëŒ£ No1\\" (The Art of Failure No. 1). A small erratum slip in the book itself explains that it was a mistake. In an interview with English Radio DJ Andrew Marshall, Pile said, \\"The Book is one of the least successful books ever issued in the USA, I don't think it has reached double figures there as yet and long may that remain the case.\\" In 1999 Penguin made the decision to re-publish the book as part of their \\"Penguin Readers\\" series to encourage reading from a young age.

He was one of the first painters of Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting to visit Italy and Rome, which he did in 1508‚Äì09, and a leader of the style known as Romanism, which brought elements of Italian Renaissance painting to the north, sometimes with a rather awkward effect. He achieved fame across at least northern Europe, and painted religious subjects, including large altarpieces, but also portraits and mythological subjects, including some nudity. From at least 1508 he was apparently continuously employed, or at least retained, by quasi-royal patrons, mostly members of the extended Habsburg family, heirs to the Valois Duchy of Burgundy. These were Philip of Burgundy, Adolf of Burgundy, Christian II of Denmark when in exile, and Menc√≠a de Mendoza, Countess of Nassau, third wife of Henry III of Nassau- Breda.Campbell, 1‚Äì3 He was a contemporary of Albrecht D√ºrer and the rather younger Lucas van Leyden, whom he knew, but he has tended to be less highly regarded in modern times than they were. Unlike them, he was not a printmaker, though his surviving drawings are very fine, and are preferred by some to his paintings.Cummings, Laura, Jan Gossaert's Renaissance Review in The Guardian of the National Gallery exhibition, London and Washington, 2011 Biography Jan Gossaert-self portrait (1515‚Äì1520). Collection of the Currier Museum of Art, Manchester, New Hampshire His name was in fact \\"Jan Gossart\\", and he was so known in his lifetime; the Dutch version \\"Gossaert\\" crept into later sources, despite Gossart's first language being French.Campbell, 1 Little is known of his early life. One of his earliest biographers, Karel van Mander, claimed he was from a small town in Artois or Henegouwen (County of Hainaut) called Maubeuge or Maubuse. Mabuse in Karel van Mander's Schilderboeck, 1604, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature Other scholars have determined he was the son of a bookbinder who received his training at Maubeuge Abbey, while the RKD mentions there is evidence to support a claim that he was born in Duurstede Castle.32898 artist record for Jan Gossaert in RKD He is registered in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1503. In 1508-9 he travelled to Rome, either in the company of, or later sent by, Philip of Burgundy, an illegitimate son of Duke Philip the Good, who was sent as ambassador to Pope Julius II by Philip the Handsome. Philip's party, very likely including Gossaert, left the Netherlands in October 1508, arrived in Rome on 14 January 1509, and was back at The Hague by 28 June 1509. Although the details are unclear, it seems that Gossaert remained in Philip's employment until he died in 1524, by then Bishop of Utrecht. However, throughout this time he was able to work for other patrons, mostly friends of Philip.Campbell, 2 In 1509‚Äì17 Gossaert was registered as a resident of Middelburg. According to Van Mander he was one of the first Flemish artists to bring back the Italian manner of painting with much nudity in historical allegories. From 1517 to 1524 he is registered at Duurstede Castle where according to the RKD, he had Jan van Scorel as pupil. From 1524 onwards he returned to Middelburg as court painter to Adolf of Burgundy, another Habsburg relative. Jan Mertens the Younger was another pupil. He was a contemporary of Lucas van Leyden, and was influenced by artists who came before him, such as Rogier van der Weyden, the great master of Tournai and Brussels and, like him, his compositions were usually framed in architectural backgrounds. Works The Adoration of the Kings, formerly at Castle Howard, now at the National Gallery Gossaert shows Antwerp influence in the large altar-pieces previously located at Castle Howard and Scawby. The bright and decided contrasts of pigment in colored reliefs are like Hans Memling, and the cornered and packed drapery are like Van der Weyden, while the bold but Socratic cast of face are like the works of Quentin Matsys. At Scawby he illustrates the legend of the count of Toulouse, who parted with his worldly goods to assume the frock of a hermit. His altarpiece of the Descent from the Cross with heavy double doors in Middelburg was admired by Albrecht D√ºrer before the church itself was hit by lightning. This is possibly the work now in the Hermitage,56051 in the RKD though Van Mander stated the lightning destroyed it and describes another Descent of the Cross in the possession of Mr. Magnus of Delft in 1604. Jean Carondelet At Castle Howard, the Earl of Carlisle had obtained The Adoration of the Kings previously created for the Grandmontines, which throws together some thirty figures on an architectural background, varied in detail, massive in shape and fanciful in ornament. This painting is now on display at the National Gallery, which bought it in 1911. Gossaert surprises the viewer with pompous costume and flaring contrasts of tone. His figures, like pieces on a chess-board, are often rigid and conventional. The landscape which shows through the colonnades is adorned with towers and steeples in the minute fashion of Van der Weyden. After a residence of a few years at Antwerp, Gossaert took service with Philip of Burgundy, bastard of Philip the Good, at that time lord of Somerdyk and admiral of Zeeland. One of his pictures had already become celebrated: a Descent from the Cross (50 figures), on the high altar of Tongerlo Abbey. Philip of Burgundy ordered Gossaert to execute a replica for the church of Middelburg, and the value which was then set on the picture is apparent from the fact that D√ºrer came expressly to Middelburg (1521) to see it. In 1568 the altarpiece perished by fire. In 1508 Gossaert accompanied Philip of Burgundy on his Italian mission to the pope, and by this accident an important revolution was effected in the art of the Netherlands. Gossaert appears to have chiefly studied in Italy the cold and polished works of the Leonardesques. He not only brought home a new style, but he also introduced the fashion of travelling to Italy; and from that time till the age of Rubens and Van Dyck it was considered proper that all Flemish painters should visit the peninsula. The Flemings grafted Italian mannerisms on their own stock, and the cross turned out so unfortunately that for a century Flemish art lost all trace of originality. In the summer of 1509 Philip returned to the Netherlands, and, retiring to his seat of Suytburg in Zeeland, surrendered himself to the pleasures of planning decorations for his castle and ordering pictures of Gossaert and Jacopo de' Barbari. Being in constant communication with the court of Margaret of Austria at Mechelen, he gave the artists in his employ fair chances of promotion. Barbari was made court painter to the regent, whilst Gossaert received less important commissions. Records prove that Gossaert painted a (posthumous) portrait of Eleanor of Portugal, and other small pieces, for Charles V in 1516. Portrait of Hendrik III, Count of Nassau-Breda Three children of Christian II of Denmark 1526 But his only signed pictures of this period are the Neptune and Amphitrite of 1516 at Berlin, and the Madonna, with a portrait of Jean Carondelet of 1517, at the Louvre, both of which suggest that Vasari only spoke by hearsay of the progress made by Gossaert in the true method of producing pictures full of mythological nude figures and poesies. It is difficult to find anything more coarse or misshapen than the Amphitrite, unless it is the grotesque and ungainly drayman who figures for Neptune. In later forms of the same subject‚Äîthe Adam and Eve at Hampton Court, or its feebler replica at Berlin and Venus and Amor (Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels)‚Äîthere is more nudity, combined with realism of the commonest type. Happily, Gossaert was capable of higher efforts. His St Luke painting the portrait of the Virgin in Sanct Veit at Prague, a variety of the same subject in the Belvedere at Vienna, the Madonna of the Baring collection in London, or the numerous repetitions of Christ and the scoffers (Ghent and Antwerp), all prove that travel had left many of Gossaert's fundamental peculiarities unaltered. His figures still retain the character of stone; his architecture is as rich and varied, his tones are as strong as ever. But bright contrasts of gaudy tints are replaced by soberer greys; and a cold haze, the sfumato of the Milanese, pervades the surfaces. It is but seldom that these features fail to obtrude. When they least show, the master displays a brilliant palette combined with smooth surface and incisive outlines. In this form the Madonnas of Munich and Vienna (1527), the likeness of a girl weighing gold pieces (Berlin), and the portraits of the children of the king of Denmark at Hampton Court, are fair specimens of his skill. As early as 1523, when Christian II of Denmark came to the Netherlands, he asked Gossaert to paint the likenesses of his dwarfs. In 1528 he requested the artist to furnish to Jean de Hare the design for his queen Isabellas tomb in the abbey of St Pierre near Ghent. It was no doubt at this time that Gossaert completed the portraits of John, Dorothy and Christine, children of Christian II, which came into the collection of Henry VIII. No doubt, also, these portraits are identical with those of three children at Hampton Court, which were long known and often copied as likenesses of Prince Arthur, Prince Henry and Princess Margaret of England. One of the copies at Wilton, inscribed with the forged name of Hans Holbein, ye father, and the false date of 1495, has often been cited as a proof that Gossaert came to England in the reign of Henry VII; but the statement rests on no foundation whatever. At the period when these portraits were executed Gossaert lived at Middelburg. But he dwelt at intervals elsewhere. When Philip of Burgundy became bishop of Utrecht, and settled at Duurstede Castle, in 1517, he was accompanied by Gossaert, who helped to decorate the new palace of his master. At Philip's death, in 1524, Gossaert designed and erected his tomb in the church of Wijk bij Duurstede. He finally retired to Middelburg, where he took service with Philip's brother, Adolph, lord of Veeren. The Holy Family, about 1507‚Äì1508 Carel van Mander's biography accuses Gossaert of an unruly life; yet it describes the solid education he must have had to learn his trade so well. It also describes the splendid appearance of Gossaert, dressed in gold brocade, as he accompanied Lucas van Leyden on a pleasure trip to Ghent, Mechelen and Antwerp in 1527. Lucas van Leyden in Karel van Mander's Schilderboeck, 1604, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature The works of Gossaert are those of a hardworking and patient artist; the number of his still extant pictures practically demonstrates that he was not a debauchee. The marriage of his daughter with the painter Henry van der Heyden of Leuven proves that he had a home, and did not live habitually in taverns. His death at Antwerp is recorded in the portrait engraved by Jerome Cock.

Beginnings The first mX was published in Melbourne on 6 February 2001,More Details on Free Newspapers Newsrail May 2001 page 139 hoping to capitalise on the Metro format, popular in Europe. The paper contained lighter news and sports articles, often containing strange stories and facts from around the world (under the headings \\"Nice One\\" and, \\"What The?\\"). The newspaper's approach was a much greater focus on entertainment than news than broadsheet newspapers, or even other tabloids. Melbourne Express, published by rival Fairfax Media, was this paper's competitor. Initially it used the same format, although it was released in the mornings rather than the afternoon. It began publication the day before mX, but was soon overtaken due to mX's much broader use of colour, its greater availability, and its lighter tone. In addition, mX had no explanation at its launch, allowing readers to assume that it stood for \\"Melbourne Express\\" and that it was the paper known by that name. Melbourne Express ceased publication on 7 September 2001. The broad success of mX contributed to reduced sales of the afternoon edition of News Corporation stablemate the Herald Sun, its last edition being published on 21 December 2001. Sydney and Brisbane editions A person hands out copies of mX at St James railway station, Sydney Following the success of mX in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane editions were launched. On 4 July 2005, mX launched a Sydney edition. Sydney City Council was considering a tender to lease Sydney footpaths to News Corporation for $362,000 annually, and charge other free daily newspaper a similar fee if they use the same location more than 40 times a year. Other newspapers, that are distributed by sellers on streets, are concerned about the possibility that they may be required to also pay such fees. The Brisbane edition of mX was launched on 5 March 2007, with an expected distribution of 40,000 copies per day.mX spreads to Brisbane, mX (Melbourne) 5 March 2007, p. 4. Format and content Being a commuter newspaper, mX was much thinner than other daily newspapers. Central themes of most articles included U.S. celebrity gossip, new product lines, controversial events, rumours, celebrity trivia, and readers' gripes, amongst other attention-grabbing stories. Large photographs often appeared without any related story, only a caption describing their contents; conversely, news stories were rarely accompanied by photographs. Small, large, and full page advertisements were also a major contributor to the paper's overall make-up. The newspaper launched an app in 2013. Sections *News ‚Äì Short items of \\"legitimate\\" news such as national and state politics, included the next day's weather forecast. Started on page 2. *Juice ‚Äì Celebrity gossip. Located on pages 4 and 5. *Sport ‚Äì Located on the final two or three pages. *Brainwave ‚Äì The puzzles page, including a crossword, Sudoku and various (Mumma needed) other word games. Also included a horoscope under the heading of \\"Should I get out of bed tomorrow?\\" *Talk ‚Äì Essentially Letters to the Editor, although most letters were very short, having been sent via SMS. It was divided into several sections: **Vent Your Spleen ‚Äì Devoted to readers' SMSed complaints (often about public transport services), comments and thoughts. **Overheard ‚Äì Devoted to humorous or bizarre conversations overheard and sent in by readers. **Here's Looking At You ‚Äì In which readers wrote messages to people on public transport to whom they are attracted, in the hope that they will reply and arrange a date, or just to anonymously compliment them. Originally such messages appeared in the general \\"Vent Your Spleen\\" section, but the practice became so popular that it was separated into its own section. \\"Here's looking at all of you\\" was the page-filling title page when the paper announced on 29 May 2015 its closure to the readers.\\"Countdown on as mX thanks readers\\", The Newspaper Works, 29 May 2015 **Lost in Love ‚Äì Readers' responses to a request from another reader for relationship advice, and an invitation to send replies to the next day's question. **My Platform ‚Äì A vox pop in which three people on the street gave a short response to a question. This section has been dropped. *Flicks ‚Äì That night's movie listings. A movie review used to feature in the middle of every flicks page but that was dropped in 2011 due to the space being needed for session time listings. *The Box ‚Äì Reviews of television programs screening that night. *Program ‚Äì That night's primetime (6:00pm ‚Äì midnight) television listing.

This decision was also based on the capabilities of publishing equipment and whether binding systems were installed at the production facilities. =Theming= Occasionally the mX masthead was modified to capitalise on major events, such as a tennis ball and racquet during the Australian Open, and love hearts and using rose scented ink during Valentine's Day. On the day of the Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the x was changed to a Union Jack and many pages said \\"The royal wedding\\" other pages said \\"Not the wedding\\". In the lead-up to both the 2007 federal election and 2010 federal election, the front page of each issue bore a \\"disclaimer\\" warning of the number of election stories (if any) contained within. *St Patrick's Day editions had the blue captions replaced with green, and Irish themed stories fill the \\"Did You Know\\" and \\"What The?\\" sections. *Easter editions did not change colour; however, the \\"Did You Know\\" and \\"What The?\\" sections related to modern Easter stories (Such as the world's largest easter egg). Closure The final edition, published on 12 June 2015 On 28 May 2015, News Corp announced that the newspaper was closing down. The final edition was printed on 12 June 2015, and the corresponding mobile app was also closed down.

It is a feminist and anti-colonial response to Charlotte Bront√´'s novel Jane Eyre (1847), describing the background to Mr. Rochester's marriage from the point-of-view of his mad wife Antoinette Cosway, a Creole heiress. Antoinette Cosway is Rhys' version of Bront√´'s devilish \\"madwoman in the attic\\". Antoinette's story is told from the time of her youth in Jamaica, to her unhappy marriage to a certain unnamed English gentleman, who renames her Bertha, declares her mad, takes her to England, and isolates her away from the rest of the world in his mansion. Antoinette is caught in an oppressive patriarchal society in which she fully belongs neither to Europe nor to Jamaica. Wide Sargasso Sea explores the power of relationships between men and women and develops postcolonial themes, such as racism, displacement, and assimilation. Rhys lived in obscurity after her previous work, Good Morning, Midnight, was published in 1939. She had published other novels between these works, but Wide Sargasso Sea caused a revival of interest in Rhys and her work and was her most commercially successful novel. Plot The novel, initially set in Jamaica, opens a short while after the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 ended slavery in the British Empire on 1 August 1834.\\"Emancipation\\", The Black Presence, National Archive. The protagonist Antoinette relates the story of her life from childhood to her arranged marriage to an unnamed Englishman. The novel is in three parts: Part One takes place in Coulibri, a sugar plantation in Jamaica, and is narrated by Antoinette as a child. Formerly wealthy, since the abolition of slavery, the estate has become derelict and her family has been plunged into poverty. Antoinette's mother, Annette, must remarry to wealthy Englishman Mr. Mason, who is hoping to exploit his new wife's situation. Angry at the returning prosperity of their oppressors, freed slaves living in Coulibri burn down Annette's house, killing Antoinette's mentally disabled younger brother, Pierre. As Annette had been struggling with her mental health up until this point, the grief of losing her son weakens her sanity. Mr. Mason sends her to live with a couple who torment her until she dies, and Antoinette does not see her again. Part Two alternates between the points of view of Antoinette and her husband during their honeymoon excursion to Granbois, Dominica. Likely catalysts for Antoinette's downfall are the mutual suspicions that develop between the couple, and the machinations of Daniel, who claims he is Antoinette's illegitimate half-brother; he impugns Antoinette's reputation and mental state and demands money to keep quiet. Antoinette's old nurse Christophine openly distrusts the Englishman. His apparent belief in the stories about Antoinette's family and past aggravate the situation; her husband is unfaithful and emotionally abusive. He begins to call her Bertha rather than her real name and flaunts his affairs in front of her to cause her pain. Antoinette's increased sense of paranoia and the bitter disappointment of her failing marriage unbalance her already precarious mental and emotional state. She flees to the house of Christophine, the servant woman who raised her. Antoinette pleads with Christophine for an obeah potion to attempt to reignite her husband's love, which Christophine reluctantly gives her. Antoinette returns home but the love potion acts like a poison on her husband. Subsequently he refuses Christophine's offer of help for his wife and takes her to England. Part Three is the shortest part of the novel; it is from the perspective of Antoinette, renamed by her husband as Bertha. She is largely confined to \\"the attic\\" of Thornfield Hall, the mansion she calls the \\"Great House\\". The story traces her relationship with Grace Poole, the servant who is tasked with guarding her, as well as her disintegrating life with the Englishman, as he hides her from the world. He makes empty promises to come to her more but sees less of her. He ventures away to pursue relationships with other womenand eventually with the young governess. Antoinette is clearly mad and has little understanding of how much time she has been confined. She fixates on options of freedom including her stepbrother Richard who, however, will not interfere with her husband, so she attacks him with a stolen knife. Expressing her thoughts in stream of consciousness, Antoinette dreams of flames engulfing the house and her freedom from the life she has there, and believes it is her destiny to fulfill the vision. Waking from her dream she escapes her room, and sets the fire. Major themes Since the late 20th century, critics have considered Wide Sargasso Sea as a postcolonial response to Jane Eyre. Rhys uses multiple voices (Antoinette's, her husband's, and Grace Poole's) to tell the story, and intertwines her novel's plot with that of Jane Eyre. In addition, Rhys makes a postcolonial argument when she ties Antoinette's husband's eventual rejection of Antoinette to her Creole heritage (a rejection shown to be critical to Antoinette's descent into madness). The novel is also considered a feminist work, as it deals with unequal power between men and women, particularly in marriage. =Race= Antoinette and her family had been slave owners up until the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 and subsequently lost their wealth. They are called \\"white nigger\\" by the Island's negroes because of their poverty and are openly despised. Rochester, as an Englishman, looks down on Antoinette because she is a Creole. Antoinette is not English and yet her family history reflects her as a white woman. Lee Erwin describes this paradox through the scene in which Antoinette's first house is burned down and she runs to Tia, a black girl her own age, to \\"be like her\\". Antoinette is rebuffed by violence from Tia, leading to her seeing Tia \\"as if I saw myself. Like in a looking glass\\". Erwin argues that \\"even as she claims to be seeing \\"herself,\\" she is simultaneously seeing \\"the other\\", that which only defines the self by its separation from it, in this case literally by means of a cut. History here, in the person of a former slave's daughter, is figured as refusing Antoinette\\", the daughter of a slave owner. =Colonialism= In Wide Sargasso Sea, Rhys draws attention to colonialism and the slave trade by which Antoinette's ancestors had made their fortune. The novel does not shy away from uncomfortable truths about British history that had been neglected in Bront√´'s narrative. Trevor Hope remarks that the \\"triumphant conflagration of Thornfield Hall in Wide Sargasso Sea may at one level mark a vengeful attack upon the earlier textual structure\\". The destruction of Thornfield Hall occurs in both novels; however, Rhys epitomises the fire as a liberating experience for Antoinette. If Thornfield Hall represents domestic ideas of Britishness, then Hope suggests Wide Sargasso Sea is \\"taking residence inside the textual domicile of empire in order to bring about its disintegration or even, indeed, its conflagration.\\" Publication and reception Rhys' editor Diana Athill discusses the events surrounding the publication of the book in her memoir. The book came out of a friendship between Rhys and Selma Vaz Dias who encouraged her to start writing again. At the time, Rhys was living in a shack made of corrugated iron and tar paper in a slum neighborhood of Cheriton Fitzpaine. The book was virtually completed in November 1964 when Rhys, who was 74 years old and complained of the cold and rain in her shack, suffered a heart attack. Athill cared for Rhys in the hospital for two years, keeping a promise not to publish the book until Rhys was well enough to compile the manuscript and add a few final lines. The income from the book provided enough money for Rhys to improve her living conditions. On 5 November 2019, BBC News listed Wide Sargasso Sea on its list of the 100 most influential novels. =Awards and nominations= *Winner of the WH Smith Literary Award in 1967, which brought Rhys to public attention after decades of obscurity. *Named by Time as one of the '100 best English- language novels since 1923'. *Rated number 94 on the list of Modern Library's 100 Best Novels *Winner of Cheltenham Booker Prize 2006 for year 1966\\"Book awards: Cheltenham Booker Prize\\", Library Thing.

Belgrave House The old Belgrave Village, containing the Belgrave Conservation Area, including Belgrave Hall, the 12th- century St Peter's Church and The Talbot Arms, is to the west of Loughborough Road. Geography Belgrave is bounded by the suburb of Rushey Mead to the north and the villages of Birstall, Spinney Hills, and North Evington to the south-east, Northfields to the east, St Matthew's and Leicester City Centre to the south and Beaumont Leys and Stocking Farm to the west. It is located just north of the centre of Leicester, in the eastern part of the city. The old village part of Belgrave is close to the county border, which is located on the other side of the Red Hill Circle. Etymology The settlement was named in the Domesday Book as Merdegrave (from Old English mear√∞ 'marten' + grƒÅf 'grove'). However, after the Norman Conquest the merde, which means excrement in French, was changed to bel. History One of the earliest mentions of this place is in the Domesday book where it is listed amongst the lands given to Hugh de GrandmesnilDomesday Book: A Complete Transliteration. London: Penguin, 2003. p. 653 by the King. The land consisted of a mill, of meadow and land for 6 ploughs. The name was used for the large 19th-century terraced developments along the A607 (Belgrave Road and then Melton Road). This area now has a large, vibrant Asian community featuring the \\"Golden Mile\\", a stretch of road a mile long named that due to its particularly high concentration of jewellery shops. The Asian community based in and around Belgrave and Melton Road have been residents since the early 1970s. The Belgrave Hall area is a conservation area. Belgrave is home to Belgrave Hall & Gardens. Belgrave Hall (1709) is a Grade II* listed building in a plain classical style. The Hall is in the midst of two acres of serene walled gardens that are open to the public during special events. It has changed hands many times but the owners have always played a major role in the economic, social and charitable life of the community. St Peter's Church is the oldest building in the local conservation area, parts of which date from the twelfth century. Archaeologists believe there may be an earlier Saxon church beneath the present structure. The Talbot Inn has origins in the 14th century, when it was a popular stop providing bed and board to those who travelled through Leicester along Loughborough Road. Folk rhyme about a giant called Bell who boasted that he could reach Leicester in three leaps, mentioning Belgrave, the city suburb in this direction and mentioning Wanlip, a nearby village as Onelep, a pun on \\"One Leap\\".

Urfe becomes embroiled in the psychological illusions of a master trickster, which become increasingly dark and serious. Considered an example of metafiction, it was the first novel written by Fowles, but the third he published. In 1977 he published a revised edition. In 1999 The Magus was ranked on both lists of Modern Library 100 Best Novels, reaching number 93 on the editors' list, and 71 on the readers' list. In 2003, the novel was listed at number 67 on the BBC's survey The Big Read. Background The Magus was the first novel John Fowles wrote, but his third to be published, after The Collector (1963) and The Aristos (1964). He started writing it in the 1950s, under the original title of The Godgame. He based it partly on his experiences on the Greek island of Spetses, where he taught English for two years at the Anargyrios School. He worked on it for twelve years before its publication in 1965. Despite gaining critical and commercial success, he continued to rework it, publishing a final revision in 1977. Plot summary The story reflects the perspective of Nicholas Urfe, a young Oxford graduate and aspiring poet. After graduation, he briefly works as a teacher at a small school, but becomes bored and decides to leave England. While looking for another job, Nicholas takes up with Alison Kelly, an Australian girl he met at a party in London. He still accepts a post teaching English at the Lord Byron School on the Greek island of Phraxos. After beginning his new post, he becomes bored, depressed, disillusioned, and overwhelmed by the Mediterranean island; Nicholas struggles with loneliness and contemplates suicide. While habitually wandering around the island, he stumbles upon an estate and soon meets its owner, Maurice Conchis, a wealthy Greek recluse. They develop a sort of friendship, and Conchis slowly reveals that he may have collaborated with the Nazis during World War II. Nicholas is gradually drawn into Conchis's psychological games, his paradoxical views on life, his mysterious persona, and his eccentric masques. At first, Nicholas takes these posturings of Conchis, what the novel terms the \\"godgame\\", to be a joke, but they grow more elaborate and intense. Nicholas loses his ability to determine what is real and what is artifice. Against his will and knowledge, he becomes a performer in the godgame. Eventually, Nicholas realises that the re-enactments of the Nazi occupation, the absurd playlets after Sade, and the obscene parodies of Greek myths are about his life, not Conchis's life. Characters =Main= * Nicholas Urfe ‚Äì the protagonist, a 26 year-old Englishman who goes to Greece to teach English and one day stumbles upon 'the waiting room' * Alison Kelly ‚Äì Nicholas' recent Australian girlfriend, whom he abandons to go to Greece * Maurice Conchis ‚Äì a wealthy intellectual who is a main player in the masques * Lily Montgomery / Julie Holmes / Vanessa Maxwell ‚Äì a young woman who is involved in the masques and with whom Nicholas falls in love =Other= * Joe ‚Äì a young black gypsy, involved in the masques * Maria ‚Äì Conchis's maid * Demetriades ‚Äì a fellow teacher at the school * Lily de Seitas (older) ‚Äì Lily's mother * Rose de Seitas ‚Äì Lily's identical twin sister * Benji de Seitas ‚Äì the younger brother of the Seitas twins * Kemp ‚Äì an unmarried woman who rents Nicholas a room in London * Jojo ‚Äì a young girl whom Nicholas pays to accompany him = Story characters = * de Deukans * Gustav Nygaard * Henrik Nygaard * Anton * Wimmel Ending The book ends indeterminately. Fowles received many letters from readers wanting to know which of the two apparently possible outcomes occur. He refused to answer the question conclusively, however, sometimes changing his answer to suit the inquirer. The novel ends quoting the refrain of the Pervigilium Veneris, an anonymous work of fourth- century Latin poetry, which has been taken as indicating the possible preferred resolution of the ending's ambiguity. Literary precedents John Fowles wrote an article about his experiences in the island of Spetses and their influence on the book. He acknowledged some literary works as influences in his foreword to the 1977 revised edition of The Magus, including Alain- Fournier's Le Grand Meaulnes, for showing a secret hidden world to be explored, and Richard Jefferies's Bevis (1882), for projecting a very different world. In the revised edition, Fowles referred to a \\"Miss Havisham\\", a likely reference to the character Miss Havisham in Charles Dickens's Great Expectations (1861). Critical reception * \\"A major work of mounting tensions in which the human mind is the guinea-pig ... Mr. Fowles has taken a big swing at a difficult subject and his hits ... are on the bull's eye\\" (Sunday Telegraph) * \\"A deliciously toothsome celebration of wanton story- telling ... Before one quite realises what is happening, one finds oneself no less avid for meanings and no less starving amid a plethora of clues than is Nicholas himself\\" (Sunday Times) * \\"A splendidly sustained piece of mystification ... such as could otherwise only have been devised by a literary team fielding the Marquis de Sade, Arthur Edward Waite, Sir James Frazer, Gurdjieff, Madame Blavatsky, C.G. Jung, Aleister Crowley, and Franz Kafka\\" (Financial Times) * The novel was featured on the Modern Library List of Best 20th-Century Novels: It ranked as No. 71 on the Readers' List and No. 93 on the Critics' List of the top 100 novels. Representation in other media In Jasper Fforde's comic detective novel The Well of Lost Plots (part of the Thursday Next series), The Magus wins the \\"Most Incomprehensible Plot\\" Award at the annual \\"Bookie\\" Awards, the awards programme that characters in literature give one another. Film adaptation The novel was adapted for film with a screenplay by Fowles, directed by Guy Green, and released in 1968. It starred Michael Caine as Nicholas Urfe, Anthony Quinn as Maurice Conchis, Anna Karina as Alison, Candice Bergen as Lily / Julie, and Julian Glover as Anton. It was filmed on the island of Majorca. The adaptation generally was considered a failure as film. Caine said that it was one of the worst films he had been involved because no one knew what it was about. Despite the critical failure, the film was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Cinematography.

It was dramatized for Broadway by Jack Kirkland in 1933, and ran for eight years. A 1941 film version, deliberately played mainly for laughs, was directed by John Ford, and the storyline was considerably altered. The novel was included in Life magazine's list of the 100 outstanding books of 1924‚Äì1944.Canby, Henry Seidel. \\"The 100 Outstanding Books of 1924‚Äì1944\\". Life, 14 August 1944. Chosen in collaboration with the magazine's editors. Plot introduction Tobacco Road is set in rural Georgia, several miles outside Augusta during the worst years of the Great Depression. It depicts a family of poor white tenant farmers, the Lesters, as some of the many small Southern cotton farmers made redundant by the industrialization of production and the migration into cities. The main character of the novel is Jeeter Lester, an ignorant and sinful man who is redeemed by his love of the land and his faith in the fertility and promise of the soil. Plot summary Lov Bensey, a friend of the Lesters, walks to his home at the train yard coal chute. He has walked seven and a half miles to get a sack of winter turnips for 50 cents, which is half of his daily wage. On his way home, he stops by the Lesters to talk to Jeeter about Jeeter's 12-year-old daughter Pearl, to whom Lov is married. While Lov is talking to Jeeter, the book introduces the reader to 16-year-old Dude, the youngest of the Lester boys; Ada, Jeeter‚Äôs wife; Grandma Lester; and Ellie May, an 18-year-old girl with a grotesque cleft lip. The entire family, acting in complete desperation, works to steal the turnips from Lov, who then becomes nauseated by the sight and leaves for home. At this point, the preacher Bessie enters the scene. Sister Bessie Rice, like Ellie May, also has a deformity of the face. Bessie‚Äôs nose contains no bone, and so when looking straight at her face one can see straight into her nostrils, like a pig. Despite this, Jeeter is still attracted to her. She does some preaching and praying for everyone‚Äôs sins, and then proposes marriage to Dude. However, Dude is more interested in her offer of letting him drive the new automobile that she anticipates purchasing than in actually marrying her. Bessie then goes home to her hovel to ask God whether or not she and Dude should get married. Jeeter has lived on the same plot of land since he was born, and even though his standard of living continues to decline until he and his family begin to starve, Jeeter stubbornly refuses to move to the city to make a better life for himself by working in a cotton mill. Such a life, he insists, would be impossible for him to live. Alongside Jeeter‚Äôs preoccupation with farming the land is his preoccupation with his own imminent death. Ada as well is fixated on her death, but their morbidity does not take the form of lamentation or self-pity. Ada's main concern is that she not be buried in her tattered, old, out-of- style calico dress, and Jeeter's main concern is that his body not be left in the old corn storage shed where it might be eaten by rats. He has had a terrible phobia of rats ever since he saw his dead father‚Äôs face half-eaten by a rat the day of his funeral. Neither of these two characters have any doubts that they are going to die sometime soon, and it is not their present life but their lifeless bodies which they care about most. Possibly they realize that their way of life is already dead; thus their primary concern becomes not the preservation of that life but its appearance during burial. When Sister Bessie returns the next day to the Lester house, she exclaims that God has given her his approval for the marriage between Dude and herself. The two then start the long walk to Fuller in order to purchase a new Ford for the purpose of traveling around the country and preaching. Once they are in the auto showroom, the salesmen take advantage of Bessie's rural na√Øvet√© to pull off a quick and profitable sale, while at the same time constantly making fun of her deformed nose. Later, Dude and Bessie go off to get their marriage certificate and are questioned by the county official, who reprimands Bessie for attempting to marry a boy of 16 years. (Bessie claims she is only 31 years old to the Lesters, but admits to 39 years at the registrar's office.) Finally, they get the marriage license, and the anxious Dude gets to drive the automobile again. Dude incessantly sounds the car horn whenever he gets behind the steering wheel to drive off somewhere. Over the course of the next two days, the automobile slowly gets wrecked more and more. First there is an accident with a wagon in which they end up killing the negro driver, and then Dude drives into a stump. The seats get torn by Jeeter‚Äôs blackjack wood, which he attempts to sell in the city of Augusta. The engine irreparably becomes damaged by being run without enough oil. On top of this, they sell the spare tire and wheel for three dollars in order to pay for gasoline, food, and a night at a disreputable hotel where Bessie willingly gets prostituted from room to room by the manager. Some days later Bessie refuses to let Jeeter ride in her car anymore, which makes him upset to the point of kicking her off the land. When she physically attacks him, Ada and Jeeter proceed to beat Bessie and poke her with sticks until she and Dude take off in the car. While fleeing from Ada and Jeeter‚Äôs onslaught, Dude backs the Ford right over Grandma Lester, who then lies with her face mashed into the sand, near dead. Lov runs down to see Jeeter, and asks him if he knows what happened to Pearl, who had run away to Augusta to be free of Lov and the bleak and desperate country life surrounding her. Jeeter notes that more than a few of his daughters have run away to the city. After this discussion about the girls running away, the two notice Grandma‚Äôs corpse and drag her into the field to dig her grave and bury her. Lov departs and Caldwell reflects on Jeeter's position as a tenant farmer in the South. Even though Jeeter, like so many others around him, had the urge to plant a crop during this time of the year, there was nothing he could do. His landlord was an absentee who abandoned Jeeter and the rest of those who had lived on his land and given him shares of their crop in exchange for credit for seeds and fertilizer. The stores in the city would not grant any more credit to Jeeter or any of the other farmers because it was too risky and there were too many asking for it. Jeeter sets a fire to burn off broom sedge and hopes somehow to find enough credit to farm his land that spring. As Jeeter and Ada sleep, sparks from the fire ignite the shingles of their house, which burns to the ground, killing them in their sleep. As the novel closes, Dude makes his first mention of working: He voices the same thoughts of plowing the Lester land that Jeeter had expressed throughout the story, indicating that the vicious cycle in which poor Southern farmers such as the Lesters are trapped continues.

The Hallucinogen PMA: Dancing With Death Unlike other similar drugs of this family, PMA does not produce stimulant, euphoriant, or entactogen effects, and behaves more like an antidepressant in comparison, though it does have some psychedelic properties. PMA has been found in tablets touted as MDMA (ecstasy) although its effects are markedly different compared to those of MDMA. The consequences of such deception have often included hospitalization and death for unwitting users. PMA is commonly synthesized from anethole, the flavor compound of anise and fennel, mainly because the starting material for MDMA, safrole, has become less available due to law enforcement action, causing illicit drug manufacturers to use anethole as an alternative.Waumas D, Bruneel N, Tytgat J. Anise oil as para-methoxyamphetamine (PMA) precursor. Forensic Science International. 2003 Apr 23;133(1-2):159-70.

Effects of PMA ingestion include many effects of the hallucinogenic amphetamines including accelerated and irregular heartbeat, blurred vision, and a strong feeling of intoxication that is often unpleasant. At high doses unpleasant effects such as nausea and vomiting, severe hyperthermia and hallucinations may occur. The effects of PMA also seem to be much more unpredictable and variable between individuals than those of MDMA, and sensitive individuals may die from a dose of PMA that a less susceptible person might only be mildly affected by.Smets G, Bronselaer K, De Munnynck K, De Feyter K, Van de Voorde W, Sabbe M. Amphetamine toxicity in the emergency department. European Journal of Emergency Medicine. 2005 Aug;12(4):193-7.

The designer drug situation in Ibiza. Forensic Science International. 2004 Mar 10;140(2-3):195-206. Since PMA has a slow onset of effects, several deaths have occurred where individuals have taken a pill containing PMA, followed by a pill containing MDMA some time afterwards due to thinking that the first pill was not active.Dams R, De Letter EA, Mortier KA, Cordonnier JA, Lambert WE, Piette MH, Van Calenbergh S, De Leenheer AP. Fatality due to combined use of the designer drugs MDMA and PMA: a distribution study. Journal of Analytical Toxicology. 2003 Jul-Aug;27(5):318-22.  Overdose  PMA overdose can be a serious medical emergency that may occur at only slightly above the usual recreational dose range, especially if PMA is mixed with other stimulant drugs such as cocaine or MDMA. Characteristic symptoms are pronounced hyperthermia, tachycardia, and hypertension, along with agitation, confusion, and convulsions. PMA overdose also tends to cause hypoglycaemia and hyperkalaemia, which can help to distinguish it from MDMA overdose. Complications can sometimes include more serious symptoms such as rhabdomyolysis and cerebral hemorrhage, requiring emergency surgery. There is no specific antidote, so treatment is symptomatic, and usually includes both external cooling, and internal cooling via IV infusion of cooled saline. Benzodiazepines are used initially to control convulsions, with stronger anticonvulsants such as phenytoin or thiopental used if convulsions continue. Blood pressure can be lowered either with a combination of alpha blockers and beta blockers (or a mixed alpha/beta blocker), or with other drugs such as nifedipine or nitroprusside. Serotonin antagonists and dantrolene may be used as required. Despite the seriousness of the condition, the majority of patients survive if treatment is given in time, however, patients with a core body temperature over 40 ¬∞C at presentation tend to have a poor prognosis.  Pharmacology  PMA acts as a selective serotonin releasing agent (SSRA) with weak effects on dopamine and norepinephrine transporters. However, relative to MDMA, it is considerably less effective as a releaser of serotonin with properties more akin to a reuptake inhibitor in comparison. It evokes robust hyperthermia in rodents while producing only modest hyperactivity and serotonergic neurotoxicity, substantially lower than that caused by MDMA, and only at very high doses. Accordingly, it is not self-administered by rodents unlike amphetamine and MDMA, and anecdotal reports by humans suggest it is not particularly euphoric at all, perhaps even dysphoric in contrast. PMA has also been shown to act as a potent, reversible inhibitor of the enzyme MAO-A with no significant effects on MAO-B, and the combination of this property and serotonin release is likely responsible for its high lethality potential. It appears that PMA elevates body temperatures dramatically; the cause of this property is suspected to be related to its ability to inhibit MAO-A and at the same time releasing large amounts of serotonin, effectively causing serotonin syndrome. Amphetamines, especially serotonergic analogues such as MDMA, are strongly contraindicated to take with MAOIs. Many amphetamines and adrenergic compounds raise body temperatures, whereas some tend to produce more euphoric activity or peripheral vasoconstriction, and may tend to favor one effect over another. It appears that PMA activates the hypothalamus much more strongly than MDMA and other drugs like ephedrine, thereby causing rapid increases in body temperature (which is the major cause of death in PMA mortalities).Jaehne EJ, Salem A, Irvine RJ.

History  PMA first came into circulation in the early 1970s, where it was used intentionally as a substitute for the hallucinogenic properties of LSD. It went by the street names of \\"Chicken Powder\\" and \\"Chicken Yellow\\" and was found to be the cause of a number of drug overdose deaths (the dosages taken being in the range of hundreds of milligrams) in the United States and Canada from that time. Between 1974 and the mid-1990s, there appear to have been no known fatalities from PMA. Several deaths reported as MDMA-induced in Australia in the mid-1990s are now considered to have been caused by PMA, the users unaware that they were ingesting PMA and not MDMA as they had intended. There have been a number of PMA-induced deaths around the world since then. In July 2013, seven deaths in Scotland were linked to tablets containing PMA that had been mis-sold as ecstasy and which had the Rolex crown logo on them. Several deaths in Northern Ireland, Particularly East Belfast were also linked to \\"Green Rolex\\" pills during that month. In 2014, 2015 and early 2016, PMA sold as ecstasy was attributed for more deaths in the United States, United Kingdom, Netherlands, and Argentina. The pills containing the drug were reported to be red triangular tablets with a \\"Superman\\" logo. The Red Ferarri pills are a new press of the Superman logo tablets that were reported to be found in Germany and Norway from 2016-2017.  Society and culture  =Legal status= International PMA is a Schedule I drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. Australia PMA is considered a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (October 2015).Poisons Standard October 2015 https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2015L01534 A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities. Germany PMA is part of the Appendix 1 of the Bet√§ubungsmittelgesetz. Therefore owning and distribution of PMA is illegal. Netherlands On 13 June 2012 Edith Schippers, Dutch Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport, revoked the legality of PMA in the Netherlands after five deaths were reported in that year. United Kingdom PMA is a Class A drug in the UK. United States PMA is classified as a Schedule I hallucinogen under the Controlled Substances Act in the United States.21 CFR 1308.11 = Economics = Distribution PMA capsules seized in Maryland, USA Because PMA is given out through the same venues and distribution channels that MDMA tablets are, the risk of being severely injured, hospitalized or even dying from use of ecstasy increases significantly when a batch of ecstasy pills containing PMA starts to be sold in a particular area.Galloway JH, Forrest AR. Caveat Emptor: Death involving the use of 4-methoxyamphetamine. Journal of Clinical Forensic Medicine. 2002 Sep;9(3):160.

These are the N-methyl, N-ethyl, 4-ethoxy and 4-methylthio analogues of PMA, respectively. PMMA and PMEA are anecdotally weaker, more \\"ecstasy-like\\" and somewhat less dangerous than PMA itself, but can still produce nausea and hyperthermia similar to that produced by PMA, albeit at slightly higher doses. 4-EtOA was briefly sold in Canada in the 1970s, but little is known about it.Alexander & Ann Shulgin, PiHKAL #97 4-MTA, however, is even more dangerous than PMA and produces strong serotonergic effects and intense hyperthermia, but with little to no euphoria, and was implicated in several deaths in the late 1990s.

The class comprised the vessels , , , and , the last of which was completed to a slightly different design. The ships were a substantial improvement over the preceding s, incorporating significantly heavier armor protection at the cost of the very high speed of the Trentos. They carried the same main battery of eight guns and had a maximum speed of . Among the best-protected heavy cruisers built by any navy in the 1930s, the heavy armor was acquired only by violating the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, which limited cruiser displacement to . All four ships served with the main fleet in the interwar period, where they were primarily occupied with training exercises and fleet reviews. During the Spanish Civil War, Gorizia evacuated Italian nationals and Pola took part in non-intervention patrols. All four ships supported the Italian invasion of Albania in April 1939, shortly before the outbreak of World War II. After Italy joined the wider conflict in 1940, the four ships saw extensive action in the Mediterranean Sea against British forces. The ships took part in the battles of Calabria and Cape Matapan, and in the latter engagement, Zara, Pola, and Fiume were all sunk in a one-sided night action with three British battleships. Gorizia continued in service, seeing further action at the First and Second Battles of Sirte. She was seriously damaged by American heavy bombers in April 1943 and towed to La Spezia, where she was still under repair when Italy surrendered in September. Germany seized the ship when they occupied the port, and Italian commandos unsuccessfully attempted to sink her in June 1944. In poor condition by the end of the war, the postwar Italian Navy decided to sell the ship for scrap in 1947. Design While the preceding of heavy cruisers were still being built, elements of the Italian naval command began to doubt the effectiveness of the new vessels, which sacrificed armor protection in favor of very high speeds. They advocated a more balanced design that would incorporate more comprehensive armor, with a main belt that was thick, while retaining the battery of eight guns and a speed of at least . The designers quickly found that these characteristics could not be incorporated into a vessel that remained within the limit imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty. The naval command agreed to allow the new ships to exceed the displacement limits, but instructed the designers to eliminate unnecessary features to save as much weight as possible. As a result, the belt armor was reduced in thickness and the planned torpedo tubes were removed. The flush deck of the Trentos was abandoned, with the ships instead incorporating a forecastle deck and a stepped-down main deck. In addition, the Zara design would be powered by just two propellers driven by lightweight machinery, unlike the four-shaft arrangement used in the Trentos. Nevertheless, the ships still exceeded the displacement limit by at least . By 1928, the work was finished on what would become the Zara class, and the first two ships, and , were ordered for the 1928‚Äì1929 building program. followed in the 1929‚Äì1930 construction year, and was ordered under the 1930‚Äì1931 program. All four ships were named for formerly Austro-Hungarian cities that were annexed to Italy in the aftermath of World War I.Brescia, p. 76 =General characteristics= Line-drawing of Pola; Zara was similar in appearance The ships of the Zara class were long at the waterline and long overall. They had a beam of and a draft of . The ships had a standard displacement of , and displaced at full load, with Fiume being the lightest of the four and Gorizia the heaviest. The first three ships were built with light superstructures as a weight saving measure, but Pola, intended to serve as a flagship, received a much larger bridge structure to accommodate an admiral's staff. All four ships received two tripod masts, with the forward mast erected over the bridge. They had a crew of 841 officers and enlisted men. The ships carried a pair of IMAM Ro.43 seaplanes for aerial reconnaissance; the hangar was located under the forecastle and a fixed catapult was mounted on the centerline at the bow.Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 292 The ships' power plant consisted of two Parsons steam turbines powered by eight oil-fired Thornycroft boilers, with the exception of Fiume, which received Yarrow boilers. The boilers were trunked into two funnels amidships. Their engines were rated at and produced a top speed of , though on sea trials all four vessels significantly exceeded those figures, reaching a minimum of and speeds of . Nevertheless, in service, their practical speeds were in the range of . The vessels each carried of fuel oil, which allowed them to steam for at a cruising speed of . When operating at maximum speed, their operational radius fell to , though due to the fact that Italian naval vessels were intended to operate only within the narrow confines of the Mediterranean Sea, their relatively short cruising range was not a significant problem.Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 283 =Armament and armor= Fiume launching a seaplane in 1935; note the closeness of the main battery guns The Zaras were armed with a main battery of eight Mod 29 53-caliber guns in four gun turrets. The turrets were arranged in superfiring pairs forward and aft. The guns fired shells at a muzzle velocity of , with a rate of fire of about three and a half rounds per minute. The turrets allowed elevation to 45 degrees, which provided a maximum range of . Each ship carried 157 shells per gun. Like the Trentos, the Zara-class ships suffered from shell dispersion that hampered accuracy. The problem was in large part due to poor quality control in Italian munition factories, which failed to ensure tight manufacturing tolerances necessary for accurate shells.Friedman, p. 310 In addition, the single cradle mounts required the guns to be very close together; this caused the shells to interfere with each other in flight and contributed to the dispersion problem.Brescia, pp. 73‚Äì74 In an attempt to rectify the dispersion problem, the guns were supplied with modified shells that fired at .Campbell, p. 326 Anti-aircraft defense was provided by a battery of sixteen 47-cal. guns in twin mounts, four Vickers-Terni 40 mm/39 guns in single mounts and eight guns in twin mounts. The 100 mm guns were copies of Austro-Hungarian guns designed in 1910 by ≈†koda that were placed in newly designed dual-purpose mounts that elevated to 85 degrees for a maximum range of .Campbell, p. 339 The ships' secondary battery was revised several times during their careers. Two of the 100 mm guns and all of the 40 mm guns were removed in the late 1930s and eight 54-cal. guns were installed in their place. Two 15-cal. star shell guns were added in 1940. In 1942, the star shell guns aboard Gorizia, by this time the only surviving member of the class, were replaced with four more 37 mm guns. The following year, a battery of fourteen guns in six twin and two single mounts replaced the machine guns. The ships were protected with an armored citadel that covered the ships' vitals, including the machinery spaces and ammunition magazines. Vertical protection consisted of an armored belt that was thick at the waterline and reduced to at the bottom edge of the belt. Their main armor deck was thick, and the box formed by the belt and deck was capped at either end by armored bulkheads that were thick in the upper portion and in the lower section. The main deck was supplemented with an upper deck that was thick, which was intended to detonate the fuses of incoming shells before they struck the main deck; the upper deck was connected to an upper belt that was thick. The gun turrets had 150 mm thick plating on the faces and the barbettes they sat in were also 150 mm thick. The main conning tower had 150 mm thick sides and an thick roof. The Zara class carried three times the armor protection of the preceding Trentos. Their heavy armor made the Zaras the best-protected cruisers until the introduction of the , laid down in 1945 by the United States.Martin, p. 69 This additional armor would have made the ships decidedly nose-heavy, so to offset this the rear of the ship was raised by one deck behind the front funnel.Fitzsimons, p. 2614 The result was excellent watertight integrity and protection.Martin, pp. 65‚Äì67, 69 Ships {class=wikitable - valign=top !

Gorizia and Pola were involved in the Spanish Civil War; in 1936 Pola conducted non- intervention patrols and Gorizia carried Italian nationals from Gijon, Spain, to Le Verdon-sur-Mer, France that year. After departing France, Gorizia visited Germany, and on the way back, she suffered a major explosion in an aviation gasoline tank that forced her to put into Gibraltar for repairs. There, British shipyard inspectors discovered that the ship was grossly over the Washington Treaty's displacement restriction. In March 1939, all four ships sortied to prevent a squadron of Republican warships from reaching the Black Sea, forcing them to stop in Bizerte, Tunisia, where they were interned. The following month, Zara, Pola, and Gorizia provided gunfire support to Italian forces invading Albania.Hogg & Wiper, pp. 18, 24, 46, 54 The Zara- class cruisers saw extensive service during World War II, having taken part in several sorties to catch British convoys in the Mediterranean as the flagship of the 1st Division. At the Battle of Calabria in July 1940, torpedo bombers from the British aircraft carrier attacked the Zara-class cruisers, but they failed to score any hits. The ships steamed ahead to the front of the Italian line of battle and joined the attack on the leading British battleship, , but they scored no hits. British cruisers attacked as the Italians withdrew, but heavy fire from the Italian cruisers drove them off.Greene & Massignani, pp. 70‚Äì77 All four ships escaped damage at the Battle of Taranto in November 1940. In March 1941 at the Battle of Cape Matapan, Pola was immobilized by a torpedo from a Swordfish torpedo bomber launched by the British aircraft carrier ; Zara and Fiume were detached from the rest of the fleet to protect Pola, and all three and a pair of destroyers were sunk in a close-range night engagement with the battleships , , and Warspite. Italian casualties were very heavy, with 783 killed aboard Zara, 328 killed aboard Pola, 812 aboard Fiume.O'Hara, p. 97 The survivors, mostly from Pola, were rescued primarily by British destroyers, though Greek destroyers and an Italian hospital ship picked up others over the following few days.Bennett, pp. 129‚Äì131Cernuschi, Brescia & Bagnasco, p. 30Fioravanzo, pp. 480‚Äì481 Gorizia, the sole surviving member of the class, saw action at the First Battle of Sirte in December 1941 and Second Sirte in March 1942, where she was heavily engaged with British light cruisers and destroyers.Hogg & Wiper, p. 47 As the action took place at very long range, neither side scored any hits.Greene & Massignani, pp. 218‚Äì221 During this period, the ship also took part in convoy escort operations to supply Italian and German forces in North Africa. While the ship was moored in La Maddalena on 10 April 1943, a major attack from United States Army Air Forces heavy bombers sank the heavy cruiser and hit Gorizia with three bombs, inflicting serious damage. She was still under repair in La Spezia when Italy surrendered to the Allies in September, and she was seized by German forces when they occupied much of the country. On 22 June 1944, Italian frogmen used Chariot manned torpedoes to enter the harbor and sink Gorizia and the heavy cruiser , which was also out of service due to battle damage, to prevent them from being used as blockships though Gorizia survived the attack. She was nevertheless sold for scrap in 1947, since it would have been cost-prohibitive to repair her.Hogg & Wiper, pp. 46‚Äì47 Notes References    Category:Cruiser classes Category:World War II cruisers of Italy Category:1930s ships ","title":"Zara-class cruiser"},{"id":"854403","text":"The Australian Women's Weekly, sometimes known as simply The Weekly, is an Australian monthly women's magazine published by Mercury Capital in Sydney. For many years it was the number one magazine in Australia before being outsold by the Australian edition of the American publication Better Homes and Gardens in 2014. , The Weekly has overtaken Better Homes and Gardens again, coming out on top as Australia's most read magazine. The magazine invested in the 2020 film I Am Woman about Helen Reddy, feminist icon and activist. Editor-in-chief Nicole Byers told Film Ink \\"Helen‚Äôs story of adversity and triumph is nothing short of inspirational. The Weekly has been telling stories of iconic Australian women for more than 80 years and we‚Äôre delighted to be supporting the film production\\". History and profile The magazine was started in 1933 by Frank Packer as a weekly publication. The first editor was George Warnecke and the initial dummy was laid out by William Edwin Pidgeon who went on to do many famous covers over the next 25 years.Spearritt, Peter (2012). \\"Pidgeon, William Edwin (Wep) (1909‚Äì1981)\\". Australian Dictionary of Biography, Vol. 18. Melbourne University Press. Online version Retrieved 29 September 2016. It was to have two distinctive features: firstly it would be a newspaper with an element of topicality in all its features. Secondly it would be an attempt to appeal to all Australian women, regardless of class, and have a national focus. Wanting it to appeal to a mass audience, Warnecke hoped that it would be a material sign that Australia was coming out of the depression. The Weekly celebrated its 50th anniversary of publication in June 1983 and its 75th anniversary in the October 2008 issue. PBL launched Women's Weekly versions in Singapore and Malaysia, in 1997 and 2000, respectively, which follow The Weekly style while containing largely local content. In 2012 the parent company of the magazine, ACP Magazines, a subsidiary of Nine Entertainment, was acquired by the Bauer Media Group. Audited circulation under Nene King was 980,000. The 60th anniversary edition sold in excess of one-million. Audited circulation in June 2013 was 459,175 copies monthly. Readership numbers for September 2014 were estimated to be 1,828,000. In mid- June 2020, the Sydney-based investment company Mercury Capital acquired the Australian Women's Weekly as part of its acquisition of Bauer Media's Australian and New Zealand magazine brands. Format and frequency The magazine is usually 240 pages long and printed on glossy paper trimmed to A4 page size, although it was originally a Tabloid in size and layout. It typically contains feature articles about the modern Australian woman. For many years, it included a lift-out TV guide. In 1982, publication frequency was reduced from weekly to monthly. \\"Weekly\\" was retained in the name for reasons of familiarity and because a woman's \\"monthly\\" was a slang term for menstruation. The final weekly edition was dated 15 December 1982, followed by the first monthly edition dated January 1983. The TV guide was discontinued on introduction of the monthly format.

From 1965, it continued to be on the same site of the Australian Consolidated Press (ACP) building (corner of Park and Castlereagh Streets) in Sydney. The Test Kitchen's first 'Best Ever' recipes compilation was published in 1976, collating the most-requested recipes from the issues of the Weekly. The cookbook sold out in days and had many reprints. The Test Kitchen had a team of 16 people in 2006, composed of chefs, home economists, food editors and support staff. In 2012, ACP was sold to Bauer Media Group. The Test Kitchen triple-tests recipes which are then published in the magazine, as well as Woman's Day and the AWW cookbooks. Surveys have shown that over 90 per cent of readers buy the magazine for the recipes.

He is mainly remembered as a biographer of Early Netherlandish painters and Northern Renaissance artists in his Schilder-boeck. As an artist and art theoretician he played a significant role in the spread and development of Northern Mannerism in the Dutch Republic.Painting in the Dutch Golden Age - A Profile of the Seventeenth Century, National Gallery of Art, 2007, p. 119 Life Most of the information about Karel van Mander's life is based on a brief and anonymous biographical sketch included in the posthumous second edition of the Schilder-boeck published in 1618 by Jacob Pietersz Wachter. It is not certain who wrote this biographical sketch and various candidates have been proposed. Most recently it has been argued that it was written by his son Karel van Mander the Younger. His son would have relied on biographical information that Karel van Mander had written himself as well as on his own recollections and notes. The information in the biographical sketch is not entirely reliable but is still regarded as the best source of information on van Mander's life.H. Duits, 'Het leven van Karel van Mander. Kunstenaarsleven of schrijversbiografie?', De zeventiende eeuw 9 (1993), nr. 2, pp. 117‚Äì136 Van Mander was born into a noble family in Meulebeke, in the County of Flanders. He studied under Lucas de Heere in Ghent, and in 1568-1569 under Pieter Vlerick in Kortrijk. The next five years he devoted to the writing of religious plays for which he also painted the scenery. Then followed three years in Rome (1574‚Äì1577). His biographical sketch refers to van Mander as the discoverer of 'caves' in Rome. This may be a reference to the Catacombs of Rome although the exact meaning of the reference is unclear. In Rome he may also have come into contact with fellow Fleming Bartholomeus Spranger, who left Rome in 1575 for Vienna to enter into the service of the emperor. His patrons in Rome included several cardinals. On his return journey he passed through Vienna, where, together with Spranger and the sculptor Hans Mont, he made the triumphal arch for the royal entry of the emperor Rudolf II. Van Mander settled in Meulebeke in 1578 where he was active as a painter and writer. He married an 18-year-old local girl, with whom he had a son. In 1580 he left for Kortrijk due to religious troubles caused by Catholic zealots in Meulebeke. Karel van Mander had at some point become a Mennonite and was therefore a possible target of these zealots.David A. Shank, 'Karel Van Mander's Mennonite Roots in Flanders', Mennonite Quarterly Review, Vol. 79, No. 2 In Kortrijk he got a commission for an altar piece. In Kortrijk another son was born. He left Kortrijk for Bruges in 1582 because of an outbreak of the plague and other reasons. In Bruges, he worked with the painter Paul Weyts. Because of the threat of religious troubles and the plague, Karel fled with his family and his mother-in-law by ship to the Dutch Republic where he settled in Haarlem in the province of Holland in 1583. Here he worked for 20 years on a commission by the Haarlem city fathers to inventory \\"their\\" art collection. The city of Haarlem had confiscated all Catholic religious art after the satisfactie van Haarlem, which gave Catholics equal rights to Protestants, had been overturned in 1578. Van Mander used his work on the commission in his \\"Schilder-boeck\\". While in Haarlem he continued to paint, concentrating his energy on his favourite genre: historical allegories. In 1603 he rented a fortified manor (\\"het Huis te Zevenbergen\\"), later renamed Kasteel Marquette in Heemskerk to proofread his book that was published in 1604. He died soon after it was published in Amsterdam at the age of 58. Haarlem Mannerists Garden of Love, 1602, Hermitage Museum Karel van Mander was the founder, together with Hubertus Goltzius and Cornelis van Haarlem, of an 'academy to study after life'. It is not entirely clear what this academy did but it is believed it was an informal discussion group which may have organised drawing classes with life models. It has also been claimed that the nature of the academy was more of a literary nature. He had an important impact on art in the Dutch Republic when in 1585 he showed his friend Hendrick Goltzius drawings by Bartholomeus Spranger. Spranger was then the leading artist of Northern Mannerism and was based in Prague as the court artist of emperor Rudolf II. These drawings had a galvanising effect on Goltzius whose style was influenced by them. Goltzius made engravings of the drawings which were important in disseminating the Mannerist style. Van Mander, Goltzius and Cornelis van Haarlem became known as the \\"Haarlem Mannerists\\" and artists from other towns joined the movement. Their pictorial language was characterised by a strong awareness of style and cultivated elegance. They strived for artful ingenuity rather than naturalism. They also had a preference for depicting exaggeratedly brawny musclemen, violent drama, wild fantasy and a heightened richness of detail. The dissemination of the engravings of Goltzius went hand in hand with the new practice of art theorisation that was new to the 16th century and in which Karel van Mander played an important role.The artful image: the Haarlem mannerists 1580-1600 on Codart He received budding artists in his home for evenings of communal drawing and study of classical mythology. After the iconoclasm of the Calvinists, religious themes had gone out of fashion and mythology had become popular. However, few painters could afford a trip to Italy such as the one that van Mander had undertaken. His purpose was to educate young painters in the proper artistic techniques. He was a firm believer in the hierarchy of genres. It was his firm belief that only through proper study of existing works it was possible to realize true-to-life historical allegories. His own works included mannerist mythological subjects, but also portraits and genre paintings influenced by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, such as the Kermis in the Hermitage Museum. Relatively few paintings by him survive. Writings Landscape with snow and the Crucifixion, 1599, Private Collection As a writer van Mander worked in various genres: drama, poetry, songs, biography and art theory. He also translated classical literature. His literary production reflects the two sides of his intellectual and spiritual interests: the humanism of the Renaissance and the religious convictions of a pious mennonite.Karel van Mander in: Marijke Spies, Ton van Strien and Henk Duits, 'Amsterdam University Press Rhetoric Rhetoricians and Poets, Studies in Renaissance Poetry and Poetics, 1999, pp. 93‚Äì97 His earliest works were biblical plays that he wrote while still in Flanders. These have not been preserved. His first spiritual writings are contained in De Gulden Harpe, published in 1597. This poetry volume consists of rather longwinded versification of biblical stories that were intended to educate readers with biblical words. His style developed under the influence of his translation (from the French) of classical literature such as the Iliad and, in particular, the Bucolica en Georgica of Virgil. He abandoned the heavy style of the rhetoricians for the jambs of Virgil in his bundle of spiritual songs published in 1613 after his death under the title Bethlehem dat is het Broodhuys.Karel van Mander in: K. ter Laan, 'Letterkundig woordenboek voor Noord en Zuid', G.B. van Goor Zonen's Uitgeversmaatschappij, Den Haag / Djakarta 1952 (tweede druk), pp. 329‚Äì330 Schilder-boeck The Continence of Scipio, 1600, Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam Karel van Mander's Schilder-boeck, written in 17th century Dutch and published in Haarlem in 1604 by Passchier van Wesbusch, describes the life and work of more than 250 painters, both historical and contemporary, and explains contemporary art theory for aspiring painters. During his travels and stay in Italy, van Mander had read and was influenced by Giorgio Vasari's famous biographical accounts of painters in his book Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects, often referred to as the Vite. It was published in 1550 and republished in 1568 with woodcuts, which is the version van Mander probably studied. He set about translating this work into Dutch and it was during this project that he was offered the commission to inventory Haarlem's art collection, a job that resulted in the chapters of his book on Early Netherlandish painters. In both books, the lives of the painters are told in the standard \\"Vita di ...\\" manner of Catholic saints, extolling the virtues of the painters one by one in several chapters. In van Mander's book many entries on Italian painters were simply translated or adapted from the Italian Vite, but the biographical details on early Netherlandish painters and, in particular the Haarlem painters, are unique and gathered during van Mander's commission. Karel van Mander's book also contains an interpretation of the stories in Ovid's Metamorphoses. This was meant as an aid to artists who wished to paint mythological themes rather than religious ones. Symbolism was very important in painting at the time, and the use of Ovid's characters, combined with the proper use of artistic symbolism allowed the artist to tell a specific story. The last chapter of the Schilder-Boeck describes the meaning of animals and other figures. Legacy The Adoration of the Shepherds (1596), National Gallery in Prague Van Mander was the master of Frans Hals. Frans Hals appears not to have shared van Mander's view that history painting was the highest in the hierarchy of genres since Frans Hals produced almost solely portrait paintings. The Schilder-Boeck introduced Dutch artists to Italian art and encouraged them to travel, if not follow the book's instructions on Italian painting methods. Aside from his son Karel van Mander the Younger and Frans Hals, his registered pupils were Cornelis Engelsz, Everard Crynsz van der Maes, Jacobus Martens (landscape painter and father of the painter Jan Martszen de Jonge), Jacob Martsen (genre painter), Jacob van Musscher, Hendrik Gerritsz Pot and Fran√ßois Venant.Karel van Mander at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Van Mander was further influential on art writing in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Cornelis de Bie (Gulden Cabinet, 1662), Joachim von Sandrart (Teutsche Akademie, 1675), Filippo Baldinucci (Notizie de' Professori, 1681), and Arnold Houbraken (Schouburg, 1720) are some of the early biographers who used material from his Schilder-boeck for their biographical sketches of Netherlandish painters. His book is still the most- cited primary source in biographical accounts of the lives of many artists he included. Of most interest to art historians is his criticism of the work of these artists, especially when he describes the location and owner of the paintings, thus becoming a valuable source for art provenance.

C. Harris Water Treatment Plant in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, is both a crucial piece of infrastructure and an architecturally acclaimed historic building named after the longtime commissioner of Toronto's public works R. C. Harris. It is located in the east of the city at the eastern end of Queen Street and at the foot of Victoria Park Avenue along the shore of Lake Ontario in the Beaches neighbourhood in the former city of Scarborough. Site history =Pre-1932 history= Prior to the construction of a water treatment plant, the area was the site of Victoria Park, a waterfront amusement park that operated from 1878 until 1906 (closed same year as rival Munro Park ceased operations). The amusement park was initially served by ferry from York Street (same docks serving Toronto Islands) until 1895 when streetcar service commenced. After the park closed in 1906, Victoria Park Forest School opened and used the site until 1932. =Water treatment plant= With an early 20th-century Toronto plagued with water shortages and unclean drinking water, public health advocates such as George Nasmith and Toronto's Medical Officer of Health, Charles Hastings, campaigned for a modern water purification system. Construction for a water treatment plant began on the site in 1932 and the building became operational on November 1, 1941. The building, unlike most modern engineering structures, was also created to make an architectural statement. Fashioned in the Art Deco style, the cathedral- like structure remains one of Toronto's most admired buildings. It is, however, little known to outsiders. The interiors are just as opulent with marble entryways and vast halls filled with pools of water and filtration equipment. The plant has thus earned the nickname The Palace of Purification. In 1992, the R. C. Harris Water Treatment Plant was named a national historic civil engineering site by the Canadian Society for Civil Engineering. It was designated under the Ontario Heritage Act in 1998. The plant appeared on a stamp issued by Canada Post in 2011, in a series showcasing five notable Art Deco buildings in Canada. Use Water pumps at the treatment plant Despite its age, the plant is still fully functional, providing approximately 45% of the water supply for Toronto and York Region. The intakes are located over from shore in of water, running through two pipes under the bed of the lake. Water is also chlorinated in the plant and then pumped to various reservoirs throughout the City of Toronto and York Region. Access The facility grounds have been made available to the public. Despite some concerns of vulnerability to an attack on the water supply since the September 11 attacks, the grounds have remained open to the public, but security has been increased. In the summer of 2007, construction began on the installation of an underground Residual Management Facility allowing processed waste to be removed before discharging into the lake. This construction has since been completed. In popular culture The R. C.

Early life and career Gallico was born in New York City. His father was the Italian concert pianist, composer and music teacher Paolo Gallico (Trieste, May 13, 1868 ‚Äì New York, July 6, 1955), and his mother, Hortense Erlich, came from Austria; they had emigrated to New York in 1895. Gallico graduated from Columbia University in 1919 and first achieved notice in the 1920s as a sportswriter, sports columnist, and sports editor of the New York Daily News. Gallico's career was launched by an interview with boxer Jack Dempsey in which he asked Dempsey to spar with him. Gallico described how it felt to be knocked out by the heavyweight champion. He followed up with accounts of catching Dizzy Dean's fastball and golfing with Bobby Jones. He became one of the highest-paid sportswriters in America. He founded the Golden Gloves amateur boxing competition. His book, Lou Gehrig: Pride of the Yankees (1941) was adapted into the sports movie The Pride of the Yankees (1942), starring Gary Cooper and Teresa Wright. Career as a fiction writer In the late 1930s, he abandoned sports writing for fiction, first writing an essay about this decision entitled \\"Farewell to Sport\\" (published in an anthology of his sports writing, also titled Farewell to Sport (1938)), and became a successful writer of short stories for magazines, many appearing in the then-premier fiction outlet, The Saturday Evening Post. His novella The Snow Goose, and other works, are expanded versions of his magazine stories. Gallico once confessed to New York Magazine, \\"I'm a rotten novelist. I'm not even literary. I just like to tell stories and all my books tell stories.... If I had lived 2,000 years ago I'd be going around to caves, and I'd say, 'Can I come in? I'm hungry. I'd like some supper. In exchange, I'll tell you a story. Once upon a time there were two apes.' And I'd tell them a story about two cavemen.\\" In 1939, Gallico published The Adventures of Hiram Holliday, known for its later television adaptation with Wally Cox in the starring role and Ainslie Pryor as the supporting actor. It depicts the comic adventures of a modern American knight-errant visiting Europe on the verge of World War II and waging a single-handed, quixotic struggle against the Nazis in various countries. Gallico's Austrian background is evident in the book's strong Habsburg Monarchist theme. (The protagonist saves an Austrian Princess, wins her love and takes charge of her young son ‚Äì who, the book hints, is fated to become the new Habsburg Emperor once the Nazis are driven out of Austria.) The Snow Goose was published in 1941 in The Saturday Evening Post and won the O. Henry Award for short stories in 1941. Critic Robert van Gelder called it \\"perhaps the most sentimental story that ever has achieved the dignity of a Borzoi (prestige imprint of publisher Knopf) imprint. It is a timeless legend that makes use of every timeless appeal that could be crowded into it.\\" A public library puts it on a list of \\"tearjerkers.\\" Gallico made no apologies, saying that in the contest between sentiment and \\"slime,\\" \\"sentiment remains so far out in front, as it always has and always will among ordinary humans that the calamity-howlers and porn merchants have to increase the decibels of their lamentations, the hideousness of their violence and the mountainous piles of their filth to keep in the race at all.\\" On December 25, 1949, Gallico's short story ‚Äú‚ÄòTwas the Night Before Christmas‚Äù was dramatized as Attraction 66 of the NBC radio series, Radio City Playhouse. It tells the humorous tale of a New York newspaper reporter and a photographer sent on a Christmas Eve wild goose chase by their publisher's wife for two goats harnessed to a little red wagon, which she intends to give her nephews for Christmas. During a night-long search fueled by a few drinks along the way, the reporter and photographer run across the evening's most dramatic news stories, which they must supposedly ignore in favor of the chore set out by their publisher's wife. The radio dramatization remains very popular with Old Time Radio fans and is featured each year on the Sirius XM Radio Classics channel. His short story, \\"The Man Who Hated People,\\" was reworked into an unpublished short story \\"The Seven Souls of Clement O'Reilly\\" which was adapted into the Oscar-winning motion picture Lili (1953), and later staged as the musical Carnival! (1961). The film Lili is a poignant, whimsical fairy tale, the story of an orphaned waif, a na√Øve young woman whose fate is thrown in with that of a traveling carnival and its performers, a lothario magician and an embittered puppeteer. In 1954 Gallico published a novella, The Love of Seven Dolls, based on \\"The Man Who Hated People. The versions, while differing, share a core theme surrounding the girl and the puppeteer. The puppeteer, communicating with Lili through his puppets as a surrogate voice, develops a vehicle whereby each of them can freely express their inner pain and anguished emotions. In the 1950s, Gallico spent time in Liechtenstein, where he wrote Ludmila, the retelling of a local legend. His novel Mrs. 'Arris Goes to Paris (1958) was a bestseller, and became the first of four books about the lovable charwoman, \\"Mrs. 'Arris.\\" Negotiations for film rights began as early as 1960, when he was resident in Salcombe, on the south Devon coast. It was eventually produced as a TV movie with Angela Lansbury in 1992. During his time in Salcombe, Gallico serialised an account of the sinking of the MV Princess Victoria, the ferry which plied between Larne and Stranraer, an event which caused the death of every woman and child on board. It was his habit, at this time, to wander in his garden dictating to his assistant, Mel Menzies, who would then type up the manuscript in the evening, ready for inclusion in the newspaper. The Silent Miaow (1964) purports to be a guide written by a cat, \\"translated from the feline\\", on how to obtain, captivate, and dominate a human family. Illustrated with photographs by Suzanne Szasz, it is considered a classic by cat lovers. Other Gallico cat books include Jennie (1950) (American title The Abandoned), Thomasina, the Cat Who Thought She Was God (1957), filmed in 1964 by the Walt Disney Studios as The Three Lives of Thomasina (which was very popular in the former USSR in the early 1990s, inspiring the Russian remake Bezumnaya Lori), and Honorable Cat (1972), a book of poetry and essays about cats. Gallico's 1969 book The Poseidon Adventure, about a group of passengers attempting to escape from a capsized ocean liner, attracted little attention at the time. The New York Times gave it a one- paragraph review, noting that \\"Mr. Gallico collects a Grand Hotel [a reference to the 1930 Vicki Baum novel] full of shipboard dossiers. These interlocking histories may be damp with sentimentality as well as brine--but the author's skill as a storyteller invests them with enough suspense to last the desperate journey.\\" In contrast, Irwin Allen's motion picture adaptation of Gallico's book was instantly recognized as a great movie of its kind. In his article \\"What makes 'Poseidon' Fun?\\", reviewer Vincent Canby coined the term \\"ark movie\\" for the genre including Airport, The High and the Mighty, A Night to Remember, and Titanic (the 1953 movie). He wrote that \\"'The Poseidon Adventure' puts the Ark Movie back where God intended it to be, in the water. Not flying around in the air on one engine or with a hole in its side.\\" The movie was enormously successful, part of a decade of disaster films, and remains a cult classic. In his New York Times obituary, Molly Ivins said that \\"to say that Mr. Gallico was prolific hardly begins to describe his output.\\" He wrote 41 books and numerous short stories, twenty theatrical movies, twelve TV movies, and had a TV series based on his Hiram Holliday short stories. Later life On resigning from the Daily News to become a full-time fiction writer, Gallico moved from New York to the village of Salcombe in South Devon, England.Gallico, \\"Mainly Autobiographical\\" p. 23 (see list of references) Later he lived in many parts of the world, including England, Mexico, Liechtenstein and Monaco.Martin Benson, \\"Paul Gallico - a biography\\" He spent the last part of his life in Antibes, France where he died and was buried. In 1955 Gallico took an automobile tour of the United States, traveling some 10,000 miles, sponsored by Reader's Digest.Gallico, Confessions of a Story- teller, p.386 (introduction to story \\"Shut Up, Little Dog\\") He wrote that \\"it had been almost twenty years since I had traveled extensively through my own country and the changes brought about by two decades would thus stand out.\\" Several stories resulted. Paul Gallico's style and themes Gallico was a self-described \\"storyteller\\".Gallico, \\"Mainly Autobiographical\\" p. 28 (see list of references) Many of his stories are told in the apparently artless style of a folk tale or legend. Like other \\"storyteller\\" writers, the charm and power of his writing lie in the cumulative effect of plainly told detail. An outline or quotation from a particular story may sound banal, but taken in its entirety, a Gallico novel can be captivating. For example, consider Molly Ivins' summary of The Snow Goose: :The Snow Goose is a tale about a disabled painter living in a lonely lighthouse on the coast of the county of Essex in England. One day a girl brings to him a wounded snow goose, which he nurses back to health. The goose returns each year, as does the girl, and a romance develops between the girl and the artist. But the artist is killed rescuing soldiers after the evacuation of Dunkirk, while the snow goose flies overhead. Andrea Park, in a review of Love of Seven Dolls, notes that Gallico's work has power only as a whole. \\"It is difficult to describe and impossible to pinpoint the tenuous, even nebulous word magic that successfully carries a reader into the world of fantasy and make-believe. It is perhaps delineated as a quality, a kind of fragile atmosphere that, once established, cannot be broken. Mr. Gallico creates this atmosphere when he writes the sequences with Mouche and the puppets.\\" Inexperienced writers are often advised to show rather than to describe. One of the mysteries of Gallico's style is its effectiveness despite his constant violation of this rule. When he wants us to know that a Peyrot is cynical, he says \\"Wholly cynical, he had no regard or respect for man, woman, child, or God.\\" When he wants us to know that Mouche is innocent, he tells us of her \\"innocence and primitive mind.\\" When he wants us to know that Rhayader has a warm heart in his crippled body, he says \\"His body was warped, but his heart was filled with love for wild and hunted things.\\" Many of Gallico's stories are told as a string of assertions and generalities, illuminated only by touches of the particular and specific. Gallico sometimes sets the scene by describing his stories as legends. Within the text of The Snow Goose he says that \\"this story... has been garnered from many sources and from many people. Some of it comes in the form of fragments from men who looked upon strange and violent scenes.\\" Later he writes \\"Now the story becomes fragmentary, and one of these fragments is in the words of the men on leave who told it in the public room of the Crown and Arrow, an East Chapel pub.\\" Given this presentation, it is hardly surprising that it has been taken to be a retelling of an actual legend; Gallico writes that \\"the person and character of the painter are wholly fictional as is the story itself, although I am told that in some quarters the snow goose appearing over Dunkirk has been accepted as legend and I have been compelled to reply to many correspondents that it was sheer invention.\\" Martin Levin wrote that \\"Mr. Gallico has long had a way with the quasi-human--puppets (Love of Seven Dolls), cows (Ludmila,) geese (The Snow Goose)\\" as well as no fewer than five books about cats. Often, Gallico's point of view implies that a nonhuman character in some way really possesses a human spirit. In The Love of Seven Dolls, the puppeteer's relation to his puppets suggests at least a resemblance to dissociative identity disorder or \\"multiple personality\\" disorder, a disorder which was well known to the lay public in the 1950s. Gallico notes that the puppeteer's \\"primitive\\" Senegalese assistant \\"looked upon the puppets 'as living, breathing creatures.'\\" But it remains ambiguous whether the relation between the puppeteer and his puppets is natural or supernatural. This ambiguity is hinted at in the close of the movie adaptation, Lili. Although the puppeteer Paul's hands are engaged in embracing Lili, the four puppets peek around the puppet stage proscenium to smile and applaud in approval, apparently under their own power. The Danny Kaye vehicle, Knock on Wood (1954), turns on a similar theme of a ventriloquist who can express his true self only through his dummy. This film possesses a psychological undertone; Kaye's character's love interest is a psychiatrist. (The pop-psychiatric point of view was prevalent during the late 1940s and 1950s, the same period that produced the psychoanalytic musical Lady in the Dark and the book The Three Faces of Eve.) Popular culture In 2000 J. K. Rowling declared that Gallico's 1968 Manxmouse was one of her favorite childhood books.NBC interview with J.K. Rowling In fact the boggarts appearing in Rowling's Harry Potter books closely resemble Manxmouse's \\"clutterbumph\\" which takes the form of whatever the viewer fears the most. Manxmouse was illustrated by Anne and Janet Grahame-Johnstone who also illustrated The Hundred and One Dalmatians by Dodie Smith. The Japanese animation studio Nippon Animation adapted this tale into a feature-length anime film in 1979, directed by Hiroshi Saito. The anime, titled Tondemo Nezumi Daikatsuyaku: Manxmouse (Manxmouse's Great Activity) in Japanese, was dubbed into English in the 1980s, broadcast on Nickelodeon, and released on video by Celebrity Home Entertainment. A television series, The Adventures of Hiram Holliday (starring Wally Cox) was adapted from a series of Gallico's stories about a newspaper proofreader who had many adventures dealing with Nazis and spies in Europe on the eve of World War II. In Fredric Brown's science-fiction novel What Mad Universe a magazine editor from our own world is accidentally sent to a parallel Earth significantly different from ours; in this parallel world, the editor reads a biography written of a dashing space hero, a figure central to the novel's narrative, which is supposedly written by Paul Gallico. In 1975, the British progressive rock band Camel released an album of work based on Gallico's The Snow Goose. Although the author was initially opposed to the album's release, legal action was evaded on the condition that the band used the words Music Inspired by The Snow Goose on the album's cover.

Glossary of Art, Architecture & Design since 1945, 3rd. ed. In the contemporary English usage, scenography is the combination of technological and material stagecrafts to represent, enact, and produce a sense of place in performance. While inclusive of the techniques of scenic design and set design, scenography is a holistic approach to the study and practice of all aspects of design in performance. Etymology and cultural interpretations The term scenography is of Greek origin (skƒìnƒì, meaning 'stage or scene building'; grapho, meaning 'to describe') originally detailed within Aristotle's Poetics as 'skenographia'. Nevertheless, within continental Europe, the term has been closely aligned with the professional practice of sc√©nographie and is synonymous with the English-language term 'theatre design'. More recently, the term has been used in museography with regards to the curation of museum exhibits. History In what is not the first use of the term, Antonio Caimi, in 1862, describes a category of artists practising pittura scenica e l'architettura teatrale, inspired by the artist Ferdinando Galli-Bibiena, who was also known as a painter of quadratura, or architectural painting (usually trompe-l'≈ìil depictions of architecture on ceilings or walls). Caimi also calls this Arte scenografica, and notes that it required ingenious engineering to create movable sets, or create illusions of environments. The Galli da Bibiena family was a pedigree of scenographic artistry that emerged in late-seventeenth-century Bologna, but spread throughout northern Italy to Austria and Germany. Another large family known for theatrical scenography were members of the Quaglio surname. Caimi goes on to mention practitioners of scenography in the second half of the 18th century and early 19th century in Lombardy, including: Bernardino Galliari, Gaspare Galliari, Pasquale Canna, Pietro Gonzaga, Paolo Landriani, Giovanni Perego, Alessandro Sanquirico, Bomenico Menozzi, Carlo Fontana, Baldassare Cavallotti, Carlo Ferrari, Filippo Peroni, Carlo Ferrario, Enrico Rovecchi, Angelo Moja, Luigi Vimercati, and the brothers Mofta of Modena, among others. A review of the history of Italian-influenced scenic painting, architecture, and design up to the nineteenth century, was provided by Landriani. Usage Scenographic design While also aligned with the professional practice of the scenographer, it is important to distinguish the individual elements that comprise the 'design' of a performance event (such as light, environment, costume, etc.) from the term 'scenography', which is an artistic perspective concerning the visual, experiential, and spatial composition of performance. Influenced by the work of Modernist pioneers Adolphe Appia and Edward Gordon Craig, scenography proposes that design practices within performance are considered an equal partner, alongside other elements such as literary texts and performance technique, within the construction and reception of meaning. The practice of scenography is thereby a holistic approach to the composition of performance and can be applied to the design or curation of events within, and outside of, the conventional theatre environment. Or, as Pamela Howard states in her book What is Scenography?: :\\"Scenography is the seamless synthesis of space, text, research, art, actors, directors and spectators that contributes to an original creation.\\" Joslin McKinney and Philip Butterworth expand upon this to suggest that: :\\"Scenography is not simply concerned with creating and presenting images to an audience; it is concerned with audience reception and engagement. It is a sensory as well as an intellectual experience, emotional as well as rational.\\" Scenographic theory While there is no one theory of scenography, Rachel Hann has argued for a distinction between 'scenography' and 'scenographics'. Hann introduces this framework by plotting the usage of key terminologies: :\\"As part of this differentiation, I approach a scenographic trait as _orientating_ and scenography as a _crafting_. My intention is to map how these evidently related concepts apply to artistic and social scenarios beyond institutional conceptions of theatre. I attempt to dissuade the reader from understanding notions of scenographic as singular and monolithic. My adoption of scenographics stresses the inherent plurality and multiplicities that sustain a scenographic encounter. Consequently, scenographic traits result from a combination of orientating stimuli that exceed strict ontologies of empiricism and complicate the neat separation of theatrical crafts.\\" Scenographics are a collection of place-orienting traits that are often explicit in theatre, yet are also present within other scenographic cultures such as gardening and visual merchandising. These traits draw attention to \\"orders of world\\" by employing methods that sculpt or irritate how distinct worlding orientations (whether that of materiality and texture, familiarity and proximity, as well as ideologies of nation and identity) sit together as part of a broader geography. Hann consolidates this position by arguing that to \\"speak of staging is to speak of how scenographics enact an 'othering' of place\\". Scenographics are \\"interventional acts of orientation that complicate, reveal or score processes of worlding\\". This approach positions scenography as a \\"crafting of place orientation\\" and a theatre-making strategy, alongside dramaturgy and choreography. The usage of place orientation as the loci for scenography seeks to capture an understanding that is inclusive of the physical as well as metaphysical relations that affect how individuals design and experience the assemblage of place. This could be the role of directed sound systems in cultivating a feeling of isolation; the usage of a tightly focused lantern to re-orientate the spatial dimensions of a place; the scent of an old well-worn desk; along with how costumes mould relations between bodies and stage environments. In practice, Hann argues that it is the interrelations between these distinct methods of scenography (costume, scenery, light, sound) that give rise to an act of scenography, where \\"scenography is neither exclusively visual nor spatial\\" Lastly, Hann proposes that scenographics are formative to all staged atmospheres by arguing that there \\"are no stages without scenographics\\". This is based on the argument that \\"all stages are also scenes\\" that challenges the \\"deterministic assumption that stages precede scenography\\". In this model, stages become manifest through the place-orienting traits of scenographics (rather than the other way around). The implications of this are that all theatre is scenographic - even if it has no defined objects or 'setting' - as all theatre is performed on a stage. Hann summarises this position by using the hybrid 'stage-scene' when discussing the tensions between the histories of these practices, particularly with reference to original Greek skene as a physical tent or hut that ultimately shaped current conceptualizations of 'the stage'.

L. Doctorow, published in 1975. It is a work of historical fiction mainly set in the New York City area from 1902 until 1912. In 1998, the Modern Library ranked Ragtime number 86 on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. TIME magazine included the novel in its TIME 100 Best English-Language Novels from 1923 to 2005. Plot summary The novel centers on a wealthy family living in New Rochelle, New York, referred to as Father, Mother, Mother's Younger Brother, Grandfather, and 'the little boy', Father and Mother's young son. The family business is the manufacture of flags and fireworks, an easy source of wealth due to the national enthusiasm for patriotic displays. Father joins Robert Peary's expedition to the North Pole, and his return sees a change in his relationship with his wife, who has experienced independence in his absence. Mother's Younger Brother is a genius at explosives and fireworks but is an insecure, unhappy character who chases after love and excitement. He becomes obsessed with the notorious socialite Evelyn Nesbit, stalking her and embarking on a brief, unsatisfactory affair with her. Into this insecure setup comes an abandoned black child, then his severely depressed mother, Sarah. Coalhouse Walker, the child's father, visits regularly to win Sarah's affections. A professional musician, well dressed and well spoken, he gains the family's respect and overcomes their prejudice initially by playing ragtime music on their piano. Things go well until he is humiliated by a racist fire crew, led by Will Conklin, who vandalize his Model T Ford. He begins a pursuit of redress by legal action but discovers he cannot hope to win because of the inherent prejudice of the system. Sarah is killed in an attempt to aid him, and Coalhouse uses the money he was saving for their wedding to pay for an extravagant funeral. Having exhausted legal resources, Coalhouse begins killing firemen and bombing firehouses to force the city to meet his demands: that his Model T be restored to its original condition and Conklin be turned over to him for justice. Mother unofficially adopts Sarah and Coalhouse's neglected child over Father's objections, putting strain on their marriage. With a group of angry young men, all of whom refer to themselves as \\"Coalhouse Walker\\", Coalhouse continues his vigilante campaign and is joined by Younger Brother, who brings his knowledge of explosives. Coalhouse and his gang storm the Morgan Library, taking the priceless collection hostage and wiring the building with dynamite. Father is drawn into the escalating conflict as a mediator, as is Booker T. Washington. Coalhouse agrees to exchange Conklin's life for safe passage for his men, who leave in his restored Model T. Coalhouse is then shot as he surrenders to the authorities. Interwoven with this story is a depiction of life in the tenement slums of New York city, focused on an Eastern European immigrant referred to as Tateh, who struggles to support himself and his daughter after driving her mother off for accepting money for sex with her employer. The girl's beauty attracts the attention of Evelyn Nesbit, who provides financial support. When Tateh learns Nesbit's identity, however, he takes his daughter out of the city. Tateh is a talented artist and earns a living cutting out novelty paper silhouettes on the street. He tries working in a factory, where he experiences a successful workers' strike, but becomes disillusioned when he sees it change little about the workers' lives, although in the final chapter he still describes himself as a socialist. He starts making and selling moving picture books to a novelty toy company, becoming a pioneer of animation in the motion picture industry. Tateh becomes wealthy and styles himself \\"the Baron\\" in order to move more easily through high society. He meets and falls in love with Mother, who marries him after Father is killed in the sinking of the RMS Lusitania. They adopt each other's children, as well as Coalhouse's son, and move to California. Mixed into the interwoven stories are subplots following prominent figures of the day, including those named above as well as in the Historical figures section below.  Historical figures  The novel is unusual for the irreverent way that historical figures and fictional characters are woven into the narrative, making for surprising connections and linking different events and trains of thought about fame and success, on the one hand, and poverty and racism on the other. Harry Houdini plays a prominent yet incidental part, reflecting on success and mortality. Arch-capitalist financier J.P. Morgan, pursuing his complex delusions of grandeur, is delivered a plainly spoken comeuppance from down-to-earth Henry Ford. Socialite Evelyn Nesbit becomes involved with the slum family and is aided by the anarchist agitator Emma Goldman. The black moderate politician Booker T. Washington tries to negotiate with Coalhouse Walker, without success. Other historical characters mentioned include the polar explorer Robert Peary and his black assistant Matthew Henson, the architect Stanford White, Nesbit's mentally unbalanced husband Harry Kendall Thaw (who murdered White for allegedly sexually assaulting Nesbit when she was 15), Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, Countess Sophie Chotek, Sigmund Freud, who rides the Tunnel of Love at Coney Island with Carl Jung, Theodore Dreiser, Jacob Riis, and the Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata. Several real-life New York City officials also appear in the book: Manhattan District Attorney Charles S. Whitman and Police Commissioner Rhinelander Waldo. Influences The name Coalhouse Walker is a reference to Heinrich von Kleist's German novella Michael Kohlhaas (1811). The part of the story involving Coalhouse's humiliation and his increasingly unbalanced search for a dignified resolution closely follow the plot and details of the earlier work by Kleist. The connection was acknowledged by Doctorow, but it is a matter of opinion among critics whether this constitutes literary adaptation or plagiarism. Literary significance The novel was a nominee for the Nebula Award for Best Novel and won the National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction in 1975, and the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters Award in 1976. Fredric Jameson's 1991 book Postmodernism, or The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism devotes five pages to Doctorow's Ragtime, to illustrate the crisis of historiography and a resistance to interpretation. Film and theatrical adaptations  The novel was adapted for an eponymous 1981 movie and 1998 musical.

Superkart is a form of motorsport road racing in which the class is a racing vehicle sized like a kart but with several characteristics more strongly associated with open-wheel racing cars. The most obvious difference between a Superkart and any other form of kart is that they have full aerodynamic bodykits and can race on car circuits over 1,500 metres in length. The power unit, most often, but not exclusively two stroke 250 cc engines, can be specially designed kart engines or production motorcycle engines with either five or six-speed sequential gearboxes. Owing to their high top speed and superb cornering ability, a Superkart's aerodynamic bodywork includes a front fairing, larger sidepods, and a rear wing. They use either tires and wheels and most often race on full size auto-racing circuits. 250 cc Superkarts often set faster lap times than much more expensive and technically advanced racing machines.Magny Cours F1 - Superkarts fire the crowds imagination !! - 6 July 2007Superkarts ‚Äî Super Speeds - Road & Track, November 2005 Some British and Australian classes also include 125 cc gearbox karts.

Performance Powered by a 2-stroke 250 cc engine producing for an overall weight including the driver of 205 kilograms, Superkarts have a power/weight ratio of 330 W/kg (440 hp/tonne)(c.5 lbs/hp).

Braking is performed in a straighter line than with a rear brake-only sprint kart, though the rate of deceleration is considerably greater.\\" - Superkart Thrill Ride, page 2 - Road & Track,October 2005 A Superkart is capable of braking from to standstill in around 2 seconds, and taking corners at nearly 3 'g' (30 m/s¬≤).Performance ; 250cc International - Queensland Superkart Club At some circuits, Superkarts are the outright lap- record holders,Morgan Park Raceway Lap Records at others they run at around Formula 3 lap times. Ben Wilshire British 125 Open class Superkart British Superkart Divisions : *Division 1 is open to 250 cc karts with one or two cylinders and five or six speed gearboxes. Typically the karts produce and are capable of - the fastest form of kart. This formula was previously known as Formula E, which was changed to avoid confusion with the Formula E series. *Division 2 is for single cylinder karts with 5 and 6-speed boxes. Typically these karts produce and are capable of . However, being lighter than the twin cylinder (Division 1) karts they can be as quick on twisted circuits. This formula was previously known as 250 International. However the main British series is for single cylinder 250 cc karts with 5-speed only, also known as 250 National. *125 Open - Powered by 125 cc engines and again featuring 6-speed sequential gearboxes, this class uses lighter chassis than the 250's and are the most agile of long circuit superkarts, they are capable of . *125 ICC (KZ) - Powered by similar 6-speed 125 cc engines to the 125 Open class with tighter tuning restrictions, this CIK sprint kart class hosts some of the closest Superkart racing in the UK. 2007 Australian 250 cc International champion Warren McIlveen (Stockman-Honda) Australian Superkart Classes: Superkarting in Australia has, since 1989, referred to any form of racing kart to race on full-size motor racing circuits, usually as sanctioned by the Australian ASN, CAMS. *250 cc International - commonly referred to as twins or inters, these karts are powered by twin cylinder engines and usually have 6-speed sequential gearboxes. Several European and North American chassis are popular in addition to locally developed designs. *250 cc National - single cylinder class, the 250 National class is powered by 250 cc motocross engines and also feature 6-speed sequential gearboxes. *125 cc Gearbox - most often powered by 125 cc Honda and Yamaha Grand Prix motorcycle engines equipped with six speed sequential gearboxes, this Superkart class uses mostly the same chassis as the 250 classes. They run at lighter weights than the 250 classes, which makes for close racing with mid-field 250 Nationals at some circuits. *80 cc Gearbox - also dominated by Honda and Yamaha motor cycle engines, 80 cc gearbox Superkarts is no longer a sanctioned class in Australian racing. Some 80 cc karts were noticeably smaller than 125/250 cc gearbox karts, with 'laydown' style karts, where the driver lies flat in the kart rather than sitting upright, proliferating. Last contested at national level in 2005. and state level in 2008, some 80 cc karts survive racing in the 125 cc division at state level, but are uncompetitive as they no longer run at lighter homologated weight levels. *125 cc Rotax Max - a cross-over class from Australian short-circuit non-gearbox sprint kart racing to allow easier and cheaper graduation from Sprint karting to long circuit racing. Three national championships exist for two weight divisions, Heavy and Light, and also sometimes a Junior division for drivers under the age of sixteen which run a version of the Rotax Max engine without a power valve. Rotax Max karts frequently race amongst gearbox equipped Superkarts at state championship level, while racing for their own titles at national level. *100 cc Another non-gearbox class, 100 cc also was split into Heavy, Light and Junior classes, and was last contested in 2002 and has since been replaced completely by Rotax Max. United States Superkart Classes: 250cc Shifter Kart *250 cc Formula/E or F/E - Twin cylinder, 6-speed, liquid cooled Grand Prix motorcycle engines such as the Honda RS250, Yamaha TZ250 or made for karting engines such as the BRC250. *250 cc Inter-Continental E or IC/E - Single cylinder, 5 or 6-speed, liquid cooled Grand Prix motorcycle engines. Spectacle Road & Track reports that Supercarts cost between $15,000 to $20,000 USD in 2005. Entries of 60 or more are common in Britain. Overtaking tends to be easy, as there is room to get past, so the races tend to be full of action. Race lengths tend to be around 20‚Äì25 miles (30‚Äì40 km), because the fuel tanks are quite small, so at most meetings that feature Superkarts, the karts race is often a brief, spectacular highlight (U.S. Superkart races are a timed 30-minute race; Pre- Final on Saturday, Final on Sunday). A global category, Superkarts are endorsed by the FIA, and were featured as a support category to the French Formula 1 Grand Prix at Magny-Cours in 2007 where they bettered Porsche Supercup lap times.

An early and primary event in the story is the abandonment of a passenger ship in distress by its crew, including a young British seaman named Jim. He is publicly censured for this action and the novel follows his later attempts at coming to terms with himself and his past. In 1998, the Modern Library ranked Lord Jim 85th on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. Plot summary Recovered from an injury, Jim seeks a position on the Patna, a steamer serving the transport of 800 \\"pilgrims of an exacting belief\\" to a port on the Red Sea. He is hired as first mate. After some days of smooth sailing, the ship hits something in the night and begins taking on water. Captain Gustav thinks the ship will sink, and Jim agrees, but wants to put the passengers on the few boats before that can happen. The captain and two other crewmen think only to save themselves, and prepare to lower a boat. The helmsmen remain, as no order has been given to do otherwise. In a crucial moment, Jim jumps into the boat with the captain. A few days later, they are picked up by an outbound steamer. When they reach port, they learn that the Patna and its passengers were brought in safely by a crew from a French navy ship. The captain's actions in abandoning both ship and passengers are against the code of the sea, and the crew is publicly vilified. When the other men leave town before the magistrate's court can be convened, Jim is the only crew member left to testify. All lose their certificates to sail. Brierly, a captain of perfect reputation who is on the panel of the court, commits suicide days after the trial. Captain Charles Marlow attends the trial and meets Jim, whose behavior he condemns, but the young man intrigues him. Wracked with guilt, Jim confesses his shame to Marlow, who finds him a place to live in a friend's home. Jim is accepted there but leaves abruptly when an engineer who had also abandoned the ship appears to work at the house. Jim then finds work as a ship chandler's clerk in ports of the East Indies, always succeeding in the job then leaving abruptly when the Patna is mentioned. In Bangkok, he gets in a fistfight. Marlow realises that Jim needs a new situation, something that will take him far away from modern ports and keep him occupied so that he can finally forget his guilt. Marlow consults his friend Stein, who sees that Jim is a romantic and considers his situation. Stein offers Jim to be his trade representative or factor in Patusan, a village on a remote island shut off from most commerce, which Jim finds to be exactly what he needs. After his initial challenge of entering the settlement of native Malay and Bugis people, Jim manages to earn their respect by relieving them of the depredations of the bandit Sherif Ali and protecting them from the corrupt local Malay chief, Rajah Tunku Allang. He builds a solid link with Doramin, the Bugis friend of Stein, and his son Dain Waris. For his leadership, the people call him \\"tuan Jim\\", or Lord Jim. Jim also wins the love of Jewel, a young woman of mixed race, and is \\"satisfied... nearly\\". Marlow visits Patusan once, two years after Jim arrived there, and sees his success. Jewel does not believe that Jim will stay, as her father left her mother, and she is not reassured that Marlow or any other will not arrive to take him from her. Her mother had been married before her death to Cornelius, previously given the factor's role by Stein for her benefit. Cornelius is a lazy, jealous, and brutal man who treats his stepdaughter cruelly and steals the supplies Stein sends for sale; he is displaced by Jim's arrival and resents him for it. \\"Gentleman\\" Brown, a marauder captain notorious for his evil ways, then arrives in Patusan, his small crew on the brink of starvation. The local defence led by Dain Waris manages to prevent the marauders from looting the village and holds them entrenched in place while Jim is away in the island's interior. When Jim returns, Brown deceptively wins Jim's mercy, who hesitantly negotiates to allow them to leave Patusan unobstructed, but reminds Brown that the long passage down river to the sea will be guarded by armed men. Cornelius sees his chance to get rid of Jim. He tells Brown of a side channel that will bypass most of the defenses, which Brown uses, stopping briefly to ambush the defenders he finds. Dain Waris is killed among others, and Brown sails on, leaving Cornelius behind; Jim's man Tamb' Itam kills Cornelius for his betrayal. Jim is mortified when he receives word of the death of his good friend, and resolves to leave Patusan. Jewel, who had wanted Jim to attack Brown and his ship, is distraught. Jim then goes directly to Doramin and takes responsibility for the death of his only son. Doramin uses his flintlock pistols, given him by Stein, to shoot Jim in the chest. On his regular route, Marlow arrives at Stein's house a few days after this event, finding Jewel and Tamb' Itam there, and tries to make sense of what happened. Jewel stays in Stein's house. Characters *Marlow: Sea captain in the merchant service of the British Empire who helps Jim after his fall from grace, trying to understand how \\"one of us\\" could lack the bravery and judgment expected of seamen. Marlow is also the narrator of three of Conrad's other works: Heart of Darkness, Youth, and Chance. *Jim: Young parson's son who takes to the sea, training for the merchant service as steam ships mix with sailing ships. He dreams of heroic deeds. He is a strong, tall, blond Englishman whose life is the story told by Marlow. *Captain Gustav: Captain of the Patna, an Australian born in Germany, who is interested in the money made from this ship, with no concern for his honour as a captain. He is a man of huge girth. He orders the engineers to free a boat for them to leave the ship. After learning ashore that the ship came in ahead of them, he knows his certificate will be cancelled and he leaves, never seen again. *Ship's engineers: Three men who keep the steam boiler working; one is George, who dies of a heart attack on the Patna as the others leave the ship. Another shows up later by chance at the same place where Jim is living, driving Jim away. The third becomes completely drunk, left in the hospital. *Montague Brierly: Captain in the merchant service with a perfect reputation. He sits in the court that hears the case of the Patna crew, telling Marlow that Jim ought to hide somewhere, as he can never work as a seaman again. A few days after the trial, this superior man (\\"indeed, had you been Emperor of East and West, you could not have ignored your inferiority in his presence\\", Chapter 6) kills himself by jumping off his ship at sea, leaving no explanation. *Stein: Head of Stein & Co., friend of Marlow, and a man with a long, interesting life. He has had success in trade in the East, collecting produce from various ports in the Dutch colonial areas and settling far from his native Bavaria after losing in the uprisings of 1848. He learned botany and natural philosophy, which became his passionate hobby, gaining him a reputation for all the specimens he sent to contacts in Europe in this age of scientific discovery. He was married and had a child, both lost to him by disease. He understands Jim's temperament instantly. *Jewel: Daughter of a Dutch-Malay woman and a white European man, never named, who deserted them. Her stepfather is Cornelius. Her mother died a year or two before she meets Jim. *Cornelius: Former factor for Stein & Co., on account of his wife, whom Stein admired. He is a lazy man of no morals, and brutal. He is Malacca Portuguese. When replaced by Jim, he does not leave the area, nor does he find any useful occupation for himself. He connives with the marauder Brown to kill Jim, which happens indirectly when Brown's men spontaneously kills Dain Waris. Cornelius is killed by Tamb' Itam, who sees him after the attack and realizes the role he played. *De Jongh: Friend to Marlow, and the last of the ship's chandlers who accepts Jim on Marlow's recommendation. *Doramin: Old chief of the Bugis people in Patusan and father of Dain Waris, his only son. He was a friend to Stein, and the two exchanged gifts on parting: Doramin gave a ring to Stein, and Stein gave pistols to Doramin. He becomes an ally to Jim. *Dain Waris: The only son of Doramin; a young, strong, and fiercely devoted leader of his people. He becomes fast friends with Jim. *Sherif Ali: Local bandit who is a trial to all others in Patusan, extorting fees and stealing crops and resources from others. He is defeated by Jim, but not killed. *Rajah Tunku Allang: Malay chief in Patusan who took Jim prisoner on his first entry into the country. Jim escapes, starting life there on his own terms. *Tamb' Itam: Malay servant and loyal bodyguard to Jim. *Captain Brown: A cruel captain of a latter-day pirate crew, who kills because he can, and is not a success in life. He has a ship in poor condition and a crew of men similar to him when he runs short of food near Patusan. He goes up the river to the village, which successfully forces him to retreat to a nearby hilltop. On leaving, Brown orders a vengeful attack on Patusan's defenders, killing Dain Waris, which leads to the end of Jim's life. Marlow meets Brown in a hospital just before his death, and hears the story of the encounter from Brown's viewpoint. Allusions to historical events The opening event in Lord Jim may have been based in part on an actual abandonment of a ship. On 17 July 1880, S.S. Jeddah sailed from Singapore bound for Penang and Jeddah, with 778 men, 147 women and 67 children on board. The passengers were Muslims from the Malay states, travelling to Mecca for the hajj (holy pilgrimage). Jeddah sailed under the British flag and was crewed largely by British officers. After rough weather conditions, the Jeddah began taking on water. The hull sprang a large leak, the water rose rapidly, and the captain and officers abandoned the heavily listing ship. They were picked up by another vessel and taken to Aden where they told a story of violent passengers and a foundering ship. The pilgrims were left to their fate, and apparently certain death. However, on 8 August 1880 a French steamship towed Jeddah into Aden ‚Äì the pilgrims had survived. An official inquiry followed, as it does in the novel. The inspiration for the character of Jim was the chief mate of the Jeddah, \\"Austin\\" Podmore Williams, whose grave was tracked down to Singapore's Bidadari Cemetery by Gavin Young in his book, In Search of Conrad. As in the novel, Williams created a new life for himself, returning to Singapore and becoming a successful ship's chandler. Conrad may also have been influenced by the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace's 1869 account of his travels and of the native peoples of the islands of Southeast Asia, The Malay Archipelago; the character Stein is based on Wallace. The second part of the novel is based in some part on the life of James Brooke, the first Rajah of Sarawak. Brooke was an Indian-born English adventurer who in the 1840s managed to gain power and set up an independent state in Sarawak, on the island of Borneo. Some critics, however, think that the fictional Patusan was intended not to be part of Borneo but of Sumatra. Recognition In 1998, the Modern Library Board ranked Lord Jim 85th on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. In 1999, the French newspaper Le Monde conducted a contest among readers to rank which of 200 novels of the 20th century they remembered best. Seventeen thousand responses yielded the final list, which placed Lord Jim at number 75. The complete list is found in Le Monde's 100 Books of the Century in English, and also in French Wikipedia. Critical interpretation The novel is in two main parts, firstly Jim's lapse aboard the Patna and his consequent fall, and secondly an adventure story about Jim's rise and the tale's denouement in the fictional country of Patusan, presumed a part of the Indonesian archipelago. The main themes surround young Jim's potential (\\"he was one of us\\", says Marlow, the narrator) thus sharpening the drama and tragedy of his fall, his subsequent struggle to redeem himself, and Conrad's further hints that personal character flaws will almost certainly emerge given an appropriate catalyst. Conrad, speaking through his character Stein, called Jim a romantic figure, and indeed Lord Jim is arguably Conrad's most romantic novel. In addition to the lyricism and beauty of Conrad's descriptive writing, the novel is remarkable for its sophisticated structure. The bulk of the novel is told in the form of a story recited by the character Marlow to a group of listeners, and the conclusion is presented in the form of a letter from Marlow. Within Marlow's narration, other characters also tell their own stories in nested dialogue. Thus, events in the novel are described from several viewpoints, and often out of chronological order. The reader is left to form an impression of Jim's interior psychological state from these multiple external points of view. Some critics (using deconstruction) contend that this is impossible and that Jim must forever remain an enigma, whereas others argue that there is an absolute reality the reader can perceive and that Jim's actions may be ethically judged. However, there is an analysis that shows in the novel a fixed pattern of meaning and an implicit unity that Conrad said the novel has. As he wrote to his publisher four days after completing Lord Jim, it is \\"the development of one situation, only one really, from beginning to end.\\" A metaphysical question pervades the novel and helps unify it: whether the \\"destructive element\\" that is the \\"spirit\\" of the Universe has intention‚Äîand, beyond that, malevolent intention‚Äîtoward any particular individual or is, instead, indiscriminate, impartial, and indifferent. Depending (as a corollary) on the answer to that question is the degree to which the particular individual can be judged responsible for what he does or does not do; and various responses to the question or its corollary are provided by the several characters and voices in the novel. The omniscient narrator of the first part remarks of the trial: \\"They wanted facts. Facts! They demanded facts from him, as if facts could explain anything!\\" Ultimately, Jim remains mysterious, as seen through a mist: \\"that mist in which he loomed interesting if not very big, with floating outlines ‚Äì a straggler yearning inconsolably for his humble place in the ranks... It is when we try to grapple with another man's intimate need that we perceive how incomprehensible, wavering, and misty are the beings that share with us the sight of the stars and the warmth of the sun.\\" It is only through Marlow's recitation that Jim lives for us ‚Äì the relationship between the two men incites Marlow to \\"tell you the story, to try to hand over to you, as it were, its very existence, its reality ‚Äì the truth disclosed in a moment of illusion.\\" Postcolonial interpretations of the novel, while not as intensive as that of Heart of Darkness, point to similar themes in the two novels ‚Äì the protagonist sees himself as part of a 'civilising mission', and the story involves a 'heroic adventure' at the height of the British Empire's hegemony. Conrad's use of a protagonist with a dubious history has been interpreted as an expression of increasing doubts with regard to the Empire's mission; literary critic Elleke Boehmer sees the novel, along with Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, as part of a growing suspicion that 'a primitive and demoralising other' is present within the governing order. Comics adaptations George Evans adapted the novel into a comic book in the 1950s.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/e/evans.htm Film adaptations The book has twice been adapted into film: *Lord Jim (1925), directed by Victor Fleming. *Lord Jim (1965), directed by Richard Brooks and starring Peter O'Toole as Jim. The 1979 Hindi film Kaala Patthar has strong traces of Lord Jim. Allusions and references to Lord Jim in other works *Jim's ill-fated ship, the Patna, is also mentioned in Jorge Luis Borges' short story \\"The Immortal\\". *The Disney motion picture, Spooner, used the story of Lord Jim as a shadow and point of comparison for the dilemmas faced by the movie's main character, Harry Spooner/Michael Norlan (played by Robert Urich). *Lord Jim is referenced in the final section of Herman Wouk's 1951 novel The Caine Mutiny as the captain of the Caine struggles to come to terms with his own decision to abandon ship. *Lord Jim is the name of a boat, and subsequently the nickname of the boat's owner, Richard Blake, in Penelope Fitzgerald's 1979 Booker Prize-winning novel Offshore. *Lord Jim is referenced in the song \\"Conrad\\" by English singer-songwriter Ben Howard: \\"You were the boat that bridged / In the tale of Conrad / We will never be the change / To the weather and the sea and you knew that.\\" *In the Mexican film Amor Libre, directed by Jaime Humberto Hermosillo, the lead characters July (Alma Muriel) and Julia (Julissa) are reading the book.

The earliest known ancestors of the Floris de Vriendt family, then still called only ‚Äòde Vriendt‚Äô, were residents of Brussels where they practiced the craft of stonemason and stonecutter which was passed on from father to son. One of Frans' ancestors became in 1406 a master of the Brussels stonemasons guild. A family member, Jan Florisz. de Vriendt, left his native Brussels and settled in Antwerp in the mid-15th century. His patronymic name ‚ÄòFloris‚Äô became the common family name in subsequent generations.

Portrait of an elderly lady Documentary evidence about the life of Frans Floris is scarce. Most of what we know about the youth and training of Frans Floris is based on the early biographer Karel van Mander's biography of the artist. At ten pages long it is one of the most detailed biographies in van Mander's Het Schilder-boeck published in 1604. According to van Mander, Frans Floris was the son of the stonecutter Cornelis I de Vriendt (died 1538). Like his brothers, Frans began as a student of sculpture, but later he gave up sculpture for painting. Floris went to Li√®ge where he studied with the prominent painter Lambert Lombard. The choice for Lombard as a teacher was surprising since Antwerp was a cultural centre with many outstanding painters. He may have chosen Lombard as his brother Cornelis was good friends with Lombard, whom he had met in Rome around 1538. It is also possible that Frans trained as a painter in Antwerp before studying under Lombard. Floris became a master in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1539‚Äì40. Lombard encouraged Frans Floris to study in Italy. He traveled to Rome probably as early as 1541 or 1542 and became fascinated with Italian contemporary painting (particularly Michelangelo and Raphael) and the Classical sculpture and art of Rome. He kept a notebook of sketches, which his pupils would later etch. Floris visited other cities in Italy including Mantua and Genoa. The Fall of Man Upon his return to Antwerp around 1545, Frans Floris opened a workshop on the Italian model. He became the leading history painter and was called the ‚ÄòFlemish Raphael‚Äô. He enjoyed the patronage of prominent personalities such as the wealthy Antwerp banker Niclaes Jonghelinck for whose house he painted a series of ten compositions on the legend of Hercules and seven compositions on the liberal arts. He also painted 14 large panels for the duke of Aarschot's palace of Beaumont. Local nobility including the knights of the Golden Fleece, the Prince of Orange and the Counts of Egmont and Horn (later the leaders of the Dutch Revolt) visited Floris at his home, attracted by his artistic reputation as well as his ability to talk with ‚Äògreat insight and judgment on any topic‚Äô. Frans Jozef van den Branden, ', Antwerp: J.-E. Buschmann, 1883 He also moved in the circle of the leading humanists such as Abraham Ortelius, Christophe Plantin, Lucas de Heere, Lambert Lombard, Dominicus Lampsonius and Hieronymus Cock. This group of intellectuals and artists was the first to develop theories on art and the role of artists in the Low Countries.Jeroen Vandommele, p. 255 In 1549 Floris was commissioned by the Antwerp city authorities to design the decorations for the Joyous entry into Antwerp of Charles V of Spain and the Infante Philip. The Last Judgement His brother Cornelis designed a palace for him in Antwerp with a fa√ßade of blue limestone and with luxurious decorations such as gilded leather wall-coverings in the bedroom.Frans Floris in Karel van Mander, Het Schilderboeck, 1604 The fa√ßade itself was designed by Frans. His design program for the fa√ßade was intended to illustrate the high status of artists in society. He painted the fa√ßade with seven personifications symbolizing the qualities and skills of an artist: Accuracy (Diligentia), Practice (Usus), Labor (Labor), Diligence (Industria), Experience (Experientia), Praise (Lauda) and Architecture (Architectura). Above the doorway of the house a relief depicted the sciences (the seven liberal arts together with painting and architectures) as the principal components of human society. The unknown monogrammist TG portrayed the fa√ßade in 1576 in a print.Jeroen Vandommele, p. 263-265 Jozef Linnig made a drawing of the palace in the 19th century but by that time most of the decoration of the fa√ßade had disappeared. Floris expressed similar ideas in his composition The awakening of the Arts (Museo de Arte de Ponce).Jozef Linnig, The house of Frans Floris at Musea en Erfgoed Antwerpen In 1547 Floris married Clara Boudewijns and the couple had one daughter and two sons. The sons Frans and Baptist were later trained as artists by their father. Baptist died young while Frans moved to Italy where he had a successful career. The house of Frans Floris by Jozef Linnig, Plantin-Moretus Museum Frans Floris was known to be hardworking as is testified by his motto: Als ick werck, dan leef ick: als ick spelen gae, dan sterf ick. This means \\"When I work, I live: when I play, I die.\\" Van Mander recounts that Floris nearly always had a large commission in his workshop on which he would work late at night, and that when he dozed off his pupils would take off his shoes and stockings and put him to bed before they left. Van Mander cites Frans Menton who asserted Floris was loved by his pupils for allowing them more freedom than other Antwerp masters. When a small group of his pupils met up for a reunion after his death they were able to compile a list of 120 of his pupils.Isaack Claessen Cloeck, in Frans Floris biography in Karel van Mander's Schilderboeck, 1604 Van Mander recounts that at the end of his life Floris became heavily indebted and started drinking. The debts were likely related to his high costs of living as well as the impact of the Beeldenstorm or Iconoclastic Fury that commenced from the 1560s and reached its peak in 1566. During the period of iconoclasm, Catholic art and many forms of church fittings and decoration were destroyed by nominally Calvinist Protestant crowds as part of the Protestant Reformation. It is said Floris never recovered from the shock of seeing his artworks destroyed. Instead, he found himself in a downward spiral in both his personal and professional affairs. His disaffection was so great that he even refused to restore his own works damaged during the Beeldenstorm. He virtually stopped painting after 1566 and his place as the leading history painter in the Habsburg Netherlands was taken by a younger generation of artists among whom Marten de Vos became the most prominent.Edward H. Wouk, pp. 61‚Äì62 Van Mander recounts that while working on a large commission for the grand prior of Spain, Floris became ill and died on 1 October 1570 in Antwerp. His paintings for the grand prior were finished by his studio assistants Frans Pourbus the Elder and Chrispijn van den Broeck. Poems were written about him by Dominicus Lampsonius and the poet-painter Lucas de Heere, who according to van Mander, was his pupil. Pupils Rijckaert Aertsz as Saint Luke. Floris himself models the pigment grinder The Netherlands Institute for Art History identifies the following pupils of Frans Floris: Joos de Beer (later the teacher of Abraham Bloemaert), George Boba, Hendrick van den Broeck, Marten van Cleve, Ambrosius Francken, Frans Francken I, Frans Menton (known for schutterstukken in Alkmaar), and Isaac Claesz van Swanenburg. Van Mander lists 26 pupils of Floris, but he may have had as many as 120 assistants. Van Mander's list includes Chrispijn van den Broeck, Joris van Ghent (who served Philip II of Spain), Marten (and his brother Hendrick) van Cleve, Lucas de Heere, Anthonie Blocklandt van Montfoort, Thomas van Zirickzee, Simon van Amsterdam, Isaac Claesz van Swanenburg (spelled Isaack Claessen Cloeck), Frans Menton, George Boba, the three Francken brothers Jeroen, Frans and Ambrosius, Joos de Beer, Hans de Maier van Herentals, Apert Francen van Delft, Lois van Brussel, Thomas van Coelen, Hans Daelmans van Antwerpen, Evert van Amersfoort, Herman van der Mast, Damiaen van der Goude, Jeroen van Vissenaken, Steven Croonenborgh uyt den Hage, and Dirck Verlaen van Haerlem. The long list of pupils and assistants shows that Frans Floris had upon his return to Antwerp adopted the studio practices that he had witnessed in Italy. He relied on a large number of assistants who came from all over the southern and northern Netherlands and even Germany. Floris invented and developed the use of study heads, which were life-size representations of people's heads, which he painted in oil on panel. These were then given to his assistants, either for literal transcription or for freer adaptations. His assistants' role is not always clear and may have ranged from painting after his study heads to adding landscape backgrounds. They also copied his compositions, either in paint or on paper, for reproduction by engravers. Work =General= Fall of the Rebellious Angels Comparatively few of his works have survived, possibly because many were destroyed during the iconoclastic destructions in Antwerp in the second half of the sixteenth century. The earliest extant canvas by Floris is the Mars and Venus ensnared by Vulcan in the Gem√§ldegalerie, Berlin (1547). Frans Floris is mainly known for his altarpieces, compositions with mythological and allegorical themes and to a lesser extent, for his portraits. He played an important role in introducing the genre of mythological and allegorical subject-matter into Flanders. He was one of the first Netherlandish artists to travel to Italy and study the latest developments in art as well as the Classical relics of Rome. The principal contemporary influences were Michelangelo from whom he borrowed the heroic treatment of the nude and Raphael whom he emulated by developing a ‚Äòrelief-like‚Äô idiom. Floris did, however, not abandon the traditional Netherlandish technique of oil paint, which allowed him to fuse its detailed, descriptive properties with his radically new visual language, in which embellishments were reduced to a minimum and the nude played a prominent role.Edward H. Wouk, p. 43 Floris‚Äô early work of around 1545 shows most clearly the influence of his Italian sojourn. It shows similarities with the work of other Romanists such as Lambert Lombard and Pieter Coecke van Aelst. Later his style became increasingly monumental. His compositional skills improved in that he showed more skill in the arrangement of the figures. After 1560 his work became more Mannerist and the sculptural handling of the figures gave way to a more painterly approach. His palette evolved towards the monochrome. Later he may have been influenced by the school of Fontainebleau as his figures became more elegant and the works more refined. Just like his brother Cornelis was able to exert influence on contemporary architecture across the borders of Flanders through the medium of the Antwerp publishers, Floris‚Äô work found wide circulation through engravings made by the leading Antwerp engravers.Carl Van de Velde. \\"Cornelis Floris II.\\"] Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 26 March 2015 Hieronymus Cock, Philip Galle and Cornelis Cort were the principal engravers involved in this effort but others such as Johannes Wierix, Balthazar van den Bos, Pieter van der Heyden, Frans Huys, Dirck Volckertsz. Coornhert and Jan Sadeler I also made engravings after the works of Frans Floris. Floris also made original designs for series of prints engraved in Antwerp. =Portraits= Study of the head of a woman He was a very skilled portraitist but, possibly because of the lower ranking of portraiture in the hierarchy of pictorial genres, he painted only a few (possibly about 12) portraits. He is still regarded as an innovator of the genre as he introduced a new level of expressiveness and accentuated psychological presence. Floris pioneered two types of images in the late 1540s: expressive portraits of individual sitters and head studies on panels. By 1562, Floris‚Äô distinctive head studies had become a form of authorial performance, which bore witness to his creative genius and the workshop practices that he had imported from Italy. While the head studies were made for his own use as well as for the pupils and assistants in his workshop, some were clearly also produced as artworks in their own right. The rapid, expressive brushwork of these panels suggests that he painted some heads as creative studies and thus anticipate in a certain way the tronies of 17th- century artists. These studies became collector's items for local art lovers. The head studies testify to the self-conscious artistic culture of Antwerp, where they were valued for their authorship rather than their preparatory value.Edward H. Wouk, p. 45-46 Family portrait Frans Floris made a self- portrait, the original of which has been lost and which is known through a copy in the Kunsthistorisches Museum. He included self-portraits in some of his religious works such as the composition Rijckart Aertsz as Saint Luke in which he included himself as the pigment grinder and in the composition Allegory of the Trinity (Louvre) where beneath Christ's outstretched right arm he painted his self-portrait, which appears out of scale with the other heads around him. The inclusion of his portrait in the latter composition suggests that the painting held a highly personal meaning for the artist. It has been observed that after the iconoclasm of the Beeldenstorm Flemish artists started including their portraits in religious compositions in order to show their personal commitment to the particular message that the compositions were trying to convey.Edward H. Wouk, p. 41-44 Floris painted some family portraits. An example is the Family portrait in the Museum Wuyts-Van Campen en Baron Caroly, Lier, which is dated 1561. It was traditionally believed to depict the Berchem family, a prominent family. However, this is no longer accepted unanimously. The painting has two inscriptions, one in the painting itself, the other on its original frame. The first inscription appears on a portrait hanging on the wall behind the figures. It states that the man depicted in the portrait died on 10 January 1559, aged 58 years. The second is the Latin text written at the top and bottom of the frame of the painting. It translates as follows: \\"As in life there can be nothing happier than a marriage in unison and a bed without discord, there is nothing more pleasant than to see one's offspring in unison enjoy peace with an immaculate mind, 1561‚Äù. The painting thus simultaneously served as a memento of the deceased father and an expression of the feelings of togetherness of his descendants. Floris depicts all the members of the family performing and attending a concert of music, which emphasized this notion of 'concordia', i.e. the harmony within the family.Van de Velde Carl, 'Frans Floris, De familie van Berchem' at Openbaar Kunstbezit Vlaanderen References Sources * Jeroen Vandommele, 'Als in een spiegel, Vrede, kennis en gemeenschap op het Antwerpse Landjuweel van 1561', Hilversum * Edward H.

His works, culminating in his famous book Liberalism (1911), occupy a seminal position within the canon of New Liberalism. He worked both as an academic and a journalist, and played a key role in the establishment of sociology as an academic discipline; in 1907 he shared, with Edward Westermarck, the distinction of being the first professor of sociology to be appointed in the United Kingdom, at the University of London. He was also the founder and first editor of The Sociological Review. His sister was Emily Hobhouse, the British welfare activist.  Life  Hobhouse was born in St Ive, near Liskeard in Cornwall,Freeden, Michael 'Hobhouse, Leonard Trelawny (1864‚Äì1929)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, May 2006 accessed 15 Oct 2007 the son of Reginald Hobhouse, an Anglican clergyman, and Caroline Trelawny. He attended Marlborough College before reading Greats at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he graduated with a first-class degree in 1887. Upon his graduation, Hobhouse remained at Oxford as a prize fellow at Merton College before becoming a full fellow at Corpus Christi.Meadowcroft, James (ed.) Hobhouse: Liberalism and Other Writings. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994. pp. ix‚Äìx. Taking a break from academia between 1897 and 1907, Hobhouse worked as a journalist (including a stint with the Manchester Guardian) and as the secretary of a trade union. In 1907, Hobhouse returned to academia, accepting the newly-created chair of sociology at the University of London, titled the Martin White Professor of Sociology, where he remained until his death in 1929. Hobhouse was also an atheist from an early age, despite his father being an archdeacon.J A Hobson and Morris Ginsberg, L. T. Hobhouse: His life and work, George Allen & Unwin, 1931, p.17. He believed that rational tests could be applied to values and that they could be self-consistent and objective. Hobhouse was never religious. He wrote in 1883 that he was \\"in politics... a firm radical. In religion... an (if possible yet firmer) agnostic\\".Collini, Stefan. Liberalism and Sociology: L. T. Hobhouse and Political Argument in England 1880-1914 (1983). p. 54 In terms of his political and philosophical views, Hobhouse was Gladstonian; a devoted follower of the philosopher John Stuart Mill; and an admirer of John Morley, Bradlaugh; and Sir Charles Dilke, 2nd Baronet. Theose influences him to various feminist, democratic and secularist political stances. He often proposed republican and democratic motions at debating societies while he was at school.  Economic policy  Hobhouse was important in underpinning the turn-of-the-century 'New Liberal' movement of the Liberal Party under leaders like H. H. Asquith and David Lloyd George. He distinguished between property held 'for use' and property held 'for power'. Governmental co-operation with trade unions could therefore be justified as helping to counter the structural disadvantage of employees in terms of power. He also theorised that property was acquired not only by individual effort but by societal organisation. Essentially, wealth had a social dimension and was a collective product. That means that those who had property owed some of their success to society and thus had some obligation to others. He believed that to provide theoretical justification for a level of redistribution provided by the new state pensions. Hobhouse disliked Marxist socialism and described his own position as liberal socialism and later as social liberalism. Hobhouse thus occupied a particularly-important place in the intellectual history of the Liberal Democrats.  Civil liberty  His work also presents a positive vision of liberalism in which the purpose of liberty is to enable individuals to develop, not solely that freedom is good in itself. Hobhouse said that coercion should be avoided not for lack of regard for other people's well-being but because coercion is ineffective at improving their lot. While rejecting the practical doctrines of classical liberalism like laissez-faire, Hobhouse praised the work of earlier classical liberals like Richard Cobden in dismantling an archaic order of society and older forms of coercion. Hobhouse believed that one of the defining characteristics of liberalism was its emancipatory character, something that he believed ran constant from classical liberalism to the social liberalism he advocated. He nevertheless emphasised the various forms of coercion already existing in society apart from government. Therefore, he proposed that to promote liberty, the state must ameliorate other forms of social coercion. Hobhouse held out hope that Liberals and what would now be called the social democrat tendency in the nascent Labour Party could form a grand progressive coalition.  Foreign policy  Hobhouse was often disappointed that fellow collectivists in Britain at the time also tended to be imperialists. Hobhouse opposed the Boer War, and his sister, Emily Hobhouse, did much to draw attention to the abject conditions in the concentration camps established by the British Army in South Africa. Initially opposing the First World War, he later came to support the war effort. He was an internationalist and disliked the pursuit of British national interests as practised by the governments of the day. During the war, Hobhouse criticised the British Idealists such as Bernard Bosanquet in his book The Philosophical Theory of the State (1918) for being Hegelians and therefore Germanizers.

Silvestro al Quirinale, Rome () Polidoro Caldara was born in Caravaggio, in what is now Lombardy. According to Vasari, whilst working as a labourer carrying the materials for the builders of the Vatican logge he ingratiated himself with the artists, and attracted the admiration of Maturino da Firenze, one of Raphael's main assistants in the ongoing decoration of the Vatican. He then joined Raphael's large workshop, in about 1517, and worked on the Raphael Rooms in the Vatican. He and Maturino then set up as painters of palace facades, usually in sgraffito, with considerable success until the sack of Rome by the army of Charles V under the command of Constable de Bourbon in 1527, in which Maturino was killed. Polidoro fled to Naples, and from there to Messina, where he was very successful. According to tradition, he was about to return from there to the mainland of Italy when he was robbed and murdered by an assistant, Tonno Calabrese, in 1543. In the second half of the sixteenth century his tomb in Messina (inside Carmine Maggiore, with the tomb of Constantine Lascaris) was totally destroyed during the repression of the Counter-Reformation.

The Christ bearing the Cross shows considerable Northern influence, probably reflecting the traditionally strong links between Sicily and the Netherlands. His other works, as well as those of his partner, Maturino da Firenze, have mostly perished from exposure, as most were external decorations on the facades of palaces, but are known from many etchings by Pietro Santi Bartoli, Cherubino Alberti and others. One of his pupils is Deodato Guinaccia. They were authors of the facade decoration in classicising Graffito, usually in grisaille, of several Roman houses, like those ones in Borgo and in Parione (near Santa Maria della Pace and in Via del Pellegrino).Museodiroma.it A series of nine small internal wood panels from an unknown palace, perhaps in Naples, of which eight are now in the English Royal Collection, and one in the Louvre, give an idea of the liveliness and quality of these lost works: \\"Polidoro learned from Raphael the idea of re-creating the decoration of classical antiquity; but he did so with a wit, freedom and spirit of his own\\". Being always visible to the public, whilst they lasted the palace facades were very well known and influential, and used by \\"generations of young artists ... as a visual textbook\\".Lucy Whitaker, Martin Clayton, The Art of Italy in the Royal Collection; Renaissance and Baroque,pp 56, 63, Royal Collection Publications, 2007, There are also many surviving drawings of high quality. Assassination According to Vasari, Polidoro was firmly resolved to return to Rome after completing significant projects in Messina. In order to make preparations for this trip, he withdrew all of his savings from the bank for the trip to Rome. Upon discovering this, one of Polidoro's workmen, along with several accomplices, resolved to put the master to death on the following night, and then to divide the money among themselves. On the night following, they set upon Polidoro while he was slumbering deeply, and strangled him with a cloth. Then, giving him several wounds, they made sure of his death; After a period of many days when no perpetrator was discovered, it was thought that no one except the workman could have committed the act. Upon receiving intelligence of the assistant's alleged involvement, he was captured on the authority of the Count of Messina, and tortured until he confessed to the crime. Shortly thereafter, he was sentenced to the gallows, torn with red- hot pincers, and quartered Legacy Among Polidoro's pupils in Messina was Deodato Guinaccia, Stefano Giordano, Mariano Riccio, Antonello Riccio, Jacopo Vignerio, and Alfonso Lazzaro.Guida del Viagiatore in Sicilia., by Salvatore Lanza, Presso I Fratelli Pedone Lauriel, Palermo (1859), page LXII.

Mature work in Rome and Urbino After passing four years at Rome, he returned to his native city, where his first work of art was a St. Margaret executed for the Confraternity of the Holy Sacrament. He was invited back to Rome by Pope Pius IV to assist in the decoration of the Vatican Belvedere Palace at Rome, where he painted the Virgin Mary and infant, with several Saints and a ceiling in fresco, representing the Annunciation. During this second sojourn, while completing the decorations for the Vatican, Barocci fell ill with intestinal complaints. He suspected that a salad which he had eaten had been poisoned by jealous rivals. Fearing his illness was terminal, he left Rome in 1563; four years later he was said to experience a partial remission after prayers to the Virgin. Barocci henceforth often complained of frail health, though he remained productive for nearly four decades more. While he is described by contemporaries as personally somewhat morose and hypochondriacal, his paintings are lively and brilliant. Although he continued to have major altarpiece commissions from afar, he never returned to Rome, and was mainly patronized in his native city by Francesco Maria II della Rovere, duke of Urbino. The Ducal Palace can be seen in the background of his paintings, rendered in a forced perspective that seems a holdover from Mannerism. Nativity, 1597, oil on canvas, Museo del Prado, Madrid While Barocci was removed from Rome, the fulcrum of artistic fame and influence, he continued to innovate in his style. At some point he may have seen colored chalk/pastel drawings by Correggio, but Barocci's remarkable pastel studies are the earliest examples of the technique to survive. In pastels and in oil sketches (another technique he pioneered) Barocci's soft, opalescent renderings evoke the ethereal. Such studies were part of a complex process Barocci used to complete his altarpieces. An organized series of steps leading up to the final product ensured its speed and success in execution. Barocci did innumerable sketches: gestural, compositional, figural studies (using models), lighting studies (using clay models), perspective studies, color studies, nature studies, etc. Today, over 2,000 drawings by him are extant. Every detail of his subsequent cartoons for canvases was worked out in this way. A good example is his famed Madonna del Popolo (Uffizi). It is a vortex of color and vitality, made possible by the great variety of people, poses, perspectives, natural details, colors, lighting and atmospheric effects. There are many surviving drawings for the Madonna del Popolo, from initial sketches to color studies of heads, to the final full size cartoon. Despite this painstaking process, Barocci's genius kept the brushstrokes passionate and liberated, and a spiritual light seems to flicker as a jewel across faces, hands, drapery, and sky. Federico Barocci, Madonna del Popolo, 1579 Barocci's embrace of the Counter Reformation would shape his long and fruitful career. By 1566, he joined a lay order of Capuchins, an offshoot of Franciscans.Walter Friedlander, Burlington Magazine (1964), p.16-17 reviewing Harold Olsen's book. He may have been influenced by Saint Philip Neri, whose Oratorians sought to reconnect the spiritual realm with the lives of everyday people. Neri, who was somewhat ambivalent about the accumulating richness of his Santa Maria in Vallicella, commissioned two completed works from Barocci, the pre- eminent artist of these large pious altarpieces: The Visitation (1583-6) and Presentation of the Virgin (1593‚Äì94). Neri is said to have been moved to ecstasy by Barocci's accomplishment in the former painting, which shows the Virgin and Elizabeth greeting each other. In Urbino, where he painted a Descent from the Cross for the cathedral of San Lorenzo at Perugia. He again visited Rome during the papacy of Gregory XIII when he painted two admirable pictures for the Chiesa Nuova, representing the Visitation of the Virgin Mary to Elisabeth and the Presentation in the Temple, and for the Chiesa della Minerva, a Last Supper. Critical assessment and legacy The artist biographer Giovanni Bellori, the Baroque equivalent of Giorgio Vasari, considered Barocci to be among the finest painters of his time. Barocci's emotive brushwork was not lost on Peter Paul Rubens when he was in Italy. Rubens is known to have made a sketch of his dramatic Martyrdom of St Vitale, in which the martyr's undulating flesh is the eye of another whirlwind of figures, gestures, and drama. Also, Rubens' The Martyrdom of St Livinus seems to owe much to Barocci, from the putto with the pointing palm frond to the presence of dogs in the lower right corner. Among the painters and artists who worked under Barocci are Antonio Cimatori (Visacci), Ventura Mazza, Antonio Viviani (il Sordo di Urbino), Giovanni Andrea Urbani, Alessandro Vitali, and finally Felice and Vincenzo Pellegrini. Barocci also had many who followed or were strongly influenced by his style, including Nicolo Martinelli (il Trometta), Giovanni Battista Lombardelli, Domenico Malpiedi, Cesare & Basilio Maggeri, Filippo Bellini, Giovanni Laurentini (Arrigoni), Giorgio Picchi, Giovanni Giacomo Pandolfi, Pietro Paolo Tamburini, Terenzio d‚ÄôUrbino (il Rondolino), Giulio Cesare Begni, Benedetto Marini, Girolamo Cialdieri, Giovanni Battista Urbinelli, Alfonso Patanazzi, Gian Ortensio Bertuzzi, Cesare Franchi (il Pollino), Silla Piccinini, Benedetto Bandiera, Matteuccio Salvucci, Simeone Ciburri, Pietro Rancanelli, Onofrio Marini, Alessandro Brunelli, and Francesco Baldelli.Catalogo dei quadri che si conservano nella Pinacoteca Vannucci in Perugia, by Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria, (1903) page 60. Barocci's swirling composition and the focus on the emotional and spiritual are elements that foreshadow the Baroque of Rubens. But even in Federico's Proto-Baroque Beata Michelina can see the makings of Bernini's High Baroque masterpiece Ecstasy of St Theresa.

In agriculture, grazing is a method of animal husbandry whereby domestic livestock are allowed to consume wild vegetations outdoor in order to convert grass and other forages into meat, milk, wool and other animal products, often on land unsuitable for arable farming. Farmers may employ many different strategies of grazing for optimum production: grazing may be continuous, seasonal, or rotational within a grazing period. Longer rotations are found in ley farming, alternating arable and fodder crops; in rest rotation, deferred rotation, and mob grazing, giving grasses a longer time to recover or leaving land fallow. Patch-burn sets up a rotation of fresh grass after burning with two years of rest. Conservation grazing deliberately uses grazing animals to improve the biodiversity of a site. Grazing has existed since the birth of agriculture; sheep and goats were domesticated by nomads before the first permanent settlements were created around 7000 BC, enabling cattle and pigs to be kept. Grazing's ecological effects can be positive and include redistributing nutrients, keeping grasslands open or favouring a particular species over another. There can also be negative effects to the environment with overgrazing, such as soil degradation, ecological disturbance and desertification. History The domestication of ruminants, by 7000 BC, like these fat-tailed sheep in Afghanistan, provided nomads across the Middle East and central Asia with a reliable source of food. Sheep, goats cattle, and pigs were domesticated early in the history of agriculture. Sheep were domesticated first, soon followed by goats; both species were suitable for nomadic peoples. Cattle and pigs were domesticated somewhat later, around 7000 BC, once people started to live in fixed settlements. In America, livestock were grazed on public land from the Civil War. The Taylor Grazing Act of 1934 was enacted after the Great Depression to regulate the use of public land for grazing purposes.\\"History of Public Land Livestock Grazing\\". Retrieved 1 Dec 2008 Production Grazing by livestock is a means of deriving food and income from lands which are generally unsuitable for arable farming: for example in the United States, some 85% of grazing land is not suitable for crops. According to a report by the Food and Agriculture Organization, about 60% of the world's grassland (just less than half of the world's usable surface) is covered by grazing systems. It states that \\"Grazing systems supply about 9 percent of the world's production of beef and about 30 percent of the world's production of sheep and goat meat. For an estimated 100 million people in arid areas, and probably a similar number in other zones, grazing livestock is the only possible source of livelihood.\\" =Management= Grazing management has two overall goals, each of which is multifaceted: # Protecting the quality of the pasturage against deterioration by overgrazing ## In other words, maintain the sustainability of the pasturage # Protecting the health of the animals against acute threats, such as: ## Grass tetany and nitrate poisoning ## Trace element overdose, such as molybdenum and selenium poisoning ## Grass sickness and laminitis in horses ## Milk sickness in calves Dairy cattle grazing in Germany A proper land use and grazing management technique balances maintaining forage and livestock production, while still maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem services. It does this by allowing sufficient recovery periods for regrowth. Producers can keep a low density on a pasture, so as not to overgraze. Controlled burning of the land can help in the regrowth of plants. Although grazing can be problematic for the ecosystem, well-managed grazing techniques can reverse damage and improve the land. On commons in England and Wales, rights of pasture (grassland grazing) and pannage (forest grazing) for each commoner are tightly defined by number and type of animal, and by the time of year when certain rights could be exercised. For example, the occupier of a particular cottage might be allowed to graze fifteen cattle, four horses, ponies or donkeys, and fifty geese, while the numbers allowed for their neighbours would probably be different. On some commons (such as the New Forest and adjoining commons), the rights are not limited by numbers, and instead a 'marking fee' is paid each year for each animal 'turned out'.Forest rights. However, if excessive use was made of the common, for example, in overgrazing, a common would be 'stinted', that is, a limit would be put on the number of animals each commoner was allowed to graze. These regulations were responsive to demographic and economic pressure. Thus, rather than let a common become degraded, access was restricted even further. Systems Ranchers and range science researchers have developed grazing systems to improve sustainable forage production for livestock. These can be contrasted with intensive animal farming on feedlots. =Continuous= Diagram of continuous grazing, a low-input, low-output system With continuous grazing, livestock is allowed access to the same grazing area throughout the year.D.

Willms, (2008) Rotational Grazing on Rangelands: Reconciliation of Perception and Experimental Evidence . Rangeland Ecology & Management: January 2008, Vol. 61, No. 1, pp. 3-17 =Seasonal= Seasonal grazing incorporates \\"grazing animals on a particular area for only part of the year\\". This allows the land that is not being grazed to rest and allow for new forage to grow.\\"Grazing Systems\\". Grasslands Conservation Council of British Columbia. Retrieved 1 Dec 2008 =Rotational= Diagram of rotational grazing, showing the use of paddocks, each providing food and water for the livestock for a chosen period. The grass is allowed to rest and puddling is reduced, possibly increasing yields. This can be contrasted with feedlot systems. Rotational grazing \\"involves dividing the range into several pastures and then grazing each in sequence throughout the grazing period\\". Utilizing rotational grazing can improve livestock distribution while incorporating rest period for new forage. =Ley farming= In ley farming, pastures are not permanently planted, but alternated between fodder crops and/or arable crops. =Rest rotation= Rest rotation grazing \\"divides the range into at least four pastures. One pasture remains rested throughout the year and grazing is rotated amongst the residual pastures.\\" This grazing system can be especially beneficial when using sensitive grass that requires time for rest and regrowth. =Deferred rotation= Deferred rotation \\"involves at least two pastures with one not grazed until after seed- set\\". By using deferred rotation, grasses can achieve maximum growth during the period when no grazing occurs. =Patch-burn= Patch-burn grazing burns a third of a pasture each year, no matter the size of the pasture. This burned patch attracts grazers (cattle or bison) that graze the area heavily because of the fresh grasses that grow as a result. The other patches receive little to no grazing. During the next two years the next two patches are burned consecutively, then the cycle begins anew. In this way, patches receive two years of rest and recovery from the heavy grazing. This technique results in a diversity of habitats that different prairie plants and birds can utilize‚Äîmimicking the effects of the pre-historical bison/fire relationship, whereby bison heavily graze one area and other areas have opportunity to rest. The Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in northeastern Oklahoma has been patch-burn grazed with bison herds for over ten years. These efforts have effectively restored the bison/fire relationship on a large landscape scale of . In the grazed heathland of Devon the periodic burning is known as swailing. =Riparian area management= Riparian area grazing is geared more towards improving wildlife and their habitats. It uses fencing to keep livestock off ranges near streams or water areas until after wildlife or waterfowl periods, or to limit the amount of grazing to a short period of time. =Conservation grazing= Conservation grazing by Highland Cattle at the London Wetland Centre nature reserve Conservation grazing is the use of grazing animals to help improve the biodiversity of a site. Due to their hardy nature, rare and native breeds are often used in conservation grazing. In some cases, to re- establish traditional hay meadows, cattle such as the English Longhorn and Highland are used to provide grazing. =Cell grazing= A form of rotational grazing using as many small paddocks as fencing allows, said to be more sustainable. =Mob grazing= Mob grazing is a system, said to be more sustainable, invented in 2002; it uses very large herds on land left fallow longer than usual. Environmental considerations Summer grazing in a high- elevation environment at the Big Pasture Plateau, Slovenia =Ecology= Old Norwegian Sheep grazing at an island on the coast of Norway. This is a vulnerable habitat where the sheep take part in a delicate ecological balance. A number of ecological effects derive from grazing, and these may be either positive or negative. Negative effects of grazing may include overgrazing, increased soil erosion, compaction and degradation, deforestation, biodiversity loss, and adverse water quality impacts from run-off.Schindler, David W., Vallentyne, John R. (2008). The Algal Bowl: Overfertilization of the World's Freshwaters and Estuaries, University of Alberta Press, . Sometimes grazers can have beneficial environmental effects such as improving the soil with nutrient redistribution and aerating the soil by trampling, and by controlling fire and increasing biodiversity by removing biomass, controlling shrub growth and dispersing seeds. In some habitats, appropriate levels of grazing may be effective in restoring or maintaining native grass and herb diversity in rangeland that has been disturbed by overgrazing, lack of grazing (such as by the removal of wild grazing animals), or by other human disturbance.History distribution and challenges to bison recovery in the northern Chihuahuan desert Rurik, L., G. Ceballos, C. Curtin, P. J. P. Gogan, J. Pacheco, and J. Truett. Conservation Biology, 2007, 21(6): 1487‚Äì1494. Conservation grazing is the use of grazers to manage such habitats, often to replicate the ecological effects of the wild relatives of domestic livestock, or those of other species now absent or extinct.What is Conservation Grazing?

Native Habitat Organization. Retrieved 1 Dec 2008 Grazing can reduce the accumulation of litter (organic matter) in some seasons and areas, but can also increase it, which may help to combat soil erosion.Dalrymple, R.L.. \\"Fringe Benefits of Rotational Stocking\\". Intensive Grazing Benefits. Noble Foundation. Retrieved 1 Dec 2008 This acts as nutrition for insects and organisms found within the soil. These organisms \\"aid in carbon sequestration and water filtration\\". When grass is grazed, dead grass and litter are reduced which is advantageous for birds such as waterfowl. Grazing can increase biodiversity. Without grazing, many of the same grasses grow, for example brome and bluegrass, consequently creating a monoculture. The ecosystems of North American tallgrass prairies are controlled to a large extent by nitrogen availability, which is itself controlled by interactions between fires and grazing by large herbivores. Fires in Spring enhance growth of certain grasses, and herbivores preferentially graze these grasses, creating a system of checks and balances, and allowing higher plant biodiversity. In Europe heathland is a cultural landscape which requires grazing by cattle, sheep or other grazers to be maintained. =Conservation= An author of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) report Livestock's Long Shadow, stated in an interview: Much grazing land has resulted from a process of clearance or drainage of other habitats such as woodland or wetland. According to the opinion of the Center for Biological Diversity, extensive grazing of livestock in the arid lands of the southwestern USA has many negative impacts on the local biodiversity there.Center for Biological Diversitysource=Grazing In arid climates such as the Southwestern United States, livestock grazing has severely degraded riparian areas, the wetland environment adjacent to rivers or streams. The Environmental Protection Agency states that agriculture has a greater impact on stream and river contamination than any other nonpoint source. Improper grazing of riparian areas can contribute to nonpoint source pollution of riparian areas. Riparian zones in arid and semiarid environments have been called biodiversity hotspots. The water, higher biomass, favorable microclimate and periodic flood events together create higher biological diversity than in the surrounding uplands. In 1990, \\"according to the Arizona state park department, over 90% of the original riparian zones of Arizona and New Mexico are gone\\". A 1988 report of the Government Accountability Office estimated that 90% of the 5,300 miles of riparian habitat managed by the Bureau of Land Management in Colorado was in unsatisfactory condition, as was 80% of Idaho's riparian zones, concluding that \\"poorly managed livestock grazing is the major cause of degraded riparian habitat on federal rangelands.\\" A 2013 FAO report estimated livestock were responsible for 14.5% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Grazing is common in New Zealand; in 2004 methane and nitrous oxide from agriculture made up a bit less than half of New Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions, of which most is attributable to livestock. A 2008 United States Environmental Protection Agency report on emissions found agriculture was responsible for 6% of total United States greenhouse gas emissions in 2006. This included rice production, enteric fermentation in domestic livestock, livestock manure management, and agricultural soil management, but omitted some things which might be attributable to agriculture.U.S. Greenhouse Gas Inventory Reports Studies comparing the methane emissions from grazing and feedlot cattle concluded that grass-fed cattle produce much more methane than grain-fed cattle. One study in the Journal of Animal Science found four times as much, and stated: \\"these measurements clearly document higher CH4 production for cattle receiving low- quality, high-fiber diets than for cattle fed high-grain diets.\\" See also * Cattle feeding * Free range * Grazing rights References  External links  Category:Land use Category:Livestock ","title":"Grazing"},{"id":"854456","text":"Wilhelm Paul Corssen (20 January 182018 June 1875) was a German philologist noted for his work on Latin and Etruscan topics.  Biography  Paul Wilhelm Corssen Corssen was born in Bremen and, after his merchant father moved to Schwedt in the Kingdom of Prussia, received his school education there. After spending some time at the Joachimsthal-Gymnasium in Berlin, where his interest in philological pursuits was awakened by the rector, Meinike, he proceeded to the university, and there came especially under the influence of Philipp August B√∂ckh and Karl Lachmann. His first important appearance in literature was as the author of Origines poesis romanae, by which he had obtained the prize offered by the philosophical or arts faculty of the university. In 1846 he was called from Stettin, where he had for nearly two years held a post in the gymnasium, to occupy the position of lecturer in the royal academy at Pforta (commonly called Schulpforta), and there he continued to labour for the next twenty years. In 1854 he won a prize offered by the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences for the best work on the pronunciation and accent of Latin, a treatise which at once took rank, on its publication under the title of √úber Aussprache, Vocalismus, und Betonung der lateinischen Sprache (1858‚Äì1859), as one of the most erudite and masterly works in its department. This was followed in 1863 by his Kritische Beitr√§ge zur lat. Formenlehre, which were supplemented in 1866 by Kritische Nachtr√§ge zur lat. Formenlehre. In the discussion of the pronunciation of Latin he was naturally led to consider the various old Italian dialects, and the results of his investigations appeared in miscellaneous communications to Franz Felix Adalbert Kuhn's Zeitschrift f√ºr vergleichende Schriftforschung. Ill-health obliged him to give up his professorship at Pforta and return to Berlin in 1866, but it produced almost no diminution of his literary activity. In 1867 he published an elaborate archaeological study entitled the Alterth√ºmer und Kunstdenkmale des Gistercienserklosters St Marien und der Landesschule Pforta, in which he gathered together all that can be discovered about the history of the Pforta academy, the so-called \\"German Eton\\", and in 1868‚Äì1869 he brought out a new edition of his work on Latin pronunciation. From a very early period he had been attracted to the special study of Etruscan remains, and had at various times given occasional expression to his opinions on individual points; but it was not till 1870 that he had the opportunity of visiting Italy and completing his equipment for a formal treatment of the whole subject by personal inspection of the monuments. In 1874 appeared the first volume of √úber die Sprache der Etrusker, in which with great ingenuity and erudition he endeavoured to prove that the Etruscan language was cognate with that of the Romans. Before the second volume (published posthumously under the editorship of Ernst Kuhn) had received the last touches of his hand,HathiTrust Digital Library (published works) he was cut off in 1875 by a comparatively early death. Influence on Friedrich Nietzsche In Twilight of the Idols (\\"What I Owe to the Ancients\\") Friedrich Nietzsche, who was educated at the Schulpforta, pays homage to Corssen in discussion of his education and writing style: :My sense of style, for the epigram as a style, was awakened almost instantly when I came into contact with Sallust.

It is usually repeated on BBC Two and on BBC Parliament, later in the week. Question Time is also available on BBC iPlayer. Fiona Bruce currently chairs the show having succeeded David Dimbleby as presenter in January 2019. Mentorn has produced the programme since 1998. Origins Question Time was first broadcast on Tuesday 25 September 1979, based on the BBC Radio 4 programme Any Questions?. The first panel consisted of Labour MP Michael Foot, author Edna O'Brien, Conservative politician Teddy Taylor, and the Archbishop of Liverpool Derek Worlock. Format Question Time panels are typically composed of five public figures, \\"nearly always [including] a representative from the UK government and the official opposition.\\" The panel also features \\"representatives from other political parties across the series, taking as [the] guide the level of electoral support at national level which each party enjoys.\\" High-profile journalists and authors, television and radio broadcasters, and comedians, join the panel, as do business leaders from well-known companies, and leading or expert academics, lawyers, police officers, and clerics. Audience members are selected by the 'audience producer' based on age, gender, occupation, ethnicity, disability status, voting intention, voting history, and party membership. The audience members are \\"requested to come up with two questions, to be considered for the programme.\\" The panel hears the questions for the first time, when the audience members ask them. Applicants are contacted on the Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday before the programme. Although, due to a \\"high volume of requests,\\" the team are unable to call everyone. Question Time is usually recorded \\"as-live\\", and in a single-take, shortly before transmission. The programme is only edited on \\"very rare\\" occasions for legal or taste reasons, or because it over-runs. For example, The Observer newspaper reported in 1986 that \\"The BBC's lawyers ordered nine seconds of Question Time to be deleted by the old-fashioned method of simply cutting off the sound\\".'\\"High Tech, low tech, no tech\\", The Observer, 9 February 1986 Presenters =Sir Robin Day= Veteran broadcaster Sir Robin Day was the programme's first chair, presenting it for nearly 10 years until June 1989. Question Time soon gained popularity under Day's lead, with his quick wit and interrogation skills. His famous catchphrase when he had introduced the panel was: \\"There they are, and here we go.\\" The programme was mainly filmed at the Greenwood Theatre in London on the south side of London Bridge. Day's last appearance as presenter was broadcast from Paris on 12 July 1989. He was allowed to choose his own guests. =Peter Sissons= After Day retired, Peter Sissons took over and continued until 1993. The BBC decided to widen the programme's appeal by moving it around the country. The programme also changed its London location from the Greenwood Theatre to the Barbican Centre. Sissons' tenure as Question Time chair included three different editors. There were several problems during filming, including a bomb scare during a live recording, which resulted in the programme being taken off the air, and the death of an audience member who collapsed while recording. The programme continued to enjoy good ratings during this period, notably on the day of Margaret Thatcher's resignation on 22 November 1990, which featured two different panels over two editions. =David Dimbleby= David Dimbleby succeeded Sissons as Question Time presenter in 1994, after the BBC held two pilot show auditions between Dimbleby and Jeremy Paxman, with two different audiences and two different panels. For a brief period under Dimbleby in the mid-1990s, there were a number of variations to the format, including the audience using voting keypads to take a poll of the audience at the end of the programme and Dimbleby getting out of his seat at intervals to question the audience. Dimbleby presented Question Time for 25 years, the programme's longest-serving presenter, until his final programme, aged 80, on 13 December 2018. =Fiona Bruce= In December 2018, the BBC announced that Fiona Bruce would succeed Dimbleby as moderator. Bruce‚Äîalong with Samira Ahmed, Victoria Derbyshire, Emily Maitlis, Nick Robinson, and Kirsty Wark‚Äîattended October 2018 auditions at London's James Allen's Girls' School. She presented her first Question Time in January 2019. =Guest presenters= Question Time has seen various presenters deputise for the main chair. Sir Ludovic Kennedy, Sue Lawley (the first woman to chair the programme), Bernard Levin (who is the only person to have been both programme chair and a panelist), and Donald MacCormick, all moderated in Day's place. In November 2009, John Humphrys presented in lieu of Dimbleby, who had been \\"injured by a bullock at his farm\\" causing him \\"briefly to be knocked out.\\" In June 2017, Nick Robinson presented a \\"Leaders Special\\" edition of Question Time. The programme was moved for news coverage of the London Bridge attack. Dimbleby was preparing for the General Election coverage. Editors Charlie Courtauld was editor from 1998 to 2000, leaving to join the Independent on Sunday as its comment editor. Nick Pisani was appointed in 2000, resigning abruptly in May 2005 after news was leaked that he had been offered a job as David Cameron's head of TV presentation. Ed Havard was made acting editor in May 2005 after Pisani left. During his time in charge the BBC offered a seat on the panel to Nick Griffin in 2009. He left when the programme's production base moved to Glasgow. Gill Penlington, the ITV News political producer, was made interim editor in May 2008, when the BBC gave Ed Havard a year-long sabbatical. Interactivity =SMS contributions= Viewers of the show can submit comments to the show via SMS; until October 2012 a selection of those comments was posted on Ceefax. Comments were edited and put to air by a team of four journalists based at Television Centre in London. The system displayed one message at a time, and usually showed several tens of messages throughout each hour-long episode. The system's popularity sprang from its mix of serious and light-hearted comments. On average, around 3,500 texts are received during each hour-long programme, although 12,000 texts were once recorded in one frantic programme in 2004. Quantity of texts is generally related to the composition of the panel. =Twitter= On 24 September 2009, the show launched its Twitter presence and the show's presenter has regularly announced its presence on Twitter since late 2009. Using the Twitter ID \\"@bbcquestiontime\\" it tweeted using the #bbcqt hashtag. By early 2010, this had become one of the UK's most active \\"Twitter backchannels\\" to a TV show. @bbcquestiontime claimed 10,000 tweets had been sent around the show on 7 October 2010. The show had over 40,000 followers on Twitter by October 2010 and this exceeded 50,000 on the evening of 3 February 2011. On 9 June 2011, Question Time became one of the most-tweeted about shows of the week in the UK, with 5,000 tweets during the programme, with tweeting continuing through to the next day. In addition to the more sober analysis of the discussion, Question Time also has a parallel Twitter backchannel based on the spoof account Dimblebot - purportedly a robot version of Dimbleby - where the entire premise of the programme is claimed to be a demonstration of Dimbleby's ability to defeat the panel. It became clear during the riot special that David Dimbleby knows of the existence of Dimblebot and the associated Dimbledance.Jack Seale, \\"DIMBLEBOT helps Question Time special draw 3.5m viewers\\", Radio Times, 12 August 2011. The @bbcquestiontime account nowAs of 3rd of June 2019. has over 500,000 followers. In March 2020, Sayeeda Warsi, Baroness Warsi and MP Debbie Abrahams sent an open letter to the programme's runners, after Question Time uploaded anti-immigrants Twitter comments from a far-right supporter who allegedly also ran for the National Front and showed support for the English Defence League. Baroness Warsi and Abrahams wrote in their letter: ‚ÄúWe understand the producers of the show seek out ‚Äòcontroversial members of the audience ‚Äì including those of far-right campaign groups ‚Äì in an attempt to curry large ratings... By providing a platform for views that are racist or sexist, the institution is normalising them and contributing to the coarsening of public debate and the growing toxicity of our politics.‚Äù  List of episodes  As of 2019, there have been over 1000 episodes broadcast. Locations While chaired by Sir Robin Day, Question Time was predominantly filmed in London. It was during Peter Sissons tenure as presenter that Question Time started \\"moving around the country each week, taking the panel to audiences in different towns and cities.\\" On occasion, Question Time has broadcast from outside the UK. Locations have included: Brussels, Johannesburg, Miami, Moscow, New York, Paris, Shanghai, Sydney, and Washington. In December 2018, Dimbleby hosted the final edition of his 25-year tenure in the Question Time chair. For this edition, the programme returned \\"to where it all started in 1979\\": Question Time was broadcast from the Greenwood Theatre, now part of King's College London Medical School. =Venues= Question Time has filmed in notable buildings, including: the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly, and Westminster Hall. It has also broadcast from: Heathrow Airport, Wormwood Scrubs Prison, and the cathedrals of Liverpool and St Paul's, Winchester and Worcester.

Famous editions In early 1981, David Steel declared his support in principle for \\"a marriage\\" between the Liberal Party and any party which might be formed by the Gang of Four; David Owen, who was also on the programme, said he could see advantages in an \\"electoral alliance\\" between them. This prefigured the period 1983‚Äì1987 when Owen and Steel were Leaders of the SDP-Liberal Alliance and tension grew over whether their deal was a prelude to a merger of the parties or merely a temporary electoral pact. During the 1983 election campaign, Conservative Foreign Secretary Francis Pym was asked by an A-level student named Andy Davis about the implications of the Conservatives winning the election with a landslide victory. He began by casting doubt on the likelihood of this happening and then observed \\"I think landslides on the whole don't produce successful governments\\". Margaret Thatcher later wrote that the remark \\"struck a wrong note\\": \\"people drew the inference that he did not want us to win a large majority\\". After the election (won by the Conservatives on a landslide) she sacked him as Foreign Secretary, partly because of his gaffe. In a 1984 edition, Alan Clark, a junior government Minister at the time, was openly critical of a government decision to buy a foreign-made missile system, prompting guest host Sue Lawley to ask the audience, \\"Is there anyone here who wishes to defend the government on this, because its Minister doesn't?\\" A 1994 edition was notable for a confrontation between Jeffrey Archer and the historian David Starkey over the age of homosexual consent. After arguing that 18 should be the age of consent, Archer was attacked by Starkey who told him: \\"Englishmen like you enjoy sitting on the fence so much because you enjoy the sensation.\\" The programme broadcast on 13 September 2001, which was devoted to the political implications of the 11 September 2001 attacks, featured many contributions from members of the audience who were anti-American, expressing the view that \\"the United States had it coming\\". The BBC received more than 2,000 complaints and later apologised to viewers for causing offence, stating that the edition should not have been broadcast live, but rather should have been recorded and edited.BBC chief apologises for terror debate, BBC News, 15 September 2001 In 2002, the editor of Private Eye, Ian Hislop, made an open attack on Jeffrey Archer, who had been imprisoned for perjury, when his wife Mary Archer was a fellow panellist. She was noticeably angry that the issue had been raised and criticised Hislop after the recording had finished. In March 2007, an Iraq Special was broadcast, featuring Tony Benn, Benazir Bhutto, Des Browne, Liam Fox, Charles Kennedy and, via video link from Washington D.C., John R. Bolton. The episode is particularly memorable for the clashes between Benn and Bolton. On 11 October 2007, former editor of The Sun newspaper Kelvin MacKenzie appeared on the programme in Cheltenham and launched an attack on Scotland. During a debate about tax, MacKenzie claimed that \\"Scotland believes not in entrepreneurialism like London and the south east... Scots enjoy spending it (money) but they don't enjoy creating it, which is the opposite to down south.\\" The comments came as part of an attack on Prime Minister Gordon Brown who MacKenzie said could not be trusted to manage the British economy because he was \\"a Scot\\" and a \\"socialist\\", and insisting that this was relevant to the debate. Fellow panellist Chuka Umunna from the think tank Compass called his comments \\"absolutely disgraceful\\", and booing and jeering were heard from the Cheltenham studio audience. The BBC received 350 complaints and MacKenzie's comments drew widespread criticism in both Scotland and England. On 3 July 2008, it was reported that the BBC Trust's editorial complaints unit had cleared the programme of any wrongdoing. Question Time then proceeded to broadcast the following question from Nick Hartley as part of the programme on the same evening: \\"After the media coverage of [Andy] Murray's rise and fall, are we now to infer that the English resent the Scots more than the Scots resent the English?\\" MacKenzie reappeared on the programme in Cardiff on 17 May 2012. After he was elected to the European Parliament, Nick Griffin the leader of the British National Party was invited onto Question Time for the first time, to appear on 22 October 2009. The decision led to controversy and political debate. Hundreds of people protested outside BBC Television Centre as the edition was filmed; six people were arrested after 25 protesters forced their way into the main reception.\\"BNP on Question Time\\", The Guardian, 22 October 2009. The edition attracted eight million viewers, and also drew a large number of complaints as a result of its content. Griffin himself said that he would make a formal complaint to the BBC for the way he believed he was treated by the show's other guests and the audience, who he described as a \\"lynch mob.\\" An edition aired on 19 May 2011 was recorded at Wormwood Scrubs Prison in London. The episode was the first to feature prisoners as part of the audience, while panellists included Justice Secretary Ken Clarke who attempted to defend controversial remarks he had made earlier in the week about rape sentencing. A special edition of the programme was aired on 11 August 2011 following the outbreak of rioting which had occurred during the previous weekend and earlier that week. Question Time had been off air for its annual summer break at the time and the edition was a scheduled at short notice due to the English riots. An appearance by George Galloway on the edition of 5 February 2015 recorded in Finchley gained much negative comment before the broadcast. Inviting Galloway, a politician who has been outspoken about Israel, onto the programme was thought to be provocative and insensitive because Finchley has a large Jewish minority.Sandy Rashty \\"Galloway Question Time appearance is chance to call MP to account, says Board\\", The Jewish Chronicle, 29 January 2015 Galloway, who was heckled during a discussion about antisemitism, thought he had been defamed by a question posed to him, which insinuated that he should share some of the blame for a rise in antisemitic incidents during 2014.\\"George Galloway accuses BBC over Question Time 'set-up'\\", The Guardian, 6 February 2015 On 23 November 2017, the programme was shortened because an audience member became ill and could not be safely moved. On 19 March 2020, the programme was broadcast for the first time without an audience in Weston-super-mare due to the Coronavirus outbreak. On 26 March 2020, the programme moved to a semi- permanent home at the IMG Studios at Stockley Park in London as a measure to prevent unnecessary travel during the Coronavirus outbreak, the show followed a different format with no audience, the number of panellists reduced to four and the removal of the desk table, with the panellists and host now sitting on chairs in a semi-circle, 2m apart from one another in order to observe social distancing rules. At the same time, the programme moved to a new, temporary timeslot of 8pm, so that it could be broadcast live and allow viewers to submit their own questions to be answered on the programme. Audience figures Audience figures for Question Time are usually around 2.7 million. The highest audience figures to date were recorded when Nick Griffin of the BNP appeared in an episode on 22 October 2009; the audience reaching 8.3 million viewers. On 14 May 2009, Question Time discussed the MPs' expenses row, with audience members heckling guest panellists Menzies Campbell and Margaret Beckett, the Labour MP, who was booed by the audience for insisting that her expenses were her privilege. The TV audience reached 3.8 million. 3.4 million people watched in 2003 at the start of the war on Iraq.

Each blue ellipse represents an individual rule covering part of the solution space. (Adapted from images taken from XCSF with permission from Martin Butz) Learning classifier systems, or LCS, are a paradigm of rule-based machine learning methods that combine a discovery component (e.g. typically a genetic algorithm) with a learning component (performing either supervised learning, reinforcement learning, or unsupervised learning). Learning classifier systems seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions (e.g. behavior modeling, classification, data mining, regression, function approximation, or game strategy). This approach allows complex solution spaces to be broken up into smaller, simpler parts. The founding concepts behind learning classifier systems came from attempts to model complex adaptive systems, using rule-based agents to form an artificial cognitive system (i.e. artificial intelligence).  Methodology  The architecture and components of a given learning classifier system can be quite variable. It is useful to think of an LCS as a machine consisting of several interacting components. Components may be added or removed, or existing components modified/exchanged to suit the demands of a given problem domain (like algorithmic building blocks) or to make the algorithm flexible enough to function in many different problem domains. As a result, the LCS paradigm can be flexibly applied to many problem domains that call for machine learning. The major divisions among LCS implementations are as follows: (1) Michigan-style architecture vs. Pittsburgh-style architectureIntroducing Rule-Based Machine Learning: A Practical Guide, Ryan J. Urbanowicz and Will Browne, see pp. 72-73 for Michigan-style architecture vs. Pittsburgh-style architecture., (2) reinforcement learning vs. supervised learning, (3) incremental learning vs. batch learning, (4) online learning vs. offline learning, (5) strength-based fitness vs. accuracy-based fitness, and (6) complete action mapping vs best action mapping. These divisions are not necessarily mutually exclusive. For example, XCS, the best known and best studied LCS algorithm, is Michigan- style, was designed for reinforcement learning but can also perform supervised learning, applies incremental learning that can be either online or offline, applies accuracy-based fitness, and seeks to generate a complete action mapping. = Elements of a generic LCS algorithm = A step-wise schematic illustrating a generic Michigan-style learning classifier system learning cycle performing supervised learning. Keeping in mind that LCS is a paradigm for genetic-based machine learning rather than a specific method, the following outlines key elements of a generic, modern (i.e. post-XCS) LCS algorithm. For simplicity let us focus on Michigan-style architecture with supervised learning. See the illustrations on the right laying out the sequential steps involved in this type of generic LCS.  Environment  The environment is the source of data upon which an LCS learns. It can be an offline, finite training dataset (characteristic of a data mining, classification, or regression problem), or an online sequential stream of live training instances. Each training instance is assumed to include some number of features (also referred to as attributes, or independent variables), and a single endpoint of interest (also referred to as the class, action, phenotype, prediction, or dependent variable). Part of LCS learning can involve feature selection, therefore not all of the features in the training data need be informative. The set of feature values of an instance is commonly referred to as the state. For simplicity let's assume an example problem domain with Boolean/binary features and a Boolean/binary class. For Michigan-style systems, one instance from the environment is trained on each learning cycle (i.e. incremental learning). Pittsburgh-style systems perform batch learning, where rule-sets are evaluated each iteration over much or all of the training data.  Rule/classifier/population  A rule is a context dependent relationship between state values and some prediction. Rules typically take the form of an {IF:THEN} expression, (e.g. {IF 'condition' THEN 'action'}, or as a more specific example, {IF 'red' AND 'octagon' THEN 'stop-sign'}). A critical concept in LCS and rule-based machine learning alike, is that an individual rule is not in itself a model, since the rule is only applicable when its condition is satisfied. Think of a rule as a \\"local-model\\" of the solution space. Rules can be represented in many different ways to handle different data types (e.g. binary, discrete-valued, ordinal, continuous- valued). Given binary data LCS traditionally applies a ternary rule representation (i.e. rules can include either a 0, 1, or '#' for each feature in the data). The 'don't care' symbol (i.e. '#') serves as a wild card within a rule's condition allowing rules, and the system as a whole to generalize relationships between features and the target endpoint to be predicted. Consider the following rule (#1###0 ~ 1) (i.e. condition ~ action). This rule can be interpreted as: IF the second feature = 1 AND the sixth feature = 0 THEN the class prediction = 1. We would say that the second and sixth features were specified in this rule, while the others were generalized. This rule, and the corresponding prediction are only applicable to an instance when the condition of the rule is satisfied by the instance. This is more commonly referred to as matching. In Michigan-style LCS, each rule has its own fitness, as well as a number of other rule-parameters associated with it that can describe the number of copies of that rule that exist (i.e. the numerosity), the age of the rule, its accuracy, or the accuracy of its reward predictions, and other descriptive or experiential statistics. A rule along with its parameters is often referred to as a classifier. In Michigan-style systems, classifiers are contained within a population [P] that has a user defined maximum number of classifiers. Unlike most stochastic search algorithms (e.g. evolutionary algorithms), LCS populations start out empty (i.e. there is no need to randomly initialize a rule population). Classifiers will instead be initially introduced to the population with a covering mechanism. In any LCS, the trained model is a set of rules/classifiers, rather than any single rule/classifier. In Michigan-style LCS, the entire trained (and optionally, compacted) classifier population forms the prediction model.  Matching  One of the most critical and often time-consuming elements of an LCS is the matching process. The first step in an LCS learning cycle takes a single training instance from the environment and passes it to [P] where matching takes place. In step two, every rule in [P] is now compared to the training instance to see which rules match (i.e. are contextually relevant to the current instance). In step three, any matching rules are moved to a match set [M]. A rule matches a training instance if all feature values specified in the rule condition are equivalent to the corresponding feature value in the training instance. For example, assuming the training instance is (001001 ~ 0), these rules would match: (###0## ~ 0), (00###1 ~ 0), (#01001 ~ 1), but these rules would not (1##### ~ 0), (000##1 ~ 0), (#0#1#0 ~ 1). Notice that in matching, the endpoint/action specified by the rule is not taken into consideration. As a result, the match set may contain classifiers that propose conflicting actions. In the fourth step, since we are performing supervised learning, [M] is divided into a correct set [C] and an incorrect set [I]. A matching rule goes into the correct set if it proposes the correct action (based on the known action of the training instance), otherwise it goes into [I]. In reinforcement learning LCS, an action set [A] would be formed here instead, since the correct action is not known.  Covering  At this point in the learning cycle, if no classifiers made it into either [M] or [C] (as would be the case when the population starts off empty), the covering mechanism is applied (fifth step). Covering is a form of online smart population initialization. Covering randomly generates a rule that matches the current training instance (and in the case of supervised learning, that rule is also generated with the correct action. Assuming the training instance is (001001 ~ 0), covering might generate any of the following rules: (#0#0## ~ 0), (001001 ~ 0), (#010## ~ 0). Covering not only ensures that each learning cycle there is at least one correct, matching rule in [C], but that any rule initialized into the population will match at least one training instance. This prevents LCS from exploring the search space of rules that do not match any training instances.  Parameter updates/credit assignment/learning  In the sixth step, the rule parameters of any rule in [M] are updated to reflect the new experience gained from the current training instance. Depending on the LCS algorithm, a number of updates can take place at this step. For supervised learning, we can simply update the accuracy/error of a rule. Rule accuracy/error is different than model accuracy/error, since it is not calculated over the entire training data, but only over all instances that it matched. Rule accuracy is calculated by dividing the number of times the rule was in a correct set [C] by the number of times it was in a match set [M]. Rule accuracy can be thought of as a 'local accuracy'. Rule fitness is also updated here, and is commonly calculated as a function of rule accuracy. The concept of fitness is taken directly from classic genetic algorithms. Be aware that there are many variations on how LCS updates parameters in order to perform credit assignment and learning.  Subsumption  In the seventh step, a subsumption mechanism is typically applied. Subsumption is an explicit generalization mechanism that merges classifiers that cover redundant parts of the problem space. The subsuming classifier effectively absorbs the subsumed classifier (and has its numerosity increased). This can only happen when the subsuming classifier is more general, just as accurate, and covers all of the problem space of the classifier it subsumes.  Rule discovery/genetic algorithm  In the eighth step, LCS adopts a highly elitist genetic algorithm (GA) which will select two parent classifiers based on fitness (survival of the fittest). Parents are selected from [C] typically using tournament selection. Some systems have applied roulette wheel selection or deterministic selection, and have differently selected parent rules from either [P] - panmictic selection, or from [M]). Crossover and mutation operators are now applied to generate two new offspring rules. At this point, both the parent and offspring rules are returned to [P]. The LCS genetic algorithm is highly elitist since each learning iteration, the vast majority of the population is preserved. Rule discovery may alternatively be performed by some other method, such as an estimation of distribution algorithm, but a GA is by far the most common approach. Evolutionary algorithms like the GA employ a stochastic search, which makes LCS a stochastic algorithm. LCS seeks to cleverly explore the search space, but does not perform an exhaustive search of rule combinations, and is not guaranteed to converge on an optimal solution.  Deletion  The last step in a generic LCS learning cycle is to maintain the maximum population size. The deletion mechanism will select classifiers for deletion (commonly using roulette wheel selection). The probability of a classifier being selected for deletion is inversely proportional to its fitness. When a classifier is selected for deletion, its numerosity parameter is reduced by one. When the numerosity of a classifier is reduced to zero, it is removed entirely from the population.  Training  LCS will cycle through these steps repeatedly for some user defined number of training iterations, or until some user defined termination criteria have been met. For online learning, LCS will obtain a completely new training instance each iteration from the environment. For offline learning, LCS will iterate through a finite training dataset. Once it reaches the last instance in the dataset, it will go back to the first instance and cycle through the dataset again.  Rule compaction  Once training is complete, the rule population will inevitably contain some poor, redundant and inexperienced rules. It is common to apply a rule compaction, or condensation heuristic as a post-processing step. This resulting compacted rule population is ready to be applied as a prediction model (e.g. make predictions on testing instances), and/or to be interpreted for knowledge discovery.  Prediction  Whether or not rule compaction has been applied, the output of an LCS algorithm is a population of classifiers which can be applied to making predictions on previously unseen instances. The prediction mechanism is not part of the supervised LCS learning cycle itself, however it would play an important role in a reinforcement learning LCS learning cycle. For now we consider how the prediction mechanism can be applied for making predictions to test data. When making predictions, the LCS learning components are deactivated so that the population does not continue to learn from incoming testing data. A test instance is passed to [P] where a match set [M] is formed as usual. At this point the match set is differently passed to a prediction array. Rules in the match set can predict different actions, therefore a voting scheme is applied. In a simple voting scheme, the action with the strongest supporting 'votes' from matching rules wins, and becomes the selected prediction. All rules do not get an equal vote. Rather the strength of the vote for a single rule is commonly proportional to its numerosity and fitness. This voting scheme and the nature of how LCS's store knowledge, suggests that LCS algorithms are implicitly ensemble learners.  Interpretation  Individual LCS rules are typically human readable IF:THEN expression. Rules that constitute the LCS prediction model can be ranked by different rule parameters and manually inspected. Global strategies to guide knowledge discovery using statistical and graphical have also been proposed. With respect to other advanced machine learning approaches, such as artificial neural networks, random forests, or genetic programming, learning classifier systems are particularly well suited to problems that require interpretable solutions.  History  = Early years = John Henry Holland was best known for his work popularizing genetic algorithms (GA), through his ground-breaking book \\"Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems\\" in 1975 and his formalization of Holland's schema theorem. In 1976, Holland conceptualized an extension of the GA concept to what he called a \\"cognitive system\\",Holland JH (1976) Adaptation. In: Rosen R, Snell F (eds) Progress in theoretical biology, vol 4. Academic Press, New York, pp 263‚Äì293 and provided the first detailed description of what would become known as the first learning classifier system in the paper \\"Cognitive Systems based on Adaptive Algorithms\\".Holland JH, Reitman JS (1978) Cognitive systems based on adaptive algorithms Reprinted in: Evolutionary computation. The fossil record. In: David BF (ed) IEEE Press, New York 1998\\\\. This first system, named Cognitive System One (CS-1) was conceived as a modeling tool, designed to model a real system (i.e. environment) with unknown underlying dynamics using a population of human readable rules. The goal was for a set of rules to perform online machine learning to adapt to the environment based on infrequent payoff/reward (i.e. reinforcement learning) and apply these rules to generate a behavior that matched the real system. This early, ambitious implementation was later regarded as overly complex, yielding inconsistent results. Beginning in 1980, Kenneth de Jong and his student Stephen Smith took a different approach to rule-based machine learning with (LS-1), where learning was viewed as an offline optimization process rather than an online adaptation process.Smith S (1980) A learning system based on genetic adaptive algorithms. Ph.D. thesis, Department of Computer Science, University of Pittsburgh Smith S (1983) Flexible learning of problem solving heuristics through adaptive search. In: Eighth international joint conference on articial intelligence. Morgan Kaufmann, Los Altos, pp 421‚Äì425 De Jong KA (1988) Learning with genetic algorithms: an overview. Mach Learn 3:121‚Äì138 This new approach was more similar to a standard genetic algorithm but evolved independent sets of rules. Since that time LCS methods inspired by the online learning framework introduced by Holland at the University of Michigan have been referred to as Michigan-style LCS, and those inspired by Smith and De Jong at the University of Pittsburgh have been referred to as Pittsburgh-style LCS. In 1986, Holland developed what would be considered the standard Michigan-style LCS for the next decade.Holland, John H. \\"Escaping brittleness: the possibilities of general purpose learning algorithms applied to parallel rule-based system.\\" Machine learning(1986): 593-623. Other important concepts that emerged in the early days of LCS research included (1) the formalization of a bucket brigade algorithm (BBA) for credit assignment/learning, (2) selection of parent rules from a common 'environmental niche' (i.e. the match set [M]) rather than from the whole population [P], (3) covering, first introduced as a create operator,Wilson, S. W. \\"Knowledge growth in an artificial animal. Proceedings of the First International Conference on Genetic Algorithms and their Applications.\\" (1985). (4) the formalization of an action set [A], (5) a simplified algorithm architecture, (6) strength-based fitness, (7) consideration of single-step, or supervised learning problems and the introduction of the correct set [C], (8) accuracy-based fitness (9) the combination of fuzzy logic with LCSValenzuela-Rend√≥n, Manuel. \\"The Fuzzy Classifier System: A Classifier System for Continuously Varying Variables.\\" In ICGA, pp. 346-353. 1991. (which later spawned a lineage of fuzzy LCS algorithms), (10) encouraging long action chains and default hierarchies for improving performance on multi-step problems, (11) examining latent learning (which later inspired a new branch of anticipatory classifier systems (ACS)W. Stolzmann, \\"Anticipatory classifier systems,\\" in Proceedings of the 3rd Annual Genetic Programming Conference, pp. 658‚Äì664, 1998. ), and (12) the introduction of the first Q-learning-like credit assignment technique. While not all of these concepts are applied in modern LCS algorithms, each were landmarks in the development of the LCS paradigm. = The revolution = Interest in learning classifier systems was reinvigorated in the mid 1990s largely due to two events; the development of the Q-Learning algorithmWatkins, Christopher John Cornish Hellaby. \\"Learning from delayed rewards.\\" PhD diss., University of Cambridge, 1989. for reinforcement learning, and the introduction of significantly simplified Michigan-style LCS architectures by Stewart Wilson. Wilson's Zeroth-level Classifier System (ZCS) focused on increasing algorithmic understandability based on Hollands standard LCS implementation. This was done, in part, by removing rule-bidding and the internal message list, essential to the original BBA credit assignment, and replacing it with a hybrid BBA/Q-Learning strategy. ZCS demonstrated that a much simpler LCS architecture could perform as well as the original, more complex implementations. However, ZCS still suffered from performance drawbacks including the proliferation of over-general classifiers. In 1995, Wilson published his landmark paper, \\"Classifier fitness based on accuracy\\" in which he introduced the classifier system XCS. XCS took the simplified architecture of ZCS and added an accuracy-based fitness, a niche GA (acting in the action set [A]), an explicit generalization mechanism called subsumption, and an adaptation of the Q-Learning credit assignment. XCS was popularized by its ability to reach optimal performance while evolving accurate and maximally general classifiers as well as its impressive problem flexibility (able to perform both reinforcement learning and supervised learning). XCS later became the best known and most studied LCS algorithm and defined a new family of accuracy-based LCS. ZCS alternatively became synonymous with strength-based LCS. XCS is also important, because it successfully bridged the gap between LCS and the field of reinforcement learning. Following the success of XCS, LCS were later described as reinforcement learning systems endowed with a generalization capability. Reinforcement learning typically seeks to learn a value function that maps out a complete representation of the state/action space. Similarly, the design of XCS drives it to form an all-inclusive and accurate representation of the problem space (i.e. a complete map) rather than focusing on high payoff niches in the environment (as was the case with strength-based LCS). Conceptually, complete maps don't only capture what you should do, or what is correct, but also what you shouldn't do, or what's incorrect. Differently, most strength-based LCSs, or exclusively supervised learning LCSs seek a rule set of efficient generalizations in the form of a best action map (or a partial map). Comparisons between strength vs. accuracy- based fitness and complete vs. best action maps have since been examined in greater detail.Kovacs, Timothy Michael Douglas. A Comparison of Strength and Accuracy-based Fitness in Learning and Classifier Systems. 2002.Kovacs, Tim. \\"Two views of classifier systems.\\" In International Workshop on Learning Classifier Systems, pp. 74-87. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2001 = In the wake of XCS = XCS inspired the development of a whole new generation of LCS algorithms and applications. In 1995, Congdon was the first to apply LCS to real-world epidemiological investigations of disease followed closely by Holmes who developed the BOOLE++, EpiCS,Holmes, John H. \\"Discovering Risk of Disease with a Learning Classifier System.\\" In ICGA, pp. 426-433. 1997. and later EpiXCSHolmes, John H., and Jennifer A. Sager. \\"Rule discovery in epidemiologic surveillance data using EpiXCS: an evolutionary computation approach.\\" InConference on Artificial Intelligence in Medicine in Europe, pp. 444-452. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2005. for epidemiological classification. These early works inspired later interest in applying LCS algorithms to complex and large-scale data mining tasks epitomized by bioinformatics applications. In 1998, Stolzmann introduced anticipatory classifier systems (ACS) which included rules in the form of 'condition-action-effect, rather than the classic 'condition-action' representation. ACS was designed to predict the perceptual consequences of an action in all possible situations in an environment. In other words, the system evolves a model that specifies not only what to do in a given situation, but also provides information of what will happen after a specific action will be executed. This family of LCS algorithms is best suited to multi-step problems, planning, speeding up learning, or disambiguating perceptual aliasing (i.e. where the same observation is obtained in distinct states but requires different actions). Butz later pursued this anticipatory family of LCS developing a number of improvements to the original method.Butz, Martin V. \\"Biasing exploration in an anticipatory learning classifier system.\\" In International Workshop on Learning Classifier Systems, pp. 3-22. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2001. In 2002, Wilson introduced XCSF, adding a computed action in order to perform function approximation. In 2003, Bernado-Mansilla introduced a sUpervised Classifier System (UCS), which specialized the XCS algorithm to the task of supervised learning, single-step problems, and forming a best action set. UCS removed the reinforcement learning strategy in favor of a simple, accuracy- based rule fitness as well as the explore/exploit learning phases, characteristic of many reinforcement learners. Bull introduced a simple accuracy-based LCS (YCS)Bull, Larry. \\"A simple accuracy-based learning classifier system.\\" Learning Classifier Systems Group Technical Report UWELCSG03-005, University of the West of England, Bristol, UK (2003). and a simple strength-based LCS Minimal Classifier System (MCS)Bull, Larry. \\"A simple payoff-based learning classifier system.\\" InInternational Conference on Parallel Problem Solving from Nature, pp. 1032-1041.

In 2008, Drugowitsch published the book titled \\"Design and Analysis of Learning Classifier Systems\\" including some theoretical examination of LCS algorithms. Butz introduced the first rule online learning visualization within a GUI for XCSF (see the image at the top of this page). Urbanowicz extended the UCS framework and introduced ExSTraCS, explicitly designed for supervised learning in noisy problem domains (e.g. epidemiology and bioinformatics).Urbanowicz, Ryan J., Gediminas Bertasius, and Jason H. Moore. \\"An extended michigan-style learning classifier system for flexible supervised learning, classification, and data mining.\\" In International Conference on Parallel Problem Solving from Nature, pp. 211-221.

Moore. \\"Using expert knowledge to guide covering and mutation in a michigan style learning classifier system to detect epistasis and heterogeneity.\\" InInternational Conference on Parallel Problem Solving from Nature, pp. 266-275. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2012. (2) a form of long-term memory referred to as attribute tracking, allowing for more efficient learning and the characterization of heterogeneous data patterns, and (3) a flexible rule representation similar to Bacardit's mixed discrete- continuous attribute list representation. Both Bacardit and Urbanowicz explored statistical and visualization strategies to interpret LCS rules and perform knowledge discovery for data mining. Browne and Iqbal explored the concept of reusing building blocks in the form of code fragments and were the first to solve the 135-bit multiplexer benchmark problem by first learning useful building blocks from simpler multiplexer problems. ExSTraCS 2.0 was later introduced to improve Michigan-style LCS scalability, successfully solving the 135-bit multiplexer benchmark problem for the first time directly. The n-bit multiplexer problem is highly epistatic and heterogeneous, making it a very challenging machine learning task.  Variants  = Michigan-Style Learning Classifier System = Michigan-Style LCSs are characterized by a population of rules where the genetic algorithm operates at the level of individual rules and the solution is represented by the entire rule population. Michigan style systems also learn incrementally which allows them to perform both reinforcement learning and supervised learning, as well as both online and offline learning. Michigan-style systems have the advantage of being applicable to a greater number of problem domains, and the unique benefits of incremental learning. = Pittsburgh-Style Learning Classifier System = Pittsburgh-Style LCSs are characterized by a population of variable length rule-sets where each rule-set is a potential solution. The genetic algorithm typically operates at the level of an entire rule-set. Pittsburgh- style systems can also uniquely evolve ordered rule lists, as well as employ a default rule. These systems have the natural advantage of identifying smaller rule sets, making these systems more interpretable with regards to manual rule inspection. = Hybrid systems = Systems that seek to combine key strengths of both systems have also been proposed.  Advantages  * Adaptive: They can acclimate to a changing environment in the case of online learning. * Model free: They make limited assumptions about the environment, or the patterns of association within the data. ** They can model complex, epistatic, heterogeneous, or distributed underlying patterns without relying on prior knowledge. ** They make no assumptions about the number of predictive vs. non- predictive features in the data. * Ensemble Learner: No single model is applied to a given instance that universally provides a prediction. Instead a relevant and often conflicting set of rules contribute a 'vote' which can be interpreted as a fuzzy prediction. * Stochastic Learner: Non-deterministic learning is advantageous in large-scale or high complexity problems where deterministic or exhaustive learning becomes intractable. * Implicitly Multi- objective: Rules evolve towards accuracy with implicit and explicit pressures encouraging maximal generality/simplicity. This implicit generalization pressure is unique to LCS. Effectively, more general rules, will appear more often in match sets. In turn, they have a more frequent opportunity to be selected as parents, and pass on their more general (genomes) to offspring rules. * Interpretable:In the interest of data mining and knowledge discovery individual LCS rules are logical, and can be made to be human interpretable IF:THEN statements. Effective strategies have also been introduced to allow for global knowledge discovery identifying significant features, and patterns of association from the rule population as a whole. * Flexible application ** Single or multi-step problems ** Supervised, Reinforcement or Unsupervised Learning ** Binary Class and Multi-Class Classification ** Regression ** Discrete or continuous features (or some mix of both types) ** Clean or noisy problem domains ** Balanced or imbalanced datasets. ** Accommodates missing data (i.e. missing feature values in training instances)  Disadvantages  * Limited Software Availability: There are a limited number of open source, accessible LCS implementations, and even fewer that are designed to be user friendly or accessible to machine learning practitioners. * Interpretation: While LCS algorithms are certainly more interpretable than some advanced machine learners, users must interpret a set of rules (sometimes large sets of rules to comprehend the LCS model.). Methods for rule compaction, and interpretation strategies remains an area of active research. * Theory/Convergence Proofs: There is a relatively small body of theoretical work behind LCS algorithms. This is likely due to their relative algorithmic complexity (applying a number of interacting components) as well as their stochastic nature. * Overfitting: Like any machine learner, LCS can suffer from overfitting despite implicit and explicit generalization pressures. * Run Parameters: LCSs often have many run parameters to consider/optimize. Typically, most parameters can be left to the community determined defaults with the exception of two critical parameters: Maximum rule population size, and the maximum number of learning iterations. Optimizing these parameters are likely to be very problem dependent. * Notoriety: Despite their age, LCS algorithms are still not widely known even in machine learning communities. As a result, LCS algorithms are rarely considered in comparison to other established machine learning approaches. This is likely due to the following factors: (1) LCS is a relatively complicated algorithmic approach, (2) LCS, rule-based modeling is a different paradigm of modeling than almost all other machine learning approaches. (3) LCS software implementations are not as common. * Computationally Expensive: While certainly more feasible than some exhaustive approaches, LCS algorithms can be computationally expensive. For simple, linear learning problems there is no need to apply an LCS. LCS algorithms are best suited to complex problem spaces, or problem spaces in which little prior knowledge exists.

The term 'rule-based machine learning (RBML)' is useful, as it more clearly captures the essential 'rule-based' component of these systems, but it also generalizes to methods that are not considered to be LCSs (e.g. association rule learning, or artificial immune systems). More general terms such as, 'genetics-based machine learning', and even 'genetic algorithm'Congdon, Clare Bates. \\"A comparison of genetic algorithms and other machine learning systems on a complex classification task from common disease research.\\" PhD diss., The University of Michigan, 1995. have also been applied to refer to what would be more characteristically defined as a learning classifier system. Due to their similarity to genetic algorithms, Pittsburgh-style learning classifier systems are sometimes generically referred to as 'genetic algorithms'. Beyond this, some LCS algorithms, or closely related methods, have been referred to as 'cognitive systems', 'adaptive agents', 'production systems', or generically as a 'classifier system'.Wilson, Stewart W., and David E. Goldberg. \\"A critical review of classifier systems.\\" In Proceedings of the third international conference on Genetic algorithms, pp. 244-255. Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc., 1989. This variation in terminology contributes to some confusion in the field. Up until the 2000s nearly all learning classifier system methods were developed with reinforcement learning problems in mind. As a result, the term ‚Äòlearning classifier system‚Äô was commonly defined as the combination of ‚Äòtrial-and-error‚Äô reinforcement learning with the global search of a genetic algorithm. Interest in supervised learning applications, and even unsupervised learning have since broadened the use and definition of this term.

Hippopotamidae had historically been classified among the Suina for morphological reasons, but is now more often classified as the sister group of the whales, or Cetacea. Classification Cladogram showing the position of Suinamorpha The suborder Suina includes Suidae (pig family) and Tayassuidae (peccary family). The Merycoidodonts, or \\"oreodonts\\", a branch of the tylopoda, were often considered suines due to the popular, though inaccurate, description of them as \\"ruminating hogs\\". Oreodonts were not suines; they were more closely related to camels. Similarly, the entelodonts had long been classified as members of Suina. Spaulding et al. have found them to be closer to whales than to pigs in their Cetacodontamorpha. Some morphological studies have suggested that the hippopotamus family Hippopotamidae was part of the Suina, but a growing body of morphological and genetic evidence has suggested that they share a common ancestor not with the Suina, but with Cetaceans‚Äîthe clade that includes whales and dolphins. Whales and hippopotamids form a clade called Whippomorpha. The most recent research into the origins of hippopotamidae suggests that hippos and whales shared a common semi-aquatic ancestor that branched off from other Artiodactyls around . Descendants of this hypothesized ancestor likely split into two branches around . One branch would evolve into cetaceans, possibly beginning with the proto-whale Pakicetus from and other early whale ancestors, known as Archaeoceti, which eventually underwent aquatic adaptation into the almost completely aquatic cetaceans. Anatomy The anatomy of the Suina differs from other even-toed ungulates. For example, they have maxillary (upper) incisor teeth. In contrast, other even-toed ungulates, such as goats and deer, have incisors only on the lower jaw, with a horny dental pad where the upper incisors would be. Most even-toed ungulates have a four-chambered stomach. In contrast, the Suina have a simple stomach that allows an omnivorous diet.Boar skeleton While most artiodactyls have long slender legs, the Suina generally have short, stubby legs.

Kuhn was born in K√∂nigsberg in Brandenburg's Neumark region. From 1841 he was connected with the K√∂llnisches Gymnasium at Berlin, of which he was appointed director in 1870. Kuhn was the founder of a new school of comparative mythology, based upon comparative philology. Inspired by Jakob Grimm's Deutsche Mythologie, he first devoted himself to German stories and legends, and published M√§rkische Sagen und M√§rchen (1842), Norddeutsche Sagen, M√§rchen und Gebr√§uche (1848), and Sagen, Gebr√§uche und M√§rchen aus Westfalen (1859). But it is on Kuhn's researches into the language and history of the Indo-Germanic peoples as a whole that his reputation is founded. His chief works in this connection are Zur √§ltesten Geschichte der Indogermanischen V√∂lker (1845), in which he endeavoured to give an account of the earliest civilization of the Indo-Germanic peoples before their separation into different families, by comparing and analysing the original meaning of the words and stems common to the different languages; Die Herabkunft des Feuers und des G√∂ttertranks (1859; new edition by Ernst Kuhn, under title of Mythologische Studien, 1886); and √úber Entwicklungsstufen der Mythenbildung (1873), in which he maintained that the origin of myths was to be looked for in the domain of language, and that their most essential factors were polysemy and homonymy. Kuhn was also the editor of the Zeitschrift f√ºr vergleichende Sprachforschung auf dem Gebiete der Indogermanischen Sprachen, which was at his time the standard periodical on the subject.

It is named after the Simmental ‚Äì the valley of the Simme river ‚Äì in the Bernese Oberland, in the canton of Bern in Switzerland. It is reddish in colour with white markings, and is raised for both milk and meat.  History  = European origin = Among the older and most widely distributed of all breeds of cattle in the world, and recorded since the Middle Ages, the Simmental breed has contributed to the creation of several other famous European breeds, including the Montbeliarde (France), the Pezzata Rossa d'Oropa (Italy), and the Fleckvieh (Germany and Austria). = Africa = Namibia (1893) and South Africa (1905) were the first countries outside Europe where the breed was successfully established. Here the breed is known as Simmentaler and is mainly used for beef cattle production under suckler cow systems. Today, the breeders' society is, as far as animal numbers are concerned, the fourth largest of the 32 nondairy breeds in Southern Africa. The main reasons for its popularity are (i) it can be used with great success in crossbreeding for breeding of both cows with much milk and heavy weaners/oxen, (ii) a large number of performance-tested bulls, (iii) comprehensive advice and other breed improvement services to its breeders, and (iv) animals that do not pass stringent inspection by breed experts, are permanently eliminated from the herdbook. = Soviet Union = In the former Soviet Union, the Simmental was the most important cattle breed. Russian Simmental (–°–∏–º–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞–ª—å—Å–∫–∞—è –∫–æ—Ä–æ–≤–∞) accounted for one-quarter of all cattle in the USSR.

Published by BAYERN-GENETIK GmbH, Munich, 2014 Types No other breed in the world has such a large within-breed-type variation as Simmental-Fleckvieh which is classifiable in the following types: * Dairy type like specialised dairy breeds (referring to Swiss Fleckvieh (code SF) with over 55% Red Holstein blood and the French Montebeliard breed); * Dual purpose but major emphasis on milk; * Truly dual-purpose (all cows are milked and bulls excel in weight gain); * Moderate beef type (suckler, extensive ranching with moderate to small frame size); * Extreme beef type (suckler, comparable to specialised beef breeds like for example Charolais, large frame size). The traditional colouration of the Simmental has been described variously as \\"red and white spotted\\" or \\"gold and white\\", although there is no specific standard colouration, and the dominant shade varies from a pale yellow-gold all the way to very dark red (the latter being particularly popular in the United States). The face is normally white, and this characteristic is usually passed to crossbred calves. The white face is genetically distinct from the white head of the Hereford.

He moved to America in 1923, founded the Vedanta Society of Southern California in 1930, and spent the rest of his life there. Biography Born in India, he joined the Ramakrishna Order after graduating from Calcutta university in 1914. He was initiated by Swami Brahmananda, the spiritual son of Sri Ramakrishna, and the first president of the Ramakrishna Math and Mission, headquartered in Belur, West Bengal.About Prabhavananda In 1923, he was sent to the United States of America. Initially he worked as an assistant minister of the Vedanta Society of San Francisco. After two years, he established the Vedanta Society of Portland. In December 1929, he moved to Los Angeles where he founded the Vedanta Society of Southern California in 1930. Under his administration the Vedanta Society of Southern California grew over the years to become the largest Vedanta Society in the West, with monasteries in Hollywood and Trabuco Canyon and convents in Hollywood and Santa Barbara.List of VSSC centers Prabhavananda was a scholar who wrote a number of books on Vedanta and Indian religious scriptures and commentary. He was assisted on several of the projects by Christopher Isherwood or Frederick Manchester. His comprehensive knowledge of philosophy and religion attracted such disciples as Aldous Huxley and Gerald Heard. Prabhavananda died on the bicentennial of America's independence, July 4, 1976, and on the 74th anniversary of the death, or mahasamadhi, of Swami Vivekananda, the founder of the Ramakrishna Order in India and many of the Vedanta centers in America and Europe. Influence Prabhavananda's book The Spiritual Heritage of India was reviewed in the academic journal Philosophy. The review stated that \\"Swami Prabhavananda has written a charming and authoritative book on the spiritual heritage of India, by which he means that heritage in consonance with the Vedic tradition and its culmination in Vedanta\\" (p. 376).Dale Riepe (1963). [Untitled - review of Prabhavananda's The Spiritual Heritage of India]. Philosophy, v38 n146, pp376-377. DOI S0031819100058411 The reviewer stated that \\"throughout the book breathes an air of relaxed simplicity and conviction.... I was particularly refreshed by the absence of attacks on science, materialism, naturalism, and other such means to spiritual fulfilment\\" (pp. 376‚Äì377). Prabhavananda and Isherwood's translation of the Bhagavad Gita was reviewed by Time Magazine in 1945. Time described the translation as \\"a distinguished literary work\\" that was \\"simpler and freer than other English translations (three of which have been published in the past year).... It may help U.S. readers to understand not only the Gita itself, but also its influence on American letters through one of its greatest U.S. admirers, Ralph Waldo Emerson\\" (pp. 98, 100).

Their thoraces and abdomens are brown in color, with blue or yellow stripes or spots on the thorax, and yellow, blue or green spots on the abdomen. Natalia von Ellenrieder's 2003 paper demonstrated that the Holarctic and Neotropical species placed in this genus did not share a common ancestor, and proposed the latter be placed in the genus Rhionaeschna. The name Aeshna was coined by the Danish entomologist Fabricius in the 18th century. The name may have resulted from a printer's error in spelling the Greek Aechma, \\"a spear\\". The spelling Aeschna has been intermittently used over a period of time, but is now abandoned for the original name Aeshna.

He was known there as Il giovane dei paesi (the young man of the landscapes), but although he continued to draw and paint landscapes throughout his career, he aspired instead to grand manner figure painting. He painted historical painting in a style based largely on Michelangelo, giving great prominence to the monumental anatomy of his figures, even in works with ascetic saints as their subject. His Resurrection of Lazarus (1555) was painted for the Colonna palace in Subiaco. It established his fame; Michelangelo himself pronounced its author one of the \\"first artists of that age\\". The painting was later placed in the church of Santa Maria Maggiore above the artist's tomb; it was afterwards transferred to the Quirinal Palace, and now is in the Vatican Pinacoteca. The painting returns to a spatial organization and narrative composition more typical of the High Renaissance than of Muziano's Mannerist contemporaries. Muziano came to be the leading artist in Rome during the 1570-80s, painting in a style that appealed to Counter-Reformation patrons. He worked for Cardinal Ippolito II d'Este from 1560‚Äì66, and his frescoes for the Cardinal's villas in Tivoli could be seen in Villa d'Este. His most noted paintings include Circumcision, formerly the high altarpiece in the church of the Ges√π (although now removed to a corridor behind the sacristy), paintings for three chapels in Santa Maria in Aracoeli, and St Jerome preaching to Monks in the Desert in Santa Maria degli Angeli. This last painting was one of two altarpieces that Muziano painted for St. Peter's Basilica during the time when Muziano served as superintendent of works for Pope Gregory XIII (the other painting, a \\"Mass of St. Basil\\" is lost, although it is recorded in an etching by Jacques Callot). Muziano also designed mosaics for the Gregorian Chapel in the basilica, and was responsible for re-founding the Academy of St Luke (Accademia di San Luca) in Rome (1577). His works can also be seen Santa Caterina dei Funari, the Galleria Colonna (portrait of Vittoria Colonna), in Orvieto (Museum of Cathedral), and in the church of San Francesco in Frascati. He died in 1592, and was buried in the church of Santa Maria Maggiore.

She enforced the Embargo Act of 1807 and fought in the First Barbary War ‚Äì taking part in the blockade of Tripoli and the capture of Derna ‚Äì and the War of 1812. During the latter conflict, she had been audaciously raiding British merchant shipping in British home waters for a month, when the heavier British intercepted her. After a sharp fight during which Arguss captain, Master Commandant William Henry Allen, was mortally wounded, Argus surrendered when the crew of Pelican were about to board. Construction and commissioning The United States Congress authorized construction of the brig, originally named USS Merrimack, the second U.S. Navy ship of that name, on 23 February 1803, and on 29 April 1803 the U.S. Navy contracted with the shipyard of Edmund Hartt at Boston, Massachusetts, to construct the ship. Edmund Hartts brother, Joseph Hartt, drafted the plans for the brig, designed with a flush deck and fine lines to optimize her for sailing conditions in the Mediterranean Sea. Captain Edward Preble was appointed superintendent of her construction, and her keel was laid down at Hartts yard on 12 May 1803.Cressman, p. 64. On 14 May 1803, two days after Merrimacks keel was laid, United States Secretary of the Navy Robert Smith assigned Preble to duty as commanding officer of the frigate , then at Boston, in addition to his duties related to Merrimacks construction. Smith informed Preble on 21 May 1803 that Preble was to take command of the U.S. Navys Mediterranean Squadron, which was to include Constitution and Merrimack, and on 27 May ordered Lieutenant Stephen Decatur, Jr. to take command of Merrimack and supervise her construction to allow Preble to focus on preparing Constitution for Mediterranean service. USS Argus (1803), circa unknown Smith found that U.S. Navy officers disliked the name Merrimack for the new brig, and he directed that she be renamed Argus, the first U.S. Navy ship of that name, on 4 June 1803. Although work on her construction proceeded quickly at first, Decatur reported on 11 July 1803 soon after arriving to take command that her construction had fallen behind schedule, although her builders assured him that she would be launched before the end of July. Decatur recruited her crew and procured her armament from Providence, Rhode Island, but by the beginning of August 1803 heavy and persistent rains had delayed her launching by two weeks. Her launch day finally came on 20 August 1803, but the attempt to launch her failed when she did not move down the ways. After the ways degree of incline was increased, Argus was successfully launched on 21 August 1803. Labor problems during her fitting out then delayed her completion but, though no document recording the date of her commissioning has been found, she was in commission and ready for sea by early September 1803. In service, Argus was reported to sail swiftly and easily, although prone to heavy pitching when lying toCressman, p. 65. (i.e., when her sails were arranged so as to counteract each other). On more than one occasion, observers described her as a remarkably handsome ship.Cressman, pp. 64, 65. First Barbary War Argus set sail from Boston on 8 September 1803, bound for the Mediterranean and service with the Mediterranean Squadron in the First Barbary War. She soon suffered a badly sprung bowsprit in exceptionally heavy seas, and Decatur put into Newport, Rhode Island, on 18 September 1803 to have it fixed, reasoning that repairs would be far easier in the United States than in the Mediterranean.Cressman, p. 65. She returned to sea on 28 September 1803Cressman, p. 65. and set a course for Gibraltar, where she arrived after a transatlantic voyage on 1 November 1803. There, Decatur exchanged commands with Lieutenant Isaac Hull, relinquishing command of Argus to Hull and relieving Hull of command of the schooner .Cressman, p. 65. Argus made a brief cruise to the east and then, in accordance with orders from now-Commodore Preble, commander of the Mediterranean Squadron, returned to Gibraltar to watch the Moroccans while the rest of the squadron sailed east to blockade Tripoli. During the early part of 1804, she cruised the western Mediterranean in an unsuccessful search for a Tripolitan cruiser reportedly operating in that area. In March 1804, she received orders to join the rest of the squadron off Tripoli. =Blockade of Tripoli= USS Argus (the third from the right) participating in the bombardment of Tripoli, 3 August 1804, painting by Michele Felice Corn√®, 1752-1845 Argus arrived at Tripoli in company with Constitution and Enterprise on 19 June 1804, but left the blockade late in the month to join a neutral ship at Syracuse, Sicily, and escort her back to Tripoli with supplies for the captive officers and crew of the frigate which had been taken by the Tripolitans after she had run aground on an uncharted reef off Tripoli in October 1803. Argus resumed her blockade duties on 7 July 1804. At that point, Preble began preparations for a shore bombardment. Heavy weather, however, postponed the action until early August. On 3 August 1804, the squadron moved in to provide long-range support for the gunboats and mortar boats actually engaged in the bombardment. The bombardment was considerably less damaging to the defensive works protecting Tripoli than hoped for, though the American gunboat crews boarded and carried several of the Tripolitan vessels sent out to engage them. The squadron conducted another ineffectual bombardment of Tripoli on 7 August 1804. Two days later, Commodore Preble embarked in Argus to reconnoiter Tripoli harbor. During that mission, Tripolitan shore batteries fired upon Argus, and she was struck below the waterline by a single shot. Fortunately for her, the shot did not pass all the way through her hull, and she remained on station off Tripoli. On 28 August 1804, the squadron conducted a third bombardment of the defenses of Tripoli in which its guns inflicted severe damage. A week later, on the night of 4 September 1804, Argus was among the ships that escorted the ill-fated fire ship to the entrance of Tripoli harbor. When Intrepid blew up prematurely, killing her entire crew, Argus remained there to pick up survivors, but none had appeared by sunrise when she returned to her blockade station. =Capture of Derna= Through the winter of 1804-1805, Argus alternated between blockade duty off Tripoli and periods in port at Malta and Syracuse. In the spring of 1805, she participated in one of the more celebrated episodes of American naval history, the capture of Derna. During the preceding months, she had made several voyages to Egypt in support of Consul William Eatons efforts to raise a force of men to take Derna in conjunction with the deposed pasha. After a march of over 600 miles (970 km) across the Libyan Desert in what is now Libya, the polyglot army ‚Äì there were only 10 Americans in the whole force ‚Äì arrived at Derna on 25 April 1805. Argus had met the army a day or two earlier at the Gulf of Bomba to provide provisions. Now, she made preparations to provide bombardment assistance for the landward assault. Eatons force launched its attack on Derna on 27 April 1805. Argus and the schooner anchored about half a mile (800 meters) to the eastward of the fortifications. The Tripolitans opened fire almost immediately upon Argus and the sloop-of-war , anchored quite a bit nearer than Argus and Nautilus. By 14:45 that afternoon, gunfire from the ships silenced all of the guns in the city. A desperate charge led by United States Marine Corps Lieutenant Presley O'Bannon managed to carry the gun batteries by storm and breathed new life into the assault. After hoisting the American flag over the battlements, O'Bannon ordered the already loaded captured guns to be turned on the town. By 16:00 that afternoon, the entire town had fallen to Eaton's army, and the enemy fled to the hinterland. The capture of Derna has been immortalized in the words of the Marines' Hymn (\\"... to the shores of Tripoli\\"). After Eaton's and O'Bannon's victory, a Tripolitan army, which had been sent to reinforce the town, arrived and began preparations to retake Derna. Argus remained offshore to provide gunfire support in the defense of the town throughout the occupation of Derna. When the Tripolitans finally assaulted the town on 13 May 1805, Argus joined in the fray and enabled the defensive forces narrowly to beat back the charging enemy troops. Arguss guns wreaked havoc among the enemy forces during their headlong retreat. Between that time and early June 1805, the Tripolitans made a few more half-hearted approaches during which Arguss long 12-pounders (5 kg) came into play. However, things remained relatively quiet, for negotiations with the pasha in power were already underway. On 11 June 1805, orders arrived for Eatons force to evacuate Derna as negotiations had been concluded. The troops and the deposed pasha were embarked in Constellation that evening, and Argus and the other American ships quit the area. Operations, 1805‚Äì1812 Argus continued to cruise the Mediterranean until the summer of 1806. She returned to the United States at the Washington Navy Yard in Washington, D.C., on 13 July 1806 and was laid up there in ordinary. In 1807, she was fitted out at the Washington Navy Yard, returned to full commission, and began a series of cruises along the Atlantic coast of the United States to enforce the Embargo Act of 1807, which she continued through the outbreak of the War of 1812 between the United States and the United Kingdom in June 1812. War of 1812 After the outbreak of war, Argus continued her cruises off the U.S. Atlantic coast. During one cruise between 8 October 1812 and 3 January 1813, she captured six valuable prizes and eluded an entire British squadron during a three-day stern chase. Through clever handling, she even managed to take one of the prizes as she was fleeing from the overwhelmingly superior British force. =Capture by HMS Pelican= Prelude Under the command of Master Commandant William Henry Allen, Argus broke out of New York Harbor on 18 June 1813, eluding the British blockade. Her mission was not warlike to begin with; it was to deliver William H. Crawford to his post as Minister to the First French Empire. Argus arrived at Lorient in Brittany, France, on 11 July 1813, disembarked Crawford, and put out to sea again three days later to begin raiding British shipping in the English Channel and Irish Sea. During the next month, she captured nineteen merchant ships. Rather than weaken his crew by sending the captured ships to American, French, or neutral ports under prize crews, Allen set most of the captured ships on fire. The intense operations exhausted Arguss crew.Roosevelt, 1882 p.114 The shipping losses soon caused insurance rates for merchant shipping to increase greatly. The cargo on the sunken ships was worth about two million dollars. The British Admiralty sent orders to all available ships to hunt down Argus. The British brig-sloop had just arrived in Cork Harbour in Ireland, having escorted a convoy from the West Indies, and immediately put to sea again on 10 August 1813. Pelicans captain was Commander John Fordyce Maple, an officer who had joined the Royal Navy when twelve years old in 1782, two years before William Henry Allen was born.Dye, 1994 p.150 On 13 August, Argus took two final prizes. One of them was from Oporto, Portugal, and was carrying wine. Both American and BritishForester, 1956 p.134 historians have suggested that Arguss crew looted some of the cargo, and that their debauched state affected their performance during the coming battle with Pelican. As with Arguss previous captures, the Americans set fire to the prize; unfortunately for them, Pelican was near enough to sight the smoke from the burning vessel and make for it. Battle and capture At 05:00 on the morning of 14 August 1813, Argus and Pelican sighted each other five leagues (about 15 miles) west of St David's Head. Argus was the faster but more lightly armed vessel, with eighteen 24-pounder carronades and a 12-pounder chase gun against the Pelicans sixteen 32-pounder carronades, one 12-pounder long gun, and two 6-pounder long guns.Roosevelt, 1882 p.115 Allen could have used Arguss greater speed to escape. Instead, he accepted battle. Allens decision to accept battle against a heavier opponent stemmed from confidence gained while he was the first lieutenant of the frigate when she captured the British frigate on 25 October 1812; following his promotion he had said that he could \\"take any British 22-gun sloop-of-war in ten minutes.\\"James (1824), vol.6, p. 221. The wind was from the south, giving Pelican the weather gauge (i.e. the windward position). Allen sailed westward on the port tack (i.e., with the wind to port) and opposed his port side battery to Pelican's starboard battery. The British prepare to board ArgusFour minutes after the ships exchanged their first broadsides, Allen lost a leg. His first lieutenant was also badly wounded, and Arguss rigging was badly cut up. Pelican tried to cross Arguss stern to deliver raking fire but Arguss second lieutenant, William Howard Allen (not related to the commanding officer), threw his sails aback to slow the American brig and instead raked Pelican. This did not fatally cripple the British vessel, and the two brigs continued to exchange broadsides, with Pelican now to leeward. After four more minutes, Arguss rigging was too badly damaged for the Americans to prevent Pelican from crossing Arguss stern and delivering several raking broadsides. Finally, three-quarters of an hour after the action began, the two vessels came into contact, Arguss bow against Pelicans quarter. As British boarding parties mustered but before they could board Argus, the Americans surrendered. Unusually for the War of 1812, the American gunnery in this engagement was comparatively ineffective, although Pelicans sides were \\"filled with grapeshot\\" and two of Pelicans carronades had been dismounted. British gunnery was \\"at least of the standard which had brought victory in a hundred victories against the French.\\"Forester, 1956 p.135 Aftermath Pelican and the captured Argus went in to Plymouth, England. Allen died there of his wounds a week after the battle. He was buried with full military honors. The rest of the crew, including sailing master Uriah P. Levy, were held as prisoners of war in England for the duration of the war.

He worked for patrons in the principal cities of Flanders. He became the court painter to successively Emperor Charles V and King Philip II of Spain.Peter Carpreau, Michiel Coxcie (1499-1592) - De vlaamse Rafa√´l in: OKV2013.4, 2013 - 51ste jaargang Ruben Suykerbuyk, Michiel Coxcie (1499 - 1592) Als Kopiist, Master paper submitted for degree of Master in Art Sciences, Promotor: Prof. Dr. Koenraad Jonckheere, University of Ghent, Academic year 2010-2011 Highly respected by his contemporaries, Coxie was given the nickname the Flemish Raphael as some of his contemporaries regarded him as being on an equal level as the Italian master. This also reflected his contemporaries' appreciation that his study of classical Antiquity and the art of Renaissance masters like Raphael, Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci during his 10-year residence in Italy had left an important mark on his style. His innovative style and bold compositions were in the centuries after his death an inspiration to Flemish artists including Peter Paul Rubens. He was thus an important artistic link between the artists of early Netherlandish painting and the Flemish Baroque. Coxie was also a copyist and produced a well-known copy of the Ghent Altarpiece by the van Eyck brothers as well as a Descent from the Cross by Rogier van der Weyden.The Flemish Raphael at M ‚Äì Museum Leuven  Life  =Early life and training= No records survive about the early life and training of Michiel Coxie. His year of birth has been determined to be 1499 through deduction from later sources. The place of his birth also remains uncertain. It is generally assumed that he was born in Mechelen as this was the first place he appears to have returned to after his long-term residence in Italy. Some art historians have suggested that his place of birth was in the region around Hasselt, then in the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge. David and Goliath The master or masters from whom he received his artistic training are not documented. Most known facts and statements of later biographers point to a training in the workshop of the Brussels master Bernard van Orley. It is known that during his stay in Rome, Coxie enjoyed the favor of the Flemish Cardinal Willem van Enckevoirt who may have been Bernard van Orley's patron in Rome assuming van Orley really took the trip to Rome as some sources have suggested. It has been speculated that this relationship with the Cardinal proves that van Orley recommended his pupil to his former patron. Michiel Coxie was also asked to complete the commission for the stained glass windows of the Brussels cathedral of St Michael and St Gudula after Bernard van Orley died in 1541. The early Flemish artist biographer Karel van Mander states in his Schilderboeck of 1604 that Coxie trained with a 'Bernard van Brussel' (Bernard from Brussels). It is therefore reasonable to conclude that Coxie was a pupil of Bernard van Orley. Even so, due to the lack of contemporary documentary evidence and surviving youth works by Coxie it is not possible to confirm with certainty that Bernard van Orly was Coxie's master.Koenraad Jonckheere, 'The life and times of Michiel Coxcie 1499-1592', in: Koenraad Jonckheere, Peter Carpreau, e.a., Michiel Coxcie and the giants of his age, 2013, Harvey Miller Publishers, pp. 29-49 =Foreign travel= The earliest documents attesting to Michiel Coxie's life and activities date to the period of his residence in Rome. The Florentine artist and artist's biographer Giorgio Vasari knew Coxie personally. He recounts that Coxie was commissioned by Cardinal Willem van Enckevoirt to paint frescoes in the Santa Maria dell'Anima. Work on the frescoes likely commenced around 1531. As the fresco technique is a painting technique typical of the Italian Renaissance and virtually unknown in contemporary Flemish painting, it must be assumed that by the time Coxie started work on the frescos he had already resided in Italy for a period of time so as to familiarise himself with this technique. It is therefore believed he may have arrived in Italy around 1527 after the sack of Rome by the Spanish king Charles V. It appears that the frescoes in the Santa Maria dell'Anima earned him a reputation in Rome. Not long after completing the frescoes in 1534 he was admitted to the Compagnia di San Luca, Rome's guild of painters and miniaturists. He was one of the first Flemish artists to be inducted into the guild. Coxie stayed in Italy until the end of the 1530s executing many commissions. He was involved in the decoration of the new St. Peter's Basilica but the frescoes that he created are lost due to later renovations to the interior of the church. During his stay in Italy he also provided designs for Italian engravers including for the series of 32 prints on the history of Amor and Psyche which was engraved by Agostino Veneziano and the Master of the Die and published by Antonio Salamanca in Rome between 1530 and 1560. The martyrdom of St. Sebastian =Return to Flanders= Coxie travelled in 1539 back to his home country via Milan. While in Milan he made two designs for tapestries. He first settled in Mechelen where he registered in the local Guild of Saint Luke on 11 November 1539. He lived in Mechelen in a house on the Bruul, in the city centre. He married Ida van Hasselt, a native of the city of Hasselt, then in the County of Loon in the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge. He later resided in Li√®ge, the principal city in the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge. Li√®ge was at that time an important artistic centre where important artists such as Lambert Lombard, Frans Floris an Willem Key were active. Lombard and Floris were Romanists, i.e. artists from the Low Countries who had travelled to Rome where they had assimilated the new Renaissance currents which they translated upon their return home into a break with the Netherlandish painting traditions.Ilja M. Veldman. \\"Romanism.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 23 June 2020 It is not entirely clear how long he stayed in Li√®ge. It may be that for a while he travelled between Mechelen and Li√®ge. The first children of Coxie, a son Raphael and a daughter Anna, may have been born in Li√®ge although other sources place their births in Mechelen. Raphael followed in his father's footsteps and became a successful painter.Raphael Coxie at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Another son called Willem was born in Mechelen in 1545 or 1546. Willem also became a painter but no existing works by him are known.Guillaume Coxie at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Killing of Abel Upon his return to the Low Countries Coxie became a sought-after artist who gained many commissions. The first important one was the 1540 commission for The Holy Kinship (now in Stift Kremsm√ºnster, Kremsm√ºnster, Austria). This work, probably commissioned by the Antwerp Hosemakers Guild for their altar in the Antwerp Cathedral, is a monumental triptych showing at the centre the Virgin Mary with her mother Anna, Christ and John the Baptist. The scene is set in an overwhelming Renaissance architecture with many figures. With this work Coxie offered the general public in Flanders its first confrontation with the monumental, grand style of the High Renaissance. When Bernard van Orley died in 1541, while he was working on the designs for stained glass windows for the chapel of the Habsburg rulers in the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula in Brussels, Coxie took over the commission and delivered four designs. Afterwards he was commissioned to design a cycle of stained glass for the St Bavo's Cathedral in Ghent. It is believed that around this time he succeeded van Orley as the court painter to Mary of Hungary, sister of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and the governor of the Netherlands. Coxie also contributed to the new Habsburg castle in Binche, construction of which started in 1546. The architect was Jacques du Broeucq from Mons who had also lived and studied in Italy. Coxcie realized fresco paintings in the new castle. He also received the commission to paint a retabel for the rood screen of the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula in Brussels. In 1543 Coxie was registered as a poorter (citizen of the city of Brussels and as a member of the local Guild of Saint Luke. Brussels was at the time the administrative capital of the Low Countries where the court of Mary of Hungary was established. He operated a large workshop in Brussels. His financial success was such that by 1550 he owned two houses in Brussels. He became gradually sought after as a designer of cartoons for tapestries, first by the Habsburg rulers but later also by the local industry. This is not surprising because at that time Brussels was the world center for the production of tapestries, then an important economic factor in the entire Netherlands. He was given the title of cartoon painter of the city of Brussels for which he received an annual salary. Several of Coxcie's tapestry designs have been documented, but none have survived. Some cartoons and series of tapestries have been attributed to him, based on stylistic rather than archival grounds. He participated in the 'Jagiellonian tapestries' which were sold to Sigismund II Augustus for his castle on the Wawel. He created the designs for some biblical scenes including scenes from the Story of the First Parents, the Story of Noah and the Story of the Tower of Babel. Coxie may also have designed the tapestries for Phillip II's Royal Palace of Madrid depicting episodes of the life of Cyrus II, based on the writing of Herodotus.Campbell, T. (2002) Art & Magnificence. Tapestry in the Renaissance, p. 394-403. The judgement of Solomon Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, then the ruler over the Low Countries, commissioned many works from Coxie. Coxie also gained commissions from many other prominent persons such as the Morillon family for whom he painted the Triptych with the triumph of Christ (M ‚Äì Museum Leuven). Guy Morillon, originally from Burgundy, was one of the most prominent notables of Leuven and a secretary to king Charles V. Coxie further designed the decorations for the joyous entry of then crown prince Philip II in Brussels in 1549 and a series of portraits of the Habsburg rulers. When in 1555 king Charles V stepped down from the throne in favor of his son Philip II, the new ruler maintained the royal support for Coxie. Philip tasked Coxie with making a true-to-life copy of the Ghent Altarpiece by the van Eyck brothers. As the altarpiece was located in the St Bavo's Cathedral in Ghent, Coxie temporarily moved to Ghent to execute this commission. He resided there from 1557 to 1559. After completing his copy in 1559, he moved to Mechelen where he acquired a house on the Bruul by swopping it for one of his Brussels homes. He continued to live in this city and became a member of the local chamber of rhetoric de Peoene and the guild of musketeers. At the time Mechelen had gained importance as a religious centre in Flanders because of the founding in 1559 of the Archbischopric of Mechelen, which from 1561 was led by the powerful cardinal Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle who was also the king's chancellor. Philip II of Spain commissioned two copies of Van der Weyden's Descent from the Cross from Coxie. Original Sin When in 1566 the Beeldenstorm caused the destruction of many religious objects he is said to have attempted to defend Mechelen against the iconoclasts. This shows that he was at heart a devout Catholic and a loyalist of the Habsburg court. This attitude earned him the strong support of the king as well as the protection of the Duke of Alba, governor of the Habsburg Netherlands between 1567 and 1573.√Ångeles Tilve Jar, El Tributo al C√©sar de Michiel Coxcie en el Museo de Pontevedra, Museo de Pontevedra, pp. 1-9 The Beeldenstorm caused the loss of a large portion of Coxcie's existing works. This era of religious turmoil saw the painter facing many other setbacks. His son Willem who had travelled to Rome in 1567 to study art was arrested in Italy on suspicion of heresy as he had travelled with a group of Dutch and German Protestants. He was convicted to the galleys for 10 years. After the king's chancellor de Granvelle, who was then living in Rome, interceded personally with the Pope the sentence was cut in half. A few years later king Philip II himself intervened leading to the liberation of Willem.Soriano, V., Michel Coxcie, pintor grato a la casa de Habsburgo in: Archivo Espa√±ol de Arte, Volume 81, 322, April‚ÄìJune 2008, Instituto Diego Vel√°zquez, pp. 194-195 This illustrates the extent of the support by powerful figures which the artist enjoyed at that time. Even the Duke of Alva bestowed favors on him and his family when he granted Michiel and his son Raphael dispensation from the compulsory billeting of Spanish soldiers at their homes. His wife died in 1569. Two months after her death he married Jeanne van Schelle (or van Schellen or van Schallen), with whom he had two more children of whom Michiel the Younger became a painter. The painter's whereabouts from the 1570s are not entirely clear. In October 1572 Spanish troops plundered Mechelen for three days after retaking the city from an army under the command of William the Silent, the leader of the Dutch Revolt. The event known as the Spanish Fury caused many local painters to flee to Antwerp. Coxie was outside of the country, possibly in Spain, when the events happened. His house was plundered and some painters from Antwerp were able to buy back some tapestry designs which Spanish soldiers had looted from his home. Portrait of Christina of Denmark Upon his return to Flanders, Coxie stayed in Mechelen and took on two pupils in his workshop. However, Mechelen had become a cultural wasteland while Antwerp offered attractive opportunities as many of the altarpieces which had been destroyed needed to be replaced and its leading history painters Frans Floris and Willem Key had just died. He completed an altarpiece in Antwerp in 1575 and was registered in the Guild of Saint Luke of Antwerp in 1578. He remained in Antwerp during the period from 1580 to 1585 when the city was governed by a Calvinist government. He was even able as a Catholic to obtain commissions from the local government, which was tolerant of Catholics. In 1585 he was registered as a tenant in the Kloosterstraat in Antwerp, while his house in Mechelen was rented out. After the Fall of Antwerp and the return of Spanish Catholic control over the city in 1585, Coxie immediately gained commissions from patrons in Mechelen, including the city government. The continued appreciation of the Spanish king for the elderly artist was demonstrated when in 1589, he granted him an annuity. Coxie continued painting even when he was over 90 years old.. His last work, dated 1592, was the Triptych of the Legend of Santa Gudula, today in the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula in Brussels. This contains on the back of one of the side panels the only known portrait of Philip II painted by the artist. Shortly thereafter, he died after accidentally falling off a scaffold while working on the restoration of the Judgment of Solomon in the Antwerp City Hall that he had made nine years earlier for the Antwerp City Council. Work =General= Coxie was a prolific artists, who painted altarpieces and portraits and produced designs for stained-glass windows, tapestries and prints. He was skilled in the traditional Flemish oil on panel technique as well as the Italian fresco technique. His career spanned almost the entire 16th century. He operated a large workshop which ensured a large output which contributed to his lifetime reputation and influence. After his death his work soon fell into oblivion as it was overtaken quickly by the triumphant Baroque style introduced into Flanders by Rubens, another Flemish artist who had studied and worked for an extended time in Italy. Plato‚Äôs Cave His style is a unique synthesis of the Flemish and Italian artistic traditions. His presumed master Bernard van Orley had possibly never studied in Italy but had certainly familiarised himself with the new pictorial vocabulary of the Italian Renaissance through his study of the designs of Raphael. These designs had been brought to Brussels. He had responded to Raphael's work by making the Ô¨Ågures in his altarpieces more monumental and heroic. He also included classical architecture in his compositions. During his stay in Rome, Coxie was able to directly study the works of Raphael, Michelangelo and other Renaissance painters as well as study the works of Antiquity that were being rediscovered at the time. He also read classical literature and philosophy and was aware of the intellectual discussions on the reception of Antique art in Italy. The panel Plato‚Äôs Cave which he likely painted during his stay in Rome is an attempt by Coxie to express these visual and philosophical influences. The painting references Plato's ideas expressed in his The Sofist about how art imitates nature and sometimes deviates from perfect imitation by changing the proportions in order for the viewer to get a true appreciation of the real object. Coxie deals in Plato's Cave with the question about how art can properly depict reality and what art can tell us about that reality. Only the viewer of the painting can see the way out of the cave, and according to Plato, this search should be the object of all true philosophy. In Plato's Cave Coxie borrows heavily from Michelangelo's models as well as from Antique models. For instance, the Roman Antique statue of Falling Galatian (Venice National Archaeological Museum) was the model for the tormented man in the centre.Koenraad Jonckheere, 'Michiel Coxcie and classical antiquity', in: Koenraad Jonckheere, Peter Carpreau, e.a., Michiel Coxcie and the giants of his age, 2013, Harvey Miller Publishers, pp. 64-97 The Holy Kinship The first important work he realised upon his return to Flanders after his stay in Italy shows all the key characteristics of his style and the contribution he made to Flemish painting. The triptych of The Holy Kinship (now in Stift Kremsm√ºnster, Kremsm√ºnster, Austria) was painted in 1540 for the Antwerp Hosemakers Guild's altar in the Antwerp Cathedral. It is a monumental triptych showing at the centre the Virgin Mary with her mother Anna, Christ and John the Baptist. The scene is set in an overwhelming Renaissance architecture with many figures. With this work Coxie showed that he had mastered the Italian style, while not abandoning his roots. The painting has many Italian characeristics. The figure of the Virgin, for instance, goes back directly to Da Vinci. The architectural columns, drapes and niches were inspired by Raphael. Flemish elements in the work are the attention to detail and the rich colour which evoke the work of Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden. =Prints= Like many artists of his time, Coxie provided designs for the printers and engravers. An important graphic series by Coxi recounts the story of Amor and Psyche. The series was attributed for a long time to Raphael, which testifies to Coxcie's excellence as a draughtsman. The Italian artist biographer Giorgio Vasari who knew Coxie personally recounts that Coxie made the design sketches. Another series of prints designed by Coxie tells the stories of The loves of Jupiter. He based his designs for both series on stories and art works from Antiquity as well as on works by Raphael and Michelangelo.Michiel Coxcie, The Flemisch Raphael, Museum M Leuven, Leuven, October 2013 References External links * Category:1499 births Category:1592 deaths Michiel Category:Flemish painters Category:Flemish history painters Category:Flemish engravers Category:16th- century engravers Category:Flemish Renaissance painters Category:Court painters Category:People from Mechelen Category:Flemish tapestry artists ","title":"Michiel Coxie"},{"id":"854556","title":"Paul Channon"},{"id":"854557","title":"List of members of the European Parliament for the United Kingdom, 1989‚Äì1994"},{"id":"854560","text":"ROUTE 66 Geographic Information Systems B.V. is a privately held company headquartered in Pf√§ffikon, Switzerland.

He is considered to be among the last practitioners, along with his brothers, of the classic Venetian school of painting. In the early part of his career he collaborated with his older brother Gian Antonio in the production of religious paintings. After Gian Antonio's death in 1760, Francesco concentrated on vedute. The earliest of these show the influence of Canaletto, but he gradually adopted a looser style characterized by spirited brush-strokes and freely imagined architecture. Biography Francesco Guardi was born in Venice into a family of nobility from Trentino. His father Domenico (born in 1678) and his brothers Niccol√≤ and Gian Antonio were also painters, later inheriting the family workshop after the father's death in 1716. They probably all contributed as a team to some of the larger commissions later attributed to Francesco. His sister Maria Cecilia married the pre-eminent Veneto-European painter of his epoch, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. In 1735, Guardi moved to the workshop of Michele Marieschi, where he remained until 1743. His first certain works are from 1738, for a parish at Vigo d'Anuania, in Trentino. In this period he worked alongside his older brother, Gian Antonio. The first work signed by Francesco is a Saint Adoring the Eucharist (c. 1739). House of Guardi in Cannaregio His works in this period included both landscapes and figure compositions. His early vedutas show influence both from Canaletto and Luca Carlevarijs. On 15 February 1757, he married Maria Mattea Pagani, the daughter of painter Matteo Pagani. In 1760 his brother Gian Antonio died and his first son, Vincenzo, was born. His second son, Giacomo, was born in 1764. In 1763 he worked in Murano, in the church of San Pietro Martire, finishing a Miracle of a Dominican Saint clearly influenced by Alessandro Magnasco in its quasi- expressionistic style. Francesco Guardi's most important later works include the Doge's Feasts, a series of twelve canvases celebrating the ceremonies held in 1763 for the election of Doge Alvise IV Mocenigo. In his later years, Canaletto's influence on his art diminished, as shown by the Piazzetta in the Ca' d'Oro of Venice. In circa 1778, he painted the severe Holy Trinity Appearing to Sts. Peter and Paul in the parish church of Roncegno. Capriccio View of a Venetian Campo (c. 1780) In 1782 Guardi was commissioned by the Venetian government six canvases to celebrate the visit of the Russian Archdukes in the city, of which only two remain, and two others for that of Pope Pius VI. On September 12 of that year he was admitted to the Fine Art Academy of Venice. A stronger attention to colours is present in late works such as the Concerto of 80 Orphans of 1782, now in Munich, in the Fa√ßade of Palace with Staircase in the Accademia Carrara of Bergamo. Guardi died at Campiello de la Madona in Cannaregio (Venice) in 1793. Mature style View on the Cannaregio Canal, Venice, c. 1775‚Äì1780, National Gallery of Art Among all the paintings attributed to either Francesco and his brother Gian Antonio Guardi, the most praised work is not a landscape, but instead the airy sfumato Story of Tobit painted for the organ loft in the small Chiesa dell'Angelo San Raffaele. To quote from the Web Gallery of Art: > Perspective, organized aerial space, the Palladian solidity of Tiepolo... > are exchanged for a personal style of coloured handwriting ‚Äì now brilliantly > calligraphic, and now brilliantly cloudy. Guardi's painterly style is known as pittura di tocco (of touch) for its small dotting and spirited brush-strokes. This looser style of painting had been used by Giovanni Piazzetta and Sebastiano Ricci, and recalls, in some religious themes, the sweetened sfumato of Barocci's Bolognese style. In this he differs from the more linear and architecturally accurate style of Canaletto's painting. This style, a century later, would make Guardi's works highly prized by the French Impressionists. Canaletto, as a vedutista, concentrated on glamorous urban architecture erected by the serene republic; on the other hand, in Guardi, the buildings often appear to be melting and sinking into a murky lagoon. Canaletto's canvases often have intricate linear and brilliant details, and depict Venice in sunny daylight. Guardi paints clouded skies above a city at dusk. These contrasts, however, simplify the facts, since Canaletto often painted the drab communal life and neighborhoods (creating in them some epic artistic qualities), while Guardi did not avoid sometimes painting the ceremonies of Ducal Venice. Ultimately, Guardi's paintings evoke the onset of the dissipation. The citizenry has shrunken to an impotent lilliputian crowd of \\"rubber-neckers\\", unable to rescue the crumbling Republic, as for example in the Fire in the Oil Depot in San Marcuola. It was fitting depiction of the rapidly declining empire, which had declined, in Napoleon's assessment, into a \\"drawing room of Europe\\" peopled with casinos, carnivals, and courtesans for hire.

He gained wealth in New Amsterdam (later New York City) in the fur trade and tobacco business. In what became known as Leisler's Rebellion following the English Revolution of 1688, he took control of the city, and ultimately the entire province, from appointees of deposed King James II, in the name of the Protestant accession of William III and Mary II. Beginning in 1689, Leisler led an insurrection and seized control of the city by taking over Fort James at the lower end of Manhattan. He took over control of the entire province, appointing himself as acting Lieutenant Governor of the Province of New York, which he retained until March 1691, refusing to yield power until the newly appointed governor himself finally arrived. While Leisler claimed to have acted to support the Protestant accession against Jacobite officeholders in New York, he was arrested by the newly appointed governor of New York in March 1691. With opponents active against him, he was condemned and executed in New York City for treason against the English monarchs William III and Mary II. His estate was forfeited to the Crown. During his period of control, Leisler completed a major purchase of property from John Pell, lord of Pelham Manor, to set up a French Huguenot settlement north of Manhattan. This developed as the city of New Rochelle, New York. Leisler's son and supporters found the trial and conviction most unjust; it was mounted by his enemies. They worked to clear the names of Leisler and Jacob Milborne (his son in law) and for the restoration of their estates to their heirs, which was achieved in 1695 by an act of Parliament. Remains of the two men were reinterred with honors at the Dutch Reformed Church in Manhattan. Early life Leisler was born in the village of Bockenheim, now a central part of Frankfurt am Main, Germany, in March 1640, the son of Calvinist French Reformed minister Jacob Victorian Leisler. After his father's death in 1651, Leisler was sent to military school. He went to New Amsterdam (later New York) in 1660 as a soldier in the service of the Dutch West India Company. Leaving the company's employ soon after his arrival, Leisler engaged in the lucrative fur trade and tobacco trade, and became a wealthy man. New York tax records from 1676 list Leisler as the third wealthiest man in the city. In 1674, Leisler was one of the administrators of a forced loan imposed by Anthony Colve. While residing in Albany in 1676, Leisler engaged in a theological dispute with the Rev. Nicholas van Rensselaer, who had been appointed to the Reformed pulpit by James, Duke of York (later King James II). His finances and reputation both suffered from this encounter, as he and a fellow dissenter Jacob Milborne were forced to pay all the costs of a lawsuit they had initiated in the dispute. While on a voyage to Europe in 1678, he was captured by Moorish pirates, and was compelled to pay a ransom of 2,050 pieces of eight to obtain his freedom. Leisler had endeared himself to the common people by befriending a family of French Huguenots who had been landed on Manhattan island. They were so destitute that a public tribunal had decided they should be sold into slavery in order to pay their ship charges. Leisler prevented the sale by purchasing the freedom of the widowed mother and son before the sale could be held. French Huguenots were arriving in New York as refugees from religious persecution by Catholics in France. Under Thomas Dongan's administration in 1683, Leisler was appointed one of the judges, or \\"commissioners,\\" of the court of admiralty in New York, a justice of the peace for New York City and County, and a militia captain. Leisler's rebellion The English Revolution of 1688 also played out in New York, where people of a wide variety of religious and ethnic backgrounds divided into two well-defined factions. In general, the small shopkeepers, small farmers, sailors, poor traders and artisans allied against the patroons (landholders), rich fur- traders, merchants, lawyers and crown officers. The former were led by Leisler (himself a wealthy man), the latter by Peter Schuyler, Nicholas Bayard, Stephen Van Cortlandt, William Nicolls and other representatives of the aristocratic Hudson Valley families. The Leislerians claimed greater loyalty to the Protestant accession. In 1688, Governor Dongan was succeeded by Lieutenant-Governor Francis Nicholson. In 1689, the military force of the city of New York consisted of a regiment of five companies, with Leisler as one of the company captains. He was popular with the men and was probably the only wealthy resident in the province who sympathized with the Dutch lower classes. At that time, the latter were agitated owing to the attempts of the Jacobite office-holders to retain power in spite of the revolution in England and the accession of William III and Mary II to the throne. When news was received that Governor Sir Edmund Andros had been imprisoned in Boston by the opposition, the Leislerians took possession, on May 31, 1689, of Fort James at the southern end of Manhattan Island. They renamed it Fort William and announced their determination to hold it until the arrival of a governor commissioned by the new sovereigns. On a report that supporters of King James II were about to seize the fort and massacre their Dutch fellow-citizens, an armed mob gathered on the evening of 2 June 1689 to overthrow the existing government. The cry of \\"Leisler\\" was raised, and the crowd rushed to his house. At first, he refused to lead the movement, but when the demand was reiterated he acceded, and within an hour received the keys of the fort, which had been seized. The revolutionaries took advantage of the fort containing all the public funds, which return Lieutenant Governor Nicholson demanded in vain. Four hundred of the new party signed an agreement to hold the fort \\"for the present Protestant power that reigns in England,\\" while a committee of safety of ten of the city freeholders assumed the powers of a provisional government, of which they declared Jacob Leisler to be the head. They commissioned him as \\"captain of the fort.\\" In this capacity, he began to repair the fort, strengthening it with a battery of six guns beyond its walls. This was the origin of the public park known as the Battery in Lower Manhattan. Thus began Leisler's Rebellion. =Leisler as acting lieutenant-governor= The aristocrats also favored deposing James, but preferred to continue the provincial government established by his authority rather than risk the danger of an interregnum. Nicholson and the council of the province, with the authorities of the city, headed by Mayor Stephen van Cortlandt, attempted to prevent the uprising, but without effect. Finally, becoming alarmed for his own safety, Lieutenant-Governor Nicholson sailed for England on the 24th of June. The New York City mayor and other officials retired to Albany. Albany held out against Leisler's authority for a time. In November, Leisler sent Jacob Milborne to Albany with an armed force to assist in its defense against any Indians. Milborne was directed to withhold aid unless Leisler's authority was recognized. This was refused, and Milborne returned unsuccessful. But after the destruction of Schenectady on February 19, 1690, by the French and their allied Indians, Christian Mohawk among them, Albany submitted to Leisler's authority. Under authority of a letter from the home government addressed to Nicholson, \\"or in his absence, to such as for the time being takes care for preserving the peace and administering the laws in His Majesty's province of New York,\\" Leisler had assumed the title of lieutenant- governor in December 1689. He dissolved the committee of safety, appointed a council, and took charge of the government of the entire province. He appointed Jacob Milborne as Clerk to the Council, Attorney-General, Advocate General and his Secretary. Milborne married Leisler's daughter Mary. Leisler summoned the first Intercolonial Congress in America, which met in New York on May 1, 1690, to plan concerted action against the French and Native Americans in the ongoing conflict in North America. The congress planned an expedition against Canada. It equipped and dispatched against Quebec the first fleet of men-of-war ever sent from the Port of New York. However, the expedition was unsuccessful. In the meantime, Colonel Henry Sloughter had been commissioned Governor of the Province of New York by William and Mary on September 3, 1689, but he did not reach New York until March 19, 1691. =Leisler and the Huguenots= Acting on behalf of a group of Huguenots in New York, Leisler brokered the purchase of land upon which they could settle. In 1689 John Pell, Lord of Pelham Manor, officially deeded 6,100 acres (25 km¬≤) to Leisler for the establishment of a Huguenot community north of Manhattan. On September 20, 1689, Leisler donated a third of this land to Huguenot refugees. In addition to the purchase money, Leisler and his heirs and assigns were to yield and pay unto John Pell and his heirs and assigns (Lords of the Pelham Manor) one \\"Fat Calf\\" yearly, as acknowledgment of their feudal obligation to the Manor.New York - A Guide to The Empire State, Work Projects Administration of New York, p. 245. This settlement developed as the city of New Rochelle, New York. =End of the rebellion= Howard Pyle's depiction of Governor Sloughter signing Leisler's death warrant On January 28, 1691, English Major Richard Ingoldesby, who had been commissioned Lieutenant Governor of the province, landed with two companies of soldiers in Manhattan and demanded possession of Fort James. Leisler refused to surrender the fort without an order from the king or the governor. After some controversy, Ingoldesby attacked the fort on 17 March, during which Leisler's forces killed two of his soldiers and wounded several. When Governor Sloughter finally arrived in New York the following March, he immediately demanded Leisler's surrender. Leisler refused to surrender the fort until he was convinced of Sloughter's identity and the governor had sworn in his council. As soon as the latter event occurred, he wrote the governor a letter resigning his command. Sloughter responded by arresting Leisler and nine of his colleagues, including his son-in-law Jacob Milborne. All but Milborne were released after trial. Leisler was imprisoned, charged with treason and murder. Shortly afterward he was tried and condemned to death. His son-in-law and secretary, Milborne, was condemned on the same charges. Leisler's son and other supporters were outraged by the trials, as they were considered unjust. The judges were the personal and political enemies of the prisoners, and their acts were described as \\"gross.\\" Governor Sloughter was said to have hesitated to sign the death-warrants, but was trying to stabilize politics in the colony and did not have sufficient influence among the elite of New York City. He was said to finally sign the warrants under the influence of wine. On the 16 May 1691, Leisler and Milborne were executed. The court had sentenced them to be hanged \\"by the Neck and being Alive their bodyes be Cutt downe to Earth and Their Bowells to be taken out and they being Alive, burnt before their faces. . .\\" (In fact, the real villain [Robert Livingston] later bragged in writing that the pair were spared the disemboweling and were cut down before dead and decapitated by sword. The crowd then began fighting over their heads to acquire hair as a souvenir.) and by the English law of treason, their estates were forfeited to the Crown. Leisler's son and other supporters appealed for justice from the committee of the Privy Council; it reported that, although the trial was in conformity to the forms of law, they nevertheless recommended the restoration of the estates to their heirs. Restitution In 1695, by an act of Parliament, achieved through the efforts of Leisler's son and supporters, the names of Jacob Leisler and Milborne were cleared. Leisler's estate was restored to his heirs. Three years later the Earl of Bellomont, who had been one of the most influential supporters of Leisler's son, was appointed as governor of New York. Through his influence the assembly voted an indemnity to Leisler's heirs.

The name is from the Greek word .The Merck Index. Entry 1009. p. 167. Structurally-related chemical compounds are often referred to collectively as batrachotoxins. It is an extremely poisonous alkaloid. In certain frogs this alkaloid is present mostly on the skin. Such frogs are among those used for poisoning darts. Batrachotoxin binds to and irreversibly opens the sodium channels of nerve cells and prevents them from closing, resulting in paralysis. No antidote is known. History It was named by scientists John W. Daly and Bernhard Witkop, who separated the potent toxic alkaloids fraction and determined its chemical properties. They isolated four major toxic steroidal alkaloids including batrachotoxin, isobatrachotoxin, pseudobatrachotoxin, and batrachotoxinin A. Due to the difficulty of handling such a potent toxin and the minuscule amount that could be collected, a comprehensive structure determination involved several difficulties. However, Takashi Tokuyama, who joined the investigation later, converted one of the congener compounds, batrachotoxinin A, to a crystalline derivative and its unique steroidal structure was solved with x-ray diffraction techniques (1968). When the mass spectrum and NMR spectrum of batrachotoxin and the batrachotoxinin A derivatives were compared, it was realized that the two shared the same steroidal structure and that batrachotoxin was batrachotoxinin A with a single extra pyrrole moiety attached. In fact, batrachotoxin was able to be partially hydrolyzed using sodium hydroxide into a material with identical TLC and color reactions as batrachotoxinin A. The structure of batrachotoxin was established in 1969 through chemical recombination of both fragments. Batrachotoxinin A was synthesized by Michio Kurosu, Lawrence R. Marcin, Timothy J. Grinsteiner, and Yoshito Kishi in 1998. Toxicity According to experiments with rodents, batrachotoxin is one of the most potent alkaloids known: its subcutaneous in mice is 2 ¬µg/kg. Meanwhile, its derivative, batrachotoxinin A, has a much lower toxicity with an of 1000 ¬µg/kg. The toxin is released through colourless or milky secretions from glands located on the back and behind the ears of frogs from the genus Phyllobates. When one of these frogs is agitated, feels threatened or is in pain, the toxin is reflexively released through several canals. = Neurotoxicity = As a neurotoxin, it affects the nervous system. Neurological function depends on depolarization of nerve and muscle fibres due to increased sodium ion permeability of the excitable cell membrane. Lipid- soluble toxins such as batrachotoxin act directly on sodium ion channels involved in action potential generation and by modifying both their ion selectivity and voltage sensitivity. Batrachotoxin (BTX) irreversibly binds to the Na+ channels which causes a conformational change in the channels that forces the sodium channels to remain open. Batrachotoxin not only keeps voltage-gated sodium channels open, but it also reduces the single-channel conductance. In other words, the toxin binds to the sodium channel and keeps the membrane permeable to sodium ions in an all or none manner. This has a direct effect on the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Batrachotoxin in the PNS produces increased permeability (selective and irreversible) of the resting cell membrane to sodium ions, without changing potassium or calcium concentration. This influx of sodium depolarizes the formerly polarized cell membrane. Batrachotoxin also alters the ion selectivity of the ion channel by increasing the permeability of the channel toward larger cations. Voltage- sensitive sodium channels become persistently active at the resting membrane potential. Batrachotoxin kills by permanently blocking nerve signal transmission to the muscles. Batrachotoxin binds to and irreversibly opens the sodium channels of nerve cells and prevent them from closing. The neuron can no longer send signals and this results in paralysis. Although generally classified as a neurotoxin, batrachotoxin has marked effects on heart muscles. These effects are similar to the cardiotoxic effects of digoxin, a poison found in the foxglove plant. Batrachotoxin interferes with heart conduction, causing arrhythmias, extrasystoles, ventricular fibrillation and other changes which lead to cardiac arrest. Batrachotoxin induces a massive release of acetylcholine in nerves and muscles and destruction of synaptic vesicles, as well. Batrachotoxin R is more toxic than related batrachotoxin A. Structural changes in nerves and muscles are due to a massive influx of sodium ions, which produces osmotic alterations. It has been suggested that there may also be an effect on the central nervous system, although it is not currently known what such an effect may be. Batrachotoxin activity is temperature-dependent, with a maximum activity at . Its activity is also more rapid at an alkaline pH, which suggests that the unprotonated form may be more active. Treatment Currently, no effective antidote exists for the treatment of batrachotoxin poisoning. Veratridine, aconitine and grayanotoxin‚Äîlike batrachotoxin‚Äîare lipid-soluble poisons which similarly alter the ion selectivity of the sodium channels, suggesting a common site of action. Due to these similarities, treatment for batrachotoxin poisoning might best be modeled after, or based on, treatments for one of these poisons. Treatment may also be modeled after that for digitalis, which produces somewhat similar cardiotoxic effects. While it is not an antidote, the membrane depolarization can be prevented or reversed by either tetrodotoxin (from puffer fish), which is a noncompetitive inhibitor, or saxitoxin (\\"red tide\\"). These both have effects antagonistic to those of batrachotoxin on sodium flux. Certain anesthetics may act as receptor antagonists to the action of this alkaloid poison, while other local anesthetics block its action altogether by acting as competitive antagonists. Sources Batrachotoxin has been found in the four Papuan beetle species C. pulchra, C. semiopaca, C. rugiceps and C. sp. A, which are all in the genus Choresine in the family Melyridae. Several species of bird endemic to New Guinea have the toxin in their skin and on their feathers: the blue-capped ifrit (Ifrita kowaldi), little shrikethrush (aka rufous shrike-thrush, Colluricincla megarhyncha), and the following pitohui species: the hooded pitohui (Pitohui dichrous, the most toxic of the birds), crested pitohui (Ornorectes cristatus), black pitohui (Melanorectes nigrescens),Avian chemical defense: Toxic birds not of a feather rusty pitohui (Pseudorectes ferrugineus), and the variable pitohui, which is now split into three species: the northern variable pitohui (Pitohui kirhocephalus), Raja Ampat pitohui (P. cerviniventris), and southern variable pitohui (P. uropygialis). While the purpose for toxicity in these birds is not certain, the presence of batrachotoxins in these species is an example of convergent evolution. It is believed that these birds gain the toxin from batrachotoxin- containing insects that they eat, and then secrete it through the skin. Batrachotoxin has also been found in a few Colombian frog species: golden poison frog (Phyllobates terribilis), black-legged poison frog (P. bicolor), and Kokoe poison frog (P. aurotaenia). The Kokoe poison frog used to include P. sp. aff. aurotaenia, now recognized as distinct. All four of those frog species are in the poison dart frog family. Of the four, the most toxic is the most recently discovered golden poison frog, which generally contains 27 times more batrachotoxin than its close relatives and is 20-fold more toxic. The frogs do not produce batrachotoxin themselves. Just as in the birds, it is believed that these frogs gain the toxin from batrachotoxin-containing insects that they eat, and then secrete it through the skin. Beetles in the genus Choresine are not found in Colombia, but it is thought that the frogs might get the toxin from beetles in other genera within the family Melyridae, which could be found in Colombia. Frogs raised in captivity do not produce batrachotoxin, and thus may be handled without risk. However, this limits the amount of batrachotoxin available for research as 10,000 frogs yielded only 180 mg of batrachotoxin.Du Bois, Justin, et al., inventor; Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University, assignee. Batrachotoxin Analogues, Compositions, Uses, and Preparation Thereof. US patent 2014/0171410 A1. June 19, 2014. As these frogs are endangered, their harvest is unethical. Biosynthetic studies are also challenged by the slow rate of synthesis of batrachotoxin. The native habitat of poison dart frogs is the warm regions of Central and South America, in which the humidity is around 80 percent. Use The most common use of this toxin is by the Noanam√° Choc√≥ and Ember√° Choc√≥ of the Embera-Wounaan of western Colombia for poisoning blowgun darts for use in hunting. Poison darts are prepared by the Choc√≥ by first impaling a frog on a piece of wood. By some accounts, the frog is then held over or roasted alive over a fire until it cries in pain. Bubbles of poison form as the frog's skin begins to blister. The dart tips are prepared by touching them to the toxin, or the toxin can be caught in a container and allowed to ferment. Poison darts made from either fresh or fermented batrachotoxin are enough to drop monkeys and birds in their tracks. Nerve paralysis is almost instantaneous. Other accounts say that a stick siurukida (\\"bamboo tooth\\") is put through the mouth of the frog and passed out through one of its hind legs. This causes the frog to perspire profusely on its back, which becomes covered with a white froth. The darts are dipped or rolled in the froth, preserving their lethal power for up to a year.

Life Charlet was born in Paris. He was the son of a dragoon in the Republican army, whose death in the ranks left the widow and orphan in very poor circumstances. Madame Charlet, however, a woman of determined spirit and an extreme Bonapartist, managed to give her boy a moderate education at the Lyc√©e Napol√©on, and was repaid by his lifelong affection. His first employment was a minor post in the Paris city administration, where he had to register recruits: he served in the National Guard in 1814, fought bravely at the Barri√®re de Clichy, and, being thus unacceptable to the Bourbon party, was dismissed from the city administration in 1816. He then, having from a very early age had a propensity for drawing, entered the atelier of the distinguished painter Baron Gros, and soon began issuing the first of those lithographed designs which eventually brought him renown. His Grenadier de Waterloo, 1817, with the motto \\"The Guard Dies and Does Not Surrender\\" ()‚Äîa famous phrase frequently attributed to Cambronne but which he never uttered, and which cannot, perhaps, be traced farther than to this lithograph by Charlet‚Äîwas particularly popular. It was only towards 1822, however, that he began to be successful in a professional sense. Lithographs (about 2000 altogether), watercolours, sepia drawings, numerous oil sketches, and a few etchings followed one another rapidly. Later in his life there were also three exhibited oil pictures, the especially admired Episode in the Campaign of Russia (1836), the Passage of the Rhine by Moreau (1837), and Wounded Soldiers Halting in a Ravine (1843). His military subjects particularly delighted Charlet, and they found an energetic response in the popular heart where they kept alive a feeling of pride and regret for the recent past of the French nation and discontent with the present. These feelings increased upon the artist himself towards the close of his career as Charlet designed many subjects of town life, peasant life, and the ways of children with much wit and whim in his descriptive mottoes. One of the most famous sets is the Vie civile, politique, et militaire du Caporal Valentin, 50 lithographs dating from 1838 to 1842. In 1838 his health began to fail owing to an affection of the chest. Charlet was an uncommonly tall man, with an expressive face, bantering and good natured. His character was full of boyish fun and high spirits, with manly independence and a vein of religious feeling. He was a hearty favourite among his intimates, one of whom was the painter Th√©odore G√©ricault. Charlet married in 1824, and two sons survived him. Legacy A life of Charlet was published in 1856 by a military friend, De la Combe. Notes References * External links Illustrations *Anne S. K.

He is currently the chair of the history department at Rice University.  English Culture and the Decline of the Industrial Spirit: The Wiener Debate  His main claim to fame lies with his 1981 book English Culture and the Decline of the Industrial Spirit: 1850‚Äì1980, which was a concerted attack on the British elite for its indifference to and wariness of industrialism and commercialism. Although the commercial and industrial revolutions originated in England, Wiener blamed a persistent strain in British culture, characterised by wariness of capitalist expansion and yearning for an arcadian rural society, which had prevented England ‚Äì and Britain as a whole ‚Äì from fully exploiting the benefits of what it had created. He was particularly scathing about the self-made industrial capitalists of the 19th century who, from the middle of that century onwards, increasingly sent their children to public schools where \\"the sons of businessmen were looked down upon and science was barely taught\\". Similar views had already been heard from the likes of Eric Hobsbawm (Marxist) and Correlli Barnett. The book inspired the New Right of the Thatcher government to move further away from the Old Right; specifically, for its first two years the Thatcher administration had held the view that Britain's industrial, economic and commercial decline was down purely to militant trade unionists and to the fact that Britain effectively bankrupted itself winning the Second World War. From 1981 onwards the faction in the party led by Keith Joseph came more and more to believe that a wariness of capitalist and economic expansionist values held by the old guard of the party had done just as much damage, if not more. Joseph gave a copy of Wiener's book to every cabinet minister. Among writers and movements of the British Right, there are those who accept Wiener's thesis and those who do not agree with it. Those who share Wiener's slant most prominently include Andrew Neil (editor of The Sunday Times in the 1980s and early 1990s), the American-based but British- raised Andrew Sullivan, the Canadian-born but U.S.-based Mark Steyn, the Times columnist and Tory MP Michael Gove, and most writers associated with The Economist (especially its Washington correspondent Adrian Wooldridge, who in 2004 likened the sort of British conservatives Wiener attacked to the leftist film-maker and polemicist Michael Moore, saying that old-school Tories dislike George W. Bush because he \\"represents an America where people believe in business, rather than dismissing it as a rather grubby pastime\\"). Among newspapers, The Sunday Times has been the most fervently Wienerite, very largely due to Andrew Neil's pervasive influence. Among Right-wing fringe groups, the Democracy Movement and other groups of Tory modernisers share most of Wiener's ideas on capitalist expansion and much of his contempt for the old guard in the party. Leading anti-Wienerites of the mainstream Right have included Peregrine Worsthorne (former editor of the Sunday Telegraph), the late Auberon Waugh, Max Hastings (former editor of The Daily Telegraph and Evening Standard) and Stuart Reid (assistant editor of The Spectator). Practically the entire British National Party and the wider far-Right movement, who are strongly economically protectionist, could also be described as anti-Wienerites (along with much else). The Conservative Democratic Alliance, a fringe group of the Old Right, is often passionately and unashamedly anti-Wienerite. Some prominent Right-wing thinkers, notably Digby Anderson, stand on the borderline. English Culture has been attacked as selective in its use of evidence and partial in its conclusions; the historians David Edgerton and W. D. Rubinstein have been leading critics of the Wiener thesis. In Edgerton's case, Wiener is simply wrong; the British state and society more generally was remarkably consistent in its technocratic aims and objectives,Edgerton, D (1991) England and the Aeroplane ‚Äì An Essay on a Militant and Technological Nation. Edgerton, D. (2006) Warfare State: Britain, 1920 ‚Äì 1970. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. and in the case of Rubinstein, Wiener is prone to \\"industrial fetishism\\", ignoring the true nature of the British economy during the period in which he writes, which is that of a consistently growing service-based economy. A standard criticism of the impressionistic nature of Wiener's work is that it relies heavily on quotations from literary sources and is barren of any quantitative analysis. In 2004 a revised edition was published of English Culture and the Decline of the Industrial Spirit: 1850‚Äì1980, reflecting on the original debate surrounding the book and accounting related events of the last 20 years.

politician with the Labor Party. Early life Delahunty was born in the Victorian town of Murtoa and educated at Loreto College in Ballarat.Who's Who in Australia 2017, ConnectWeb. She earned a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from La Trobe University. Media career Delahunty was a news journalist for the ABC and Network Ten from 1975 to 1996. She appeared in news and current affairs programs such as Four Corners and The 7.30 Report. She received a Gold Walkley award for the story Aiding and Abetting which was shown and produced by Four Corners in 1983. Aiding and Abetting was about the improper use of Australian aid money in the Philippines. In the late 1980s, Delahunty, then the chief newsreader for the ABC in Victoria, was parodied by comedian Jean Kittson on The Big Gig, where Kittson portrayed a snobbish, acid-tongued announcer called Veronica Glenhuntly (whose surname was taken from that of the elite Melbourne suburb). Delahunty was the weeknight presenter of ABC News Victoria from 1986 until 1990, she was replaced by Sue McIntosh. Political career Delahunty was elected to the seat of Northcote in the Victorian Legislative Assembly at a 1998 by-election. Her maiden speech was about the implications of the Fitzgerald report for Victoria, especially in regard to police corruption. Delahunty was Minister for Education from 1999‚Äì2002, during the term of the first Bracks Government. She was the Minister for the Arts from 1999‚Äì2006, Minister for Women's Affairs from 2002‚Äì06, and Minister for Planning from 2002‚Äì05. As Minister for Planning, she was responsible for the media presentation of Melbourne 2030. As Minister for Planning, Delahunty was criticized for the altering of the annual Surveyor- General's Report 2002‚Äì03, submitted by the Surveyor-General of Victoria, Keith Clifford Bell. The acting Victorian Ombudsman announced in January 2004 that he would ‚Äúinvestigate why the former Surveyor-General's final annual report was substantially altered before being tabled in State Parliament last November‚Äù He also announced he would investigate the misuse of the Surveyor- General‚Äôs electronic signature by the Department of Sustainability and Environment. The Auditor-General confirmed it would keep a watching brief over the investigations. It was also confirmed that the government ignored the advice of the office of the Victorian Government Solicitor ‚Äúto not interfere with the report‚Äù. Bell, himself had confirmed that the report had been altered. The complaint to the Ombudsman leading to the investigation had come from the then Opposition planning spokesman Ted Baillieuhttps://www.theage.com.au/national/ombudsman-to-probe-altered- report-20040127-gdx6ut.html Efforts to alter or block Bell‚Äôs reports, 1999-01 and 2000-01, had also occurred under the former Minister Sherryl Garbutt. Garbutt had made claims the reports were inaccurate, but were subsequently tabled without any alteration. https://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/downloadhansard/pdf/Assembly/Autumn%202004/Assembly%20Autumn%20Weekly%20Book%206%202004.pdf The Ombudsman's investigation found substantial sections altered after Bell had finished his term as Surveyor-General. It also found that Bell's signature was assigned to the Annual Report 2002-03 of the Surveyors Board of Victoria, without his knowledge or consent. The government was directed to apologize to Bell.https://www.theage.com.au/national/ex-officials-signature-misused- watchdog-20050314-gdzs3q.htmlhttps://www.theage.com.au/national/report- critical-of-delahunty-altered-20031210-gdwwn6.html Shadow Planning Minister, Ted Baillieu, in his statement to the Parliament on 9 April 2003 reported on the political interference at multiple levels, including the Planning Minister, in the performance of the responsibilities of the Surveyor-General. Bell was acknowledged as a competent, highly respected public servant and he was held in the highest esteem by both the surveying profession and the business sector.//www.parliament.vic.gov.au/downloadhansard/pdf/Assembly/Autumn%202003/Assembly%20Autumn%20Parlynet%20Weekly%20Book%204%202003.pdf In a further statement to Parliament on 4 May 2005, Baillieu commented on the \\"doctoring\\" of Bell's report, which had been done at the Minister's direction. Baillieu further cited the Ombudsman's findings that the altering of the report was inappropriate and there were concerns regarding the adequacy of the investigations. It was claimed that then Planning Minister Delahunty had misled the Parliament.https://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/downloadhansard/pdf/Assembly/Autumn%202005/Assembly%20Extract%204%20May%202005%20from%20Book%204.pdf The tabled report bears the hand-written note signed by Bell's successor: ‚ÄúAmended by the direction of the Minister.

The Auditor-General identified the interference by Land Victoria in the performance of the Surveyor-General's responsibilities, including the wrongful transfer of the Surveyor-General's responsibilities to business units of Land Victoria outside of the Office of Surveyor-General. He confirmed that such responsibilities cannot be transferred without legislative mandate. The Auditor-General found that the transfer of the functions of the Surveyor- General had seen them delivered unsatisfactorily and did not meet the obligations of the legislation. The Opposition blamed Delahunty and her predecessor Sherryl Garbutt, for extreme political interference in the performance of the Surveyor-General's responsibilities. Such interference included: attempts to block or alter annual reports from Bell; affix his electronic signature without his knowledge or permission; threats and intimidation by the former Executive Director of Land Victoria Elizabeth O'Keeffe; hiring of private investigators to investigate Bell and his office; and efforts to interfere with his review of State electoral boundaries in his capacity as a Electoral Boundaries Commissioner.https://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/downloadhansard/pdf/Assembly/Autumn%202004/Assembly%20Autumn%20Weekly%20Book%206%202004.pdf In January 2005 Bracks dumped Delahunty as Planning Minister.https://www.theage.com.au/national/on-life-death-and- treachery-20050319-gdztd4.html Rob Hulls replaced Delahunty in what the media reported as an \\"increasingly controversial\\" ministerial portfolio.https://www.theage.com.au/business/a-planner-who-plans-to-stay- public-20050430-ge02mc.html Delahunty commented in the media that In late February 2005 \\"she picked up The Sunday Age to read that members of the ruling Right faction of the ALP wanted her out of her safe seat.\\" In October 2006, Delahunty advised that she would not contest the November 2006 election due to health and family reasons.https://www.theage.com.au/national/minister-resigns- on-doctors- orders-20061006-ge39sc.htmlhttps://www.abc.net.au/news/2006-10-05/delahunty- to-quit-victorian-parliament/1278780 Personal life Delahunty is the sister of Victorian National Party MP, Hugh Delahunty, who is also a former Victorian Football League player, as is another brother, Michael.

The society can be traced back to a 13th-century guild which funded the voyage of John Cabot to Canada. In 1552, it gained a monopoly on sea trading from Bristol from its first Royal Charter. The society began surreptitious trading in slaves from West Africa before 1689, and successfully lobbied Parliament to open up the slave trade in 1698. For centuries it had almost been synonymous with the government of Bristol, especially Bristol Harbour. In recent times, the society's activities have centred on charitable agendas. The Society played a part in the development of Bristol, including the building of Clifton Suspension Bridge and the Great Western Railway. It also influenced the development of educational institutions in Greater Bristol, including University of Bristol, University of the West of England, University of Bath, City of Bristol College, Colston's Girls' School and Merchants' Academy. History A Guild of Merchants was founded in Bristol by the 13th century, and swiftly became active in civic life. It funded John Cabot's voyage of discovery to Newfoundland in 1497. The society in its current form was established by a 1552 Royal Charter from Edward VI granting the society a monopoly on Bristol's sea trade. The society remained in effective control of Bristol's harbour until 1809. Further charters were granted by Charles I, Charles II and Elizabeth II. The society's members were active in the English colonisation of North America, helping to establish the Bristol's Hope and Cuper's Cove settlements in Newfoundland. From the accession of William III in 1689, the society promoted trade protectionism which resulted in Parliament enacting policies such as restricting exports from Ireland and banning imports into Ireland from anywhere except England 'with deplorable results'. During the eighteenth century one quarter of the individual members of the Society were directly involved in the slave trade, including Michael Becher, Edward Colston, John Duckenfield, and Isaac Hobhouse. The first light on the island of Flat Holm was a simple brazier mounted on a wooden frame, which stood on the high eastern part of the island. In 1733 the Society of Merchant Venturers of Bristol found the brazier to be unreliable and petitioned the general lighthouse authority, Trinity House, for an actual lighthouse, but the petition failed. In 1735 Mr. William Crispe of Bristol submitted a proposal to build a lighthouse at his own expense. This initial proposal also failed but negotiations resumed in 1736 when 60 soldiers drowned after their vessel crashed on the Wolves rocks near Flat Holm. Following this disaster, the Society of Merchant Venturers supported William Crispe's proposal. Crispe agreed to pay ¬£800 (¬£110,552, $220,241 in 2008) for the construction of the tower as well as the fees permits. The construction of the tower finished in 1737 and it began operating on 25 March 1738. The costs of the construction of Bristol's Floating Harbour, completed in 1809, were far beyond the limited resources of the Society and necessitated the setting up of the Bristol Docks Company. Although the Society was represented on the Board, it ceded its role in the management of the port of Bristol, which had dominated its activities throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In the 19th century the Society helped to fund the building of Clifton Suspension Bridge and members of the society helped to establish the Great Western Railway. In the 1860s the Society acted with the Bristol Corporation to put Clifton Down and the adjoining Durdham Down under the control of a single Downs Committee. Alderman Proctor's Drinking Fountain on Clifton Down was built in 1872 by G and H Godwin in a Gothic Revival style to commemorate the Society's presentation in 1861 of \\"certain rights over Clifton Down made to the citizens\\" of Bristol. The Society was involved in funding the construction of the Statue of Edward Colston, which was completed in 1895 ‚Äî 170 years after the death of Colston. With growing awareness in the late 20th century of his involvement in Britain's slave trade, there were protests and petitions for changes to institutions named after Colston, alterations to the statue's plaque, or for the statue to be removed, culminating in June 2020, when the statue was toppled and dumped in Bristol Harbour by Black Lives Matter protesters. After the statue was toppled, the Merchant Venturers said that it had been \\"inappropriate\\" for them to have become involved in the rewording of the plaque in 2018. In the sixteenth century the Society had maintained a free school for mariners' children under the Merchants' Hall in King Street. A century later sailors were being instructed in the 'Arte of Navigacion'. This was to evolve into the Merchant Venturers' Technical College in Unity Street towards the end of the nineteenth century when over 2500 students were enrolled. When University College, Bristol achieved its charter as the University of Bristol in 1909, the Merchant Venturers' Technical College provided the faculty of engineering, whilst the remaining departments of the college eventually became the University of the West of England. At the beginning of the eighteenth century the Society took on Edward Colston's 'Colston's Hospital', a school for 100 boys (now Colston's School). This moved to Stapleton in 1861, becoming co-educational in 1991. In 1891 Colston's Girls' School was opened on Cheltenham Road using funds from Edward Colston's endowment. It became an academy in 2008, when Withywood School reopened as Merchants' Academy. In 2016 the Bristol Autism Free School, now called Venturers' Academy, opened nearby. Since 2017 the Society and the University of Bristol have jointly sponsored five primary schools, a secondary school, an all-through school and a special school in Bristol. The overarching Venturers' Trust now oversees the education of more than 3,200 students. The Merchant Venturers cared for twelve poor mariners in the sixteenth century and the Society continues to be involved with the care of the elderly. The Society has managed Colstons Almshouses on St Michael's Hill since its foundation by Edward Colston in 1696. Since 1922 the Society has been the endowment trustee for the independent charity, the St Monica Trust, enabling very substantial developments in recent years. The Society has also been sole trustee of the Cote Charity, set up in 1968, which in 2009 opened Katherine House, a residential care home and in 2016, Griffiths House for those living with dementia. Archives Records of the Society of Merchant Venturers including foundation and membership, administrative, financial, charities, education, estates management, trade, associated clubs and societies, the Seamen's Hospital Fund, and various name indexes are held at Bristol Archives (Ref. SMV) (online catalogue) as well as further papers and correspondence related to the Society of Merchant Venturers' interests (Ref. 12152) (online catalogue). Other deeds and estate papers related to the Society's interests in Somerset and Dorset are available at Somerset Heritage Centre. Current status Merchants' Hall on Clifton Down. The Society of Merchant Venturers comprises men and women, prepared to give their time and skills to support the organisation's objectives. The Merchant Venturers work closely with the wider community and many of its members play a role in Bristol's commercial life and the institutions within the city. Its objectives are to: # Contribute to the prosperity and well being of the greater Bristol area through active support of enterprise and commercial and community activity; # Enhance the quality of life for all, particularly for the young, aged and disadvantaged; # Promote learning and the acquisition of skills by supporting education; # Act as effective stewards of the charitable trusts, heritage, ancient buildings and open spaces for which the society is responsible. Criticisms An article in local magazine Venue, in 2002, claimed that many members were not active in charity. However, the society says that the qualification for potential members is being \\"prominent in their own sphere of business and active in the charitable or public life of the area\\". There were no female full members of the society until 2003 (though Margaret Thatcher had earlier been made an honorary member), and no ethnic minority members until 2020 when Marti Burgess, a partner at Bevan Brittan, was appointed. Venue claimed that the Merchant Venturers control 12 charities and 40 trust funds, and also a private unlimited company, SMV Investments, that has major investments in defence contracting, tobacco, genetically modified agriculture and the petroleum industry. Merchant Venturers serve on the boards of many local charitable and cultural organisations, and are guaranteed seats on the University of Bristol Court and the Downs Committee. It quotes Paul Burton of the University's School of Policy Studies as saying, \\"they exert quite a bit of influence and we, the people of Bristol, don't know much about them and can't hold them to account\\". On 7 June 2020, during international Black Lives Matter demonstrations provoked by the killing of George Floyd, a group of protestors in Bristol pulled down the 1895 statue of Edward Colston that stood in Magpie Park in The Centre, Bristol, objecting to the veneration of Edward Colston, a slave-trader, and pushed it into the harbour. During ensuing debate over the legitimacy of this act, the Society of Merchant Venturers was accused of having used its influence to block previous attempts to remove the statue legally. In response to the statue's removal, a spokesperson for the Merchant Venturers promised the society would \\"continue to educate itself about systemic racism\\".

He was Bishop of √âvreux in France from 1982 to 1995. In 1995, Pope John Paul II removed him as head of his diocese because he publicly expressed controversial and heterodox positions on religious, political and social matters. These views earned him the popular nickname of The Red Cleric.Reuters.French Against Vatican Sacking of \\"Red Cleric\\" 17 January 1995 Early years Jacques Gaillot was born in Saint-Dizier, Haute-Marne, on 11 September 1935. He decided to become a priest while still a teenager. After his secondary studies, he entered the seminary in Langres. From 1957 to 1959, he performed his compulsory military service in Algeria during the war of independence. In Rome from 1960 to 1962 he completed his studies in theology and earned his bachelor's degree. He was ordained a priest in 1961. From 1962 to 1964, he studied at the Higher Institute for Liturgy in Paris and taught at the major seminary in Ch√¢lons-en-Champagne. Beginning in 1965, he was a professor at the regional seminary of Reims. He chaired many sessions to implement the principles and policies established in the documents produced by the Second Vatican Council. In 1973, he was assigned to the parish of St Dizier in his home town and became co-manager of the institute for the training of seminary instructors in Paris. In 1977, he was appointed vicar general of the Diocese of Langres. In 1981, he was elected vicar capitular. Bishop of √âvreux On 5 May 1982, Pope John Paul II appointed him Bishop of √âvreux. He received his episcopal consecration on 20 June from L√©on Aim√© Taverdet, Bishop of Langres.Diocese of Partenia. January 2007 During his first Easter message he wrote: \\"Christ died outside the walls as he was born outside the walls. If we are to see the light, the sun, of Easter, we ourselves must go outside the walls.\\" Following this he then stated that: \\"I'm not here to convince the convinced or take care of the well. I'm here to support the ill and offer a hand to the lost. Does a bishop remain in his cathedral or does he go into the street?. . .I made my choice.\\" Within months Gaillot had begun to act on his word. In 1983, he supported a conscientious objector in √âvreux who declined to perform alternative service in forestry because it did not contribute to relief of the destitute or promoting peace. During the yearly assembly of the episcopate, he was one of the two bishops (of a total of 110) voting against the episcopate's text on nuclear deterrence, which supported having nuclear arms as a legitimate deterrent. In 1984 he angered numerous Catholic authorities by refusing to support the movement in defence of French parochial schools. In 1985, he supported the First Intifada in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and met Yasser Arafat in Tunis, being embraced by the future Nobel Peace Prize Laureate in a private audience. Perhaps the most notable event he performed in 1987 was attending, by invitation, a special session of the United Nations in New York to speak out for disarmament. The first amount of considerable media attention paid to Gaillot came in January 1985 when he signed an appeal on behalf of underpaid Catholic school teachers; also signing the appeal was Georges Marchais, the head of the French Communist Party. This proved to be highly controversial, bringing about the start of a right-wing campaign against Bishop Gaillot. Within his own diocese, Le Figaro spearheaded the campaign. At this point Bishop Gaillot was described as being \\"a tool of the church's worst enemies\\". In 1987, he went to South Africa to meet a young anti-apartheid militant from √âvreux sentenced to four years in prison by the South African r√©gime. There he also appeared at a demonstration where some Communist militants were also demonstrating. In order to accomplish this trip, he had to renounce going with the diocesan pilgrimage to Lourdes, a move that attracted criticism. Further, in the same year he also announced that the French Bishops \\"remain too preoccupied by the correct functioning of the church and its structures.\\" This only ensured that the responses to Gaillot when he later attacked the right-wing French political party, the National Front, were even stronger. Also in 1987 Gaillot traveled to Athens to show solidarity with a boatload of Palestinian refugees. In 1988, during a closed- door session of the assembly in Lourdes, he advocated the ordination of married men to the priesthood. After the proceedings had finished Gaillot spoke to the press about the discussions held and also promoted his own viewpoints. By promoting a revision of clerical celibacy and the use of condoms, he caused considerable tension with the French bishops' conference, the situation being exacerbated by the fact that in speaking to the media about the session, Gaillot had violated convention regarding assembly conclaves. He later defended his previous actions, remarking that \\"I never broke the vow of celibacy ... I only questioned it. But that's worse.\\" Also that year, Gaillot took the unprecedented step for a Roman Catholic bishop of blessing a homosexual union in a \\"service of welcoming\\", after the couple requested it in view of their imminent death from AIDS. In 1989, Galliot participated in a trip to French Polynesia organized by the peace movement, asking for the end to French nuclear testing. He also participated in the ceremony of the transfer of the ashes of the late bishop Baptiste-Henri Gr√©goire (1750‚Äì1831) to the Panth√©on, a necropolis for the great men of France. Gr√©goire had been instrumental in the first abolition of slavery, and the end of discrimination against Blacks and Jews during the French Revolution. The hierarchy of the Catholic Church had refused to give him the last sacraments because of Gr√©goire's acceptance of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. Gaillot was the only French bishop participating in this ceremony. The French journalist Henri Tincq wrote in Le Monde that Gaillot \\"has the merit of saying out loud what many people in authority in the church think deep down\\". In 1989, the French Bishops' Conference, to the extent that the members of the episcopate voted to censure him after Gaillot gave an interview to the publication Lui, a publication known for its explicit sexual content. He also gave interviews to leading gay magazines and criticized his peers as incompetent to judge the circumstances of gays and lesbians. Gaillot offered to resign but the Vatican did not respond. Toward late 1989, he made a conciliatory gesture by signing a promise of \\"loyalty\\" and \\"docility\\" to the papal authority. A week later, Gaillot appeared on television and spoke of the \\"feeble state of internal debate in the church\\" and express disappointment that progress had not been made since the Second Vatican Council. In 1991, he opposed the Gulf War, publishing a book called Open letter to those who preach war, but let it be waged by others. He also condemned the embargo on Iraq. By the end of 1991, the French Bishops' Conference had censured Gaillot three times, most recently for his intervention in Haiti, rousing support for Jean- Bertrand Aristide. Gaillot's book A Rant on Exclusion (Coup de gueule contre l'exclusion) was published in March 1994. It criticized the French laws on immigration proposed by Minister of the Interior, Charles Pasqua. On 12 April 1994, Gaillot appeared on television in a discussion with dissident Catholic theologian Eugen Drewermann. On 14 April, Archbishop Joseph Duval, President of the Bishops Conference of France, wrote to Gaillot: \\"For all to see you are in solidarity with Drewermann. But how do you show your solidarity with us, your fellow episcopal brothers and the Pope? Are you aware that your position is unsustainable? The distance from your brothers in the episcopate that you emphasize makes us suffer and has become a scandal for many Catholics.\\" Gaillot at one point offered to resign, but withdrew his offer, fearing that the Vatican might resolve his case as it had that of Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen in 1987 by appointing an auxiliary bishop with special authority. Gaillot was the target of a bitter campaign to disparage his name. Unsubstantiated allegations of homosexuality, racism, anti-Semitism, and psychosis and neurosis were made by highly placed authorities in the French hierarchy. Gaillot responded by calling Duval an \\"ayatollah\\" seeking to impose \\"ideological uniformity\\" within the French Bishops Conference. He compared the leadership style of Cardinal Bernadin Gantin, head of the Vatican's Congregation for Bishops, to that of the Stasi, the East German security police. Removal from √âvreux Gantin summoned Gaillot to a meeting at the Vatican on 13 January 1995 and offered the choice of resigning his see and becoming bishop emeritus of √âvreux or being removed from his office. Gaillot returned to France and issued a statement that said: \\"I was asked to hand in my resignation, which I thought I had good reasons to refuse.\\" As all bishops need to be assigned to a see (diocese), whether one that they administer or one to which they have only the relationship established by their title to it‚Äìa titular see‚Äìhe was assigned the titular see of Parthenia, in accordance with standard practice for a bishop without real administrative responsibilities, used routinely for auxiliary bishops, officials of the Roman Curia, and senior diplomats of the Holy See. The Church named two bishops to stay in contact with Gaillot. =Reaction to removal= This removal sparked an emotional response from thousands of people across France and the rest of the world. Twenty thousand people, including Gaillot's own mother, attended Bishop Gaillot's last Mass at the Cathedral in √âvreux and stayed on the streets protesting the Vatican's decision. Protestors united under the leadership of the Communist mayor of the region and marched on the streets in the rain. With the Cathedral full, many people stayed outside for the bishop's last Mass. Still being a bishop he left his cross, mitre and staff behind in √âvreux. The choice to remove Bishop Gaillot as ordinary of √âvreux was widely seen as a mistake by both lay people and clergy, and also by many non- religious people who had come to view Gaillot favorably. After his removal, a reported forty thousand people wrote letters to the Cathedral office at √âvreux, with more being sent to the Vatican and eminent prelates. He was perceived favorably by a significant number of people, particularly due to his ministry to all people without distinction. In addition, he had become a national figure after the sanctions taken against him.Christianity Today. Deposed Bishop Invents Online Diocese, 29 April 1996 Official polls taken at the time consistently revealed the French public to be against the punishment brought upon Gaillot. One CSA survey showed that total of 64 percent of the public were against the firing of Jacques Gaillot as bishop of √âvreux, with only 11 percent approving of his firing and a remaining 25 percent being undecided.La Vie. January 1995 Some later polls showed that support for Gaillot might even have been as high as 75 percent. Reaction from other French bishops varied. No French bishop expressed public support for Gaillot, but the spokesperson for the hierarchy reported that both Cardinal Robert-Joseph Coffy of Marseille and Archbishop Duval were \\"visibly troubled\\" by the Vatican's action. Duval released a statement that said: \\"I pleaded for patience in Rome\\". Duval later said that he \\"regretted\\" what Rome had done and called it \\"an authoritarian act which cannot be accepted by society, even if it is carried out by the Church\\". The Archbishop of Cambrai, , defended Gaillot and called his removal \\"a wound for our church... a source of misunderstanding for the poor and for all those who seek the truth and who put their trust in the church.\\" By the time he left office at the Diocese of √âvreux he had visited more prisons than any bishop in France's history. After √âvreux After being removed from his position as prelate of √âvreux, Bishop Gaillot wrote the following comment: After leaving the Bishop's Palace, Gaillot immediately moved in with illegal squatters in Paris' infamous Rue de Dragon. Since then he has shown similar solidarity with the homeless. Bishop Gaillot continues to defend human rights and engage in activism, regularly publishing information about his activities on the website of Partenia. He remains active as a pastor to the excluded. He also travels throughout France and also internationally, spreading the word of the Christian Gospel and defending those who are considered \\"outcasts\\" (namely immigrants). He is an avid anti-war protester and is considered by many to be a strong socialist. Gaillot had a strong friendship with Abb√© Pierre. In 1995, after his removal as Bishop of √âvreux, Gaillot attended a Call to Action conference in Detroit as one of the keynote speakers. He held three sessions, proving to be popular despite speaking through a translator. He hosted the conference alongside other controversial Catholic theologians including Professor Hans K√ºng and Bishop Thomas Gumbleton.Call to Action. My Option for the Poor 1996 The removal of his responsibility over a specific geographical diocese permitted Gaillot to be even more daring in his activism. In 1995 following his removal, Bishop Gaillot engaged in protests regarding the policy of French nuclear testing at Mururoa Atoll in the Tuamotu Archipelago of French Polynesia. Gaillot went with a fleet of protest ships, being on the Greenpeace vessel Rainbow Warrior, he was subsequently removed from the ship by French commandos, given that Rainbow Warrior had sailed within the exclusion zone, and escorted back to the atoll.The Militant. Protesters Say \`No Nukes In Pacific!' 7 August 1995 Twice bishops prohibited Gaillot from speaking in their dioceses. In 2000, Pope John Paul II forbade his participation in a conference in Rome about religion and homosexuals. Cardinal Joachim Meisner of Cologne banned Gaillot from addressing a World Youth Day event in Bonn in 2004 called subject of \\"Being a Christian in the Third Millennium: A Faith which has Hope\\".Lifesite News. World Youth Day Cardinal Forbids French Dissident Bishop from Speaking in Cologne 2 November 2004 Also in 2004 Bishop Gaillot met with Maryam Rajavi, a controversial Iranian political activist. Gaillot strongly criticised the actions of some extremist religious leaders in Iran, going on to comment that ‚ÄúOne must not forget that the strength of truth will make it [the Iranian resistance] triumphant. Darkness will give way and truth will prevail despite all the lies and ruses‚Äù. Rajavi publicly thanked the bishop and expressed that his support had been very effective in promoting the cause of the Iran resistance.Secretariat of the National Council of Resistance of Iran. 17 August 2004 Gaillot has also taken position as a well-known public figure in France, fighting for a number of causes; Gaillot serves as the co-chairman of one of France's foremost human rights activist groups, (Rights First), among other groups. In 2007 Gaillot expanded his use of the internet by posting a video interview on the website Google Video, attempting to bring attention to the escalating violence in Darfur.Diocese of Partenia. Darfur: conscience awakening 1 May 2007 A book released shortly after his removal from √âvreux was Voice From the Desert: A Bishop's Cry for a New Church. It was a largely autobiographical discussion of the events surrounding his removal. Reconciliation with Church authorities In 2000, Louis-Marie Bill√©, Archbishop of Lyon and president of the French Bishops Conference, invited Gaillot to attend a national ecumenical service in Lyon on 14 May alongside other senior members of the French hierarchy. Bill√© said the invitation came from the bishops as a group: \\"It is important that Catholics, and public opinion in general, are aware that the communion that links us as brothers is real, even when it is lived out in a special fashion. What happened five years ago remains a wound even for those who don't necessarily share Mgr Gaillot's opinions.\\" There was no indication that the Pope or anyone in the Roman Curia was involved. Gaillot accepted, writing that he was \\"happy to demonstrate my communion with the Church\\". On 1 September 2015, shortly before his 80th birthday, Gaillot, accompanied by Daniel Duigou, a priest and former journalist, met privately with Pope Francis in his Vatican City residence for 45 minutes. Gaillot said the pontiff encouraged him to continue his activism on behalf of migrants and refugees. After the meeting, Gaillot said he was ‚Äúin love‚Äù with Francis.

As Badgerline Group, it expanded through acquisition purchasing other formerly nationalised bus companies in England and Wales.

A corporate white, pink and blue livery nicknamed \\"Barbie\\" was introduced to new buses, while further bus company acquisitions continued. Inherited bus fleets were initially left in their original colours with First fleet names, with the intention that the Barbie scheme would stand for a set service quality. Later older buses received a modified \\"Barbie 2\\" livery. As part of its corporate branding, First subsequently removed all local branding for its bus services, buses simply carried the 'First' brand, although each company still operated independently.

James Harvest at Hammersmith Odeon, 1980s Barclay James Harvest are an English progressive rock band. They were founded in Oldham, in September 1966 by bassist/vocalist Les Holroyd (b. 1948), guitarist/vocalist John Lees (b. 1947), drummer/percussionist Mel Pritchard (1948‚Äì2004), and keyboardist/vocalist Stuart \\"Woolly\\" Wolstenholme (1947‚Äì2010). History After signing with EMI's Parlophone label in the UK for one single in early 1968, they moved to the more progressively inclined Harvest label. The name for the band, according to The International Barclay James Harvest Fan Club, signifies nothing specifically. Having exhausted other possibilities, each of the band members wrote single words on pieces of paper which were drawn out of a hat one by one. All were rejected until only three were left: James, a guy who used to sing with the band, Harvest because they were living in a farmhouse, and Barclay after Barclays bank, because they aspired to make money. These were then rearranged to get the best-sounding name - \\"Barclay James Harvest\\".What does the name \\"Barclay James Harvest\\" mean?, The International Barclay James Harvest Fan Club website Their self-titled debut album was released in mid-1970 to positive reviews, but few sales. Their second album, Once Again, gained even more favourable reviews, and the tour that followed was conducted with a full orchestra under the guidance of Robert John Godfrey. Their third album Barclay James Harvest and Other Short Stories was an even greater achievement, though Martyn Ford was brought in to supervise the orchestral work after Godfrey departed over writing issues behind \\"Mocking Bird\\" ‚Äì one of the group's most consistently popular tracks. By the release of their fourth album, Baby James Harvest, in 1972, the pressures of touring were beginning to affect the band. After this album, they departed from EMI, moved management to Harvey Lisberg, and signed to Polydor, the move immediately resulting in greater sales. The next album, Everyone Is Everybody Else (1974), is viewed by many as their artistic high point. This was shown by the album being played extensively on Radio Caroline, and by its appearance in the station's Top 100 All Time Albums Chart. It also led to the band being invited to a BBC Radio 1 session for John Peel; Alan Freeman, however, would be the band's main champion on the station in the 1970s and again when he returned from 1989‚Äì93. The double live album, Barclay James Harvest Live, which followed in late 1974, built on their solid fanbase, and was the first to chart in the UK, reaching No. 40. Time Honoured Ghosts (1975), which has \\"Titles\\", recorded in the US, followed, and this too charted in the UK, reaching No. 32. Octoberon followed in 1976 and reached number 19 in the UK. They finally broke into the mainstream mainland European market with their 1977 set Gone to Earth, which contained the song \\"Poor Man's Moody Blues\\", a homage to the Moody Blues' song, \\"Nights in White Satin.\\" Wolstenholme ‚Äì whose mellotron playing was a trademark of the band's sound in the 1970s ‚Äì left in 1979 after the album XII (1978). He pursued a short solo career fronting the band Maestoso, before retiring from the music industry until rejoining John Lees when BJH essentially split in two. The remaining three members continued. In August 1980, they played a free concert in front of the Reichstag in West Berlin, with an estimated attendance of 250,000 people. They were the first Western rock band to perform in an open-air concert in East Germany (after Glasnost had begun in the Eastern bloc but over two years before the Berlin Wall fell), playing in Treptower Park, East Berlin on 14 July 1987 to a 170,000-plus audience. The band continued as a trio with regular guest-musicians until 1998. One album, Welcome to the Show, produced in 1990, was released under the abbreviated name BJH. However, because of criticism from fans, the full name was restored, albeit with the inclusion of the BJH moniker. In 1998, musical differences amongst members of BJH saw the band essentially split into two different groups, each of which retained \\"Barclay James Harvest\\" as part of its name. John Lees released an album mixing new songs and classics of the band, entitled Nexus, under the name \\"Barclay James Harvest Through the Eyes of John Lees\\". Woolly Wolstenholme played in (and composed for) this band, subsequently resurrecting Maestoso to record and tour with new material, as well as back-catalogue favourites. Les Holroyd and Mel Pritchard teamed up to record under the name \\"Barclay James Harvest featuring Les Holroyd\\". In 2006/7, Lees and Wolstenholme toured under the slightly modified band title \\"John Lees' Barclay James Harvest\\". Mel Pritchard died suddenly of a heart attack in early 2004. Woolly Wolstenholme took his own life in December 2010, having apparently struggled with depression for many years. The two derivatives of Barclay James Harvest continue to record and tour to this day, and enjoy ongoing popularity, particularly in Germany, France, and Switzerland. John Lees' Barclay James Harvest (since 1998) This derivative of Barclay James Harvest features John Lees, bassist Craig Fletcher, drummer Kevin Whitehead and keyboard player Jez Smith. The band originally featured \\"Woolly\\" Stuart Wolstenholme on keyboards before his death in December 2010. The group formed in 1999 to record the album \\"Nexus\\". Craig Fletcher and Kevin Whitehead were from Wolstenholme's band \\"Maestoso\\", and John and Woolly were members of the original Barclay James Harvest. The band toured in the UK and Europe in 2006, and recorded the live album \\"Legacy\\" at the Shepherd's Bush Empire in London. Since then, the band has played at venues in the UK, but more so in the rest of Europe, where they achieve good success. The band toured again around the UK in 2009. They played at the Berlin Wall anniversary festival at the Brandenburg Gate, Bad Homburg in Germany with JLBJH's best attendance of 17,500 people, and more recently in Porto, Portugal with an attendance of 5,000. The band recently visited America, and played in Philadelphia. John Lees' Barclay James Harvest is currently signed and managed by Esoteric Recordings. Mark Powell, founder of the label, works as the band manager. In October 2013 JLBJH released \\"North\\", a studio album of all-new material, recorded at John's own Friamere Studios, on limited edition vinyl, CD and deluxe CD with a bonus disc recorded live at the Buxton Opera House. \\"North\\" was very well received, going on to become Cherry Red's biggest selling album of the fourth quarter of 2013. The band played nine gigs on a UK tour to promote the album, followed by a live radio concert for Christmas on German station SWR1. The band also formerly featured Jeff Leach and Mike Bramwell as guest musicians. Barclay James Harvest featuring Les Holroyd (since 2002) In 2001, Les Holroyd and Mel Pritchard returned to the studio to record the album 'Revolution Days' along with former Sad Cafe members Ian Wilson and Michael Byron-Hehir, as well as Steve Butler, Steve Pigott (Cher, Mike and the Mechanics), and Rabbit Bundrick (The Who). 'Revolution Days' was released in 2002, and a touring band was put together with Holroyd and Pritchard; Michael Byron-Hehir on lead guitar and vocals; Ian Wilson on guitar and vocals; Steve Butler on keyboards, percussion, and vocals; Chris Jago on drums; and former BJH sideman Colin Browne on keyboards and vocals. The first show was at the Colmar Wine Festival in August 2002. In October and November of that year, they undertook their first European Tour. More tours and festivals followed in 2003. In January 2004, the band performed at the 'Art on Ice' spectacular at the Zurich Hallenstadion with Roger Hodgson, John Helliwell and Bob Siebenberg of Supertramp, Justin Hayward of The Moody Blues and Jeremy Spencer of Fleetwood Mac. Upon returning to the UK, Mel Pritchard died from a suspected heart attack. In January 2005, BJHFLH toured with Asia featuring John Payne as support, returning the favour on four UK shows in March of the same year. In 2006, they undertook the Classic Meets Rock Symphonic Barclay Tour with the 25-piece Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. In July 2007, they toured the UK. Les Holroyd and Michael Byron-Hehir also worked on Alan Simon's Excalibur II album, Les joining the stage show in 2010. Les also performed in the live show of Simon's Anne de Bretagne. In 2011, Les joined the Rock Meets Classic Tour along with Ian Gillan, Lou Gramm, Dan McCafferty with The Bohemian Symphony Orchestra, performing four BJH songs: \\"Hymn\\", \\"Mockingbird\\", \\"Ring Of Changes\\", and \\"Life Is For Living\\". Still touring Europe, the band introduced an acoustic spot into the set, showcasing their vocal harmonies with old favourites like \\"Poor Boy Blues\\", \\"Friend of Mine\\", and \\"Crazy City\\". They recorded their 2012 winter tour. External works The band released a single \\"Breathless\\"/\\"When the City Sleeps\\" under the pseudonym of \\"Bombadil\\" in 1972. \\"Breathless\\", an instrumental, was credited to \\"Terry Bull\\" (actually John Lees). The B side \\"When the City Sleeps\\" was credited to \\"Lester Forest\\" (actually Woolly Wolstenholme), who also played every instrument and sang. This obscure track made an appearance on the soundtrack of the 2007 series Life on Mars, although it was not featured on the CD release.

A pioneer of the progressive metal movement, Fates Warning has been referred to as one of the \\"Big Three\\" of the genre, along with Queensr√øche and Dream Theater; namely, the bands who are most responsible for progressive metal's creation, development and popularization. Their early work, influenced by the new wave of British heavy metal, is also important in the development of American power metal. Fates Warning rose to international fame in the 1980s and has experienced numerous lineup changes. From 1982 to 1996, and temporarily in 2010, Matheos and DiBiase were the only remaining original members of the band, with the former being the only constant member. Their current lineup consists of guitarist Jim Matheos, vocalist Ray Alder, bassist Joey Vera, and drummer Bobby Jarzombek. Fates Warning has released twelve studio albums, two live albums, one compilation album, one VHS, three DVDs (each featuring live concerts) and four demo tapes. The band experienced major American commercial success with the 1986 release of their third studio album, Awaken the Guardian, which peaked at No. 191 on the Billboard 200, and became the first album released on Metal Blade to enter that chart. Their next three albums‚ÄîNo Exit (1988), Perfect Symmetry (1989) and Parallels (1991)‚Äîwere also successful; the former two peaked at No. 111 and No. 141 on the Billboard 200, respectively. By 2001, Fates Warning had sold over a million albums worldwide. Their upcoming thirteenth studio album, Long Day Good Night, will be released on November 6, 2020. History =Early career and first three albums (1982‚àí1986)= The first album, Night on Br√∂cken, was released in 1984 on the Metal Blade label. The album was mainly influenced by Iron Maiden and other heavy metal bands, in songs like the title track and, particularly, \\"Damnation.\\" There were prog aspects that would be further developed in subsequent albums. The Spectre Within (1985) featured a more progressive approach with songs like \\"The Apparition\\", \\"Epitaph\\", \\"Pirates of the Underground\\" and \\"Traveler in Time\\", with many tempo changes, a greater complexity in the arrangements, and fantasy lyrics full of symbolism and double meaning . In 1986, original guitarist Victor Arduini left the band and was replaced by Frank Aresti. The third album, Awaken the Guardian, regarded as a groundbreaking and essential Progressive metal release, was launched that year, working towards creating a more mythical atmosphere and a more fully realized progressive approach in song form; with complex and unusual riffs, and numerous tempo changes amidst frenetic and evocative vocal lines, however maintaining a basic fluidity. Fates Warning at KIT Festival (2016) Fates Warning at KIT Festival (2016) =Lineup changes and rise to near fame (1987‚àí1993)= In 1987, original vocalist John Arch left the band prior to the start of work on the band's next album. Ray Alder joined the band later that year. The first album with Alder, No Exit was released in 1988 and further developed the direction taken by the prior album with a more powerful sound all the while setting aside the fantasy themes and atmospheres. It featured one of the first prog metal suite of the genre, \\"The Ivory Gate of Dreams,\\" which is based on the Gates of horn and ivory. Following the tour in support of No Exit, original drummer Steve Zimmerman left the band in 1988. He was replaced by Mark Zonder in 1989. Perfect Symmetry was released later that year. The album abandoned the aggressive sound of No Exit, in favor of a more melodic and experimental one along with a melancholic atmosphere and intimate lyrics. Perfect Symmetry was full of extremely complex arrangements and an unusual and very articulated rhythm section,, and is often regarded as a seminal prog metal album, \\"which laid the foundations of the sound of the 90s\\". Kevin Moore (keyboardist for Dream Theater at the time) was featured as a guest on the song \\"At Fate's Hands\\", while the cover was designed by Hugh Syme, famous for his work with the Canadian progressive rock band Rush. 1991 saw the release of Parallels, distributed by Warner. The album, which started the collaboration with Rush producer Terry Brown, contains more accessible and streamlined songs than in the past, except for tracks such as \\"The Eleventh Hour\\" and \\"Life in Still Water.\\" Parallels is considered by some an essential album that \\"has influenced a great amount of subsequent musicians\\" and is possibly the band's most commercially successful record. James LaBrie (who had just joined Dream Theater) provided guest vocals on the song \\"Life in Still Water\\". =Later years (1994‚àí2009)= Slowing down after the commercial success of previous releases, the band took two and a half years to complete 1994's Inside Out, which continued in the general vein of the previous album while adding more melody to their songs. The band's lineup also remained intact between albums for the first time since Spectre Within. Band members have attributed the album's comparative lack of success to confusion while writing this album in the wake of the success of Parallels and their subsequent failure to maintain creative momentum. Inside Out was followed by a 1995 compilation, Chasing Time, which included two previously unreleased songs. In 1996, both Joe DiBiase and Frank Aresti left the group. The three remaining members, Alder, Matheos and Zonder, joined by new member Joey Vera on bass and Kevin Moore as a guest keyboardist, released A Pleasant Shade of Gray in 1997. Written as a concept album, A Pleasant Shade of Gray revealed a much darker and bleaker mood in writing style than had been heard before from the band. The album consists of a single 53-minute song split into twelve parts, making it the longest track Fates Warning has ever recorded. A live two-CD set, Still Life, was released in 1998, containing A Pleasant Shade of Gray performed live in its entirety. Joey Vera (bass), Bernie Versailles (guitars) and Jason Keazer (keyboards) accompanied the group on this album. A Japanese version included a studio cover of the Scorpions', \\"In Trance.\\" The lineup for A Pleasant Shade of Gray consisting of Alder, Matheos, Zonder, Vera, and Moore, returned to record Disconnected in 2000. In 2003, Frank Aresti was asked to fill in on a tour with Dream Theater and Queensr√øche. He officially rejoined the band as a full time member in 2005. Their tenth studio release FWX was released in 2004. Drummer Mark Zonder stated it would be his last album with the band, as he wished to pursue other interests, and left in 2005. Although an official member again, Frank Aresti did not appear on the album because the writing had been completed and contracts had been signed already. Live in Athens, a concert DVD, was released in 2005; this DVD included guest drummer Nick D'Virgilio. In the liner notes to the 2005 expanded edition of Awaken the Guardian, Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy noted that \\"very often fans and critics credit Dream Theater for creating a whole new genre of progressive metal music in the late '80s/early '90s, [...] but the truth is Fates Warning were doing it years before us.\\"Review of the album Awaken the Guardian at PopMatters.com The band has recorded songs for various \\"tribute\\" albums, including the tracks \\"Closer to the Heart\\" on the tribute to Rush, Working Man, \\"Saints in Hell\\" on the 1997 Legends of Metal, a Judas Priest tribute, and \\"Sign of the Southern Cross\\" on the 2000 Holy Dio Ronnie James Dio tribute. =Reunions with former members, Darkness in a Different Light and Theories of Flight (2010‚àí2017)= In 2010, Fates Warning played select dates with the Parallels lineup (Alder, Matheos, Zonder, Aresti and DiBiase) to celebrate the reissued, remastered and expanded edition of the classic album. At the beginning of 2011, an announcement was made that Matheos and original vocalist John Arch had formed a band called Arch/Matheos. Their debut album was released in the autumn of that year, also featuring Joey Vera on bass guitar, Bobby Jarzombek on drums, and Frank Aresti on additional lead guitar.Arch / Matheos Project Launched Featuring Past And Present Fates Warning Members; Band Tracking In The Studio bravewords.com. 2011-01-19. Retrieved on 2011-01-22. After many delays, Fates Warning released its eleventh studio album Darkness in a Different Light on 27 September 2013. It was the band's first album since 2004's FWX. To celebrate the album's 30th anniversary, the Awaken the Guardian lineup (Arch, Matheos, Aresti, DiBiase and Zimmerman) reunited for a headlining appearance at the Keep it True festival in Germany on April 30th, 2016.‚ÄúFates Warning‚Äôs Awaken the Guardian Lineup Performs at Germany‚Äôs Keep it True Festival.‚Äù Blabbermouth.net. 1 May 2016.

The album, titled Theories of Flight, was released on July 1, 2016. =Return to Metal Blade and Long Day Good Night (2018‚àípresent)= When asked in a June 2018 interview about the thirteenth Fates Warning album, frontman Ray Alder stated: \\"Right now, we're not in a writing mode. Everyone is kind of doing their own thing. I'm sure that will come out soon enough, of what everyone is doing. For the meantime, there are no plans to write another Fates Warning album ‚Äî not in the near future, at least.\\" Alder also commented on the band's future, saying: \\"Right now, there's just no plans to go into the studio or write. But, people are working on different things and we're working on another tour right now for South America, so that is still a little up in the air. It's 90 percent sure, but we'll see what happens with that. I can't say anything until it's confirmed.\\" On February 15, 2019, it was announced that Fates Warning had re-signed to Metal Blade Records, and planned to begin working on a new album, for a 2020 release, after their spring tour with Queensr√øche. In a December 2019 interview, bassist Joey Vera stated, \\"Fates Warning is not quite done writing, but pretty close. I think that the Fates record is also gonna be recording probably around January, February. I'm still very involved in both of those bands, obviously. So, for sure, a new Armored Saint record and a new Fates Warning record is on the horizon in the next 18 months, for sure.\\" On May 13, 2020, Alder announced on his Instagram profile that \\"the vocals for Fates Warning's 13th album are done. 13 songs in 12 days.\\" It was announced on August 25, 2020, that the album was titled Long Day Good Night and will be released on November 6, 2020,https://fateswarning.bandcamp.com/ just two weeks after Punching the Sky by Vera's other band Armored Saint.

Eight-string guitars are less common than six- and seven-string guitars, but they are used by a few classical, jazz, and metal guitarists. The eight-string guitar allows a wider tonal range, or non-standard tunings (such as major-thirds tuning), or both. Various non-standard guitars were made in the 19th century, including eight-string guitars played by Italians Giulio Regondi and Luigi Legnani. Eight-string guitars gained popularity among metal bands, largely inspired by Swedish progressive metal band Meshuggah (formed in 1987). Designs =Semi- acoustic guitar (hollow-body guitar)= Seeking a guitar tuning that would facilitate jazz improvisation, Ralph Patt invented major-thirds tuning in 1963. Patt's tuning is a regular tuning, in the sense that all of the intervals between its successive open strings are major thirds; in contrast, standard guitar tuning has one major-third amid four fourths. Seven-string guitars are needed for major-thirds tuning to have the E-e' range of the standard tuning.: Having an eight-string instrument allowed Patt's guitar to have G (equivalently A) as its open note. Patt purchased six-string archtop hollow-body guitars that were then modified by luthiers to have wider necks, wider pickups, and eight strings. Patt's Gibson ES-150 was modified by Vincent \\"Jimmy\\" DiSerio c. 1965. Luthier Saul Koll modified a sequence of guitars: a 1938 Gibson Cromwell, a Sears Silvertone, a c. 1922 Mango archtop, a 1951 Gibson L-50, and a 1932 Epiphone Broadway; for Koll's modifications, custom pick-ups accommodated Patt's wide necks and high G (equivalently A); custom pick-ups were manufactured by Seymour Duncan and by Bill Lawrence. Roy Connors, former member of the 1960s folk singing group, the Highwaymen, reconfigured a Martin O-28 six-string guitar to an eight-string of his own design and received a U.S. Patent on it (#3269247). =Solid-body= Solid- body eight string guitars are also used by many bands today. The construction of a solid-body eight-string guitar is comparable to that of seven- and six- string variants. The standard tuning (from low to high) is F, B, E, A, D, G, B, E.http://www.guitarcasa.com/2014/02/17/8-string-guitar-tuning/ Many prefer to tune the F to a low E (E1), the same note as the lowest string on a four- string electric bass in standard tuning, and providing the guitar with a fuller sound by having three different E strings. Like the seven-string, the first mass-produced eight-string guitar was made by Ibanez guitars in Japan; the RG2228. =Scale length= The main design issue faced with an eight- string guitar is tuning stability with the lower strings. This is due to the neck being constructed too short, bridge problems such as improper intonation, uneven spacing for floating bridges, or the use of wrong string gauges. Other problems associated with tuning stability rely on proper setup of the guitar. Extended range eight string guitars sometimes will have a multi-scale design where the bass strings will be longer than the treble strings (fanned fret design). This helps with proper intonation of the lower strings, improves string tension balance across the strings, improves harmonic overtones, overtone series, and improves inharmonicity. (See also inharmonicity in pianos). The bass strings on an 8 string typically require the saddle to be pulled back a bit more than the other strings to properly set the intonation. Some bridge designs accommodate this by offsetting back the 7th and 8th strings or providing a bit extra room for adjustment. Longer scale lengths require less offset for proper intonation. Notable players =Classical= Paul Galbraith began using an eight string guitar in 1994 when in collaboration with luthier David Rubio they designed the Brahms guitar. Galbraith generally tunes AEADGBEA. Egberto Gismonti (born 1947) is a Brazilian guitarist and pianist who favors the 8-string classical guitar. Livio Gianola (Premana, 1964) is an Italian guitarist. It is considered by the specialized critic \\"The Master of the Eight String Guitar\\". =Jazz= Hungarian born Australian Jazz guitarist Laszlo Sirsom plays 8-string jazz guitar made by Phil Carson Crickmore He's tuning as a normal guitar on the middle plus High A and lower B. Charlie Hunter plays a hybrid eight-string guitar made by Ralph Novak of Novax Guitars. Five of the strings are tuned to the standard guitar's upper five (A, D, G, B, E), while three of the strings are tuned to the standard bass guitar's three lowest (E, A, D). The bass and treble sections have separate pickups and are sent to separate amplifiers. Hunter also has a ten-string guitar based on the same principle‚Äîa combination of standard six-string guitar and standard four-string bass. =Metal= The eight-string guitar is used by modern heavy metal guitarists such as Fredrik Thordendal and M√•rten Hagstr√∂m of Meshuggah, Dino Cazares of Fear Factory, Stephen Carpenter of Deftones, Greg Burgess of Allegaeon, Simon Girard and Kevin Chartr√© of Beyond Creation, Justin Lowe and Trent Hafdahl of After the Burial, Josh Travis of Emmure (ex-The Tony Danza Tapdance Extravaganza and ex- Glass Cloud), Per Nilsson of Scar Symmetry and Meshuggah as a touring member and others. The instrument is particularly associated with the ‚Äúdjent‚Äù sound popularized by Meshuggah, Vildhjarta and other contemporary metal artists. Tosin Abasi and Javier Reyes of Animals as Leaders tune their eighth strings to the same low E as the lowest string on a standard four-string bass guitar, and use the instrument's versatility to incorporate bass guitar techniques‚Äîsuch as string thumping (on \\"Earth Departure, An Infinite Regression\\") √° la funk bassist Larry Graham and the double thumping technique pioneered by Victor Wooten ‚Äî as well as harp-like arpeggios. Ihsahn of the black metal band Emperor began playing seven-string guitar in 1999 and first played eight-string guitar on his 2010 album After. Rusty Cooley tunes his eight-string guitar like a standard six-string expanded in both directions. This tuning offers both deeper bass tones than a conventional guitar and extended range in the higher register for lead melodies. Guitarist Justin Broadrick of the English industrial metal band Godflesh introduced his eight- string playing on the 2014 Godflesh EP Decline & Fall. Guitarists Lucas Mann and Miles Dimitri Baker from the technical deathcore band Rings Of Saturn also used eight-string guitars. Joel Omans, one of their former members, also used one. Chris Andrews of the death metal band Devourment uses eight-string guitars, starting with the album Obscene Majesty.

Career Chapman started his career as a guitarist, recording and performing in the late 1960s. He played with Barney Kessel and Tim Buckley before leading his own band. In 1969, Chapman modified his homemade nine-string \\"Freedom Guitar\\" to accommodate his \\"Free Hands\\" tapping method. Although some guitarists had done two-handed tapping with the fingers of the right hand parallel to the strings, Chapman's method used the fingers of both hands perpendicular to the strings. This culminated in the creation of the Electric Stick, which he renamed the Chapman Stick. He founded Stick Enterprises in 1974 and has made more than 6,000 instruments. He holds fourteen patents for various aspects of the Chapman Stick. During the 1970s, Chapman toured extensively to promote his music and the instrument. He was influenced by Barney Kessel, then John McLaughlin. In 1985, he released a solo album, Parallel Galaxy. The song \\"Back Yard\\" was used in the Alan Smithee version of the 1984 film Dune.

It is owned and operated by the Southern Union Conference of Seventh-day Adventists. It was founded in 1892 in Graysville, Tennessee, as Graysville Academy and was the first Adventist school in the southern U.S.. Due to the need for additional space for expansion the school relocated in 1916 and was renamed Southern Junior College. In 1944, Southern began awarding baccalaureate degrees and was renamed Southern Missionary College. In 1996 the institution started conferring master's degrees and adopted its current name. Southern offers associate, baccalaureate, master's, and doctoral degrees. It is accredited by multiple organizations including the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Its Institute of Archaeology offers an undergraduate degree in biblical archaeology; Southern is one of only two schools which offer the degree. It is known for its emphasis on Adventist beliefs and conservative religious and social practices, and is considered the most conservative of the Seventh-day Adventist schools in North America. The college operates a radio station (WSMC-FM), a health food store and a wellness center. Enrollment was 3,053 students in 2010, its highest level to date. History Southern's roots stem from the establishment of Graysville Academy in Graysville, Tennessee, in 1892, in a part of the South much affected by the American Civil War. The area saw the battle of Chickamauga and the Chattanooga campaign, and was the staging ground for Sherman's Atlanta campaign. The Academy was privately funded at first, with no financial support from the Adventist church.Pettibone, Dennis (1992) A Century of Challenge: The Story of Southern College 1892-1992, pp. 9-60 In 1897 it was renamed the Southern Industrial School and then Southern Training School in 1901. The school moved to the community of Thatcher's Switch in 1916, renaming it Collegedale. In 1943, Kenneth A. Wright became president of the school. During Wright's administration, Southern Junior College became accredited as a four-year college. A new name, Southern Missionary College, was adopted in 1944, and Southern granted its first baccalaureate degrees two years later. When the school became a university in 1996, the trustees voted on a new name: Southern Adventist University. =Graysville Academy, 1892-1897= Graysville Academy, 1895 The Graysville Seventh-day Adventist Church was organized on September 8, 1888, and by the fall of 1890, the members had dedicated a church building. R.M. Kilgore, former president of the Illinois Conference had been asked to supervise the church's work in the Southern United States. He had just moved to Graysville and was present for the church dedication. As the superintendent for the church's work in the South, Kilgore repeatedly advocated the establishment of a school. Kilgore invited George W. Colcord (1843‚Äì1902), to come to Graysville and establish a school. Colcord was the founder of Milton Academy, which is the forerunner of Walla Walla University. The General Conference Education Secretary, W. W. Prescott, along with Kilgore and Colcord worked together to establish the school at Graysville. Colcord and his wife Ada began the school. The first term began in February, 1892, with 23 students. The second term began in September of that year. By January 1893 Colcord reported that 62 students were in attendance. By 1893 there were three full-time teachers and three part-time teachers. Prescott considered the positive attitude of the school's faculty, students and supporters to be indicators of the school's future success and good reason to start other such schools in the South. During 1892, Colcord operated the school privately. Then, at the session of the Seventh-day Adventist General Conference held at Battle Creek, Michigan, February 17 to March 6, 1893, the church officially took over the school. This first school in the South inspired the session to recommend that other schools also be established. In the Fall of 1894, Graysville Academy faced a crisis. Fourteen of the members of the Graysville Church were indicted for having violated the Tennessee Sunday law. This included Colcord, his nephew, Prof. I. C. Colcord, and M. C. Sturdevant, manager of the boys' dormitory. The church members found guilty refused to pay the fines, choosing to go to prison instead. The imprisonment of the school's leaders resulted in its immediate closing for the rest of the year. The students, some of whom were ready to graduate, returned to their homes.p.2 =Southern Industrial School, 1897-1901= In November 1897, the district conference voted to change the school's name to Southern Industrial School. The name change reflected a change in the school's emphasis. Industries were established including a wagon and blacksmith shop, a broom shop, a printshop and a school farm. The farm grew peaches, pears and many types of berries and vegetables. =Southern Training School, 1901-1916= The Southern Union Conference was organized in April 1901. Kilgore, the superintendent of the Southern District, known as District 2, was elected the first president of the Southern Union Conference. The headquarters was in Graysville. The General Conference arranged for the Southern Union to take over the operation of the Southern Industrial School. The property was transferred to the Southern Union. They renamed the school the Southern Training School. It offered 14 grades of instruction. p.18 =Southern Junior College, 1916-1945= Relocation Collegedale in the Tennessee River Valley Eventually the Graysville school outgrew its site. Church leaders looked for a larger plot of land. They believed \\"that the only education worth while in these strenuous days is that practical kind which teaches the student to actually do with his hand the things he learns about in books.\\" To provide for this practical concern, they found a larger property. Plans were made to relocate the college program to a farm at Thatcher's Switch east of Chattanooga. The move from Graysville to Thatcher's Switch involved moving most of the school's equipment, livestock, and implements to the new site fifty miles away. The school moved and opened in its new location by October, 1916. The community was soon renamed Collegedale and the school as Southern Junior College. The term training school had become associated with reform schools while at the same time the junior college designation had become a popular one. Graysville Academy continued on at the original site as a church and conference-sponsored secondary boarding academy until 1938. Pioneer years In 1916, the school's property holdings totaled $32,000. Two years later, due mainly to the construction of additional buildings on campus, the school's holdings increased to $113,000. Many students earned their tuition by helping to construct these buildings. Southern was financially supported by two union conferences of the Church's North American administration. The school organized construction bees. Interested church members came from across the South to help in these bees. At first, the school taught only students in grades 1-12 with a total enrollment of 59 students. In 1918, three students were taking post-high school level classes. The total student enrollment at this time was 175. Southern Junior College served two union conferences of Seventh-day Adventists, the Southern and the Southeastern. Later these two would be reorganized into one, the Southern Union Conference. In 1920, Lynn H. Wood, the president of the college, presented a major report to meetings for both union conferences. He reviewed the events of the first four years at the Ooltewah location. According to Wood, enrollment grew quickly because of a tuition work program. Students of limited means realized they could get an education and improve themselves. This put a strain on housing. But the desire for an education motivated the students to cope with those early inadequate facilities, \\"Students have been willing to live in shacks and tents, to put up with all kinds of inconvenience, in order that they might receive the character development that the school had for them.\\" Wood referred to these first few years as the \\"pioneer years.\\" He wrote that the positive spiritual attitude of the students made these years the most enjoyable that one could wish for. The college built the girls' dormitory first. The girls moved in before it was finished, even before there was any heating, doors or chairs. They used \\"curtains for doors, sat upon their trunks for chairs ‚Äî any way to get along.\\" Faith community support The building of the boys' dormitory began in the summer of 1918. The students helped build it, and, in doing so, many earned their way through school. Shortly after the beginning of the school year in 1918, a \\"Workers' Bee\\" took place. Church workers from all across the South and from church headquarters in Washington, D.C. came to the college to build the boys' dormitory. For two and a half weeks they worked and associated with the students. They succeeded in putting up most of the framework. Other help from the Adventist faith community included a $6,000 donation by the Southern Publishing Association for a water supply system and another \\"Working Bee\\" to build a large dairy barn, a blacksmith shop, and a corn crib. People interested in the college's success bought surrounding properties and donated them to the institution, more than doubling the school's area to close to . This allowed the school to protect itself from families moving so close that they hindered their young people attending from learning some independence, President Wood wrote. He encouraged families to send their young people to the school, and if the cost was too high for some of them, he advised that church leaders make sure they got the help they needed for their young people to attend and live in the dormitory. =Southern Missionary College, 1944-1982= Wright Hall, the administrative building of Southern Missionary College, was completed in 1967 In 1944, the Seventh Day Adventist General Conference Spring Council voted for Southern to become a four-year college. The enrollment that first year was the highest ever to date, 436 students. The theology, teaching and pre-nursing departments had the highest enrollments. Industries that helped students earn their tuition included a wood shop, a broom factory, a printing press, and a farm. The name Southern Missionary College was chosen at a combined meeting of the members of the college board, the union educational board, and the college faculty. =Southern College of Seventh-day Adventists, 1982-1996= On July 1, 1982, the word \\"Missionary\\" was dropped from the school's name. The reported reasons for the change were that the general population reacted negatively to the term; foreign countries resisted accepting church workers who were from a \\"missionary\\" college; the name incorrectly identified the school as only a Bible college, rather than a fully accredited, four-year liberal arts institution; and, graduates found the name \\"missionary\\" made it more difficult for them to get a job. Southern was the last Adventist college in North America to retain \\"missionary\\" in its title. The others changed their names many years earlier.\\"SMC to change name\\" (1982), p. 23 In their official announcement of the name change, the Board of Trustees of Southern Missionary College explained that a shorter name would help popularize it. They also stated that, \\"The word 'Southern' has been associated with the College since its beginning‚ÄîSouthern Industrial School, Southern Training School, Southern Junior College, Southern Missionary College, and now Southern College.\\" =Early 1980s controversy= Southern College found itself drawn into a wider church controversies involving Desmond Ford who was dismissed from ministry in the Adventist church in 1980, and Walter Rae, and Ronald Numbers' book, The Prophetess of Health. It began after a visit to the campus by a leading Bible scholar and theologian of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, Edward Heppenstall, on his understanding of the church's \\"investigative judgment\\" teaching, and who was also mentor to Desmond Ford.Knight, George R. A Search for Identity: the Development of Seventh-day Adventist Beliefs, Review and Herald Pub. Assoc. (2000), pp.171-175. Then grew when a teacher from the theology department made a comment that seemed to disagree with statements made by church pioneer Ellen G. White. The teacher stated he was \\"aware of no scientific proof that masturbation caused some of the more extreme effects suggested by Ellen White in her book, A Solemn Appeal.\\" The incident along with other concerns led to accusations that faculty at the school did not believe in White as a prophet and led to calls for their dismissal. Southern President Frank Knittel and Board of Trustees member Tom Zwemer resigned, and Jerry Gladson, a professor of Old Testament Studies at Southern, also left the school. His credentials as a minister of the church were not renewed.\\"War of Cultures at Southern College\\" Adventist Today, November‚ÄìDecember 1995, pp. 6-13. Retrieved 2011-11-09. Knittel, Gladson, et al., discuss the events of the 1980s. =Southern Adventist University, 1996-present= In May 1996, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools granted approval for Southern to become an accredited Level III institution, allowing the school to confer master's degrees. By September of that year, the college's constituency approved the name change to Southern Adventist University. In 1996, attendance was 1600. Since 1996, Southern has continued to grow and build, reaching a peak enrollment of 3,053 in 2010 (compared with 2,079 in 1980).Pettibone, D. (1992), last endpaper, in chart section \\"Events in School History\\" Academics The student-faculty ratio at Southern Adventist University is 16:1 and its most selected majors are biological and biomedical sciences; business, management, marketing, and related support services; education; and health professions and related clinical sciences. Southern offers 81 undergraduate degrees, with sixty majors, thirty-eight minors and two one-year certificate programs. It also offers master's degrees in business, computer science, education, psychology, nursing, religion and social work. The university is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and the Accrediting Association of Seventh-day Adventist Schools, Colleges, and Universities. In 2009, the Princeton Review, an education services company, selected Southern as one of 141 institutions it listed in its \\"Best in the Southeast\\" section. Southern Adventist University, 2011 =School of Nursing= The nursing program was instituted in 1934. Upon completion of the program students were able to transfer to Florida Sanitarium and Hospital, where they could earn a diploma in nursing. In 1963, Southern's President Rees announced that the school's nursing program had received its Bachelor of Science National League of Nursing accreditation.\\"SMC Nursing Accredited\\". Southern Tidings, March 13, 1963, p. 4 In 2002, the master's program also received official accreditation. Southern's School of Nursing has existed on the Collegedale campus since 1956.Herin, Mazie A.

Retrieved 2011-11-09. In 2003, the School announced an accelerated program allowing registered nurses with an associate's degree to receive a Master of Science in Nursing. At this date approximately half of Southern's nursing graduate program were non-Adventist. In December 2010, the college temporarily suspended a home health nursing program after two of its nursing students were accosted at gunpoint in Chattanooga. The school is considering a safer, more controlled environment for the program. In 2011, the university opened Florida Hospital Hall, a new building with twice the space of the former nursing building, to accommodate an expanding student base.Campbell, Hannah (January 5, 2011) =Institute of Archaeology= The Institute of Archaeology is part of the School of Religion. It coordinates the archaeological programs at Southern through an undergraduate degree, an archeological museum,Cooper, Clint (February 23, 2008) \\"Wood Archaeological Museum at Southern Adventist University adds clay goddess figurine\\" Chattanooga Times Free Press. Retrieved 2011-05-31. the William G. Dever Research Library and its archaeological excavations and publications. Southern is one of two schools in the U.S. where students can pursue an undergraduate degree in biblical archaeology. The Lynn H. Wood Archaeological Museum has a collection of nearly 600 artifacts, many of which were unearthed in Israel between 1967 and 1975. The current Institute Director, Professor of Near Eastern Studies and Archaeology Michael Hasel, studied for his doctorate under William G. Dever at the University of Arizona. In 2000, Dever gave his artifact collection in loan to Hasel and Southern. This made the development of Southern's program possible. The artifacts, valued at $250,000, date from 3200 BC to 450 AD. The collection has an almost complete set of the many strains of pottery from this period which students can study. In 2008, Dever placed his personal library at Southern, along with 15,000 photographic slides of archaeological excavations. =School of Visual Art and Design= Wayne and Maria Hazen founded the School of Visual Art and Design in 1998. The film department produced Angel in Chains in 2003,Oliver, Ansel (August 5, 2003) Land, Gary (2005) p.26.

The family-oriented feature was filmed in Ireland and was the first feature-length film produced at the university.Byrd, Alita (February 12, 2008) Herrington, Angie (September 7th, 2007) The school offers degrees in graphic design, animation, film production and fine art. =McKee Library= Page from Life of Abraham Lincoln by J. L. Scripps The McKee Library is located on the campus and opened in 1970. Its collection of books and media comprises approximately 165,000 volumes on the shelves, 25,000 electronic books, subscriptions to more than 880 print and electronic periodicals and access to more than 19,000 electronic journals. The library is defined by the Thomas Memorial Collection, a major Civil War collection with more than 3,600 volumes concerning Lincoln and the Civil War, and authentic photos and newspapers. The Collection has two original copies of the only Lincoln biography ever read and approved by him, the Life of Abraham Lincoln by J. L. Scripps, and a section of his original marble sarcophagus. Ideology Southern is known for its religious and social conservatism, and it is widely regarded as the most conservative of denominationally owned Adventist colleges in North America. In 2001, Adventist noted theologian and scholar Raymond Cottrell, a \\"progressive Adventist\\", \\"Throughout his life Ray was a remarkable thought leader in our denomination. It is usual to be productive in one's prime years, but consider Ray's accomplishments both early and late in his long career. In his 30s, teaching Bible at PUC, he became one of the first Adventist theologians to join a scholarly religious society; and simultaneously, he cofounded the first Adventist Biblical research fellowship, an association that evolved into the current Biblical Research Institute at the General Conference. After formal retirement, in his 70s, Ray advocated the need for a judicial branch of church governance. In his 80s he argued for relative autonomy for the General Conference Divisions in our increasingly diverse world church. And then, just last year (2002), he courageously called for progress beyond our dated sanctuary doctrine. Was Ray right in all these progressive positions? I suggest that question misses the larger issue. The point is that Ray epitomized the spirit of Adventism and its fearless pioneers in conscientiously advocating what he saw as vital and true.\\" p. 10. (emphasis added) wrote that Southern operated \\"an agency of Southern Bible belt obscurantism.\\" In explaining why he placed his collection of artifacts and his personal library at Southern Adventist University, archaeologist William Dever said, \\"The major support for archaeology work in Israel and Jordan comes from conservative and evangelical circles where the Bible is still taken seriously and no one is more serious and committed about archaeological study in the Middle East than Adventists.\\" Student life The Princeton Review describes Southern as a \\"religiously loving environment.\\" Most forms of jewelry are not allowed on campus, including engagement rings, and students may be fined for not complying with this policy. Southern is a dry campus, as the Adventist Church opposes the use of alcohol. The university observes the Sabbath from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday and students are expected to refrain from secular activities during these hours. Although Southern does not have fraternities or sororities, there are 40 clubs on campus, one of which is a chapter of the Adventist Forum, publisher of Spectrum Magazine. The Southern Accent is a weekly student-run newspaper that has been the voice of Southern students since 1926 and gives information on events and outings and \\"hot issues that are being talked about on campus\\". There are 21 student-led ministries on campus and in the community and a Student Missions program. Southern has more than of hiking/mountain biking trails used by students and local community members alike. There is a campus-wide internet network with all classrooms accessing the wireless network and a computer lab in each building with access to printing. Wireless printing is also accessible in the dormitories. =Dormitories= Southern's dormitories are single gender although students can opt out of the dormitories during summer sessions or with permission from a dean. Upperclass and married students can receive exemptions from this policy. The men's dormitory is Talge Hall and the women's dormitory is Thatcher Hall. An accidental fire in Thatcher Hall in April 2005 killed one student and injured two others.\\"Fire Ruled Accidental In Which Southern Adventist Student Died\\" , The Chattanoogan, April 26, 2005. Retrieved 2011-11-09. The dormitories have also been used to shelter storm victims who needed short-term housing, such as after tornadoes in early 2011. =WSMC-FM radio station= Southern owns and operates FM radio station WSMC which is almost completely staffed by students and the only classical music station in the Chattanooga area. In 2003, following technical problems that caused the station to keep dropping off the air, WSMC upgraded equipment to improve its reliability. It has been in operation since 1961 and is located on campus. McKee Foods McKee Foods has its headquarters beside the campus and has been an important part of school history as one of the companies which have provided jobs within walking distance for students to fund their education. It was founded by a Southern alumnus and is the headquarters for Little Debbie, Sovex and Sunbelt products.
