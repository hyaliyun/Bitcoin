History The Valdelsa was a center of the Etruscan civilization, as shown by a wide range of findings in the area, including several necropolises. In the Middle Ages, it was crossed by the Via Francigena, a pilgrimage road connecting France and Northern Europe to Rome, and therefore saw an economic and religious development. There were numerous churches, convents and pleban churches, while its strategical role is testified by the presence of a series of towers and fortified boroughs, mostly from the 10th and 11th century, built by noble families such as the Alberti and the Cadolingi. The valley entered under the influence of the growing power of the Republic of Florence in the 13th-14th centuries.

Personal life and early career Gita Lenz lived for more than sixty years in Greenwich Village on the corner of Carmine and 7th Avenue. She married twice; widowed by her first husband George Zoul‚Äôs death fighting Franco's forces in the Spanish Civil War, she married her second husband, Richard Lenz, in 1940 and divorced him eighteen months later. There were no children from either marriage. Now on her own, an amateur photographer in the 1940s, Lenz strove to find professional work from commercial and editorial clients and was quite successful through the 50s and 60s. Her subject matter was the city and the urban life and environment around her with social documentary, reminiscent of that by Walker Evans and Helen Levitt,Vince Aletti, Gita Lenz, New Yorker, November 1, 2010 being her initial focus before an interest in abstraction emerged. It was her fine art photography that brought her considerable attention. Recognition In 1951, following the success of the exhibition Abstract Painting and Sculpture in America at the Museum of Modern Art, Edward Steichen curated its photographic follow-up Abstraction in Photography, introducing ‚Äúwork of photographers concerned with evolving another reality by probing into the realm of the abstract.‚Äù Lenz‚Äôs pictures shared the walls beside those of Erwin Blumenfeld, Josef Breitenbach, Alexey Brodovitch, Harry Callahan, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Ralston Crawford, Walker Evans, Lotte Jacobi, Gy√∂rgy Kepes, L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy, Man Ray, Charles Sheeler, Arthur Siegel, Aaron Siskind, Frederick Sommer, Alfred Stieglitz, Paul Strand and Edward Weston. A major exhibition of Lenz‚Äôs work was in a three-person show, The Third Eye with John Reed and Don Normark, at the Brooklyn Museum of Art in 1952. In 1955, Steichen included her work, a picture of a little girl asleep in the sun, in another exhibition at the MoMA, this time in the world-touring The Family of Man, which was seen by 9 million visitors around the world. Lenz continued taking photographs into the early 1960s, much of it fine art but with some commercial commissions for photo stories, one on the New York cab industry, another for Standard Oil, with other series on coal miners, city children and botanical gardens, amongst formal portraits. However, her financial situation forced her to seek a more reliable income in copywriting, proofreading and research positions. Though she was still photographing views from her apartment window,Meyers, W. Gita Lenz, Wall Street Journal, 2010 gradually she abandoned photography to pursue a less expensive creative interest in writing, mainly poetry. Obscurity and rediscovery With the coming of the millennium, Lenz had been forgotten as a photographer and was living alone in her fifth floor walk-up apartment. When she became dependent on a wheelchair the accommodation became impractical. Neighbour-cum-friend Timothy Bartling (a chef) helped Lenz move into an assisted living facility near her old neighbourhood and looked after her personal affairs. Amongst her belongings he discovered a large archive of photographs that he felt might be valuable and took her in 2002 to meet his friend the photographer Gordon Stettinius during his exhibition opening at Robin Rice Gallery. Subsequently, on seeing her imagery and impressed by its quality, Stettinius offered to archive Lenz‚Äôs work which he put into storage at his home in Richmond, Virginia. In 2006 he asked expert friends at Virginia Commonwealth University to assist in sorting through the disorganised mass of negatives, prints and documents.Claire O‚ÄôNeill 'Daily Picture Show: An Unknown Photographer, Remembered'. National Public Radio February 17, 2011, 11:50 AM ET Stettinius sought institutions, galleries, museums and publishers who might be interested in her discovery. Among her papers was correspondence with Aaron Siskind, a friend whom she described as ‚Äògreat man‚Äô, but given the state of Lenz‚Äô fading memory few other details of her career emerged. Most importantly, her work is quite an early example of the abstraction that Siskind promoted in photography. Stettinius approached the Aaron Siskind Foundation to seek further connections between the two artists and there met Charles Traub, president of the Board of Directors of the foundation, who connected him to Tom Gitterman of Gitterman Gallery in New York, with the prospect of an exhibition by the newly rediscovered photographer‚Äôs work.Lenscratch Blog, Tuesday, October 12, 2010. Stettinius founded Candela Books and its first publication was the monograph on Lenz,Susan Burnstine: 'Past in focus. Pictures shot in the 1950s by Gita Lenz have recently been re-discovered and are catching attention stateside'. Black and White Photography, Christmas 2010, p.22-23 for which he wrote an introduction.

It was designed by the New South Wales Government Railways, and built by W. Rowe and W. Smith (tunnel) and Mr. McDonald (vent shaft). The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The Otford Railway Tunnel was constructed in 1888 by the firm Rowe and Smith, who built 7 of the 8 original tunnels on the Illawarra line from Waterfall to Clifton. The Otford Railway Tunnel, the seventh after Waterfall, was the final major engineering project which permitted the linking up of the northern part of the Illawarra Line to the isolated southern part in 1888. The Otford Railway Tunnel opened on 3 October 1888. The single line connection was made at (old) Stanwell Park Station (now bypassed by the 1915 Stanwell Park Deviation). The tunnel was built of brick arched form and when built was the largest and steepest (5,985 feet long - 1824m - and 1 in 40 gradient) on the system. Of the 8 original tunnels in the Waterfall to Clifton section of the Illawarra line, the Otford tunnel and the Metropolitan tunnel were notorious for hot and suffocating conditions experienced by the crew of steam trains climbing to Waterfall from Thirroul. There were cases of enginemen burnt by the heat. Due to these conditions, the single line section became an operational bottleneck. To negotiate the steep terrain, train loads were reduced by up to 50% of capacity. This was partly solved in 1891 by building of a brick circular ventilation shaft 7 feet in diameter down 200 feet to the tunnel. Due to the ongoing ventilation problems in the tunnel, the use of electric locomotives in the tunnel was considered, however by 1904 plans for a new set of tunnels (known as the \\"Helensburgh Deviation\\") were well advanced, so make-do measures were introduced to minimise the smoke problem. With the use of longer or double headed trains, smoke problems necessitated installation in 1908 of a forced air fan at the northern end of the tunnel. In 1915 the Helensburgh deviation was under construction to create a set of new tunnels deviating around the Stanwell Park amphitheatre: the duplicated line was able to fully bypass the Otford tunnel and it was closed on 10 October 1920. The Otford Tunnel was subsequently used as a pedestrian access from Otford to Stanwell Park. The repaired tunnel In 1942/43, as part of a war-time explosives programme, the Army detonated a section of roof approximately 1630m to 1643m into the tunnel. In 1959 the tunnel was used by Eden Industries to farm mushrooms. The debris created by the 1942/43 explosion was cleared away, and a 13m box-like reinforced concrete section was built to replace the brick walls demolished in the explosion and support the tunnel structure. The tunnel was closed for public access in 2000. RailCorp has placed security gates at the southern portal at Stanwell Park to deter vandalism.  Description  The precinct includes the tunnel (including entrance and approaches) (1888) and the vent shaft to the tunnel (1891). The tunnel is accessed from its southern portal at Stanwell Park, at the end of Chellow Dene Avenue (Lawrence Hargrave Memorial Park). The northern portal is located approximately 440m south-west of Otford Railway Station. ;Otford Railway Tunnel (1888) This is a disused concrete and brick arched 1824m long single track tunnel. The tunnel originally had a sandstone dish drain running through it, covered by large sandstone slabs, however much of the sandstone has been removed. The track bed and drain are estimated to be approximately 1.3 m below the current surface. The 1891 brick vent shaft is located halfway along the length of the tunnel. Northern portal: the northern portal is located approximately 440m south of Otford Railway Station. ;Archaeological potential Remains of buildings, foundations etc for ventilating plant, near the northern portal of the tunnel. ;Condition and integrity It was reported to be in moderate condition as at 26 October 2010, as the southern portal needed new steel security gates to prevent wildlife and public entry, The condition of the track bed, ballast and central sandstone draining varies along the length of the tunnel.

Archaeologists believe Al-Ashoosh was a seasonal settlement occupied by a hunter/pastoral community, probably occupying structures of perishable materials, during the second half of the third millennium BC (2500‚Äî2000 BC). It is thought the water table would have been higher, supporting inland settlement in what is now a plain and arid site with a brackish well. The site was used for the production of stone tools.  The site  Dubai Municipality and the Sanisera Archaeology Institute conducted excavations at the site between November 2015 and May 2016. The site was discovered during two seasons of survey in 2002‚Äì2003 following the discovery of the nearby Iron Age metallurgical centre Saruq Al Hadid, and is located 8km from that site. Surveys in the area by Dubai Municipality and the Department of Antiquities of Jordan identified 33 archaeological sites ranging in date from prehistory to the late Islamic period. In 2006‚Äì2007, more-detailed archaeological investigations of the area of Al-Ashoosh were conducted, including survey, excavation and geological sampling. The site of Al-Ashoosh covers some 1.3 hectares and comprises a fenced area of low dunes surrounding a large tell, or mound, 1.5‚Äì2m in height. The site is divided into two distinct parts, dubbed areas A and B. Area A, the main area, covers some 350m¬≤ and represents a single-phase rubbish midden located on a natural sand dune. It has yielded a large amount of material including faunal remains, lithics, charcoal and a small quantity of pottery. There is no evidence of any structure at the site. Carbon dating of recovered materials dates the site to the Umm Al Nar period. 50m to the south-west, Area B has revealed eight ovens, constructed of an irregular clay rings sloping down to bases of the structures that sit directly on the bedrock. These are thought to be a type of tannour. Almost 300kg of faunal remains were recovered during digs at Al-Ashoosh. Finds at the site include unusual seals with links to Dilmun, stone tools and pottery of the black-on-red Umm Al Nar type.

It was designed and built by the then-New South Wales Government Railways. The property is owned by RailCorp, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The difficult geological formation of the Illawarra escarpment created many problems for the railway engineers and contractors in building the single line from Waterfall railway station to the (Old) Stanwell Park station so that when it opened in 1888 it was nearly two years after the opening of the southern part of the line to Bombo. This difficult section of terrain resulted in the construction of six tunnels of varying length of which nearly all were abandoned in 1915 when a new double track deviation line (the \\"Helensburgh Deviation\\") was built from just south of Waterfall to Coalcliff. The two southern tunnels at Lilyvale are known as Tunnels No 5 and 6. Tunnel 5 has since been vested to the Department of Lands. The two tunnels are used to provide road access to the west of the line. The 1915 double track tunnel is known as the Deviation Tunnel and remains in use today. In 1986, the line was electrified as far as Wollongong, necessitating the installation of new electrical infrastructure within the 1915 tunnel.  Description  The precinct contains two tunnels: the disused original 1888 tunnel, now known as the Lilyvale Road Access Tunnel, and the 1915 tunnel, which remains in use as the Lilyvale Railway Tunnel. The tunnels are located southeast of Helensburgh, west of Lady Wakehurst Drive. ;Lilyvale Road Access Tunnel (1888) The original tunnel is of a single line brick oviform construction. The tunnel in still used for service road access (known as Road Access Tunnel Number 2) on the rail system and retains all of its entry detail and interior curved brick walls in both plan form and in section. ;Lilyvale Railway Tunnel (1915) This is a semi-circular arched double line brick tunnel with brick buttresses and a sandstone keystone to the centre of the arch. ;Other nearby related elements A further 1888 road access tunnel (Number 1) is located further west of the two tunnels and is now owned by the Department of Lands. An easement for road access is current across the site. The tunnels were in good condition at the time of their heritage listing and appear largely intact.  Heritage listing  The two Lilyvale Railway tunnels are of State significance for their ability to clearly demonstrate the two significant periods of construction of the Illawarra Line. The original 1888 tunnel, now used for road access, remains largely intact and is located adjacent to the 1915 railway tunnel which was built as part of the Helensburgh deviation, to bypass the steep and difficult tunnels built in 1888 in this section of the Illawarra line. The two tunnels side by side demonstrate the changing needs of the railway system and the skills and technology available during two different periods. As such, the two tunnels are an important reference site demonstrating changes in railway construction engineering and design during the late 19th and early 20th century.

Nawequa Geezig was a Baptist who, while friendly to European-American settlers and missionaries, nonetheless opposed the cession of Ottawa land to the United States. Like many Ottawas at the time, Nawequa Geezhig fought for the British against the United States in the War of 1812. He fought in the Battle of the Thames and, by one account, witnessed firsthand the death of Tecumseh. Treaty of Chicago In 1821, several Grand River Ottawa chiefs met with representatives of the United States in Chicago to negotiate the sale of tribal lands south of the Grand River in present-day central Michigan. Nawequa Geezhig was hostile to the idea of a treaty ceding Ottawa land and rejected its terms. Nevertheless, the treaty was signed by other Ottawa chiefs and enforced by the United States. Treaty of Washington By 1836, the possibility that Ottawas from the L'Arbre Croche band in northern Michigan might promise the Grand River Ottawas' land north of the Grand River to the United States prompted Nawequa Geezhig and other Grand River Ottawa chiefs to write President Andrew Jackson a letter preemptively refusing the cede any land or remove their bands west of the Mississippi. However, after an especially harsh winter and a year-long outbreak of smallpox, the Grand River Ottawas' negotiation position was severely weakened. In March 1836, two dozen Ottawas travelled to Washington, D.C. to negotiate a potential treaty with the United States. The resulting treaty, in which the Ottawas agreed to sell the Grand River lands to the United States in exchange for five-year reservations in west and northwest Michigan, regular annuities, hunting rights, and access to a blacksmith, Western farming implements, and various other amenities to help smooth any integration efforts, was only loosely followed by both its parties. Nawequa Geezhig, though not present in Washington during the treaty, was designated by the Grand River Ottawa in the treaty as a chief \\"first class,\\" and assigned to receive a $500 annuity for his tribe. Religious Beliefs As a condition of the 1821 treaty, the United States provided the Grand River Ottawas with money to construct a school and a missionary in Grand Rapids. Nawequa Geezhig, who presided over a village in Grand Rapids called Bowting, invited Reverend Leonard Slater, a Baptist missionary, to construct a mission in the village. Nawequa Geezhig was criticized by other members of the Grand River Ottawa for receiving and spending treaty annuities dispensed by the missionaries there. In 1837, following the Treaty of Washington, Grand River Ottawas at Bowting split over management of the tribe. The Baptist Ottawas left with Nawequa Geezhig to create the \\"Ottawa Colony\\" in modern-day Prairieville Township. Catholic and non-Christian Ottawas followed Nawequa Geezhig's son-in-law, Megis Ininne, a Catholic Ottawa chief.

It was built from 1842 to 1909. The homestead has also previously served as a museum (1972-1985) and as a function venue (1985-1992). It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 4 August 2000.  History  William Frances Weston, his wife Elizabeth, and son John were among the first free settlers in the Illawarra, when they took up 500 acres at Dapto in 1818. The land was given to them by Governor Macquarie as a \\"promise grant\\", one yet to be ratified by King George III. W. F. Weston named the property \\"West Horsley Place\\" after his home in Surrey. He died at the property in 1826, leaving his wife and five children. The 1828 census records Elizabeth Weston and children still residing there, with 500 acres, 40 acres cleared, 25 acres cultivated, and 35 horned cattle. In 1830, Elizabeth Weston married a convict, Thomas Williamson. The 1841 census records the Williamsons living at Horsley, with Elizabeth Weston as landlady to 21 tenants. The farm had become a small village with 84 people in 21 slab houses, some were free, others were convicts. On 13 January 1842, Governor Gipps ratified the promised grant of 1818. It was bequeathed to William and Elizabeth Weston's daughters, Elizabeth and Augusta. The first section of the house, with four rooms and a central hall, was built prior to 1842. In 1843, Elizabeth Weston Jr. married Andrew Thompson, and it became their home. In 1866, John Lindsay bought West Horsley Place from Augusta Brooks (n√©e Weston), and renamed the property Horsley. John's son, George Lindsay operated as a dairy farm with a high quality Ayrshire herd. George was a successful exhibitor at the local and Sydney Agricultural Shows. George also purchased a butchery business with three shops, and a piggery for his son John Hessel Lindsay who became a partner in the Illawarra Meat Company. In 1947, George Lindsay died aged 91, and his son, Arthur Lindsay inherited the property. In October 1968, Ron and Judy Holloway bought 27 acres with Horsley homestead from Arthur Lindsay. The land was sold to developers in 1972, and Horsley, with 2.59 hectares (5.7 acres) was bought by Mr and Mrs C. Neaves for restoration and exhibition. Marlene Neaves set up a museum at Horsley and conducted tours there until at least 1985. A building called the \\"Old Albion Park Store\\" was relocated onto Horsley's site as part of this museum In 1985-86, Peter and Prue Fyfe purchased and lived at Horsley, and operated a venue for occasions such as wedding receptions. Prue also had a wholesale/retail business in Thai imports. On 28 November 1992, Dr and Mrs Robert Pescud bought Horsley with 2.071 hectares (4.5 acres) as a private home. Since 2001 the property has been in the ownership of Rod and Mary Young.  Description  The property consists of a complex of buildings on a northern slope, with the farm buildings along the ridge line. The house faces north over Robins Creek with Mount Kembla in the distance. The property was originally accessed from West Dapto Road to the north, over Robins Creek. Early natural round gate posts identify the entry point to the front yard. A line of fig trees identifies the earliest approach to the property while a later alignment was angled slightly to the west and is likely to date to the use of the creamery as a cheese factory. The house and garden are surrounded by a Tecoma hedge. Other typical 19th century plantings in the garden include a Bunya Bunya Pine and a row of five Morton Bay Fig Trees (now in separate ownership). The access road was changed to a drive from Bong Bong road to the south. Bong Bong road was proposed in 1861 and an aerial photograph taken in 1948 shows an overgrown, disused track from the north with an older track branched off along the row of fig trees and a clear track in use from Bong Bong Road, entering the homestead along the alignment that is still in use today, adjacent to the west of the stable. The house is a Georgian style building built from limewashed brick in two main stages; Initially c.1842, there was a central hall with two rooms either side. This was extended by the addition of rooms along the east and west. The back and front verandahs were used to access the later rooms. The interior has cedar joinery throughout. Behind the house there is a detached, random rubble kitchen with opposing doors in the southern and northern walls. The interior has a maids room, stone floor and a large open fireplace. It is possible that the kitchen predates the house as the first cottage. There is also a detached dairy (creamery) adjacent to the west of the house constructed from bricks similar to those used in the house. The dairy was converted to a cheese and butter factory in c.1880 using beaded timber partitions. The house, kitchen and dairy have slate roofs. The farm buildings form a row. The easternmost building is the random rubble stable which retains timber stalls and stone floor. The original slate roof has been replaced with corrugated iron. The loft was used as a corn store. Across the driveway is a timber framed, corrugated iron milking shed with the bails removed and a chaff cutting area. This is adjacent to an early (1909) reinforced concrete silo which has a replacement hexagonal timber roof. The westernmost building is a large cow shed built using natural round posts and rails to form two rows of stalls with a central aisle. This is the only local example of a cow shed where the cows were tethered using traditional fixtures. The original 500 acre property has been subdivided multiple times. However the remaining 2.071 hectares contains the original farm buildings and significant landscape elements. The buildings have been well maintained. The buildings and their setting remain significantly intact. = Modifications and dates = * 1818 - Site was occupied. The stone rubble kitchen may be an earlier cottage from the establishment phase. * 1842 or earlier - central hall and 4 rooms.

Heritage listing  Horsley Homestead is a rare intact example of a 19th-century Georgian style farm complex and garden in Illawarra. The property was one of the earliest to be owner occupied and was associated with the Lindsay family who was influential in the dairy industry and region, particularly rural based activities. The property demonstrates building materials, techniques and design used in the Illawarra throughout the 1800s. The site includes one of the earliest known reinforced concrete silos, the only cow shed known in Illawarra where cattle were individually tethered and an early random rubble stable with timber stalls. The house is a fine example of early 19th century rural architecture with the original detached stone kitchen and separate brick and stone dairy. Horsley Homestead was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 4 August 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Horsley is associated with the Western Family who settled on the property in 1818, one of the first to owner occupiers in the district. It is associated with the clearing lease settlement process, and supported numerous small tenancies, typical of the early 1800s. Horsley is associated with the Lindsay family who were innovative farmers and regional leaders in the dairy industry. Horsley is associated with the evolution of the dairy industry in Illawarra. The region became renowned for progressive herd and pasture techniques enabling it to become a major supplier of milk to the Sydney market. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Horsley is sited on a knoll and forms a visual landmark, made distinctive by the significant elements of its 19th century garden including significant trees; a Bunya Bunya Pine, 5 Morton Bay Figs, Tecoma Hedge and the early farm buildings; the house with a detached kitchen and separate dairy (creamery), stables, milking bail and chaff cutting shed, early silo and cow shed. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The property was operated as a museum followed by a function venue during the 1970s and 80s. The current owners have also opened the house and grounds to the public on a number of occasions to raise funds for others. Earlier owners were publicly minded and held civic roles. Consequently, Horsley is well known and highly regarded by the past and present community. This regard is reflected in the property's inclusion on all relevant heritage lists. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The silo and chaff cutting area demonstrates the technological shift to improved pasture and all year round nutrient supply for dairy herds. The Illawarra region was quick to invest in improved breeding and feeding of Dairy Herds and the Lindsay family, owners of Horsley, pioneered these techniques in the district. The site has evolved throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries and demonstrates building techniques employed during that time. The site has been occupied since 1818 and remains relatively undisturbed. It is considered to have high archaeological potential. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Horsley remains as a rare, substantially intact complex of 19th century dairy farm buildings with significant landscape elements, in central Illawarra, which was a major dairying region until the mid 1900s. The property retains rare examples of dairy related structures including an early reinforced concrete silo, cow shed with tethering fixtures, 19th century stone stable with timber stalls and brick dairy (creamery). The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The site represents the 19th century dairying practises through the building materials, construction techniques and location of the structures within the landscape. The major landscape elements including the Bunya Bunya Pine, Tecoma hedge and natural round gate posts within the site and the row of Morton Bay Fig trees adjoining the site, now in different ownership, represent plants and features used in major 19th century gardens in Illawarra and other rural areas.

It is located within North Cascades National Park and Stephen Mather Wilderness. Like many North Cascades peaks, Elephant Butte is more notable for its large, steep rise above local terrain than for its absolute elevation. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into the Skagit River via Stetattle Creek and McMillan Creek. Climate Elephant Butte is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. Rhino, Hippo, Elephant Buttes During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

In 1953, the first campus of the college was inaugurated by President Sukarno in Bandung.http://seskoad.mil.id/index.php/sejarah Notable People & Alumni (In alphabetical order) *Abdul Haris Nasution *Andika Perkasa *Feisal Tanjung *Gatot Subroto *Hendropriyono *Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan *Moeldoko *Prabowo Subianto *Ryamizard Ryacudu *Suharto *Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono *TB Simatupang *Try Sutrisno *Umar Wirahadikusumah *Wiranto International *Brig Gen James McDevitt, United States Armed Forces *G.

It was released on November 8, 2004, by Callaway Arts & Entertainment. The book is a moral tale inspired from a 300 year-old story by rabbi Baal Shem Tov, that Madonna had heard from her Kabbalah teacher. It tells the story of Abdi who was given the task of delivering a precious necklace to the queen. Madonna was inspired to write The Adventures of Abdi by the settings in \\"Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves\\" and other folk stories from One Thousand and One Nights. Published in a 32-page jacketed hardcover format, the book was illustrated by Russian painters Olga Dugina and Andrej Dugin. Madonna promoted the release by appearing for book signing events as well as on television shows. The Adventures of Abdi was criticized for being Orientalist and promoting Kabbalah to children; its illustrations received positive feedback. Synopsis In a faraway land lived a young boy named Abdi. He was an orphan raised by the great jeweler Eli. One day, Eli was commissioned with creating a necklace for the queen. Once the necklace was completed, Eli gave it to Abdi for traveling to the royal palace and giving it to the queen on her birthday. The boy starts his journey across the desert. One night while sleeping, Abdi is robbed by two Bedouins, who steal the necklace and replace it with a live snake. Unaware of the theft, Abdi reaches the palace and meets the king where the snake is revealed inside Abdi's bag. Seeing this, the king gets really upset and orders the boy to be thrown in the dungeon. Eli comes to know about what happened to Abdi, and hurries along reaching the palace a week later. Because of his faith and honesty, he is able to convince the king that after placing the snake around the queen's neck, it would turn into a diamond necklace. As the queen places the snake around her neck, it slowly converts into a precious encrusted necklace. The king is impressed and releases Abdi, rewarding him and Eli. News about Abdi and Eli's magical necklace reaches the two Bedouins who had stolen the original one from Abdi. They reach the royal palace to see the king with a large bag stuffed with real snakes. However, the snakes were not charmed into jewelry and instead ended up frightening the poor queen. The enraged king orders them to be thrown in the dungeon forever. Background and writing Folk stories like \\"Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves\\" (pictured) inspired Madonna to write the book In 2003, Madonna signed a contract with Callaway Arts & Entertainment for a series of five children's books. She explained that each book dealt \\"with issues that all children confront... Hopefully there is a lesson that will help kids turn painful or scary situations into learning experiences\\". The first three releases were The English Roses (September 2003), Mr. Peabody's Apples (November 2003), and Yakov and the Seven Thieves (June 2004). All three charted on The New York Times Best Seller list. Cumulatively, the three books sold over 1.5 million copies worldwide. Callaway announced that the fourth book in the series, The Adventures of Abdi, would be released on November 8, 2004. Like her previous releases, Madonna was again inspired by a 300 year-old story by rabbi Baal Shem Tov that she had heard from her Kabbalah teacher, and wanted to share the \\"essence\\" of it. \\"The power of certainty is without limits\\", the singer wrote in the preface, referencing a line uttered by the character Eli to Abdi.The Adventures of Abdi, 2004, Acknowledgement, p. III In an interview with The Times, Madonna explained that she was inspired by the settings in \\"Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves\\" and other folk stories from One Thousand and One Nights, and wanted to create something in that genre. She included the Kabbalistic principle of certainty in the story with the idea that one can \\"overcome all obstacles and challenges in our lives if we perceive them as blessings and not curses; if we accept that they have arrived in our lives to teach us something valuable\\". The Adventures of Abdi was published in a 32-page jacketed hardcover format. Madonna collaborated with Russian illustrators Olga Dugina and Andrej Dugin, who created the images for The Adventures of Abdi. This was the first time they worked with a contemporary writer and it presented them \\"with several artistic possibilities‚Äîto show a desert,a palace,a small house where an old man was making jewelry\\". The couple took almost four months to finish the illustrations. They first decided on the \\"most interesting\\" portions of the story and gathered research materials from libraries and museums. They created rough sketches based on them; Andrej did the drawings while Olga painted them. The couple's favorite illustration was showing the queen trying out the necklace since they could show \\"a lot of strange characters. We could tell the story that was not told, and hint at something much broader than the text itself\\". The image for the book cover was the last painting finished by them. Publication and reception Selfridges, Oxford Street in London, where Madonna appeared to promote the release Following the release of The Adventures of Abdi, Madonna made a number of promotional appearances. On November 12, 2004, the singer appeared at Selfridges, Oxford Street in London for a book signing event. Only 250 of the fans queued up were chosen to get inside. Madonna read aloud from the book for 30 minutes, watched by 30 schoolchildren in audience. She appeared on British television chat show Richard & Judy, where she spoke about the inspiration and her writing process of the book, followed by The Jeremy Vine Show. Madonna was interviewed by Pat O'Brien from The Insider on November 11, and she spoke about writing the book as a means for \\"giving children some kind of tools to deal with adversity in their life in a peaceful way\\". In December, Madonna promoted the book on the CBBC show Blue Peter. Publishers Weekly criticized The Adventures of Abdi for being Orientalist as it depicts \\"a cobra-bodied man play[ing] a flute [while] dark-skinned dwarves assist the milky-skinned queen and a gazelle sports a turbaned person's head\\". The writer believed that some readers could be troubled by its \\"harem-chic depiction of an exotic Middle East\\" and simplistic philosophy. The illustrations received positive feedback, with the reviewer calling them \\"sumptuous\\" and a mix between the paintings of Michelangelo and Hieronymus Bosch. Author Sandra L. Beckett complimented the illustrations in her book, Crossover Picturebooks: A Genre for All Ages. She described the images as \\"intricately detailed, richly textured\\" and believed it evoked the work of past artisans and masters. The book faced negative reaction from religious groups who believed that it was forcing children into accepting teachings of Kabbalah. Religious cult expert Rick Alan Ross opposed the release, saying it was just \\"more Kabbalah preaching disguised as a kiddie book... It's just pushing Kabbalah down the throats of innocent children'.\\" See also *Madonna bibliography References External links * The Adventures of Abdi at Callaway * After Election, Madonna Tries to Stay Upbeat by ABC News Category:2004 children's books Category:American children's books Category:American picture books Category:Books by Madonna (entertainer) Category:Children's fiction books Category:Orientalism ","title":"The Adventures of Abdi"},{"id":"58020192","text":"Siege of Montemassi by Simone Martini.

No evidence of wrongdoing was ever found. Since the 2015 publication of the book Clinton Cash by Breitbart News editor and Steve Bannon collaborator Peter Schweizer, as well as a 2015 New York Times article that Schweizer was involved with, allegations of a bribery scheme involving Hillary Clinton, the Clinton Foundation and the 2010 sale of Uranium One persisted, primarily in conservative media. Fox News host Sean Hannity characterized it as \\"the biggest scandal ‚Äî or, at least, one of them ‚Äî in American history,\\" while his frequent guest and former Trump advisor Seb Gorka equated it with treason worthy of a death sentence. Despite four years of discussion and analysis of the matter‚Äîas well as an FBI investigation‚Äîno evidence of any quid pro quo or other wrong-doing has surfaced. Numerous Republican politicians and pundits, including President Donald Trump, have insisted that the Clinton-Uranium One story is the \\"real\\" Russian scandal, rather than the matters for which the Trump administration was investigated. The Washington Post reported in January 2020 that an additional Justice Department investigation into the matter, initiated after Donald Trump took office in 2017, was winding down after finding nothing worth pursuing.  Timeline of events  = 2005: $145 million alleged bribes to Clinton Foundation = Frank Giustra donated $31.3 million to the Clinton Foundation, to be followed in 2007 with a pledge of at least $100 million. These amounts constituted the bulk of the $145 million in supposed bribes paid to the Clinton Foundation. = 2007: Uranium One acquired UrAsia Energy = On April 20, 2007, Uranium One acquired UrAsia Energy, a Canadian firm with headquarters in Vancouver, from Frank Giustra, who then resigned from the UrAsia Energy Board of Directors. Having severed ties with UrAsia Energy and Uranium One in 2007, Giustra had no evident beneficial interest in the firm's subsequent sale to Rosatom in 2010. UrAsia has interests in rich uranium operations in Kazakhstan,\\"UrAsia Energy Ltd.\\" updated April 21, 2007, accessed April 23, 2015. and UrAsia Energy's acquisition of its Kazakhstan uranium interests from Kazatomprom followed a trip to Almaty in 2005 by Giustra and former U.S. President Bill Clinton where they met with Nursultan Nazarbayev, the leader of Kazakhstan. Giustra denies reporting by The New York Times that he and Clinton traveled together to Almaty. Substantial contributions to the Clinton Foundation by Giustra followed, with Clinton, Giustra, and Mexican telecommunications billionaire Carlos Slim in 2007 establishing the Clinton Foundation's Clinton Giustra Sustainable Growth Initiative to combat poverty in the developing world. In addition to his initial pledge of $100 million, Giustra pledged to contribute half of his future earnings from mining to the initiative. There is no indication that Giustra was contemplating any transaction with Russian interests at the time he began donating to the Clinton Foundation in 2005; rather, he sold UrAsia Energy to Uranium One, a South African-Canadian company based in Toronto, in 2007. That sale was completed two months before he made his pledges to the Clinton Foundation. Since uranium is considered a strategic asset with national security implications and Uranium One owned uranium mining operations in the United States, the acquisition of Uranium One by Rosatom was reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a committee of nine government cabinet departments and agencies including the United States Department of State, which was then headed by Hillary Clinton. Clinton herself did not sit on CFIUS, but rather the State Department was represented by Jose Fernandez, the Assistant Secretary of State for Economic, Energy and Business Affairs, who stated that Clinton was not involved in the Uranium One matter. Although CFIUS members can object to such a foreign transaction, none did, and no member can veto a decision; veto power rests solely with the president. CFIUS unanimously approved the Uranium One sale. The Utah Division of Radiation Control and Canada's foreign investment review agency also approved the transaction. = 2010: $500,000 payment to Bill Clinton = On June 29, 2010, Renaissance Capital, a Russian investment bank with ties to the Kremlin and which was promoting Uranium One stock, paid Bill Clinton $500,000 for a speech in Moscow shortly after the Rosatom acquisition of Uranium One was announced. = 2015: New York Times coverage = On April 23, 2015, The New York Times reported that during the acquisition, the family foundation of Uranium One's chairman, Ian Telfer, made $2.35 million in donations to the Clinton Foundation. The donations were legal but not publicly disclosed by the Clinton Foundation, despite an agreement with the White House to disclose all contributors. In a follow-up story six days later, The Times clarified that the donations went to \\"the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership (Canada), [which] operates in parallel to a Clinton Foundation project called the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership, which is expressly covered by an agreement Mrs. Clinton signed to make all donors public while she led the State Department. However, the foundation maintains that the Canadian partnership is not bound by that agreement and that under Canadian law contributors' names cannot be made public.\\" In his May 5, 2015, book Clinton Cash, Breitbart News editor Peter Schweizer alleged that the Clinton Foundation received $145 million in pledges and donations in exchange for Hillary Clinton's support of the Uranium One deal. This allegation has been repeated numerous times across conservative media, particularly by Sean Hannity, as evidence of a bribery scheme. However, $31 million of this amount was donated by Frank Giustra in 2005, and another $100 million pledged by him in 2007, the latter amount after he had severed ties with Uranium One. Both cases occurred years before any prospective Uranium One sale to Russian interests was known. PolitiFact identified about $4 million in donations from various Uranium One investors in the years before and after the Russian deal, but these amounts do not appear to be unusual compared to amounts that countless other donors have made to the Clinton Foundation. = 2016: FBI investigate Clinton Foundation = By August 2016, the FBI had begun to confidentially investigate the Clinton Foundation, based largely on Schweizer's book and reporting by The New York Times, but they failed to find much evidence to support corruption allegations. As the investigation lay dormant, Attorney General Jeff Sessions in December 2017 ordered Justice Department prosecutors to ask FBI investigators about the evidence they had gathered. Sessions was responding to demands of Republican members of Congress for a special counsel to be appointed to investigate Uranium One and other matters relating to Hillary Clinton and the FBI. CNN reported on March 29, 2018, that Sessions had appointed John W. Huber, the United States Attorney for the District of Utah, to investigate \\"a cluster of Republican-driven accusations against the FBI,\\" which includes allegations that the FBI acted inappropriately in two matters involving Hillary Clinton, including her emails and the sale of Uranium One to Rosatom. In a letter to three Republican Congressional committee chairmen, Sessions said he would rely on Huber's findings to decide if a special counsel needed to be appointed. Huber had been investigating the matters for a time, but his involvement had not previously been disclosed. Several members of Clinton's State Department staff and officials from the Obama-era Department of Justice have said that CFIUS reviews are handled by civil servants and that it would be unlikely that Clinton would have had more than nominal involvement in her department's signing off on the acquisition. According to Snopes, the timing of donations might have been questionable if Hillary Clinton had played a key role in approving the deal, but all evidence suggests that she did not and may in fact have had no role in approving the deal at all. = 2017 =  Investigation sale of Uranium One  In October 2017, following a report by John F. Solomon and Alison Spann published in The Hill and citing anonymous sources, Forbes Energy BeltwayBrief contributed by geoscientist, adjunct professor at WSU, and trustee at the Herbert M. Parkier Foundation for education in the radiological sciences the Republican-controlled House Intelligence Committee opened an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the sale of Uranium One. The Hill story insinuated payments from Russians to the Clinton Foundation at the time when the Obama administration approved the sale of Uranium One to Rosatom. The story also focused on the alleged failures of the Department of Justice to investigate and report on the controversy, suggesting a cover-up. Subsequently, the story \\"took off like wildfire in the right-wing media ecosystem,\\" according to a 2018 study by scholars at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, Harvard University. The Hill reported, \\"There is no evidence in any of the public records that the FBI believed that the Clintons or anyone close to them did anything illegal. But there's definitive evidence the Russians were seeking their influence with a specific eye on the State Department.\\" FactCheck.org reported that there was \\"no evidence\\" connecting the Uranium One‚ÄìRosatom merger deal with a money laundering and bribery case involving a different Rosatom subsidiary which resulted in the conviction of a Russian individual in 2015, contrary to what is implied in the Solomon-Spann story. Glenn Kessler of The Washington Post wrote that the problem with some of the accusations that Republican commentators levied against Clinton is that she \\"by all accounts, did not participate in any discussions regarding the Uranium One sale.\\"  Lift gag order  In October 2017, President Trump directed the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to lift a gag order it had placed on a former FBI informant involved in the investigation. The DOJ released the informant from his nondisclosure agreement on October 25, 2017, authorizing him to provide the leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee, House Oversight Committee, and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence \\"any information or documents he has concerning alleged corruption or bribery involving transactions in the uranium market\\" involving Rosatom, its subsidiaries Tenex and Uranium One, and the Clinton Foundation. The informant's lawyer said that the informant \\"can tell what all the Russians were talking about during the time that all these bribery payments were made.\\" During a C-SPAN interview, Hillary Clinton said that any allegations that she was bribed to approve the Uranium One deal were \\"baloney.\\" On November 16, 2017, William Douglas Campbell identified himself as the FBI informant. He is a former lobbyist for Tenex, the US-based arm of Russia's Rosatom. On March 8, 2018, The Hill reported, \\"A confidential informant [Campbell] billed by House Republicans as having \\"explosive\\" information about the 2010 Uranium One deal approved during Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of State provided \\"no evidence of a quid pro quo\\" involving Clinton, Democratic staff said in a summary of the informant's closed-door testimony obtained by The Hill on Thursday.\\" CNN reported that the summary document also stated that the Justice Department had expressed concerns about Campbell's credibility due to \\"inconsistencies between Campbell's statements and documents\\" in a separate investigation in 2015. In November 2017, Shepard Smith of Fox News described President Trump's accusations against Clinton regarding Uranium One \\"inaccurate in a number of ways.\\" Smith said that the sale of Uranium One was \\"not a Hillary Clinton approval\\" but instead a unanimous decision by the nine cabinet-level department heads of CFIUS, approved by the president and with permits issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Smith added that \\"most of the Clinton Foundation donations\\" came from Frank Giustra, who said he \\"sold his stake in the company\\" three years before it was sold to Russia. Lastly, Smith noted that \\"none of the uranium was exported for use by the U.S. to Russia.\\"  Review of FBI investigation ordered by Attorney General Sessions  In March 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions revealed that he had declined to appoint a special counsel to investigate, among other matters, the alleged connections between Uranium One and the Clinton Foundation and, instead, had ordered John W. Huber, U.S. Attorney for the District of Utah, on November 22, 2017, to look into whether further investigation was warranted. Huber found nothing worth investigating, a result law enforcement officials indicated was largely expected, and the investigation was quietly wound down. Nonprofit American Oversight obtained Session's letter in 2019 through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request they had filed in 2017; the United States Department of Justice had claimed in 2018 that the letter did not exist. = 2018: Indictment rumor = In 2018, several sources, including the New York Post, incorrectly reported an indictment in the Tenex/Rosatam kickback scheme as a \\"first indictment\\" resulting from Rosatom's purchase of Uranium One. The rumor was rated false by PolitiFact and Snopes.

Tomas, it provides free secondary education for the people of the municipality and neighboring barangays with primary aim on junior high school and senior high school basic education. History Sto. Tomas Integrated High School was first known as Calauan Stand-alone Senior High School and later Calauan Senior High School, established in school year 2016‚Äì2017. It initially offered three Technical- Vocational-Livelihood (TVL) Tracks in Grade 11 and 12, to wit: Home Economics Combo 1 (Front Office Services NC II, Attractions and Theme Parks NC II, Tourism Promotion Services NC II, and Local Guiding Services NC II), Home Economics Combo 2 (Cookery NC II, Bread and Pastry Production NC II, and Food and Beverage Services NC II), and Information Communications Technology (Computer Systems Servicing NC II). The following school year 2017‚Äì2018, it was integrated and became known as Sto. Tomas Integrated High School and offered complete basic secondary education by adding Junior High School (Grade 7 to 10). Thereby, it held its first Moving-Up Ceremonies in Grade 10 and its first Commencement Exercises in Grade 12 this year. The population of the school has grown ever since, from an initial enrolment of 93 SHS students in SY 2016‚Äì2017, it rose to a total of 989 students in SY 2017‚Äì2018 and 1,256 students in SY 2018‚Äì2019. Thus, from a pioneer of 11 senior high school faculty in the first two school years, it employed an additional 26 junior high school teachers in 2018. This normalized the teacher-student ratio per classroom and distribution of teaching load. Rhodora C. Alcantara was assigned as the very first school head with the rank of Principal II. She led the school in transition from simply a senior high school to a fully-grown integrated high school. Later on, Marvin A. Umali served as Assistant Principal II to assist in the day-to-day operation and supervision of the school. Sto. Tomas IHS is home of promising students who excel in district, unit, cluster and division-wide contests as well as regional competitions in terms of campus journalism, sports and technical skills development.

It was designed by Geoffrey D. Loveridge and built from 1937 to 1939 by L. Benbow in conjunction with W. W. Todd & Son (joinery), W. Wilson & Co. (bricks/tiles) and Hawkesbury Sandstone Co. (stone). It is also known as Glenifer Brae and Wollongong Conservatorium of Music. The property is owned by Wollongong City Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  =Early history= The land that would become Gleniffer Brae and the Wollongong Botanic Garden was originally inhabited by the Dharawal Aboriginal people. 2000 acres of land including this site were purchased by James Spearing in 1825. In the 1830s the estate was sold and subdivided.Johnson, 12/3/16 The site of Gleniffer Brae was originally part of a Crown grant of 1000 acres to Robert and Charles Campbell in 1841. The land went through a number of different owners until 1928.WCC, 2006, 4-5 James Fitzgerald bought 75 acres in 1919, building Cratloe, the cottage on the Wollongong Botanic Gardens site now used as the Gardens' Discovery Centre. In 1928, Arthur Sidney (known as Sidney) Hoskins a founder of the Australian Iron and Steel works at Port Kembla, came from Lithgow with his brother Cecil. Sidney Hoskins purchased 75 acres of Fitzgerald's dairy farm around Murphy Lane, Wollongong and began plans for a family home, the same year the steel works commenced operation.Johnson, 12 March 2016 Hoskins was born in 1892 and joined the family's steel firm in 1907. He became joint managing director with his elder brother in 1924 and was directly involved with the move of the company to Port Kembla and the erection of the new works.WCC, 2006, 5 Sidney Hoskins married Helen Madoline (known as Madge) Loveridge in 1934 and a son was born to them at Edgecliff in 1936. =Residence= Hoskins commissioned his brother-in-law, Geoffrey Loveridge (1893 -1989), to design Gleniffer Brae Manor House and had the gardens designed by Paul Sorensen.RAIA, 2010/11 The name Gleniffer Brae comes from a small village in Paisley, Scotland, the birthplace of Mrs Hoskins' grandfather. Gleniffer Brae was designed by architect Geoffrey Loveridge, brother of Mrs Hoskins. The building of the residence began in 1937 through a tender by L. Benbow. The surveying work was undertaken by George Dunwoodie. The house was completed in 1939.Ratliffe, 1990 Unlike most architects of his time, Geoffrey Loveridge had a long and thorough training in the building business. This involved both a strong family tradition and extensive personal experience. His building expertise was evident in his careful selection of the tradesmen for Gleniffer Brae: Benbow as builder, Todd and Son for joinery, Wilson's bricks and the Hawkesbury Sandstone Company. There is good anecdotal evidence of Loveridge's careful supervision of the high quality detailing of Gleniffer Brae. Loveridge was not simply a new architect working for rich relatives who knew what they wanted. Certainly, he designed the houses that Cecil and Sidney Hoskins intended: \\"Stockbroker Tudor\\" for Cecil and a bungalow complex for Sidney. In the latter case, at least, there are abundant signs of highly competent architectural design, giving unity to an array of single storey buildings. The Tudor features are carefully adapted to the basic design. Gleniffer Brae bears a mature Loveridge stamp. The extensive landscaped gardens surrounding the manor were largely attributed to the landscape designer Paul Sorensen, a Danish-Australian garden designer who had worked for Hoskins' brother Cecil at his estate \\"Invergowrie\\", Exeter and who had become known to Cecil Hoskins through his work for Henri Van der Velde at \\"Everglades\\", Leura. Sidney Hoskins had a reliable and loyal gardener for Gleniffer Brae, named Eric Winter. In 1921 Hoskins gave Winter 2.5 acres of land on the eastern boundary of his property that included a house named Cratloe, which stands today as the Botanic Gardens Discovery Centre. Council purchased this land in 1966 from the owner, who had bought it off Winter.WCC, 2002, 6 The impressive location and style of Gleniffer Brae was in keeping with the position of the Hoskins family with the social and financial circles of the day. In the immediate post-war years distinguished guests such as the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, the Archbishop of York and Lady Baden-Powell were hosted at Gleniffer Brae.Conacher & Delahunty Architects 1993 =School= With the death of Sidney, part of the property was donated for use as a Botanic Garden while the house and remaining grounds were sold to the Sydney Diocese of the Church of England for its Girls Grammar School (SCEGGS) in 1954. This was a significant addition to the educational facilities of the region.Ratcliffe, 1990, WCC, 2002, 6 The church operated SCEGGS at the site until 1975, when the school merged with Illawarra Grammar School. The house was later listed for sale, before the school grounds were acquired by Wollongong City Council in 1978. Along with land previously bought from the school in 1976, the purchase allowed for the extension of the Wollongong Botanic Garden. A memorandum of understanding was finalised in 1954 with Wollongong City Council for approximately 32 acres of land extending from Murphys Avenue to Northfields Avenue for the purposes of a Botanic Garden. It would take many years to see Hoskins' dream become a reality: the Botanic Gardens did not open to the public on a regular basis until 1971. On 10 December 1959 R. H. Anderson, Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney visited the Keiraville site and declared it good and recommended that expert advice be sought to prepare a design for a Botanic Garden. Ultimately the expert chosen was Professor Peter Spooner of the University of New South Wales. Spooner came up with an idea of a geographically based garden layout; which was unusual. Plants were grouped according to their country of origin rather than the more usual botanic family groups (Australasia; Indonesia and Malaysia; Pacific Islands; Europe; India; Africa; China & Korea; The Americas).WCC, 2006, 6-7 The first planting was an azalea (Rhododendron indicum cv. and R.kurume cv's), established in 1964 by original gardener, Jack Woodgate. In 1966, Council purchased Cratloe and in 1968 built the Sir Joseph Banks glasshouse. The Wollongong Botanic Garden was officially opened in September 1970, with 6000 people visiting in the first year. Later when the Gardens were expanded and Council had hired Deane Miller as Parks & Gardens Controller and Director of Wollongong Botanic Gardens, it was determined that the geographical based garden concept was not working well and that a habitat planting system would better suit the expanded site. It was possible to develop microclimates in the garden - from the exposed dryland of the highest hill, to stone filled gullies and open grassland. In 1976 a financial crisis forced SCEGGS to sell nearly 15.5 acres to Wollongong City Council and in 1978, the remaining grounds, including Gleniffer Brae passed into Council's possession via a notice of resumption. As a result, Council owned all the land that now comprises Gleniffer Brae, the University Soccer Fields (Kooloonbong Oval) and the Botanic Garden by 1978.WCC, 2006, 6 Since 1980, part of the manor house, school buildings and auditorium have been used as the Wollongong Conservatorium of Music and function centre under lease from Wollongong City Council. The remainder of the manor house and surrounding gardens have operated as a function venue by Wollongong City Council. Hoskins was civic-minded and desired that Gleniffer Brae be used for educational purposes and that the surrounding land would become a botanic garden once his family no longer used the residence.WCC, 2006, 1 Under Hoskins' will, part of the property became the nucleus of Wollongong Botanical Gardens. The grounds have been subdivided with over half of the area, now known as Hoskins Park, being used as the Wollongong Botanic Gardens (open to the public on a regular basis from 1971. Apart from the Spinney, which is readily recognisable as part of the original garden, the changes necessary to adapt a domestic garden, no matter how big, to use as a public park have disguised Sorensen's work so that his hand is no longer visible over large areas. The simplification of maintenance around the conservatorium has also reduced his impact.Ratcliffe, 1990  Description  ;House A picturesque single storey Tudor Revival style building designed by architect Geoffrey Loveridge, of complex plan, built of red textured brick with rock-faced sandstone trims (doors, window surrounds). A steep multi-gabled roof of multi-coloured Marseille tiled roof has projecting rafters, elaborate twisting chimneys. The roof's slit gable vents, ornately carved bargeboards and twisted chimneys are reminiscent of Edwin Lutyens. Tudor arched diamond patterned windows have sandstone mullions and facing the rear courtyard is a leadlighted bay window with deliberate archaizing breaks in the panes. The interior has excellent carved doors and a central room with carved timber frieze and ribbed ceiling with stone bosses. The internal joinery i.e. panelling and framings including doors and frames being part of the panelling were constructed of using \\"Swedish Oak\\". Other details of note are pull-up flyscreens hidden in window sills, bathroom with original tiling and rainwater heads decorated with fleur-de-lis. ;Grounds Extensive grounds, courtyards, garden, stone walls and paving. ;Garden Shed Timber shed with tile roof built as part of the original estate. ;Old Soils Testing Laboratory Split level brick building first built as part of the girls' school then used by Council as a laboratory to test soils. ;School Buildings A double storey and a single storey school buildings in brick were built during the school era. ;Auditorium This is a 1970s brick building of one large room around 13x12m with 2 small auxiliary rooms. ;Old Caretaker's Residence This was originally brought from Mangerton and placed on the site as headmistress' residence c.1960. After the school closed it was occupied by the Council caretaker on site until 1992. It is leased as a private residence now. ;Garden/Site Immediately around the house are original stone walls and terraces, a fountain in a sunken circular area to the rear, sandstone driveway (2 tracks), gate pillars and a doll's house. The site slopes north-east gently into a valley, rising on the far side to form a low hill which screens the suburbs of Wollongong from the house. Behind the house the dramatic view of Mount Keira rises to 460 metres provides a unique backdrop. The garden (4 acres around the house, out of 75 acres - mostly grazing land) was designed by Danish-Australian garden designer Paul Sorensen for/with the Hoskins family. Sorensen began tree planting as soon as the house was completed in 1938. Firstly he transplanted from the surrounding bush several large Illawarra flame trees (Brachychiton acerifolius) for immediate shelter and an appearance of maturity. Some of these survive (1990), and could be the earliest successful example of transplantation of mature Australian native trees, a process still regarded as almost impossible. Also planted at this time were many brush box (Lophostemon confertus), Kaffir plum (Harpephyllum caffrum), plane trees (Platanus x acerifolia), silky oak (Grevillea robusta) and Jacaranda mimosifolia trees. An area known as the spinney, low on the nearside of the valley, was planted with hundreds of azaleas growing in the shade of a natural grove of turpentines (Syncarpia glomulifera). Sorensen's interest in native plants is revealed by the dominance of native species in this list and the presence in a prominent location of a very large specimen of coastal cypress pine (Callitris columellaris) which still survives in excellent health. The driveway sweeping up the hill to the front of the house was constructed in a similar low-key fashion to that at Invergowrie, Exeter (Hoskins' brother Cecil's estate), with the drivestrips in this instance formed by sandstone flagging, carefully fitted together with lawn grasses creeping between the flags further visually subduing the whole drive. Behind the house is an almost circular lawn with central pond and stone borders in a more formal manner. This is surrounded by trees and shrubs framing the view of Mount Kiera. Service areas to the south-east are separated from the formal garden with stone walls of similar construction and detailing as those at Everglades, Leura. This quarter was heavily planted for shelter from prevailing winds. Across the formal garden from the house a romantic playhouse for the children sits comfortably within the shurbs on the axis to the mountain, fulfilling the role of a summer house as a visual accent in the vegetation. Other significant features of the garden are gravel paths, boundary wall, rustic \\"dolls house\\" of roughcast-covered fibro with unsawn timber posts and tiled roof, rustic gardener's shed of vertical boards with unsawn coverstrips and rafters, leadlight windows and tiled roof.National Trust 1985, amended Read, S., 2005 ;Condition The physical condition of the property was reported as good as at 1 October 1997. The archaeological potential was assessed as low. = Modifications and dates = * 1937 - building began * 1939 - construction completed * 1954 - The house and grounds became a branch school for the Sydney Church of England Girls Grammar School * 1978 - The school closed and was acquired by Wollongong City Council in 1978. The house is now used as a Conservatorium of Music and function centre. * 1980+ - The grounds were subdivided with over half of the area, now known as Hoskins Park, being used as the local Botanic Gardens.  Heritage listing  Gleniffer Brae is intimately associated with that period of Illawarra's history which saw the beginning of major economic development. It is associated with the Hoskins family and particularly Arthur Sidney Hoskins, pioneers of the steel industry and responsible for its creation and development at Port Kembla. The estate is thus not only a gentleman's residence but the manager's house for a large industrial complex. Sidney Hoskins, for whom the house and garden was designed and built, was instrumental establishing the Illawarra steel industry and made a significant contribution to the community life of Wollongong. Gleniffer Brae forms a well designed residential estate in sympathy with the surrounding site which was selected for its topographical setting. It is associated with architect Geoffrey Loveridge and landscape designer Paul Sorensen. Gleniffer Brae exhibits a high quality of craftsmanship in the fabric of the original buildings. The detailing represents the finest in Australian building skills of the pre-war period and this is enhanced by the fact that its original fabric is more or less intact. The open space around the house permits a full appreciation of the scale and design of the house. The grounds' original garden design are very attractive in their own right.Conacher & Delahunty Architects, 1993 The house constitutes a fine example of the Inter-war period English Tudor or Elizabethan Revival style of architecture, influenced by English architecture and cleverly and unusually adapted to the requirements of a single storey complex. The English Tudor or Elizabethan Revival style very much reflected the orientation and values of wealthy families in the period to World War II, who tended to look to Britain as the \\"Home\\" country, who had Royalist sympathies and who promoted attachment to \\"King and Empire\\". The gardens constitute an integral part of the design and setting of the house and show the outcome of an integrated association between architect and landscape designer. The grounds' original garden design is representative of designer Paul Sorensen's ability to incorporate the surrounding landscape and flora into the overall design and to capture and extend the dramatic effect of the natural landscape through spatial planning, planting and construction of hard landscape elements. In the execution of the landscape design, Sorensen transplanted from the surrounding bush several large Illawarra flame trees (Brachychiton acerifolium), that is reputed to be one of the earliest successful examples of transplantation of mature Australian native trees, a process still regarded as almost impossible. The estate's current use as now the Wollongong Botanic Gardens precinct and the house's current use as home of the Wollongong Conservatorium of Music continue the estate's association with the community and educational life of Wollongong and the Illawarra region. Few capitalists associated with the mining and industrial development chose to live in the Illawarra. Gleniffer Brae stands apart as the only example of a \\"grand house\\" on a grand estate in the City of Wollongong. Gleniffer Brae together with Invergowrie at Exeter are a unique pair, both estates being the outcome of the collaboration between architect Geoffrey Loveridge and landscape designer Paul Sorensen, both built for two brothers Cecil and Sidney Hoskins family who each married a sister of Geoffrey Loveridge. Their rarity is heightened by the fact that the pair of estates survive as relatively intact outstanding examples of Interwar period architecture and landscape designNBRS, 2005, partly based on Conacher & Delahunty Architects 1993 Gleniffer Brae was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Gleniffer Brae is intimately associated with that period of Illawarra's history which saw the beginning of major economic development. Sydney Hoskins for whom the house was designed and built was instrumental in establishment of the Illawarra steel industry and made a significant contribution to the community life of Wollongong. Gleniffer Brae is associated with architect Geoffrey Loveridge and landscape designer Paul Sorenson. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Gleniffer Brae exhibits a high quality of craftesmanship in the fabric of the original buildings. The detailing represents the finest in Australian building skills of the pre-war period and this is enhance by the fact that its original fabric is more or less intact. The open space around the house permits a full appreciation of the scale and design of the house. The grounds original gardens design are very attractive in their own right. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The English Tudor or Elizabethan revival architectural style of Glennifer Brae very much reflected the orientation and values of wealthy families in the period to WWII, who tended to look to Britain as the \\"Home\\" country, who has Royalist sympathies and who promoted attachment to \\"King and Empire\\". Its elaborate style displays wealth and power much as the manor did in English context. Few capitalists associated with mining and industrial development chose to live in the Illawarra. Glennifer Brae stands apart as the only example of a \\"grand house\\" in the City of Wollongong. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. There is nothing else in the City of Wollongong comparable to this house, particularly from the 1930s.

History  In 1914, the Germans began construction of a light railway on Upolu, the main island of German Samoa, to transport building material from the waterfront at Apia to the wireless station. The railway was inaugurated on 1 August 1914, just as World War I began.Telefunken-Zeitung, No 18, October 1919. Retrieved on 29 July 2018.

When the New Zealand Railway engineers unit of the 3rd Auckland Regiment arrived in Samoa, the line was in disrepair, but a gang of surfacemen, under Lieutenant Christophers, lifted, ballasted and relaid the rails. A frequent service was instituted, and for several days the ‚Äòtrain‚Äô averaged 30 trips per day between Apia and to Vaea Camp, where the Railway Corps was encamped. The engine was quickly rebranded N.Z.R. and christened A1, but the men missed the omission of the customary whistle of an ‚ÄòA‚Äô class engine. Two enginemen were thus requested to arrange to have a whistle affixed to the engine. It was difficult to re-commission the wireless station because essential parts had been removed by the Germans. The petroleum engine of the Apia master butcher's ice cream machine was confiscated and attempts made to use it to power the station. It turned out to be far too weak. After reinstalling the regulator parts that the Germans had removed, the original glow-head diesel engine started suddenly, but since the regulator had not been set accurately, it ran at much too high revolutions and the flywheel exploded. A part of the flywheel broke through the roof, reached the tower at a height of 75 m, bent it, fell down and amputated the leg of a station worker. The repair of the station had become a matter of prestige for the English, New Zealand and Australian forces. Despite being discrete, the failed attempts to repair the station had not gone unnoticed by the natives and the reputation of the occupying forces suffered.Maritime Radio: Apia Radio (Samoa).

During the occupation, the railway was used for hauling ammunition, ballast and camp material, including timber for the tents and shingle for the roads in the new camps, and at the wireless station.

It was designed by Cobden Parkes in his capacity as New South Wales Government Architect and built in 1937-39. It is also known as Wollongong Hospital Nurses Home and Eloura House. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  It was opened in April 1939 by Acting Minister for Health Athol Richardson and named \\"Elouera\\" for the 'native name' for the Illawarra. The building had 69 rooms, with a separate room for every member of the nursing staff, spacious balconies, a spacious recreation room and \\"all necessary sitting rooms, studies, etc.\\" It had been first announced in February 1937, with construction starting in November that year; while completed at its 1939 opening, it was still not furnished at that time. It was built by contractors Hogden Bros at a cost of approximately ¬£22,000, financed on a 50-50 arrangement between the state government and hospital, which took out a loan to cover the cost. By 1940, the nurses' home was found to be not big enough, with 21 more rooms needed. It was subsequently extended in 1941. In 2011, it was being used for obstetrics, gynecology and administration, although at that time it had fallen into a state of disrepair. In that year, the Wollongong Hospital released plans for an $86 million expansion of the hospital. It proposed to demolish the 1941 extension on the building's western side to make way for a new six-storey, 120-bed hospital wing. The Heritage Council responded that retention of the wing was \\"desirable in view of its heritage significance\\", but noted the arguments that it was in a poor state and was not part of the original building. The state planning department subsequently agreed that it would not have a significant heritage impact and approved the demolition of the wing. It was demolished by March 2013.  Description  Elouera House is a three-storey nurses' home with round ended cantilevered balconies. It is built in the Inter War Functionalist style, with cream facing bricks, Marseilles pattern semi-glazed terracotta tiles and reinforced concrete slab. It is the oldest structure on the Wollongong Hospital site. It was reported to be in fair condition as at 18 December 2000. By 2011-12, it was described as \\"dilapidated\\", with many rooms unable to be occupied due to the state of internal disrepair.  Heritage listing  Wollongong Hospital Nurses Home was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

Biography Kimmritz was born as the 14th child in a working class family and attended Volksschule until the seventh grade. After his confirmation, he worked as a farmhand and a coachman in agriculture. His first conviction for rape took place in 1936, where he served three years in Gollnow prison. After his release, he married and had a child. In 1943, he robbed his employer, a wholesaler, and was again sentenced to three years in prison. During his detention, his wife divorced him. In April 1945, Kimmritz and other prisoners in Gollnow were sent away to the West due to the approaching Red Army, where he was finally released. After an interlude as a steward of a supply of the Soviet occupiers, in which he was accused of embezzlement, he first fled to Bad Freienwalde to his mother and then to Berlin, where he lived without a permanent residence mostly around prostitutes. He made his living mainly through robbery and burglary. Between 1946 and 1948 he lured several women to the Brandenburg forest areas north and east of Berlin, where he raped and robbed them, even killing four of them. His actions triggered one of the largest post-war manhunt operations called Aktion Roland. The search for Kimmritz was initially unsuccessful for several years, although several of the surviving victims identified him early in a facial composite. This was mainly because the post-war circumstances (insufficient police forces and investigators, obstruction of the search by the Soviet occupation authorities, jurisdictional disputes between the occupying powers and finally the Berlin Blockade), which made the investigation difficult. On September 11, 1948, Kimmritz was recognised by a witness in Berlin and arrested in the French sector; at the interrogation, he confessed. He was extradited to the Soviet sector, where he confessed to 23 rapes, 4 murders and numerous property offenses. On February 18, 1949, the trial began in the district court of Potsdam. For procedural reasons, he was only tried for 13 rapes and 3 murders. On the same day, his death sentence was pronounced, which was confirmed in the appeal application. On July 26, 1950, Willi Kimmritz was guillotined in the detention center of Frankfurt an der Oder.  Film  The DEFA feature film Leichensache Zernik (1971) is about the hunt for Kimmritz.

He was the first person accused of murder in German legal history, on whom a chromosome test was applied.  Murders  Beck, who had repeatedly been convicted for theft, fraud, forgery, assault and sexual assault, on April 8, 1961, strangled 23-year-old Ingrid K. She had gone to a bachelor party, disappearing on the way home and was later found strangled in a mill near Rehme. The case caused a great interest because all 84 guests had to be interrogated very thoroughly by the police. The authorities also tracked over 1000 tracks, without finding the culprit. Several people were suspected, including the victim's father, who was never relived because he died before Beck's arrest. On May 25, 1965, Beck murdered 29-year-old officer worker Ursula F. She had met Beck in a dance hall and called him for a dance. After several visits to restaurants, Beck invited F. to her mother's apartment in Herford, inhabited at the time only by F.. There he strangled her and left the apartment unseen. Since F. had planned a trip to the Netherlands at the time, she was not considered missing and was found by neighbours after ten days. On February 28, 1968, Beck murdered 21-year-old store clerk Anneliese H. She was found the next day by a driver in a creek near Herford.  Trial  Beck was arrested on March 1, 1968 due to a matching fingerprint found in Ursula F.s home. Although he denied involvement, he was admitted to a state psychiatric hospital in Marsberg for a psychiatric examination. There he confessed to the local killings. The special circumstances under which Beck was considered a murderer prompted his defense lawyer, Schl√ºter, to a submit a request for evidence to obtain a cytogenic report from the Institute of Human Genetics at the University of Marburg. In forensic psychiatry, it has been argued that the chromosome shift in the sex- determining pair of chromosomes, from the normal combination XY to XYY in males, must result in predisposition to violent crimes. In trials against killers in the United States and France, test results had already led to criminal mitigation. While in the trial against child murderer J√ºrgen Bartsch the assizes court of Wuppertal rejected the application, the director of the district court of Bielefeld agreed with it, and the prosecutor's office did not object. It was the first time in German criminal and legal history that somebody accused of murder was subjected to the chromosome test. From the report prepared by the Marburg Institute of Human Genetics it emerged that Beck had no probability of a shift from XY to XYY according to the researchers. So he had the normal chromosome combination and could expect no mitigation from the court. On November 4, 1968, Ernst-Dieter Beck was sentenced to three counts of life imprisonment for the three murders, which he served in the Werl Prison until his death in 2018.Frankfurter Rundschau of November 5, 1968  References  See also * J√ºrgen Bartsch Category:1940 births Category:2018 deaths Category:German serial killers Category:People convicted of murder by Germany Category:Male serial killers Category:Serial killers who died in prison custody Category:1960s murders in Germany Category:1961 crimes in Germany Category:1961 murders in Europe Category:1968 crimes in Germany Category:1968 murders in Europe ","title":"Ernst-Dieter Beck"},{"id":"58020878","text":"Cl√°udionor Provenzano (9 May 1891 - 2 February 1965) was a Brazilian rower.

Swinka was the son of a contentious and irascible father who left his family after being released from captivity. Swinka himself was diagnosed with intermittent explosive disorder at the end of his school days. He was considered a contact-poor loner and outsider, who finished school but did not graduate. He initially worked as a casual worker, but to compensate for physical deficits, he joined a boxing club at 17 years old. Since then he became a thug and was punished several times for violent crimes. He attempted several times to gain a foothold in West Germany, but failed. Eventually he got a job as a lab assistant and later section assistant at the Pathological Institute of the Charit√© in East Berlin. At this position Swinka developed an interest and continued to study, privately setting up his own knife collection.

The trial against Swinka was conducted under strict secrecy, since from the point of view of the former rules in East Germany this case offered propaganda possibilities from the West. Swinka was sentenced to death, and on October 1, 1970, in the Leipzig penitentiary, shot from close range by executioner Hermann Lorenz.

Life  = Early life = Born as the seventh and last child of his parents, Adolf was first trained as a locksmith then as a watchmaker who repaired grandfather clocks and pocket watches. He came to L√ºbeck in 1890 and married Katarina Seefeldt, who divorced him in 1910. At the age of nineteen, his son was sent to a lunatic asylum for moral crimes. Seefeldt is said to have been abused by two men at the age of 12. He was first imprisoned at 25 years for sexual harassment of a boy. Psychiatrists diagnosed him as mentally unstable, which is why he spent most of his life in mental hospitals and prisons. = Serial murders = The traveler and watchmaker Adolf Seefeldt, also called \\"Sandman\\" or ‚Äì because of his profession ‚Äì \\"Uncle Tick Tock\\" and \\"Uncle Adi\\", abused and killed at least twelve boys during the reign of the Third Reich. As a crime scene he usually chose pine preservations with one exception. A commonality was found in the victim's clothing, who consistently wore sailor suits. Since all children were \\"sleeping peacefully\\" and showed no signs of external violence, the police were mystified by the circumstances of death. It is therefore possible that Seefeldt committed more murders that were considered natural deaths. Contemporary experts speculated that Seefeldt had used his own homemade poison, chloroform or smothered his victims. According to Hans Pfeiffer, a well-known author of popular science books on authentic criminal cases, these theories were disproven with little effort. Pfeiffer suspected, however, that Seefeldt had put his victims into a hypnotic sleep, then probably performed oral sex on them and let them lie asleep in the woods, where he failed to awaken them from hypnosis. The children later died of hypothermia, which Seefeldt had accepted or intended.  The victims  His victims ranged from toddlers to 12-year-old boys: Kurt Gnirk (April 16, 1933), Wolfgang Metzdorf (October 8, 1933), Ernst Tesdorf (November 2, 1933), Alfred Pr√§torius (November 12, 1933), Hans Korn (January 16, 1934), G√ºnter Tieske from Oranienburg (October 2, 1934), 11-year-old Erwin Wishnewski from Brandenburg (October 8, 1934), 4-year-old Artur Dill and 5-year-old Edgar \\"Eipel\\" Dittrich (October 16, 1934, both found in Neuruppin), 10-year-old Hans-Joachim Neumann (killed February 16, 1935; found on June 20, 1935), 10-year-old Heinz Zimmerman (February 23, 1935) and 11-year-old Gustav Thomas (March 22, 1935). The investigative authorities assumed that the actual number of casualties was much higher, possibly claiming up to 100 lives. = Gustav Thomas case = The lawyer Wilhelm Hallermann summed the murder case of 11-year-old Gustav Thomas (found in a pine forest near Wittenberge), that due to microscopic examinations, the bloodshot pressure indicated strangulation. The medical examiner Victor M√ºller-He√ü came in the murder trial against Seefeldt with the claim that the murder victims were not poisoned, but instead strangled.Der Spiegel: THE GAME IS OUT THERE ‚Äì ARTHUR NEBE Splendor and misery of the German Kriminalpolizei.  Trial and execution  The Schwerin jury under the chairmanship of the district court director Karl Friedrich Sarkander and the advisory district court councils of Wilms and Weise consisted of butcher Ernst Hahn from Crivitz, secretary Wilhelm Schneeweis from Schwerin, Ortsgruppenleiter Friedrich Jahnke from Parchim, Mayor Ernst Dubbe from Leussow, engineer Otto Arpke from L√ºbtheen and city councilor Kreisleiter Buhr from Ludwigslust, negotiating the case on January 21, 1936.

Adolf Seefeldt's defense lawyer was Rudolf Neudeck. August Br√ºning (1877‚Äì1965) was a participating expert in the trial. After the closing arguments of February 21, the verdict for the murder cases was announced the following day. Seefeldt was sentenced to death. According to the Niederdeutschen Beobachter, on February 29, 1936, Seefeldt is to have brought in an appeal. Neither a revision nor a revision procedure is historically documented; the judgment was enforced after legal force and refusal of the pardon occurred on May 23, 1936. The records of Seefeldt's conviction are poor. In addition to newspaper reports of his execution, there are only two memory protocols of conversations conducted in April 1936 at his cell in Schwerin.Br√ºckweh, Mordlust, p. 276. The case of Adolf Seefeldt was discussed by J.

He is responsible for the murder of five people and numerous other serious crimes and gained nationwide attention in the first half of 1999 following a several-month escape from custody. The escapes were followed closely by the media and announced an arrest reward of 10,000 Deutsche Mark.Gerhard Starke, Christoph Kloft: I had to kill her. The crimes of Dieter Zurwehme and other authentic cases  Life  Zurwehme the son of an Algerian and a German. He grew up with adoptive parents in Ottbergen, a district of H√∂xter in the Weser Uplands, and became a criminal when at the age of 12, when he tried to rob a 15-year-old. At 16, he was given his first sentence to theft and embezzlement. In November 1972, Zurwehme killed an employee of a real estate agency during a robbery in D√ºren. Because of this, he was sentenced in 1974 for murder and in majority for sex and robbery offenses and vehicle thefts by the district court of Aachen, with one of the charges landing him into life imprisonment.Anja Wunsch: \\"Murderer Zurwehme: \\"I'm the one you're looking for\\" in rp-online.de (Rheinische Post). During detention at the Bielefeld-Brackwede Prison, psychologists saw an apparent change of personality; for example, he learned Latin and French in prison and received prison leaves from 1988 onwards for his good leadership. In 1997, he was transferred to an open prison. On December 2, 1998, Zurwehme did not return from his 166th clearance. His track was lost quickly and the police investigation was unsuccessful. After his escape on March 21, 1999 in Remagen, he killed four older people: one 71-year-old who recognized him was stabbed in his villa he lived in. When the victim's cellphone rang, Zurwehme answered and told his victim's wife that something had happened to her husband, and that he wanted to tell her everything else in a personal conversation. After the shocked wife had given him her address, he went to her house and killed her, her brother and sister-in-law the same way. Then he continued his escape, where he kept afloat with money from robberies and temporary jobs. In addition, he committed a rape, and fled to several places: Bochum, Remagen, Lindau, Dessau, Frankfurt, Calw, Baden-Baden, Freiburg im Breisgau and Cuxhaven. In the course of his flight, he being able to flee from surrounded maze fields or flee only minutes before the police's arrival.\\"Escape to the Cornfield\\" in spiegel.de (Spiegel Online). Through several determining margins the police investigation was even more difficult. In the weekly program Kripo live on MDR Fernsehen, on the evening of June 27, 1999, the public was called upon to report pertinent observations about complicity, known to be travelling with a walking stick and a backpack. Amongst the numerous callers was a waitress from Heldrungen, who stated that he stayed at a hotel where she worked at day and slept in overnight with a hiking stick and a backpack. During the night, the hotel guest, 62-year-old Friedhelm Beate from Cologne, was shot dead in his hotel room by local police officers on the assumption that he was the fugitive.\\"Wrong and real traces\\" in spiegel.de (Spiegel Online). On August 19, 1999, a car driver in Greifswald, who only a few days earlier had seen his picture in a television report, saw Zurwehme. The summoned police officers were able to arrest and detain the criminal. When asked about his ID card, Zurwehme recognized his hopelessness and said that: \\"I am the one you seek\\". By virtue of four counts of murder, aggravated rape, robbery, rape, coercion and false imprisonment, the district court of Koblenz condemned Zurwehme in June 2000 to life imprisonment with subsequent preventative detention. He remains imprisoned at a prison in Bochum. On February 15, 2001, Zurwehme married a waitress from the Berlin district of Spandau.https://swrmediathek.de/player.htm?show=29e276e0-6d78-11e7-bcc9-005056a10824 Another fourfold murder of Dutch holidaymakers which occurred in a country house in Southern France during Zurwehme's escape on May 22, 1999, was also initially associated with him. However, this suspicion was later excluded.  Press articles  * Peter Brock: \\"The last process\\" in www.berliner-zeitung.de (Berliner Zeitung).

Barratt was most notable for developing a specialist service for children with kidney diseases in Britain, bringing peritoneal dialysis, haemodialysis, and later renal transplantation to ever younger children. Barratt was an early advocate for multidisciplinary care and developed a model that was later taken up by many other specialist centres across the world. His research led to a new treatments for many types of childhood kidney diseases., and for research into childhood Nephrotic syndrome and Hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Life Barratt's father owned and ran a law firm, and his mother was one of the first women to matriculate at Cambridge University. He was the third of three children. Barratt's early schooling took place at Clifton College and after winning a scholarship to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, he graduated with a First-class honours in Natural Sciences. Throughout his life, Barratt suffered from facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, a disease that causes progressive weakness, which forced him to retire early, eventually forcing him to use wheelchair for movement. In retirement he kept up to date with the latest developments in paediatric nephrology. Career Barratt completed his clinical training at St Thomas' medical school. After a number of house positions, he was appointed as a registrar at the Institute of Child Health, Great Ormond Street Hospital working with Professor Barbara Clayton. Barratt then spent a year as a research fellow at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, working within the Department pharmacology and experimental therapeutics, and researching fluid physiology with Mackenzie Walser. Upon returning to the UK in 1967, Barratt was appointed as a lecturer working on paediatric nephrology with Professor John Soothill at the Institute. In 1971, Barratt was promoted to senior lecturer in the Institute of Child Health and consultant paediatric nephrologist at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children and in 1978 promoted to professor of paediatric nephrology. In 1966 Barratt married Gill Owen, a social worker who was later promoted to group analyst and psychotherapist. Contributions =Research= When Barratt started his clinical career, the specialism of paediatric nephrology in the UK, outwith certain areas, was primitive. Barratt held the first post that was specifically committed, both academically and professionally to the treatment of children with renal disease. Barratt initially worked by himself, but was joined by Michael Dillon in 1975, and together they built a major world class paediatric nephrology services department at Great Ormond Street Hospital and conducted a research programme at the Institute of Child Health. Barratt was later joined by Richard Trompeter and Lesley Rees who continued the work of Barratt. Barratt early in his career realized that collaboration was needed in developing an interdisciplinary care model for the treatment of children with renal diseases, eventually working closely with the paediatric urologists David Innes Williams and Philip G. Ransley and the paediatric imager, Isky Gordon. Barratt had a broad research focus, conducting research into GFR measurement, urolithiasis, renal cystic disease, Diabetes mellitus, kidney disorders, renal function after cardiopulmonary bypass, genetic studies in inherited kidney disorders and the urological disorders in children. It was research into childhood Nephrotic syndrome and the Hemolytic-uremic syndrome that was his most notable work, particularly the biological roles played by atopy, membrane charge and Cytokine release. Barratt undertook a number of trials to determine the best treatments with patients with nephrotic symptoms. In 1970, Barratt conducted a trial with the immunologist John Soothill, using cyclophosphamide treatment for nephrotic syndrome. Barratt tested the drugs Azathioprine, Levamisole and cyclosporine A in subsequent trials, eventually working with paediatrician Michael Levin and others to study pathogenetic mechanisms involved in the syndrome, including e.g. Platelet-derived growth factor and prostacyclin inhibition. Levin who was Barratt's registrar at Great Ormond Street stated of Barratt, that: :Clinically, Martin had the most wonderful clarity of thought‚Äîmaking the most complex issues clear. He had an absolute belief that the job of a consultant was to offer patients the best of all available evidence. Barratt was considered an outstanding teacher and lecturer. Association work From 1972 to 1976, Barratt was secretary of the British Association for Paediatric Nephrology, and from 1994 to 1997 he was president of the association. Barratt worked with the European Society for Paediatric Nephrology and the International Pediatric Nephrology Association. After his retirement, in 1998, Barratt was co-president along with the paediatrician Sir Cyril Chantler of the 11th Congress of the International Pediatric Nephrology Association.

He obtained a BSc from King's College London in 1972 from the School of Biological Sciences. He subsequently obtained a PhD from King's College as well. From 1975-1977, Allen was a Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC) postdoctoral research fellow at the Botany School of the University of Oxford. During his position as postdoctoral research assistant at the Department of Biological Sciences, University of Warwick in the UK (1979-1983), he was also a visiting research associate at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign in the US (1980). In 1983 he took up a lectureship in the Department of Pure and Applied Biology at the University of Leeds. He returned to the US from 1986-1987 as a Nuffield Foundation Science Research Fellow at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory at the University of California in Berkeley, California. In 1990 he became Professor of Plant Physiology at the University of Oslo, Norway. He moved in 1992 to Sweden where he became the first professor in Plant Cell Biology at Lund University. He stayed in Lund until 2005 when he became Professor of Biochemistry at Queen Mary University of London. He was honoured with a Royal Society-Wolfson Research Merit Award (2005-2009). In 2015, he became honorary professor at University College London.  Contributions to science  Allen is a plant biochemist, in particular relating to regulation of photosynthesis. His work has been cited over 12,000 times. He has given over 300 seminars in 22 countries and 4 continents. 19 of these were plenary or named lectures. Professor Allen's name is linked to the CoRR hypothesis which he formulated in 1993 in the Journal of Theoretical Biology, introducing the term ‚ÄúCoRR\\" in 2003.

The main objective of the journal is to highlight the problem of the history of religion and the history of atheism, to print the chronicle of the spread of atheism in the USSR and abroad, as well as translations (including bourgeois scholars) about religion and the church.

He finished his elementary school in his hometown. In 1963, he was admitted to the Department of Drama and Literature of the Shanghai Theatre Academy. After entering the school, he participated in agricultural labor. In 1966, when the \\"Cultural Revolution\\" disaster occurred, the family broke. His father, Mr. Yu Xuewen, was detained for ten years for being accused of ‚Äúfalse remarks‚Äù and the family‚Äôs economic source was cut off; the only uncle who was able to help him, Mr. Yu Zhishi, was persecuted to death by the rebels. In the hunger and cold, in 1968, he was sent to the 27th Army Army for labor service, which was extremely difficult. In February 1985, Wang Yuanhua, Jiang Kongyang, and Wu Hao, senior academics of Shanghai universities, jointly recommended them. They were promoted to full professors without being an associate professor. They were the youngest liberal arts professors in the country. In March 1986, the National Ministry of Culture ranked first in the three public opinion polls held at the Shanghai Theatre Academy. He was appointed as the vice president and dean of the Shanghai Theatre Academy, and was the youngest university president in the country. One year after presiding over the work, he was recognized by the Department of Education of the Ministry of Culture as one of the ‚Äúfour deans who have the most modern management skills‚Äù. At the same time, he served as the Shanghai Consultant Planning Consultant, the President of the Shanghai Writing Society, the Shanghai Chinese Professional Professor Evaluation Team Leader and the Art Professional Professor Review Team Leader. He was awarded the honorary title of ‚ÄúNational Outstanding Contribution Expert‚Äù and ‚ÄúShanghai Top Ten Higher Education Elites‚Äù. From 1989 to 1991, he refused to be promoted to several provincial and ministerial positions, and began to submit a report to the Ministry of Culture to resign as dean. The resignation report was submitted 23 times in total, and finally was allowed to resign in all administrative positions in July 1991, including various honorary positions and name-related positions. After resigning, he was alone from the Northwest Plateau and systematically inspected all important sites of Chinese culture. The theme of the investigation that was determined at that time was \\"crossing a hundred years of blood and tears, looking for a thousand years of glory.\\" In the study of the \\"cultural essays\\", „Ää„Äã(Cultural Sojourn), \\"Mountain Notes\\" and other fast-moving global Chinese reading circles, it is called \\"the most modern Chinese literature books with the largest printing volume\\". He has thus become one of the most influential Chinese writers in the world.Â§ßÈô∏ÂØåË±™‰ΩúÂÆ∂ÊéíË°å ‰ΩôÁßãÈõ®Âç†È∞≤È†≠ In June 1998, the grand cross-century cultural dialogue was convened in Singapore to shake the Chinese world. The main characters of the dialogue are four Chinese scholars, in addition to Professor Yu Qiuyu, Professor Du Weiming from Harvard University, Professor Gao Xijun from the University of Wisconsin, and artist Chen Ruixian. Yu Qiuyu‚Äôs speech titled ‚ÄúThe Fourth Bridge‚Äù. Since 1999, he has presided over the historical inspection of the major civilizations of human beings by Hong Kong Phoenix Satellite TV. It has become the only humanistic professor in the world to cross the tens of thousands of kilometers of dangerous areas. It is also the first to report the terrorism control area to the civilized world before the 9/11 incident. The scholar of the situation. This was selected by the Japanese \\"Asahi Shimbun\\" as \\"the top ten international figures across the century.\\" Since 2000, due to the huge impact of the global inspection, some domestic media have launched a large-scale embarrassment in pursuit of the market effect of ‚Äúreverse anti-stimulus‚Äù. First, a student from Peking University mistakenly criticized a Shanghai literary rumor for reversing criticism, that is, the textbook writing group set up by Premier Zhou Enlai for the rescue education was described as the \\"Cultural Revolution Writing Group\\", and the Shanghai literati himself was mistakenly involved. The pen name is \\"Shi Yi Ge\\". Thus, a critical tide of more than a decade without actual evidence is formed. According to Professor Yang Changxun‚Äôs statistics, there are more than 1,800 articles in the article. Yu Qiuyu did not make any rebuttals and counterattacks on this. He said: \\"The horses are thousands of miles away, and they don't wash the dust.\\" After 12 years, they disappeared and wrote the article \\"Shi Yi Ge\\" (Chinese:Áü≥‰∏ÄÊ≠å). In March 2004, participated in the design, discussion and review of the United Nations Development Programme Human Development Report. At the end of 2004, it was selected by UNESCO, Peking University, and China Talent Magazine as ‚ÄúChina's Top Ten Cultural Elites‚Äù and ‚ÄúChinese Cultural Communication Coordinates‚Äù. On July 20, 2005, at the United Nations \\"World Civilization Conference\\", he delivered a keynote speech \\"The Conclusion of Matteo Ricci\\", which discusses the non-aggressive nature of Chinese civilization since ancient times. For the first time, it culturally questioned the \\"China threat theory.\\" From 2005 to 2008, he was hired by the Hong Kong Baptist University as the \\"Foundation Professor of Sound Personality Education\\" and worked in Hong Kong for no less than half a year. On May 12, 2008, the Wenchuan Earthquake occurred in China. The first time it rushed to the disaster area to participate in the rescue, and continued to give a speech on the scene to the people and rescuers in the disaster area. After seeing the disabled textbooks left by the students in the ruins, they decided to donate three student libraries. However, since each book must be personally selected and purchased by itself, the donation money cannot be found in the accounts of the Chinese Red Cross, so it was speculated on the Internet as a ‚Äúswindle donation‚Äù. Later, the Education Bureau of the disaster area repeatedly stated that the donation was built, and Wang Meng, Feng Yucai, Zhang Xianliang, Jia Pingwa, Liu Shikun, Bai Xianyong, and Yu Guangzhong all wrote inscriptions for the three student libraries, and the storm was calmed down. On March 27, 2010, he was awarded the title of ‚ÄúDoctor of Honorary Literature‚Äù by the Macau University of Science and Technology. At the same time, he was awarded the honorary doctorate by experts such as Yuan Longping, Zhong Nanshan, Ouyang Ziyuan and Sun Jiadong. On April 30, 2010, he was appointed by the Macau University of Science and Technology and became the Dean of the School of Humanities and Arts of the Macau University of Science and Technology. It is announced that during the term of office, the annual salary of HK$500,000 per year will be donated in full as a scholarship for postgraduate students majoring in design art and communication. On May 21, 2010, the first \\"World Report\\" on the theme of culture since the establishment of the United Nations, the main part of the launch ceremony was a dialogue between the Director- General of UNESCO, Ms. Bokova, and Mr. Yu Qiuyu. Yu Qiuyu‚Äôs speech in the dialogue was entitled ‚ÄúRejecting the ‚ÄúClash of Civilizations‚Äù‚Äù. On October 12, 2012, the China Academy of Art established the ‚ÄúAutumn Rain Academy‚Äù in Beijing as the Dean. The college is a high-level teaching institution for cultivating doctoral students. It now trains two professional doctoral students: one, major in Chinese cultural history; and two, major in Chinese art history. On the afternoon of October 18, 2013, I went to the United Nations Headquarters Building in New York, USA, to give a speech on \\"Why Chinese Culture Longevity\\". For the first time, I questioned the \\"China Collapse Theory\\" from the cultural perspective. On the same day, the UN website listed this speech as the first important news. In March 2015, he was invited to conduct a ‚ÄúCircle Island Tour‚Äù in major cities in Taiwan, from Taipei City, New Taipei City, Taichung City to Kaohsiung City. The blind nephew masters led the monk team to the Kaohsiung station to greet them and gave the highest reception. This is the fourth large-scale round-the-island speech by Professor Yu Qiuyu since his first visit to Taiwan in 1991. The theme of this speech is \\"Chinese Culture and the Way of the Gentleman.\\" In November 2015, he was elected as the honorary president of the World Yu Clan Association. On September 9, 2016, he resigned as dean of the School of Humanities and Art. He was honored as Honorary Dean and Distinguished Professor of Macao University of Science and Technology. In August 2017, Gate Hole was published by Hunan Literature and Art Publishing House. Personal life His wife Ma Lan is a Huangmei opera performing artist. Ma Lan‚Äôs main stage performances were mostly written by Yu Qiuyu. The couple currently live mainly in Shanghai.

Club career =M≈†K ≈Ωilina= 2018‚Äì19 season Bo≈æen√≠k made his professional Fortuna Liga debut for ≈Ωilina against Nitra on 28 July 2018. ≈Ωilina won the game 2‚Äì1 and although Bo≈æen√≠k was replaced by Filip Balaj 73 minutes into the match, he scored the winning goal for the ≈†o≈°oni in the 54th minute, after an assist by Jakub Hol√∫bek.M≈†K ≈Ωilina ‚Äì FC Nitra 2‚Äì1 28 July 2018, futbalnet.sk Within a month of his debut, he also scored against AS Trenƒç√≠n and iClinic Sereƒè. Before the winter break he had scored 10 goals, including one against later champions Slovan Bratislava in a 2‚Äì5 defeat and 2 further goals against Nitra, in a 2‚Äì0 victory. He was named Fortuna Liga's player of the month for October 2018. He was also praised for his successful spell and was crowned one of the league's greatest talents after the autumn part of the 2018‚Äì19 season by experts in the media, as well as fans. On 1 December 2018, M≈†K had announced a contract extension until June 2022. In the spring part of the season, Bo≈æen√≠k struggled to reclaim his form from the previous months. Still, in the final round of the main part of the Fortuna Liga season, in the match against ≈ΩP ≈†port Podbrezov√°, Bo≈æen√≠k had replaced Filip Balaj in the 76th minute and scoring the decisive goal, to seal the 2‚Äì1 win for ≈Ωilina, less than a minute later. Since then, it took Bo≈æen√≠k 9 league fixtures to score again. He did score two goals in Slovnaft Cup, one in second-leg semi-final match against Zempl√≠n Michalovce and another one in the unsuccessful final match against FC Spartak Trnava (Bo≈æen√≠k was also one of the players who missed a penalty in the shoot-out). In the league, however, it took him two-and-a-half months to score again, scoring two against Ru≈æomberok in final match of the season, in a 4‚Äì2 win. Overally, Bo≈æen√≠k completed the season with 15 goals in 39 competitive games for ≈Ωilina. With 13 goals in the Fortuna Liga, he was the second best scorer of the season, behind Andra≈æ ≈†porar (29 goals). After the season, in early June, as Bo≈æen√≠k had been preparing for a double fixture against Jordan and Azerbaijan, it was reported that season's Belgian champions, K.R.C. Genk, have shown interest in both Bo≈æen√≠k and his national team team-mate and Viktoria Plze≈à midfielder, Patrik Hro≈°ovsk√Ω. ≈Ωilina had apparently requested a transfer fee of 4 million Eur. This would have made Bo≈æen√≠k ≈Ωilina's third most expensive departure and 4th in the history of Fortuna liga, only behind B√©nes, Hancko and Dubovsk√Ω, but ahead of players like Nemanja Matiƒá, Tom√°≈° Huboƒçan or Slovakia's second most capped national team player Miroslav Karhan. 2019‚Äì20 season Based on past season's performances, Bo≈æen√≠k was expected to rank among Fortuna Liga's leading top scorers in the new season as well. Instead, J√°n Bern√°t, a young, then 18 year old attacking midfielder, also playing for M≈†K ≈Ωilina, co-headed the top scorer's table until Round 8, with 5 goals to his name. In the same time period, Bo≈æen√≠k only scored two goals against Ru≈æomberok and Senica. His goal against Senica, in a 5‚Äì0 win of 31 August 2019, had contributed M≈†K's rise to the top of the Fortuna Liga table. Bo≈æen√≠k also managed to score against competition's novice, FK Pohronie, on 21 September 2019, securing the 2‚Äì1 victory, along with Filip Ka≈°a. This turned out to be Bo≈æen√≠k's last goal with the club, as he did not score in the leagues upcoming 7 fixtures. During this half-season spent at pod Dub≈àom, he recorded 3 goals in 16 league fixtures. At the same point in the previous season, he recorded 10 goals. He also made a single appearance in Slovnaft Cup, coming on as a tactical substitute to avoid an upset elimination, in a match against Odeva Lipany, playing in 3. Liga East. ≈Ωilina narrowly won 1‚Äì0, after a goal by Patrik Mysloviƒç. During a yellow-card suspension, Bo≈æen√≠k was also featured in a single 2. liga fixture against Kom√°rno (1‚Äì1), for M≈†K reserve squad, on 27 October 2019. He secured the point for M≈†K with a late equaliser. =Feyenoord= On 27 January 2020, Bo≈æen√≠k signed a 4¬Ω‚Äìyear contract with Dutch club Feyenoord for a fee ‚Ç¨4.6 million. Sporting Director Frank Arnesen described Bo≈æen√≠k as \\"a young but big talent who will be given the time to grow and develop here\\". As his preferred number 9 jersey was taken by Danish forward Nicolai J√∏rgensen, Bo≈æen√≠k had opted for number 19. While he did not feature in the KNVB Cup fixture against Fortuna Sittard on the following day, Bo≈æen√≠k marked his Eredivisie debut at De Kuip on 1 February 2020 against Emmen. Feyenoord won the game 3‚Äì0, after goals by Oƒüuzhan √ñzyakup, Nicolai J√∏rgensen and Luis Sinisterra. The last was replaced by Bo≈æen√≠k in the 82nd minute, with the final score already set. Still, despite the short play-time, it was noted that Bo≈æen√≠k managed to develop few chances to score. He scored his first goal for the club on 16 February 2020, putting Feyenoord up 3‚Äì4 in the 88th minute in the away game against PEC Zwolle to secure the three points. International career On 18 October 2018, during a press conference when former coach of the Slovak national team had explained his decision to resign, he referred to Bo≈æen√≠k as ' Roho≈æn√≠k ' (a village in the Malacky District of western Slovakia). Koz√°k claimed, that despite his talent, Bo≈æen√≠k was not yet ready for the national team, referring to apparent pressures from ≈Ωilina-aligned managers and interest groups. Bo≈æen√≠k repeatedly reacted very calmly to the incident, laughing it off as a mistake and declaring concentration on his play and performances. He even claimed, that at first he did not know that Koz√°k was referring to him. Bo≈æen√≠k made his debut for Slovak national team on 7 June 2019 in a friendly against Jordan, as a half- time substitute for Pavol ≈†afranko. Bo≈æen√≠k scored his first international goal against Hungary in a tense qualifying derby fixture on 9 September 2019. After a physical match, in which he suffered numerous tackles, Bo≈æen√≠k was commended by media and fans for the winning goal and the gameplay. On 13 October 2019, he was commended once again, after scoring the only goal of Slovakia in a friendly against Paraguay. The game was a farewell game for defenders Martin ≈†krtel, Tom√°≈° Huboƒçan and forward Adam Nemec. Nemec starred in the starting XI but was replaced by Bo≈æen√≠k after about half an hour. Slovakia's leading goal scorer of the previous years Nemec had said, that he sees great future and a possible replacement in Bo≈æen√≠k, adding that the youngster will require numerous similar games to mature. To score the goal, Bo≈æen√≠k utilised a pass from L√°szl√≥ B√©nes, but Slovakia merely tied the game 1‚Äì1. =International goals= :Scores and results list Slovakia's goal tally first. { class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" + International goals by date, venue, cap, opponent, score, result and competition - !scope=colNo. !scope=colDate !scope=colVenue !scope=colCap !scope=colOpponent !scope=colScore !scope=colResult !scope=colCompetition - !scope=row1  9 September 2019  Groupama Arena, Budapest, Hungary  align=center  4   align=center  2‚Äì1  align=center  2‚Äì1  UEFA Euro 2020 qualification - !scope=row2  13 October 2019  Teheln√© pole, Bratislava, Slovakia  align=center  6   align=center  1‚Äì0  align=center  1‚Äì1  Friendly - !scope=row3  16 November 2019  Stadion Rujevica, Rijeka, Croatia  align=center  7   align=center  1‚Äì0  align=center  1‚Äì3  rowspan=2  UEFA Euro 2020 qualification - !scope=row4  19 November 2019  ≈†tadi√≥n Antona Malatinsk√©ho, Trnava, Slovakia  align=center  8   align=center  1‚Äì0  align=center  2‚Äì0 } Honours Individual *Peter Dubovsk√Ω Award: 2019 References External links  M≈†K ≈Ωilina official club profile * Futbalnet profile * Fortuna Liga profile * Ligy.sk profile Category:1999 births Category:Living people Category:People from ≈Ωilina District Category:Slovak footballers Category:Slovakia youth international footballers Category:Slovakia under-21 international footballers Category:Slovakia international footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:M≈†K ≈Ωilina players Category:Feyenoord players Category:2.

Raised in Philadelphia in late 1864, the regiment enlisted for one year and was sent to the Army of the James during the Siege of Petersburg. During the Third Battle of Petersburg it assaulted Forts Gregg and Alexander, then pursued the retreating Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, fighting at Rice's Station and Appomattox Court House. Following the Confederate surrender at Appomattox, the regiment moved to Richmond, where it mustered out in late June 1865.  History  A newspaper recruiting advertisement for the regiment The regiment was organized at Camp Cadwalader near Philadelphia during August, September and October 1864, for a term of one year under the command of staff officer Colonel James C. Briscoe. It was also known as the Commercial Regiment, and many of its soldiers had previously served in other regiments, including Lieutenant Colonel Ambrose A. Lechler, former Colonel of the 176th Pennsylvania Infantry. The regiment was sent to the front in October and took positions on the extreme right of the Army of the James on the New Market Road at Deep Bottom Landing, joining the 1st Brigade of the 1st Division of X Corps. Shortly after fortifying its position, the 199th went into winter quarters with the army, during which it conducted training while also being employed in picket duty, fortification building, and road construction. In December it was transferred to the newly formed XXIV Corps, still with the 1st Brigade of the 1st Division. With strict discipline and sanitation, the regiment was capable of active service when the northern hemisphere spring arrived. The division crossed the James River on 28 March and moved southwards through the night to arrive in front of the Confederate fortifications on 29 March. The division participated in the Third Battle of Petersburg, during which it attacked Forts Gregg and Alexander on 2 April. The regiment attacked Fort Gregg on the right of the brigade, commanded by Brevet Brigadier General Thomas O. Osborn. Advancing in line of battle at the head of the division, the 199th was to the left of the 67th Ohio and the 39th Illinois. It counterattacked the Church Road with the brigade at 09:00, forcing back Confederate troops from a salient that they had gained in a counterattack earlier that day. At 13:00 the brigade was committed to the attack on Fort Gregg, advancing through a hail of fire. Briscoe was hit in the leg within the last 300 yards to the fort, but continued onward with others from the regiment into the ditch in front of the fort, partially filled with water. There, First Lieutenant Oliver Sproul of Company H planted the colors of the 39th Illinois in the parapet of the fort after the 39th's color bearer was shot. Along with other Union troops, the men of the regiment advanced into the fort and captured it. The regiment lost eighteen killed or mortally wounded, and 91 wounded; among the latter were six officers, including Briscoe and two company commanders. Briscoe was made a brevet brigadier general for his gallantry, and was promoted to command the brigade; he was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Robert P. Hughes. Following the breakthrough at Petersburg, the 199th pursued the retreating Confederate Army of Northern Virginia along the Southside Railroad to Burkeville and Appomattox. The regiment fought in skirmishes, and lost two killed and one wounded at the Battle of Rice's Station on 6 April, and two killed and eight wounded at the Battle of Appomattox Court House on 9 April. The division was moved to Richmond and encamped two miles north of the city shortly after the Confederate surrender at Appomattox. The regiment remained at the camp until it was mustered out on 28 June, with its recruits and Briscoe being transferred to the 188th Pennsylvania Infantry, which mustered out on 14 December. During its service, the regiment lost two officers and thirty men killed or died of wounds and 52 men to disease, out of a total enrollment of 1,462 officers and men.

He gained it by medicines derived from trees, roots, tubers and bulb of deep forests and legendary ball of mercury which possesses supernatural powers. They spend their lives searching for herbs to treat suffering humans and to attain longevity. They use the magic wand to grind the medicinal herbs and roots and any round flat stone found miles from anywhere are believed to be the Zawgyi's grinding stones. He always has a staff in his hand, which he would use during his walks especially in negotiating along very rugged footpaths. Zawgyi practices alchemy to become Weizza and attain immortal life, along with lesser attainments such as supranormal powers. The goal of this practice is to achieve the timeless state of the Weizza, who awaits the appearance of the future Buddha, Metteya. Costume Zawgyi are dressed in red from head to toe with a red hat and a magic wand in hand. There are only male Zawgyis. Mustache is an optional part of the costume. Zawgyi becomes a Weizza, he would change his dress to white and would change his trousers for a white Burmese longyi. Zawgyi dance and choreography Zawgyi dance is basically a happy dance to portray how he grinds medicines with the wand and how he finally created a magic pill. Therefore, nearing to the end of the performance, he performs this choreography where he holds the wand horizontally and jumps across it to show his success.

He is also known in his area as a Land Grabber in Domail and Lakki Marwat currently grabbing lands with the help of his front man Dr Alam Wazir. Early Life Sher Azam started his career as a government servant in Revenue authorities as a Patwari (An official who visits agricultural lands and maintains records of their ownership and tilling). This job is known for lax morals and abuse of power throughout Pakistan. He was quick to grab this opportunity by conducting himself as a morally corrupt and perverted man himself. Money trail of his immense wealth could be found in his exploits of grabbing lands of orphans and widows by tampering Revenue records. At the start of his career, he would find people in challenging circumstances with the help of Tehsil-Daar Syed Sabtain Shah and then pressurize his victims using the help of a sub-inspector Syed Qamber Ali Shah in Dera Ismail Khan. His gang of land mafia now always works in close coordination with the Revenue Authorities and support from the local police. His usual course of action is to find a piece of land owned by some poor citizen, usually nowadays in his own constituency near Bannu and Lakki Marwat, and then selling it off in small pieces to his numerous front men. Land Mafia Scandals When he was given the job of Labour Minister in PPP- ANP coalition government in KPK province between 2008-2013, it was as if he had won a lottery and a free license to do corruption as he wills. While continuing to grab land from people suffering multiple social and domestic challenges and lack of access to lawyers, he also started grabbing large swathes of government owned lands. In 2017, National Accountability Bureau (NAB) of Pakistan, filed a reference against him in relation with government land grabbing in the city of Peshawar, KPK. According to this reference Sher Azam Wazir, as Labour minister, with the help of his cronies grabbed land measuring 260 kanals at Mouza Shahi Bala sited near the provincial capital. https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/209700-NAB-to-file-reference-against-ex- minister-Sher-Azam-Wazir-others During Musharraf's era, a legislation was introduced and passed in the Pakistan's parliament making it mandatory for the law makers to be at least the graduate from a university. Sher Azam Wazir being only a semi-literate person who never even set foot in any higher education institute, produced his Bachelors certificate overnight claiming to be the holder of Bachelors of Business Administration from Institute of Management Sciences, Lahore. His claim was later challenged in courts, and the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan found that the degree was fake and bogus.https://www.thenews.com.pk/archive/print/248653-sher- azam%E2%80%99s-degree-again-declared-fake. His son Jahangir Azam Wazir, soon after becoming a government servant followed the footsteps of his father and supported the network of land mafia set up by his Sher Azam. In January 2020, he was transferred from his post of Deputy Commissioner of District Lakki Marwat on the charges of corruption and land grabbing. However, he is still a government servant as an (Officer on Special Duty) OSD, and waiting for his next opportunity to prey on the people of Dera Ismail Khan, Lakki Marwat and Bannu like a vulture.https://nation.com.pk/24-Jan-2020/kp-govt-reshuffles-top- bureaucrats In 2018, just before the general elections in Pakistan, Jahangir Azam Wazir was suspended by Azam Khan, the current Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan, for his involvement in political issues in Bannu district, where he in capacity of a government servant was shamelessly visiting the elders of the area to gain support for his father, Sher Azam Wazir in the upcoming elections .https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/327365-kp-officer-suspended-for-involvement- in-politics This would remind some readers of the story they read in school about the Turtle trying to save a scorpion from drowning, it goes like this; ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll sting me while I‚Äôm swimming and I‚Äôll drown.‚Äù ‚ÄúMy dear Turtle,‚Äù laughed the Scorpion, ‚Äúif I were to sting you, you would drown and I would go down with you. Now where is the logic in that?‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right!‚Äù cried the Turtle. ‚ÄúHop on!‚Äù The Scorpion climbed aboard and halfway across the river gave the Turtle a mighty sting. As they both sank to the bottom, the Turtle resignedly said: ‚ÄúDo you mind if I ask you something? You said there‚Äôd be no logic in your stinging me. Then why did you do it?‚Äù ‚ÄúIt has nothing to do with logic,‚Äù the drowning Scorpion sadly replied. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just my character.‚Äùhttps://ofthestory.wordpress.com/2015/08/30/scorpion-and-turtle- story/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CMy%20dear%20Turtle%2C%E2%80%9D%20laughed,would%20go%20down%20with%20you.&text;=%E2%80%9CIt%20has%20nothing%20to%20do,of%20whom%20you%20associate%20with.

She has also worked with Cassandra Miller, who, making use of Benjamin's 'down-to-earth, no-nonsense gritty focus' wrote for mira, which is an arrangement for violin of a transcription of an acoustic performance of Kurt Cobain singing Where did you sleep last night. Her work with composer Scott McLaughlin began with his string quartet, a metastable harmony (2012), written for the Quatuor Bozzini while Benjamin was a member, and was furthered with The Endless Mobility of Listening for violin and electronics. McLaughlin writes of the work: > This piece is based on the same string technique of drone-bowing on open > strings to reveal upper partials, with the listening aspect now shifted to > using a footswitch to trigger the electronics to ‚Äòcapture‚Äô the current > partial.

The species in this family have a cosmopolitan distribution in temperate and tropical areas and are found in marine and freshwater environments, typically in inshore, euryhaline areas with silt and sand substrates. The Oxudercidae includes 86 genera, which contain around 600 species. This family has many species which occur in fresh water, and a number of species found on wet beaches and are able to live for a number of days out of water. The family includes the mudskippers, which include species that are able to move over land with quite quickly. They have eyes located on the top of their heads on short stalks. They are capable of elevating or retracting them, and they can see well out of water. One species, Gillichthys mirabilis, usually stays in the water, but surfaces to gulp air when the oxygen levels in the water are low; it holds the air in its buccopharynx, which is highly vacularised to facilitate respiratory exchange.

Crawford Woods, was the first minister of the Adelaide Unitarian Christian Church, South Australia, serving from 1855 to 1889. History Woods was born in Woodville, a mile from Bangor, County Down, Ireland, the fourth child and second son son of (Presbyterian) Rev. Hugh Thean Woods and his wife Magdelene Campbell Woods, n√©e McClure. They had a small farm of and lived comfortably if frugally with a manservant, thanks to the income from the farm and a succession of boarders which supplemented his stipend of around ¬£167 p.a.. He was educated at a school in Bangor run by Mrs Blain, wife of Dr. Thomas Blain of the Royal Academic Institute , Belfast, followed by a school for girls run by the sisters Mecredy (accompanying his sister Maria), then another run by James MacMaster. His father next engaged as tutors for his family a young theology student named Robert Campbell, followed by a nephew William Woods, then Robert Montgomery, another theology student. In 1839 he enrolled at the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated BA in 1845, winning prizes in Greek and Modern Philosophy. He took a position in Downham Market, near Sandringham House, as assistant and tutor to the children of Dr. James Patterson, originally of \\"Ballymore, County Antrim\\" [sic, most likely Ballymoney]. Presbyterians in Ireland were much freer in their religious beliefs than those of England and having read Dr. Channing and attended lectures by the Rev. John Scott Porter Woods decided to become a Unitarian. His father was unconcerned, but mother was not sympathetic, with the result that he went as a Non-subscribing Presbyterian ministry student to the newly founded Queen's University Belfast, where he read Theology under Dr. Henry Montgomery and the Rev. John Scott Porter and studied Hebrew. He may have also studied medicine. He tutored the children of cotton baron John Leech of Gorse Hall in Cheshire for nearly four years, then briefly served as minister of a Presbyterian Church at Newtownards. He served as minister to the Unitarian church in Devonport, where he fell in love with Susan Perriman Harris, who he would later marry, then Northampton, St. Mark's Chapel, Edinburgh for nearly four years, and the Isle of Wight before answering a call to Adelaide, South Australia, where a small but influential group was building a church of their own. :On 1 July 1854 William Blyth, A. Sidney Clark, William Kay and five others advertised for people interested in forming a Unitarian congregation to meet at the Freemasons' Tavern on 11 July. Despite public notices in various newspapers every day in the preceding week, only twelve attended, but they resolved to appoint a minister as soon as one year's salary (¬£400) had been collected. This achieved, in October that year the committee authorised the British and Foreign Unitarian Association to select a suitable candidate, offering an additional ¬£200 for travelling and relocation expenses. Their choice was Rev. John Crawford Woods, of Newport, Isle of Wight. Woods and his wife arrived in South Australia aboard Quito on 19 September 1855 No mention of infant son. after a long (123 days), stormy, and eventful (the captain got so drunk in Bahia that he sailed out of the harbor into the teeth of a gale and tore the sails; the mate took over and the crew mutinied) voyage, and stayed for a time at \\"Hazelwood\\", the home of Francis and Caroline Clark and family. His first service was held at \\"Hazelwood\\", the second at the home of Edward Martin on Osmond Terrace, Norwood. From 14 October 1855 services were held in a room attached to Green's Exchange, and was well attended. The church was a success from the start, attracting many prominent figures, including Catherine Helen Spence, and the decision to erect a church building was made. A portion of city Section 302 on Wakefield Street was made over to the church by Dr. William Everard for a very modest sum,Many references have the land transaction as a gift. and the corner stone was laid on 23 December 1856. Woods took the first services on the morning and evening of Sunday 5 July 1857 to a large assembly. Prominent early supporters of the church were Dr. Charles Davies of North Adelaide, Henry Higginson of North Adelaide, John Howard Clark and Mrs Clark of Hazelwood, William Kay of Norwood, Dr. and William Everard, William Sanderson, Vernon Herford and James Allen. The church prospered from the start, largely due to Woods' oratory and thoughtful sermons. He officiated at many weddings in Wakefield Street, not all participants being Unitarians; secular Jews such as members of the Solomon family being a case in point, and most likely marriages between Catholics and Protestants, which in those days would not be countenanced by either. He also officiated at many weddings in secular spaces, J. M. Wendt being a well-known example. In March 1874 Woods returned to England aboard Collingrove for an extended holiday, visiting his brothers and renewing old acquaintances. Charles Lawrence Whitham, who arrived aboard Cyphrenea earlier that month, acted as locum tenens. They spent a year in Newport, Isle of Wight, where Woods officiated at the church. They returned to Adelaide aboard the clipper Torrens on her maiden voyage, in 1876 arriving in March 1876 and resumed serving the Adelaide congregation. It was during this period, in 1881, that the congregation peaked at 747 members. Catherine Helen Spence, who had been a regular member of the congregation from its inception, preached her first sermons at Wakefield Street in 1878 and filled in at the pulpit during Woods' occasional absences between 1884 and 1889. He resigned in 1887 after attendance at the evening service had dropped away to a considerable extent and a dispute arose as to the cause, (an alternative explanation was that it was on account of his declining health) but it was two years before a suitable replacement was found in the Rev. Robert Cooper Dendy of Tentereden, Kent, and Woods continued as pastor. He gave his last sermon on 18 May 1889, and on 20 May 1889 Woods and his wife left for England by the P.& O. steamer Parramatta. Again Woods revisited familiar places and old friends, and spent some time seeing the sights of Europe. They returned to Adelaide by the P.& O. steamer Victoria in 1892\\\\. Woods died 10 March 1906 at his home in Rochester Street, Knightsbridge. Other activities *Woods gave a great many lectures at Institutes in the countryside, for which he was paid ¬£2 plus travelling expenses by the Government. The subjects were usually of an enlightening or instructional non-sectarian nature, enhanced by Woods' sense of humour, and were well attended. In this way Woods was able to see a great deal of the Colony. *When the University of Adelaide was founded he was admitted BA ad eundem, and was appointed one of two University appointed Governors of the South Australian Institute along with Sir Samuel Way.

The club was named until 2018 after Consolat, a neighborhood located in La Calade, in the 15th arrondissement, north of Marseille. Founded in 1964 by the residents of Consolat, the club has been run by current club president Jean-Luc Mingallon since 1983. Mingallon pushed the team to success which has led to their promotion from the Division d‚ÄôHonneur in 1999. In 2006, the club reached the national amateur level of football with its promotion to CFA2. This promotion sparked new derbies with the reserve team of Olympique de Marseille and US Endoume. The desire to become ‚Äúthe second club of Marseille‚Äù was one step closer with the promotion to the CFA in 2011. Consolat won the CFA title in 2014, earning promotion to the Championnat National, the third tier of French football. They nearly were promoted to Ligue 2 during the 2015-2016 season, falling short only by a single point behind Amiens SC. They again missed out on possible promotion in the following season, finishing behind division rivals Paris FC due only to goal differential. In the summer of 2018, Consolat underwent a re-branding process and changed their name to Athl√©tico Marseille. Despite finishing 5th in the league, Athl√©tico Marseille were relegated to Championnat National 3 in 2019, due to financial issues. In 2020 the club secured top position in their group when the 2019‚Äì20 season ended prematurely, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, on 9 June 2020, the Commission R√©gionale de Contr√¥le des Clubs (CRCC) of the Ligue de M√©diterran√©e announced that the club would be administratively relegated to R√©gional 2 for financial irregularities. The club appealed, and on 6 July 2020 the appeals committee of the FFF's DNCG overruled this decision, reinstating the club to National 3, and re-presenting the case for promotion to the CRCC. The CRCC once again denied the club promotion on 15 July 2020. The club appealed again to the FFF and, on 27 July 2020, the appeals committee of the FFF's DNCG confirmed the promotion to National 2. Three days later, the disciplinary committee of the FFF announced that they were demoting the club back to National 3, due to the production of fraudulent documentation at the end of the 2018‚Äì19 season.

Ed.): Garser stories. Gars am Kamp. Thousands of years of cultural landscape (2014). Chapter 11: Architecture and Art in Gars , by Anton Ehrenberger, p. 381] He mainly designed schools for the city of Vienna and was involved in the construction of some residential buildings.  Biography  = Private = The Gach-Gr√§ff family included several artists. Richard Gach married Johanna Henke, daughter of the chemist Richard Henke. One of their daughters, Martina Maria Gach, a professor for art, married the artist Helmuth Gr√§ff, and was the mother of the artist Matthias Laurenz Gr√§ff. Gach was a member of the Schlaraffia society under the religious name \\"Knight of Kamp\\". = Professional = Richard Gach (right) and Gustav Peichl in Gars am Kamp (1990) Richard Gach completed the Salzburg HTL for Building Construction and in 1949 he studied architecture at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna in the class of Lois Welzenbacher. As a student he built the scale model for the construction of the Wiener Stadthalle at the request of the architect Roland Rainer.This circumstance was due to Gach's skill in building architectural models During his studies he became friends with architects such as Gustav Peichl, Friedrich Achleitner, Wilhelm Holzbauer, and Hans Puchhammer. He graduated in 1955 with a Mag. Arch. and began work in the architecture office of Wilhelm Hubatsch, with whom he later won several architectural competitions. After becoming an independent architect in 1958, Gach actively contributed to the construction of Viennese housing and schools. The Gach-designed Gangschule with 24 classes and two high schools comes from the \\"haze circle\\" of Hubatsch's school concepts.Friedrich Achleitner, Museum Moderner Kunst (Austria): Austrian Architecture in the 20th Century: A Guide in Three Volumes, Volume 3, Part 2, p. 186 This concept is typified by the residential complex Edergasse 1-3 in Vienna 21 and the two high schools Hernalser Gymnasium Geblergasse and Amerling-Gymnasium. In 1970, the former Esterhazypalais (Palais Kaunitz) was demolished for the construction of the Amerling Gymnasium. Built in 1970-1972, the new building with 24 classrooms and two sports halls corresponds to the common typology used in the construction of secondary schools in the late sixties, without any architectural respect for the environment. It was also important to him to build contemporary architecture, also in the context of church building. He planned the church building of Rigau at Abtenau (Salzburg) with Robert Posch in 1956.Norbert Mayr: Stadtb√ºhne und Talschluss: Baukultur in Stadt und Land Salzburg , p 279 (2006). The project failed because of the Pinzgau district authority.

On the reconstruction of the Salzburg Cathedral after 1945, p. 17 (2009) Richard Gach was also active in Lower Austria, as reflected in numerous construction projects such as the Aufbahrungshalle in Orth an der Donau, the Bundesgymnasium and Bundesrealgymnasium Amstetten (high school), the Sparkasse Mistelbach and the Hauptschule Gars am Kamp.

Production and procession  There are a number of improvement methods used in the local livestock processing and production fields. * Maintaining stability in the procession of livestock products * Meeting people‚Äôs demand for the livestock products by internal procession power * Establishing new agriculture areas During the recent years, more than 15 modern production complexes improved by leasing. They are Hachalmurad (Imishli district), Bayim Sarov (Samukh district), Balakurd (Goranboy district), Afatli (Agdam district), Agabayli (Aghjabadi district), Kharkhatan (Lankaran district), Qasimli (Masalli district), Mehdili (Barda district), Digah settlement (Absheron district).  Classification  = Cattle = Cattle and sheep are main species preferred by Azerbaijanis and considered the most productive livestock products in Azerbaijan. Meat procession is the second place in accordance with its value expression. This product does not meet local demand and its export level is low. Processed and canned meat are predominantly exported products in Azerbaijan. The convenient natural ‚Äì geographical and climatic condition influenced the development of the cattle farming in the country. Beef cattle breeding in Azerbaijan mainly developed in the areas where are mountainous. In these areas, animals should be intensively fattened at the end of the lactation. Their high fatigue rate is when they are 15 ‚Äì 18 months old. The buffalo husbandry in Azerbaijan takes about more than 10% of the all-beef cattle. Buffalo husbandry is used by both dairy and production in Azerbaijan. Karabakh, Mil ‚Äì Mugan, and Shirvan are mainly engaged areas for buffalo husbandry. ‚ÄúAzerbaijan‚Äù is considered as a homeland purebred of buffalo. During the 1970s ‚Äì 1980s, cross-breeding was carried out by ‚ÄúMurrah‚Äù breed in order to increase dairy and pure meat production. By this way, milk and meat production increased by 20% ‚Äì 30% and 10% - 15% respectively. Two methods are used in buffalo breeding in Azerbaijan: * True breeding ‚Äì by this way, homeland breed ‚ÄúAzerbaijan‚Äù is mated with same breed. * Cross breeding ‚Äì mating homeland breed with Indian ‚ÄúMurrah‚Äù breed for the increase of dairy production. After the liquidation of the public farms in 1996, all buffalos were privatized. 99% of buffalos are kept in farmer or family farms. There are about 30 buffalo breeding farms in the country. Azerbaijan Public Union was established for buffalo farmers in 2001 in order to improve farms and solve problems in this area. Zebu is also a specie of the domestic cattle that engaged in ancient times in the country. Azerbaijani zebu differs from zebus in other areas according to their typical form. They have black and black ‚Äì brown colors and resistant to local conditions and diseases. The pure meat of Zebus production is up to 60%. Azerbaijani zebus are particular for Lankaran ‚Äì Astara regions. Family farms are engaged in dairy cattle breeding in Azerbaijan. Holstein Friesian cattle species are used as a bred for increasing dairy production. = Sheep breeding = The existing sheep breeds belong to various species in Azerbaijan. Along with native sheep breeds, there are different breeds from parts of the world. According to the recent statistics, there are more than 8 million sheep and goats in the country. 70 thousand tons of meat and 17 thousand tons of wool are produced. Sheep mainly increased for consumption of meat, wool and dairy products. Obtained wool classified as rough, semi-rough, semi-delicate and delicate wool. Sheep breeding is common for all regions of the country but delicate wool sheep are raised in mountainous areas and foothills. Armenian Semicoarsewool is raised as a rough woolen breed and Merino is raised for delicate wool in Azerbaijan. Besides, Karabakh and Garadolak are mainly raised breeds in Azerbaijan. Compared to other breeds these sheep can walk approximately 18 ‚Äì 20 km per day. They are hot and dry weather resistant and quickly adapt to local conditions. However, breeds are resistant to tuberculosis and some other diseases, but frequently infect brucellosis, bruise, and mastitis. They show low productivity in the areas where are wet and swamp. Karabakh and Garadolak breed quickly. Farmers take about 120 ‚Äì 130 lambs from per 100 sheep. = Horse breeding = Karabakh horse As a result of national selection Karabakh and Azerbaijan, horse breeds (also called Dilbaz) are created in the country and these breeds are included in 260 cultivated species of the world. At the end of the XVIII and early XIX centuries, Dilbaz horses created on the basis of crossbreeding with Eastern breeds. These horses are distinguished with their broad forehead, short head, narrow nose, long waist and back from other horse breeds. Their legs are relatively high and height is 152 cm. They mainly used in sports and light trailers. Karabakh horses widespread in the south ‚Äì western regions such as Agdam, Barda, Baylagan, Agjabadi, Shusha, Khojali, Khojavand, Tartar, Jabrail, Kalbajar, and Fuzuli. Karabakh horses have been used for improving local breeds especially in Goranboy, Shamkir, Gadabay, Dashkasan, Goygol, Yevlakh, Tovuz districts, Guba ‚Äì Gusar and Shirvan regions since 1850s. Nowadays, Aghdam horse breeding factory is developed and a number of selective breeding programs applied. These breeding programs cover the years 2012 ‚Äì 2015. = Poultry = Chickens are predominantly used lying birds for egg and meat production in Azerbaijan. Over the recent years, about 100 million manats subsidiary were allocated for the improvement of the overall 15 broiler plants with procession capacity of 55 thousand tons of meat and about 250 million eggs. Statistics reveal that 64,4% of poultry meat and 45% of eggs were produced by industrial methods in 2014. Export of poultry products is regulated in accordance with decree 66 of the Ministers Cabinet of Azerbaijan dated April 21, 2009. = Beekeeping = In the recent years, the number of bee families have been risen to 238 thousand in Azerbaijan. A number of improved programs implemented in order to reach 310 000 bee families in 2020. 61% of the vegetation that bees take nectar accounted by Azerbaijan in the South Caucasus. This geographical condition increases the availability of beekeeping in the country. Every year, honey exhibitions and sale fairs are organized in order to expand the market scale of the beekeepers. The existing bee species are ‚ÄúGray Caucasus‚Äù, Yellow Caucasus\\", ‚ÄúGapaktapa‚Äù and ‚ÄúGonagkand‚Äù in Azerbaijan.

Loub√®re was governor of French Guiana from 14 May 1871 to 29 September 1877. Loub√®re was strong-willed and active, and was known as a great builder. He constructed roads with embankments, bridges, public buildings, sewers and a stone barracks, all of which were still mostly intact at the end of the World War II. He also established schools and supported improvements to crops and livestock through breeding. He was involved in the introduction of Eucalyptus trees from Australia to French Guiana. Loub√®re used felons transported to French Guiana to work on improving communications in the colony.

He showed very good form as a two-year-old in 2009 when he won two races including the Champagne Stakes. He failed to live up to his promise in the first half of the following year but then returned to form to win the Celebration Mile and then defeated a very strong field to take the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes. He never won again and was retired at the end of 2011. He was a headstrong and unpredictable racehorse, breaking out of the starting stalls on one occasion and biting one of his rivals on another. He made a very promising start to his stallion career, siring the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes winner Poet's Word in his first season at stud. Background Poet's Voice is a bay horse with no white markings who was bred by Sheikh Mohammed's Dalham Hall Stud and raced in the colours of the Sheikh's Godolphin organisation. He has trained by Saeed bin Suroor, whose stable is based at Newmarket, Suffolk, but typically relocates to Dubai in winter. He was ridden in all but one of his races by Frankie Dettori. He was sired by Dubawi a top-class son of Dubai Millennium, whose wins included the Irish 2,000 Guineas and the Prix Jacques Le Marois. At stud, Dubawi has been a highly-successful breeding stallion, siring major winners such as Monterosso, Al Kazeem, Makfi, Lucky Nine and Night of Thunder. Poet's Voice's dam Bright Tiara won one minor race in the United States and was later bought for $3,000,000 by John Ferguson Bloodstock on behalf of Sheikh Mohammed. Her dam Expressive Dance was a half-sister to General Assembly. Racing career =2009: two-year-old season= Poet's Voice made his debut in a seven furlong maiden race at Newmarket Racecourse on 8 July in which he started at odds of 6/1 and finished third behind Elusive Pimpernel and Timely Jazz. Just over three weeks later, over the same course and distance, he recorded his first success: starting the 4/9 favourite, he took the lead approaching the final furlong and quickly went clear of his rivals, winning by ten lengths despite being eased down before the finish. The colt was then moved up in class and started 7/4 favourite for the Group 3 Acomb Stakes at York Racecourse in August but compromised his chances by breaking out of the starting stalls and having to be reloaded. When the race began he fought Dettori's attempts to restrain him and pulled his way to the front. He hung to the left in the last quarter mile, was overtaken in the closing stages, and finished third behind Elusive Pimpernel and Emerald Commander. Despite his defeat at York, Poet's Voice was stepped up again in class for Group 2 Champagne Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse on 12 September and was made the 11/8 favourite against six opponents. He led from the start, accelerated approaching the final furlong and won by three quarters of a length from the Aidan O'Brien-trained Viscount Nelson. In the Group 1 Middle Park Stakes at Newmarket in October, the colt was dropped back in distance to six furlongs and started the 15/8 favourite. After leading for most of the way he was outpaced in the closing stages and finished fourth of the five runners behind Awzaan. =2010: three-year-old season= On his first two races as a three-year-old, Poet's Voice ran without success in France: he finished eighth behind Lope de Vega in the Poule d'Essai des Poulains on 16 May and ninth to Joanna in the Prix de la Porte Maillot on 3 July. At Salisbury Racecourse on 12 August he started a 16/1 outsider for the Sovereign Stakes but belied his odds as he finished strongly and failed by only a nose to overhaul the pace-setting Sea Lord. He was partnered by Ted Durcan at Salisbury, but Dettori resumed the ride when the colt contested the Celebration Mile at Goodwood Racecourse and started the 2/1 second choice in the betting behind the five-year-old Main Aim, a two-time winner of the John of Gaunt Stakes. After being restrained at the rear of the four-runner field he took the lead a furlong out and drew away to win \\"comfortably\\" by four lengths. The Group 1 Queen Elizabeth II Stakes over one mile at Ascot Racecourse on 25 September attracted an international field, with Poet's Voice starting the 9/2 third choice in the betting behind Makfi and Rip Van Winkle. The other five runners were Beethoven, Hearts of Fire (Gran Criterium), Red Jazz (European Free Handicap), Bushman (Diomed Stakes) and Air Chief Marshal (Minstrel Stakes). Air Chief Marshal set the pace for his stablemate Rip Van Winkle with Poet's Voice retrained at the rear of the field before making a forward move on the outside two furlongs from the finish. The final furlong saw a three way struggle between Rip Van Winkle on the rail, Poet's Voice on the outside and the 40/1 outsider Red Jazz between horses, resulting in a photo finish. Poet's Voice was adjudged to have won by a nose from Rip Van Winkle, with Red Jazz half a length away in third. After the race Dettori said \\"The horse was in tremendous form coming into the race, and it means so much to win these big races for Godolphin at Ascot, which is a special course for me. Saeed was confident he would run great. I thought we had a few pounds to find on form, but Saeed was right\\". On his final appearance of the year he was moved up in distance for the Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Newmarket on 16 October but made little impression and came home ninth of the ten runners behind Twice Over. In the 2010 World Thoroughbred Rankings Poet's Voice was given a rating of 122, making him the 23rd best racehorse in the world. =2011: four-year-old season= In the winter of 2010/11 Poet's Voice was sent to Godolphin's training base in Dubai. On his first run of the year he was narrowly beaten by Wigmore Hall in the Jebel Hatta on turf at Meydan Racecourse on 3 March, with Presvis in third. Later that month he was switched to the synthetic Tapeta surface at the same venue for the Dubai World Cup but came home last of the fourteen runners, more than 20 lengths behind the winner Victoire Pisa. After a lengthy break, Poet's Voice returned to the track in August when he attempted to repeat his 2010 success in the Celebration Mile. He started favourite but after biting one of his opponents during the race he finished last of seven in a race won by Dubawi Gold. In his twoother tarts that year he finished third to Ransom Note in the Joel Stakes at Newmarket in September and sixth to Frankel in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes on the 15th of October. Stud record Poet's Voice was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at Dalham Hall. He produced two individual Group 1 winners being Poet's Word, (Prince of Wales's Stakes, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes) and Trap For Fools (LKS Mackinnon Stakes). Death Poet's Voice died aged 11 after suffering a heart attack at Dalham Hall Stud. Saeed bin Suroor, who trained Poet's Voice throughout his racing career, said, \\"I am very sad to hear of the death of Poet's Voice and my condolences go to His Highness Sheikh Mohammed and everyone connected to him at Darley. He was a pleasure to train, always relaxed in his work and gave his best throughout his career. His victory in the QEII S. was very special indeed.\\" Pedigree References Category:2007 racehorse births Category:2018 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 10-a ","title":"Poet's Voice"},{"id":"58022063","text":"Mads Lauritsen (born 14 April 1993) is a Danish footballer who plays for Viborg FF on loan from Vejle Boldklub.

Crane was the son of Richard Teller Crane, Jr., and Florence Crane, and grandson of Richard T. Crane, founder of Crane Co.. He is best known for the Crane Pacific Expedition of 1928-1929, which he funded, and which took place aboard his yacht Illyria. The expedition was sponsored by the Chicago Museum of Natural History and staffed by a number of scientists and specialists. It left Boston Harbor on November 16, 1928, stopped at Port- au-Prince, Haiti, and then at the Panama Canal. It departed the canal on December 30, 1928, for stops at the Cocos Islands and Galapagos Islands, where it made extensive collections of local fish and birds. It then continued to the Marquesas group, the Tuamotu Archipelago, Tahiti, Bora Bora, Fiji, New Hebrides, Solomon Islands, New Guinea, Borneo, and onwards, in what was ultimately a circumnavigation of the globe. On the expedition, Crane met Cathalene Isabella Parker Browning (1904-1987), step-daughter of the marine superintendent of the Panama Canal. They married in 1929, at which time he adopted his wife's daughter, Cathalene Parker Browning (1923-2005), from her previous marriage. After the couple divorced in 1940, he disinherited his stepdaughter (she later gave birth to American actor and comedian Chevy Chase), and his ex-wife subsequently married the Austrian painter Rudolf Anton Bernatschke. Crane himself remarried in 1955 to Minescule (Min√©) Sawahara in a Shinto ceremony in Japan; she later established the Mrs. Cornelius Crane Scholarship at the Juilliard School.

The paper was founded in 1973 by Michael Goldstein (1938‚Äì2018). History The first issue was published on October 11, 1973. Initially published in eight pages, it eventually grew to over 100 pages and competed with The Village Voice. The paper's offices were at 111 Spring Street, Manhattan although the earliest issues showed the address of Goldstein's apartment on the masthead. Circulation was reported as 25,000 ‚Äì 30,000. The paper was sold to Associated Newspaper Group in 1979. In the fall of 1981, ANG announced plans to close or sell the paper by February 1982. Although there were negotiations with possible purchasers which continued beyond the original deadline, continuing losses ($1.7 million in the previous year) forced ANG to shut down the paper in March. The recent unionization of the paper was cited a factor in the decision. The last issue dated March 10‚Äì16, 1982 had 40,000 copies printed. Influence and style Three years after it was launched, The New York Times reported that the SoHo Weekly News was the second largest English-language weekly in the city, was being positioned as a direct competitor of The Village Voice, and was sold at 400 newsstands in New York City. After the paper shut down, the New York Times ran an op-ed which called the SoHo News the \\"alternative to alternative papers\\". The paper's contributors were described as an eccentric mix of \\"neo-conservatives and Marxists, radical feminists and hedonistic libertines, chronic potheads and antidrug crusaders\\". The paper was an outspoken critic of the commercialization and gentrification of SoHo, the neighborhood where it was located and concentrated its coverage. Topics covered included a review of East Village drug merchants; the piece described various brands of heroin and cocaine that were available, their street names, and commented on the relative quality.  New music coverage  The SoHo News was known for its coverage of new musical artists in downtown New York. In 1975, the SoHo Weekly News was one of the first papers to interview The Ramones. In 1978, they ran an interview with the Talking Heads.  Self- mutilation event  On November 26, 1979, 27-year-old Manhattan resident Henry Benvenuti walked into the SoHo Weekly News office and asked to see art editor Gerald Marzonati. After being told he could not see Mr. Marzonati, Benvenuti took out a hatchet, stated that, \\"I'm doing this in the name of art\\", chopped off two of his fingers, and walked out of the office, leaving the fingers behind. Benvenuti and his severed fingers were taken to Bellevue Hospital. Doctors were unable to reattach the fingers.  Alumni  Many SoHo News staff went on to have significant careers after the paper shut down. Noteworthy alumni include: * Sasha Anawalt, dance writer * Richard Corliss, writer *Christopher Cox, writer, photographer, editor * Danny Fields, columnist * Annie Flanders, style editor * Peter Frank, art critic * Ralph Gardner Jr., writer *Timothy Greenfield-Sanders, photographer *Kim Hastreiter, style editor * Cynthia Heimel, writer * Ira Kaplan, music critic * Michael Musto, writer * Tim Page, news editor * Jane Perlez, reporter * John Perreault, art critic * Bill Plympton, political cartoonist * Charles Ruas, literary critic * Jill Schary Robinson, writer * Ken Tucker, freelance reviewer * Judd Tully, art reviewer * Bruce Weber, fashion photographer * Ron Whyte, arts and book review editor * Peter Zummo, music reviewer  References   External links  * SoHo Weekly News ‚Äì New York in the 70s, Allan Tannenbaum photo gallery Category:Alternative weekly newspapers published in the United States Category:1973 establishments in New York (state) Category:1982 disestablishments in New York (state) Category:Defunct newspapers published in New York City ","title":"SoHo Weekly News"},{"id":"58022359","text":"Captain Davy (d. late 1700s) was an eighteenth-century Maroon officer at Scott's Hall who gained notoriety by killing the leader of Tacky's Revolt, the most dangerous slave rebellion in eighteenth-century Jamaica. Tacky's Revolt In the 1760 slave rebellion, also known as Tacky's War, the British colonial authorities summoned the Jamaican Maroons to fight alongside local militias against Tacky and his slave rebels. Maroon contingents were commanded by the white superintendent of Moore Town, Charles Swigle, and the names of Maroon officers reporting to him were Clash and Sambo from Moore Town, Quaco and Cain from Charles Town, Jamaica, and Cudjo and Davy from Scott's Hall (Jamaica).Michael Siva, After the Treaties: A Social, Economic and Demographic History of Maroon Society in Jamaica, 1739-1842, PhD Dissertation (Southampton: Southampton University, 2018), pp. 71-3. Upon defeating the revolt, Davy and a group of Maroons hunted down Tacky and his loyal lieutenants. Tacky and his men went running through the woods being chased by the Maroons and their legendary marksman, Davy. While running at full speed, Davy shot Tacky and cut off his head as evidence, for which he would be richly rewarded.http://jamaicans.com/tackys_rebellion/Tacky above some heroes, Daily Gleaner, 13 October 2013. http://jamaica- gleaner.com/gleaner/20131013/focus/focus6.html Retrieved 5 April 2019.Encyclopaedia of Antislavery and Abolition, Vol. 2, edited by Peter Hinks (Westport: Greenwood Press, 2007), p. 462. https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3UXQs0uO0VMC&pg;=PA462&lpg;=PA462&dq;=davy+maroon+tacky&source;=bl&ots;=ULfsbV- XJ9&sig;=ACfU3U0NZuVDTbR4CJERonnq2pKOxEeOeA&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwjWiKb597jhAhVsZhUIHQg1CHA4ChDoATAGegQIBxAB#v=onepage&q;=davy%20maroon%20tacky&f;=false Retrieved 5 April 2019.Junius Rodriquez, Encyclopaedia of Emancipation and Abolition in the Transatlantic World. https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MnysBwAAQBAJ&pg;=PT1649&lpg;=PT1649&dq;=davy+maroon+tacky&source;=bl&ots;=37SI1-KdoF&sig;=ACfU3U3D2lzLXv1mtKLLEXEW_QRq8Jfiyw&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwiY59CY- bjhAhUwVRUIHSK6CB44ChDoATALegQICBAB#v=onepage&q;=davy%20maroon%20tacky&f;=false Retrieved 5 April 2019.Michael Craton, Testing the Chains (New York: Cornell University Press, 1982), p. 136. Hunting runaway slaves The treaties of 1739 and 1740 required the Maroons to hunt runaway slaves, for which they received rewards from the colonial authorities. After making his name killing Tacky, Davy found that many planters were willing to pay him to hunt down their runaway slaves. Davy then made a considerable living leading teams of Maroons in hunting runaways.Siva, After the Treaties, pp. 103-4.

Death While Davy lived, he was one of the Maroon officers who reported to the white superintendent in Scott's Hall. However, when he died, sometime in the eighteenth century, the superintendent no longer saw the need to appoint a Maroon officer to succeed him, and the Scott's Hall Maroons reported directly to the superintendent for the rest of the century.Siva, After the Treaties, p. 73.

More specifically, it allows inter agency referral - the referral instructor is not necessarily a member of the same certification agency as the initiating instructor. The program was developed in 1998 by educators, risk managers and attorneys for the diver certification agencies International Diving Educators Association (IDEA), National Association of Scuba Diving Schools (NASDS), National Association of Underwater Instructors (NAUI), Professional Diving Instructors Corporation (PDIC), Scuba Schools International (SSI) and YMCA SCUBA Program based on industry training standards. The system established referral paperwork, procedures and a minimum list of skills to be performed. The URP enrollment procedures and instructor qualifications are managed by each training agency for their members. The referral instructor must review and verify that the candidate's medical history form has been completed, conduct the required open water skills exercises, and assess the diver on the specified diving skills, then complete the paperwork. If performance was satisfactory a temporary certification may be issued. The completed form is returned to the initiating instructor to issue the certification. PADI instructors can also accept students for certification dives using the Universal Referral Program form. The advantages of the URP are that the learner diver can complete the theory and confined water training near home, which should be more economical in time and cost, then get the open water training in a vacation environment, where the water conditions are likely to be more pleasant, and can be followed by further recreational dives. The hometown study environment is found to be more conducive to learning than the vacation environment, and referral students tend to have a better grasp of the theoretical side of the training. Completing the theory and pool training at the local dive shop saves on vacation time and allows the learner more time to practice and develop skills as the time pressure is reduced. They also have the opportunity to become involved in the local diving community. Disadvantages of the Referral Program are that there may be a delay between the initial part of the course and the open water dives. The time allowed varies from 6 months to a year, depending on the certification agency, and this is long enough to forget some skills and knowledge, so a refresher may be required. It is preferable to do both parts within a short period, and this may be logistically complicated, and the weather conditions may not be conducive to this schedule. The change between instructors may not be helpful, as they may differ in style and personality, and there may be small differences in technique which could cause confusion, but could also provide a better range of experience. It is also likely that rented equipment will be unfamiliar at the referral site. An unfamiliar set of equipment should be tested in benign conditions where adjustments can be made in comfort and safety, which requires more time. There may also be an increased cost because of the split between two service providers, the additional paperwork and other overheads and sometimes the necessity to repeat training of forgotten skills.

There was a stand-off as the Maroons stood by Grant, but the white Superintendent-General, Robert Brereton, persuaded the Moore Town Maroons to hand over Grant, who stood trial at Spanish Town. However, much to the surprise of local planters, Grant was acquitted of the murder of Townshend.Siva, After the Treaties, pp. 75-6.R.C. Dallas, History of the Maroons, Vol. 1, p. 130. Hunter of runaway slaves Grant returned to Charles Town, where he rose through the ranks of the Maroon officer class, eventually becoming a major and nominally leader of the Maroon town, a post he held for many years.Siva, After the Treaties, p. 76. In 1781, Grant was a part of the Maroon party that successfully hunted and killed the notorious leader of a community of runaway slaves, Three Fingered Jack.Siva, After the Treaties, pp. 113-5.Benjamin Moseley, A Treatise on Sugar (London: G.G. and J. Robinson, 1799), pp. 175-6. Grant made a career hunting runaway slaves for neighbouring planters, but in 1797 he lodged a complaint about the length of time it took for the colonial authorities to pay him his rewards.Siva, After the Treaties, pp. 106-7. Second Maroon War During the Second Maroon War of 1795-6, the Windward Maroons remained neutral, but the governor, Alexander Lindsay, 6th Earl of Balcarres, ordered Grant to lead a party of Charles Town Maroons to Kingston to await his orders. However, an obeah man advised Grant that Balcarres planned to deport them, and Grant, suspicious of the governor, led his men back to their Maroon town in the Blue Mountains (Jamaica). Balcarres later admitted that he had indeed planned to deport the Windward Maroons.Siva, After the Treaties, p. 139.Dallas, History of the Maroons, Vol. 1, pp. 234-5Lord Lindsay, Lives of the Lindsays; or, A Memoir of the Houses of Crawford and Balcarres (London: John Murray, 1858),Vol. III, p. 102n. From the 1790s until his death, Grant was the leading Maroon officer in Charles Town, first as a major and then promoted to colonel.Siva, After the Treaties, p. 272. Later life and death In 1807, the colonial authorities exposed a slave conspiracy, and one of the informers claimed that the Charles Town Maroons were conspirators. Grant, who was the elderly leader of Charles Town, denied the charges. William Anderson Orgill, the magistrate who investigated the case, dismissed the evidence of the slave conspirators, and chose to believe Grant's expressions of loyalty.Siva, After the Treaties, p. 195. Sam Grant died in 1808.

The style is often used in erotic manga, anime (), and video games ().  History  Also known as the O-Face, the term dates at least as far back as the early 1990s. Pornographic magazines used the word to describe the facial expressions of female live-action porn actresses during orgasm. In the same context, was used in some postings at 2Channel and its sister community for adult content, BBSPink, as well as in pornographic videos at adult e-commerce platforms in the early 2000s. In the midst of the 2000s, use of the term increased, and the drawing style became rather conventionalized and started spreading throughout the culture. In 2008, the first -themed comics anthology, A-H-E, was released. In the 2010s, major publishers produced more -themed comic anthologies. By that time, the facial expression was featured in regular pornographic videos during the popularization of fetishes in the real-life sex industry. Additionally, -like exaggerated facial expressions sometimes are featured in normal anime and manga works, in a non-sexual context.  Description  Emoji with typical ahegao expression Typical characteristics are rolled or crossed eyes, a hanging tongue, and flushed cheeks. A character's overall face shape may also be distorted in scenes. Depictions of are often drawn intentionally exaggerated to create a surreal effect. An face of various levels of distortion is used to depict different grades of sexual arousal indicates that the pleasure experienced is so powerful that the character loses control of their facial expression. While is often used in pornographic manga, anime, and videogames, it is not exclusively a term of . A number of non-adult works feature faces, often in a porn-parodying manner.  Etymology  The first part of the term, (katakana: ; not representable in kanji) is an abbreviation for (), an onomatopoeia for 'pant' or 'moan'. The second part, or () is kanji and is Japanese for 'face'. Thus, can be interpreted as 'moaning or panting face', or more loosely as 'weird face'. Another term which is similar to is () meaning 'coming [i.e. orgasmic] face'. The difference between and art style is the more realistic drawing used for , found in relatively more mainstream works.  Internet meme and social network  e-girl's expression According to an article from adult gaming site Nutaku, in combination with the peace sign became an Internet meme in Japan, known as \\" double peace\\" (). In 2018, Belle Delphine drew coverage from various media outlets for her Instagram modeling which often featured her ahegao expressions.  Ahegao clothing  In 2015, an image by the hentai artist Hirune depicting various anime characters with the ahegao face circled the internet. On 16 March, 2016, the image was recorded as being used in South Korea phone cases, pillows and bags. Later that year, the pictures appeared on clothing. In May 2017, such images started appearing in western fashion, the clothes depicting among other works an image from the hentai Danke Dankei Revolution by Asanagi. This version is now sold by English-language hentai publisher Fakku. The clothes have sparked debate about whether the depictions on the clothing is sexist. = Ban of Ahegao clothing = In January 2020 several Anime Conventions throughout the United States banned Ahegao clothing on their grounds. Visitors wearing those clothes are forbidden to enter the event. This led to a controversial discussion in the worldwide Anime community. = Trademark registration and lawsuit = The Chinese company Shenzhen Guangcai Trading filed a trademark registration for the term ‚Ä≤Ahegao‚Ä≤ in September 2018 and got approved by the United States Patent and Trademark Office on April 23, 2019. On July 27, 2020 Jacob Grady CEO of hentai publisher Fakku! announced to contest the trademark registration and accused the company of using stolen artwork.

Early life and education Kathleen Mary Josephine O'Flaherty was born in Mayfield, Enniscorthy, Co. Wexford to Bernard Joseph O'Flaherty and his wife, Frances Mary Lewis. Her father was a prominent solicitor in the town. She was educated by the Ursuline convent, St Mary's, Waterford. After finishing secondary school O'Flaherty spent a year at the Universit√© Catholique de Lille before going on to University College Cork where she graduated in 1938 with a BA in English and French. While there she was the first graduate to be awarded the French government medal and also won the Peel memorial prize. O'Flaherty continued her studies in UCC gaining her master's for a dissertation on A. E. Housman in 1939. Her thesis supervisor at the time was Daniel Corkery. Though she then achieved the travelling studentship from the National University of Ireland, O'Flaherty was unable to use it due to the outbreak of World War II. She went on to gain her Ph.D in 1943 with a dissertation on Fran√ßois-Ren√© de Chateaubriand. Career After completing all her college degrees, O'Flaherty took a part-time position in the college and also taught in the Cork school founded by Mary and Eithne MacSwiney. She also wrote a number of books in these first few years including Voltaire: myth and reality (1945) and Paul Claudel and ‚ÄòThe tidings brought to Mary‚Äô (1948). In 1945 O'Flaherty took up a position as assistant editor of Cork University Press working closely with her mentor Alfred O'Rahilly who was president of UCC. She worked there until 1953. Her own publications were on French interests and she was published in several journals. O'Flaherty shared her home from this point on with a fellow French lecturer Yvonne Servais. They lived together for the rest of their lives. They worked on new undergraduate and postgraduate programmes for the University. O'Flaherty was promoted to lecturer in 1954 and to a readership in 1968. In 1970 she became the professor of French. She began to increase her writing output and published several new books. O'Flaherty and Servais lived in Rosscarbery, Co. Cork but spend significant time in Paris every year. They built up an excellent library, left to UCC when they died. In 1972 O'Flaherty was made a chevalier in the Ordre national du m√©rite by the French government. Servais died after a brief illness in June. O'Flaherty died in the Bon Secours Hospital, Cork on 21 July 1994.

He is best known for his infomercials that contained alternative health claims and his work with professional football players including Tom Brady and other members of the New England Patriots. Education and early career  Guerrero received a master's degree in traditional Chinese medicine from Samra University in Los Angeles, California, an institution that closed in 2010 after the state of California dissolved the Bureau of Private Postsecondary and Vocational Education board in 2007, which had provided the school's accreditation. (Aspects sourced to Introduction and About the Author sections). After graduating, Guerrero opened his own health treatment practice in 1996, and soon began working with individual professional athletes. 2004 book In 2004, Guerrero wrote a book called In Balance for Life: Understanding & Maximizing Your Body's pH Factor. The book promoted what he called a \\"nutritional supplement program that will take your health to the next level\\", with a \\"14-Day Diet Plan to quick-start your journey to vibrant vitality\\". In the book, he said the principles of the program were \\"easy to understand, and even easier to implement\\", and said \\"In fact, the principles that support it have been scientifically verified time and time again by researchers throughout the world. For the most part, however, they remain all but ignored by conventional and alternative health- care providers alike. As a result, our society is increasingly burdened with health-care problems.\\" The book referred to \\"the important role that the pH Factor plays in health and overall balance of the body\\" and said that \\"unhealthy pH levels‚Äïa disruption of proper acid-alkaline balance‚Äïare at the root of all disease conditions\\". Infomercials and sanctioning by the FTC In 2005, Guerrero was sanctioned by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for falsely presenting himself as a doctor and claiming to be able to cure cancer, AIDS, multiple sclerosis, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, and Parkinson's disease using a dietary supplement called \\"Supreme Greens\\". He had made these claims in infomercials on the channels Paramount Network and We TV. He claimed to have conducted extensive scientific studies of the benefits of his program with 200 patients that had been diagnosed as terminally ill before his treatments, but he later admitted that no such studies existed. The FTC fined him and barred him for life from ever again presenting himself as a doctor or from ever again marketing Supreme Greens or any substantially similar product as an effective treatment for any disease. Barrie Cassileth, Ph.D., the founder of the Integrative Medicine Service at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, who helped in the FTC investigation, referred to his practices as \\"just out and out quackery\\". She said that a major danger of such useless treatments is that they may delay patients from seeking proper evidence-based medical care, and that \\"this is fatal for many patients\\". She said \\"The organizations and people who make these claims and produce these false treatments really are doing something horrific.\\" He later founded a new company called 6 Degree Nutrition, which marketed various nutritional supplements including a product called Neurosafe. Neurosafe was called \\"a seatbelt for your brain\\", and was claimed to protect its users \\"from the consequences of sports-related traumatic brain injury\\". The product was advertised as being endorsed by prominent professional football players that had experienced concussions, with a claim that \\"When used consistently, NeuroSafe helps to dramatically improve recovery from head trauma by providing the brain the nutrients it needs to repair itself.\\" Wes Welker, a wide receiver who had suffered repeated concussions, was quoted as saying \\"NeuroSafe is essential. It keeps me safe. I've seen what concussions do to people. With NeuroSafe I know it's protecting what my helmet can't.\\" Champion quarterback Tom Brady was quoted saying \\"NeuroSafe makes me feel comfortable that if I get a concussion I can recover faster and more fully. There is no other solution on the market today that can do what NeuroSafe does. It's that extra level of protection that gives me comfort when I'm out on the field.\\" The FTC intervened again in 2012, reaching a settlement with Guerrero that resulted in closure of the company and the cessation of the marketing of the product. The Boston Globe reported that Guerrero also had \\"a long history of financial troubles, bankruptcies, and legal entanglements\\". He was sued twice for allegedly defrauding investors in his health product business enterprises of hundreds of thousands of dollars in investment funds, and resolved the cases with settlements under undisclosed terms. Work with football players Guerrero has treated a number of professional football players, and is especially closely associated with Tom Brady, a quarterback for the New England Patriots. Brady refers to Guerrero as his \\"body coach\\" and \\"body engineer\\", and has said Guerrero \\"has been a huge part of what I do\\" and is a \\"huge, huge reason why I'm still playing\\". In addition to Brady, Guerrero has worked with nearly every player for the Patriots, particularly including Danny Amendola, Jacoby Brissett, Julian Edelman, Jimmy Garoppolo, Rob Gronkowski, Duron Harmon, Chris Hogan, Ty Law, and Willie McGinest. In December 2017, it was estimated that Guerrero was treating about 20 of the current Patriots players. The dietary and training techniques espoused by Guerrero and Brady have also been influential with other NFL players outside of the Patriots. As in Guerrero's 2004 book, aspects of Guerrero's dietary guidelines are phrased in terms of pH balance, with Brady saying he has a primarily alkaline diet that is 80 percent alkaline and 20 percent acidic. The diet is mostly vegan while avoiding foods that are claimed to cause inflammation, including tomatoes, peppers, mushrooms, and eggplants. Earlier in his career, Guerrero also worked with LaDainian Tomlinson and Keenan McCardell of the San Diego Chargers. Guerrero and Brady have become collaborators and business partners in various ventures branded as \\"TB12\\" (with \\"TB\\" being the initials for Tom Brady, and 12 his jersey number as a player for the Patriots). Together they created a peak performance website TB12Sports.com and opened a facility in 2013 called the TB12 Sports Therapy Center next to Gillette Stadium, the home of the New England Patriots. Guerrero helped Brady develop a health program that Brady wrote about in a 2017 book, The TB12 Method. Guerrero and Brady also developed \\"The TB12 Nutrition Manual\\", a line of TB12-branded snacks, protein bars, and prepared meals, and a line of TB12 workout gear and clothing (including \\"recovery pajamas\\" that are said to help the wearer recover from physical exertion and trauma). The practices of Guerrero and the TB12 Center were investigated by several Massachusetts state agencies in 2013, but the agencies took no enforcement action, partly due to regulatory exceptions granted for work that was considered massage therapy. In 2014, after an allegation that he was practicing physical therapy without a license, he was sent a letter instructing him to abide by state regulations when supervising the work of licensed therapists. Although Guerrero has treated many members of the New England Patriots, there has been substantial friction with the Patriots' management and training staff over his involvement, and in December 2017, the head coach Bill Belichick and the Patriots staff stripped Guerrero of many of his team privileges. Dr. Jessica Flynn, a specialist in sports medicine at the Lahey Hospital & Medical Center, criticized Guerrero's practices in 2017, saying that although she truly believes \\"there is a lot of good going on at TB12\\", she is troubled that Guerrero has implied that doctors don't really care about the functional outcomes for their athletic patients. In an otherwise-positive account of one writer's experience, Guerrero had reportedly told his patient that \\"your surgeon's number one goal is to protect his surgery site. He doesn't care if you ever run again. He doesn't care if you want to climb Mount Everest.\\" Moreover, Flynn said she is concerned that at TB12 \\"they continue to profit from non-proven treatments, supplements, and other therapies and none of those profits seem to be invested in studying their efficacy.\\" She said \\"Guerrero functions in a different world than doctors. He doesn't have to prove his therapies work, or even that they are safe.\\" In an article on the sports website Deadspin, the sports writer Tom Ley used even more harsh language. He called Guerrero a \\"dangerous quack guru\\" and said \\"In a just world, Guerrero would be shunned from public life and quickly identified as a scam artist who has preyed on desperate and even dying people when making any attempt to present himself as a credible fitness guru.\\" In July 2018, Guerrero became the subject of inquiries about his association with the receiver Julian Edelman, and Edelman's suspension for using performance- enhancing drugs. Guerrero issued a statement saying \\"Here at our facility, we take a natural, holistic, appropriate and, above all, legal approach to training and recovery for all of our clients. And anyone who would suggest otherwise is irresponsible, and just plain wrong.\\" When a reporter said to Brady that a lot of people thought Edelman's violation might be connected to Guerrero, Brady said \\"It's just ridiculous. I'm out. See you guys,\\" and abruptly ended the press conference. Brady reacted similarly a month later when asked about Guerrero in late August. During a weekly interview segment that Brady regularly held with WEEI radio, Brady was asked about whether Guerrero was traveling with the team and about the relationship between Guerrero and team management. Brady said he didn't want to talk in detail about the topic, and when the reporter asked follow-up questions, he said \\"Yeah. Alright, guys. Have a great day. I'll talk to you later,\\" and hung up the phone.

Her essay on \\"Dream Poetry\\", appeared in one of the leading magazines of the 19th-century and attracted much attention. She wrote more for pleasure than for any monetary gain. She was also quite as clever with drawing-pencils as with her pen, and from time to time, for private circulation, published little books of rhyme‚Äîsimple, jesting doggerel‚Äîwritten and illustrated by her own hand. She was a hand puppeteer, creating them for several decades and writing a book on the subject. Early years and education Bessie Mason Alexander was born near Fredericksburg, Virginia, November 10, 1861. Her mother was B. M. Alexander and her maiden name was Mason. On her father's side, she is of Scotch descent. Her great-grandfather, a graduate of University of Edinburgh, emigrated from Scotland to the United States in Colonial days. He settled in Georgia and served as a surgeon in the American Revolutionary War. Ficklen's father, General Edward Porter Alexander, was educated at West Point, and, after completing the course of study there, entered the United States Army Corps of Engineers . On the breaking out of the Civil War, he enlisted in the Confederate States Army, and served with distinction as James Longstreet's chief of artillery. Ficklen was graduated from the Columbia Female Institute, Columbia, Tennessee. Career On December 28, 1886, she married John Rose Ficklen (1858‚Äì1907), professor of history in Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana. On the opening of the art school in H. Sophie Newcomb Memorial College, in New Orleans, Ficklen became a student there, showing special excellence in the direction of drawing and modeling. In the latter department, she did some good work, notably the head of a child, shown at the autumnal exhibition in 1891. In 1889, was published \\"Catterel, Ratterel, Doggerel\\", a set of satirical verses composed by General Alexander; the clever illustrations which accompanied these humorous verses were the work of Ficklen. An essay of Ficklen's, entitled \\"Dream-Poetry\\", appeared in Scribner's Magazine in 1891. On April 14, 1928 and April 28, 1928, she exhibited at the 1st Allied Arts Exhibition of Dallas County, Texas. Ficklen made hand puppets at various times in her life, when she was a child, mother, and grandmother. She also authored the book, A Handbook of Fist-Puppets (1935). A film regarding Ficklen included the subject of puppets. Personal life The Ficklens had two children, Porter Alexander (born 1887), and Elizabeth Fitzhugh (born 1890). Ficklen died March 3, 1945.

British Museum. Retrieved 29 July 2018 The image explores themes of death and the transience of life. It shows a woman sitting alone under an eerie, barren, dead tree in which the upper branches appear as if scattering crows. The lower ground is surrounded by encroaching and engulfing weeds, which reflecting her despair, seem as if about to envelope her. She rests one arm on a branch of the tree as she looks mournfully and enigmatically out towards the far distance, perhaps looking towards an uncertain future, or as has been suggested, in waiting for the return of a long lost lover. The image was influenced by both Albrecht D√ºrer's engraving Melencolia I (1514) and from characters from the romantic writings of Ludwig Tieck. It is part of a series that Christian cut from Caspar's drawings,Other works from this series include the similarly themed Woman with a Raven near an Abyss. See Wolf, 15\\"Seated Woman with a Spider's Web (Die Frau mit dem Spinnennnetz zwischen kahlen Baumen)\\". Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved 29 July 2018 however, Caspar appears to have been unhappy with the outcome and when asked by his brother to produce further works for transfer, he declined, writing, \\"ask another artist\\". Original cuts of Woman with the Spider's Web are in the British Museum, London, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, amongst other locations. Description and theme Albrecht D√ºrer's 1514 engraving Melencolia I The image shows a female figure sitting by a dead tree as she solemnly looks into the distance, away from the viewer. Her elbow rests on a broken tree branch, while, according to art historian Albert Boime, \\"all around her weeds have sprung up (including the sickening thistles, traditional symbols of melancholy)\\".Boie, 543 Many of the overgrown weeds are unnaturally oversized. Above her a spider has weaved a rather gothic looking web, into which an approaching insect is about to be entangled. The work is a highlight of Friedrich's obsession with dark and mysterious, gothic landscapes,Rewald et al., 4 and revisits his interest in nature and time.\\"Woman with Spider's Web Between Bare Trees, 1803\\". Art Institute of Chicago. Retrieved 29 July 2018 The work is sometimes known by the title Melancholy or Melancholie, a reference to Albrecht D√ºrer's 1514 engraving Melencolia I, on which it is closely modeled, and which is similar in pose and overall solemn mood.Bartrum et al., 296‚Äì298 Woman with a Raven at an Abyss (Die Frau mit dem Raben am Abgrund), a c. 1803 woodcut of similar size and often considered a companion piece, although the woman seems older and is far more disheveled and distressed But while D√ºrer's image was concerned with creative activity and the nature of scientific activity, Friedrich evokes a sense of mourning, and themes around the brevity and transience of life.\\"Caspar David Friedrich, The woman with the spider's web, a woodcut\\". artsandculture. Retrieved 29 July 2018 The ephemeral nature of existence is suggested by the flowers and the spider's web. However it may be simplistic to conclude that Friedrich felt a sense of hopefulness when considering death. According to the contemporary theorist of Early German Romanticism, Novalis, \\"death is the romanticizing principle of our life. Death is - Life. Life is strengthened by death\\", and thus the artist may have found solace and reinforcement when composing the image.Wolf, 15 German Romanticism was in part founded on nationalism and historical pride, which perhaps explains why Friedrich reached back to D√ºrer's 16th century engraving. The drawing may have been influenced by Ludwig Tieck's stories, particularly his 1797 fairy tale \\"Der Blond Eckbert\\", which contains passages where Eckbert's wife, Bertha, is abandoned by her husband and becomes stranded on an isolated mountain top, while she yearningly reflects on moments from their her youth.

The title is taken from the Inscription on the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior in Westminster Abbey in London commemorating a British soldier of World War I. The plot involves a fictitious British Army battalion, the Third Dukes, serving on the Western Front in France between 1914-1918; the cast of characters includes a wide range both of those serving and their friends and family at home. Background & Publication The novel was first published by William Heinemann in the UK and by Doubleday in the US, where it was the August 1970 Book of the Month Club selection. Elleston Trevor was then a successful and prolific novelist, best known in the US for his 1964 novel The Flight of the Phoenix and the 1965 film based on it. It has much in common with the 1961 novel 'Covenant with Death' by his contemporary John Harris and the stories share a number of very similar episodes and characters e.g. the battalion's first march to the trenches. However, unlike Trevor, Harris' novel focuses on Kitchener's Army and covers the period from enlistment in August 1914 to the Somme in 1916. Trevor himself was educated at an English public school, which he allegedly loathed; some of this is noticeable in his characterisation, although not overly so. Source of Title Tomb of the Unknown Warrior, Westminster Abbey. The title is taken from the Inscription on the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior in Westminster Abbey in London commemorating a British soldier of World War I. It reads in full; Beneath this stone rests the body of a British warrior, unknown by name or rank, brought from France to lie among the most illustrious of the land and buried here on Armistice Day, 11 Nov: 1920, in the presence of His Majesty King George V, his Ministers of State, the Chiefs of his forces and a vast concourse of the nation. Thus are commemorated the many multitudes who during the Great War of 1914 ‚Äì 1918 gave the most that Man can give, life itself; for God, for King and country, for loved ones, home and empire, for the sacred cause of justice and the freedom of the world. They buried him among the kings because he had done good toward God and toward his house. The last line is an adapted version of 2 Chronicles, Chapter 24, Verse 16, King James Version; And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his house. Plot summary The family featured here are the Talbots, an upper-middle- class family living at Ashbourne Manor in the London suburbs; the actual location is not given but clues suggest Richmond, London. The Talbots are composed of Aubrey, his younger brother Victor, his 19-year-old sister Pam, his father William, editor of a Fleet Street newspaper and his wife Lady Eleanor, who is the emotional heart of both family and book. It opens on 4 August 1914, the day war began between the British and German Empires. Aubrey and Victor enlist in the 3rd Dukes, as does their family chauffeur Freddie Kemp and Tom Follett, an orphan working as a junior gardener at Ashbourne. Pam joins the Red Cross in London as an ambulance driver. A Territorial Force unit, the London Scottish at Messines, 31 October 1914; the Dukes would have been similar. The provenance of the 3rd Dukes is uncertain but the novel has it serving on the Western Front before Christmas 1914. This makes it part of the Territorial Force rather than the better known Kitchener's Army, whose first units did not reach France until early 1915.W.N. Medlicott, Contemporary England 1914-1964 (1967) p. 21. The Talbot circle includes Hugh Sadler, their neighbour, long-term friend and conscientious objector who is shunned by his parents as a result and Diana Lovell, sister of Aubrey's fellow officer Julian, who becomes a nurse in France and later Aubrey's fianc√©e. A small group of enlisted men in the Dukes features prominently; the Talbot family chauffeur Freddie Kemp, Tom Follett, an orphan employed as a junior gardener at Ashbourne, Geoff Tufnell, Wiggy Bennett, Percy Stokes and Sam Quincy, an American. In general, the book focuses more on the emotional links between the characters and their development, rather than details of the fighting itself; unusually for books of this era, the Battle of the Somme is barely mentioned. The central theme is loyalty, both to friends and to ideals. It provides a wide range of the motives driving personal choices; Aubrey and Freddie enlist because they think it is their duty to do so, Victor to escape from what he sees as the restrictions placed on him by his family and Aubrey in particular. Hugh and Geoff are the moral centre of the novel; one enlists and the other does not, but both have deeply held beliefs and Geoff also comes to oppose the war. Others join for adventure, Wiggy Bennett to provide support for his widowed mother. While one or two episodes seem unlikely e.g. Aubrey's confrontation with a senior staff officer who orders the continuation of a pointless attack, it is generally a well-balanced portrayal that does not avoid the realities of the time and place. Some significant characters die while the different living conditions and expectations of the social classes are referenced, although rarely criticised. The standard 'selfish worker at home, striking for pay while their colleagues die in France' puts in an appearance but so do those working and dying in munitions factories. The novel ends in Trafalgar Square where it began, with the crowds celebrating in Armistice Day, 11 November 1918; the emotions are similar but very different in motivation.

It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade II* listed building. History An Act of parliament in 1815 allowed for \\"erecting a Shire Hall, Courts of Justice and other Buildings, for Public Purposes; and for providing suitable Accommodations for His Majesty's Justices of Assize, in and for the County of Hereford\\". The Shirehall, which was designed by Charles Heather under the instruction of Sir Robert Smirke in the Classical style, was completed in 1817. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage facing onto St Peter's Square; the central section featured a hexastyle portico with Doric order columns supporting a frieze with triglyphs and a pediment. The principal rooms included a Great Hall, a Grand Jury Room, a library and some courtrooms. A statue of the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir George Cornewall Lewis, by Carlo Marochetti was unveiled outside the Shirehall in 1864. Although originally used as a facility for dispensing justice, following the implementation of the Local Government Act 1888, which established county councils in every county, it also became the meeting place of Herefordshire County Council. After the creation of Hereford and Worcester County Council in 1974, County Hall in Worcester became the meeting place for the new combined county council. However with the creation of the unitary authority known as Herefordshire Council in 1998, meetings of the new body with county-wide responsibilities were once again being held at the Shirehall in Hereford. Some council staff relocated from the council's former base at Brockington to the Shirehall in August 2014, so allowing the Shirehall to form part of the \\"civic hub\\", along with Hereford Town Hall. A plaque was unveiled by the Lord Lieutenant of Herefordshire, Susan Bligh, Countess of Darnley, to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the opening of the Shirehall, in October 2017. Part of the ceiling collapsed in one of the courtrooms, which continued to host Crown Court hearings, in June 2020; the incident happened on a Sunday when the building was unoccupied and so no staff or members of the public were injured.

The valley is home to several mountain ranges, salt mines, lakes, and waterfalls.  Demography  Jahan is one of the most beautiful villages of Sub Tehsil Moola. The population is estimated to be over 20,000. The local language of Moola Chotok is Brahui.  Weather  In summer, it is one of the hottest places in the country like Sibi and Dhadar. In winter, it is one of the coldest places. Temperatures vary wildly throughout the year, with summer highs commonly exceeding 120 ¬∞F (48.9 ¬∞C) and winter minimum temperatures sometimes falling below freezing point. Weather conditions can greatly affect hiking and valley exploration, and visitors should obtain accurate forecasts because of hazards posed by exposure to extreme temperatures and late summer monsoons.

In 1813 she engaged an American privateer in a notable but inconclusive single-ship action. The Navy put Coquette in ordinary in 1814 and sold her in 1817. She became a whaler and made five whaling voyages before she was lost in 1835 on her sixth. Talbot class Coquette was the second ship in a class of two sloops; her sister ship was , the name ship for the class. Both were enlarged versions of the Cormorant-class ship-sloop. In 1811 the Admiralty re-rated Talbot and Coquette as 20-gun post ships. Royal Navy service Commander Robert Forbes commissioned Coquette for the Channel in June 1807. An announcement of his appointment to Coquette described her as \\"the fins and largest sloop in the British Navy\\".Naval Chronicle, Vol. 17, p.30. On 19 November 1807, Coquette recovered the English brig Amazon, which was carrying a cargo of hemp. Amazon, Birkley, master, had been sailing from Petersburg to Plymouth when two French privateers captured her off the Isle of Wight. Coquette recaptured Amazon and sent her into Portsmouth, where Amazon arrived on 2 December.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4209. On 26 October 1807, Tsar Alexander I of Russia declared war on Great Britain. The official news did not arrive there until 2 December, at which time the British declared an embargo on all Russian vessels in British ports. Coquette was one of some 70 vessels that shared in the proceeds of the seizure of the 44-gun Russian frigate Speshnoy (Speshnyy), and the Russian storeship Wilhelmina (or Vilghemina) then in Portsmouth harbour. The Russian vessels were carrying the payroll for Vice-Admiral Dmitry Senyavin‚Äôs squadron in the Mediterranean. On 23 October 1808, Coquette was in company with when they captured the French privateer Espiegle. Forbes was promoted to post captain on 21 October 1810, the fifth anniversary of the battle of Trafalgar.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 24, p.318. Commander George Hewson replaced Forbes in November.

Her crew had abandoned her. She had been bringing timber from Memel. Two days later Coquette took Haabet into Leith, arriving on 21 November.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4617. Between January and May 1812 Coquette was undergoing fitting at Woolwich. In March Captain Thomas Bradby assumed command. In May, Captain John Simpson replaced Bradby. When news of the outbreak of the War of 1812 reached Britain, the Royal Navy seized all American vessels then in British ports. Coquette was among the Royal Navy vessels then lying at Spithead or Portsmouth and so entitled to share in the grant for the American ships Belleville, Janus, Aeos, Ganges and Leonidas seized there on 31 July 1812. On 20 November Coquette sailed from Portsmouth with a convoy bound for the West Indies. On 11 March 1813 Coquette was a little to windward of Suriname. At 6 o'clock in the morning she encountered a schooner. Simpson lured the schooner closer by sailing like a merchantman. The schooner opened fire at 9a.m. with a 32-pounder gun that outranged Coquettes guns. Coquette was finally able to engage at about 10:30a.m. She discovered that the schooner, which flew an American flag, was armed with 14 guns, plus the 32-pounder, and had a crew of over 100 men. In the engagement the vessels exchanged broadsides and both sustained damage. It appeared that the American might strike her flag, but instead she took to her sweeps and escaped as the wind was too weak for Coquette to pursue. Coquette had four men wounded, two of whom later died.\\"Ship News.\\" Times [London, England] 7 Sept. 1813: 2. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 28 July 2018. The American privateer was .

Marijke van der Veen at one of the columns left in the Roman stone quarry at Mons Claudianus, Egypt  Biography  Van der Veen studied History and Archaeology at the University of Groningen. During this time she worked together with Jan Lanting on the Bronze Age barrow landscape, and their circular post settings, at the Hooghalen- estate in the Dutch province of Drenthe. At the University of Sheffield, she studied for a MA in Economic Archaeology and a PhD in Archaeobotany. Following her PhD, Van der Veen worked at Durham University as the English Heritage advisor for environmental archaeology in northern England. In 1992 Van der Veen joined the School of Archaeology and Ancient History, University of Leicester and was promoted to Professor in 2005. Her research has focussed on the Iron Age and Roman periods in Britain, and Roman and Islamic periods in Egypt. Early work established statistical methodologies for archaeobotanical analysis, and pioneered the sampling of archaeological sites in northern Britain. This work demonstrated that Iron Age societies in northern England were undertaking cereal cultivation. More recently, Van der Veen has reconsidered the interpretation of the density of charred crop remains at Iron Age sites, and the comparison of modes of preservation. Van der Veen has studied the food supply to Roman quarry sites Mons Claudianus and Mons Porphyrites in the eastern desert of Egypt, which showed the wide range of foods grown and imported to these remote sites. A major archaeobotanical study of food remains from the port at Quseir al-Qadim, recovered from the 1999-2003 University of Southampton excavations, showed new insights to Roman and Islamic trade. Finds included garlic gloves, citrus rind, banana skins,and black pepper. Her study on Quseir al-Qadim has been described as showing \\"her ability to recount fascinating botanical investigations of the past in a stimulating and thorough way\\". Her recent work has focussed on the dispersal of imported plant foods, in Roman Britain, and the Indian Ocean spice trade. Van der Veen received a Leverhulme Trust Major Research Fellowship (2008-2011), and a Research Fellowship at the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Studies (2011‚Äì12) for the project Seeds of Change. Van der Veen has worked to advance archaeobotanical work in Africa, and has edited a proceedings of the International Workshop on African Archaeobotany and several issues of the journal World Archaeology.

Educated at Roedean School in Johannesburg. Her brother became a Rugby International but died young. She passed her university entrance exam but she became a concert pianist. She toured for four years but it was her decision to abandon this and she trained as a stenographer. When she joined the theatrical agents H. M. Tennent Ltd in 1937 when it was a growing success. The management were impressed with idea of having a stenographer and she developed a strong interest in what was a growing business. In 1939 she became Binkie Beaumont's secretary and the following year she also became secretary to John Geilgud. As a pianist she was able to accompany auditions and performances and as a confident person she was entrusted to take on secondary casting. She was annoyed to find she had been passed over when the company appointed new managers including a casting director and the Binkie Beaumont's partner. She moved to work as an assistant to Murray Macdonald who ran \\"Company of Four\\" which was also Tennant's company. Here she was based at the Lyric Theatre. She and Macdonald produced several notable theatrical productions but John Perry explained that she would progress no higher. Black was head hunted and she became a literary agent at Curtis Brown. She played golf and used her connections to find clients that included Somerset Maugham and Samuel Beckett. She was involved with the noted production of Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot in 1956 and holidayed with Maugham in France. She notably told John Osborne to \\"think again\\" about his play Look Back in Anger that transformed British theatre. Black was fluent in French and so in love with France that she was sometimes called \\"Noir\\". She created translations of plays that were enabled not only be her fluency in French but with her knowledge of theatre after reading so many plays as a literary agent. Her translations included Crime Passionel by Jean Paul Sartre. She also translated his play \\"Morts sans S√©pulture\\" and was thrilled when the director said that it was perfect.

Soh is a Canadian science columnist, author, political commentator, and former academic sex researcher. Education and research Soh holds a Doctor of Philosophy degree in psychology from York University in Toronto. Her dissertation was titled Functional and Structural Neuroimaging of Paraphilic Hypersexuality in Men, and her committee included Keith Schneider of York University and James Cantor of the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. During her graduate studies, Soh received the Michael Smith Foreign Research Award from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and York's Provost Dissertation Scholarship. While at York, she studied paraphilias, which are abnormal sexual preferences. Her research indicates that these are neurological conditions rather than learned behaviours. Soh has emphasized that paraphilia is broad enough to encompass consensual activities; she reserves the term paraphilic disorder for the types that predispose one to harm others such as paedophilia.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpMcsM5tRTs A 2016 Cosmopolitan article highlighted some of Soh's findings and their implications for determining which men are likely to commit rape. Career Soh has written articles for Quillette, The Globe and Mail, New York magazine, Playboy, Los Angeles Times, and The Wall Street Journal. She began hosting Quillette's Wrongspeak podcast with Jonathan Kay in May 2018. Soh describes herself as a former feminist who later became disillusioned with the term. In a 2015 editorial, Soh criticized the prevalence of childhood gender transitions, advising parents and doctors to wait \\"until a child has reached cognitive maturity.\\" Soh's essay, which referenced gender non-conforming aspects of her own childhood, argued that \\"a social transition back to one's original gender role can be an emotionally difficult experience.\\" David A. French characterized this as \\"an understatement.\\" Soh has also written against anti-conversion therapy laws that include both sexual orientation and gender identity, believing that such laws conflate the two and prevent legitimate therapeutic counselling for individuals with gender dysphoria. She believes that the current societal view to allow for gender transition in childhood is mostly based on homophobia due to studies which show that many transgender children will desist and detransition in adolescence and early adulthood and come out as gay or lesbian. Fellow Canadian academics Florence Ashley and Alexandre Baril disputed Soh's interpretation of these studies. Soh opposed the 2015 decision to close Toronto's gender identity clinic, which was known for beginning treatment after or during puberty in most cases. A previous inquiry had put the clinic's chief physician, Kenneth Zucker, at odds with other gender dysphoria specialists who encourage social transitions at ages as young as three. Critics of Soh on this matter have stated that hormones are prescribed after puberty according to the Endocrine Society guidelines. The following year, Soh wrote an editorial which criticized CBC News for cancelling its airing of a British documentary that featured Zucker. In 2016, Soh spent a weekend documenting the furry fandom in order to dispel myths about the subculture being primarily sexual in nature. In August 2017, Soh wrote a column for The Globe and Mail and contributed to an article at Quillette defending engineer James Damore's memo \\"Google's Ideological Echo Chamber.\\" She continued to give interviews on the topic over the following year. Soh was described as a member of the \\"intellectual dark web\\" by New York Times opinion editor Bari Weiss. In April 2019, Soh supported a lawsuit by Nova Scotia resident Lorne Grabher against the Registrar of Motor Vehicles. The suit was filed to reinstate a license plate bearing Grabher's last name whose similarity to the phrase \\"grab her\\" had made it the subject of a complaint. Soh testified that the plate would not encourage any socially adjusted person to commit a violent act and opined that the government was \\"overreaching.\\" On 4 August 2020, Soh published her first book, The End of Gender: Debunking the Myths about Sex and Identity in Our Society.

The church contains several medieval mural paintings as well as a richly decorated Romanesque baptismal font. History and architecture There was probably a wooden church in the same spot as the current church as early as the 11th century. It was replaced by the present stone church around 1150. The church was built using unusually expensive materials (such as delicately cut sandstone instead of fieldstone) and is unusually richly decorated. The apse in particular displays Romanesque sculptures unusual for a countryside church. It has been assumed that the building of the church was financed by a local lord, indicating that this area of the province was important also politically during the early Middle Ages. A broad, western tower was built during the 12th century but demolished and replaced with the currently visible Neo-Romanesque tower in 1892. Inside the church the vaults were constructed in the 14th century. A church porch was built in front of the southern entrance in the 15th century, but demolished in 1763 and replaced by the current transept. A northern transept had also been built in 1723. The exterior of the church has been described as a \\"miniature of Lund Cathedral\\". Murals The Romanesque murals in the apse The interior of the church contains two separate sets of medieval murals. Decorating the apse is a set of vivid Romanesque paintings, influenced by French art and made in the early 13th century but somewhat harshly restored in the 19th century. They depict God holding the crucified Christ within a mandorla, under which the Apostles are standing. On the side walls there are scenes from the Old and New Testament as well as the family tree of Jesus. The paintings adorning the vaults of the nave are from the 14th century and depict the Coronation of the Virgin and the former patron saint of the church, Saint Lawrence. Furnishings The oldest item in the church is the richly decorated Romanesque baptismal font, adorned with images depicting the baptism of Christ. It was made in 1180 by a Romanesque sculptor called Tove. The name of the sculptor is known since another, very similar, baptismal font in Guml√∂sa Church is signed Tove gierhi (\\"Tove made me\\"). The church also has a triumphal cross from the 15th century, flanked by two copies of 16th- century wooden sculptures today in the Swedish History Museum but originally from Bj√§resj√∂ Church. They portray Mary and John the Evangelist. The other furnishings of the church are not medieval. Some of the pews date from the 16th century, and one of them is marked with the date 1562. The altarpiece of the church is an early Baroque piece, while the pulpit is from 1620. Adjacent to the church are also the Bj√§resj√∂ Runestones.

Megee later gave contradictory statements as to how he came to be stranded crossing the Northern Territory and Western Australia. On one occasion he said that his car broke down, and on another that he had been carjacked by an armed gang. However, a doctor later confirmed that Megee's appearance was consistent with having lived in extreme conditions. Like most deserts, the Tanami can reach during the day but still be very cold at night. Megee made his own primitive shelters and survived by drinking rainwater and eating small animals and available vegetation for nourishment. He was eventually discovered by a group of station hands near Katherine, Northern Territory, and taken to Darwin for medical assistance. Although some doubts were later raised as to the exact chain of events as Megee related them, the police did not find evidence that a criminal offence had occurred. Early life Ricky Megee was born in 1971 in Gippsland, Victoria; he later described his childhood as a happy one, until the family moved to Melbourne, where his father later killed himself. Megee worked at a variety of jobs. He was, variously, a carpet salesman, prawn fisherman, nightclub doorman, and an electrician. He eventually became a bailiff. Eventually, he went to jail after being involved in a fight in Perth, as well as for drug offences. In 2006 he was 35 years old and living in Queensland. Journey to Port Hedland and attack Map of the Buntine Highway In January 2006 Megee had been offered work in a government department in Port Hedland, Western Australia. He accepted the job, and set off on the long drive, which he had made multiple times before. Driving a 2001 Mitsubishi Challenger he took the Buntine Highway, which for much of his journey was a desert track across the outback of the Northern Territory. The events leading to Megee being stranded are somewhat confused, and indeed, Megee's version of how events unfolded changed significantly over time. He first told his rescuers that his car had broken down, but then, The Washington Post reported, he claimed \\"that he had been drugged by hitchhikers and left for dead\\". Megee later elaborated on how this scenario unfolded, saying he had picked up a lone Aboriginal hitchhiker between the towns of Kalkaringi and Halls Creek. He believed that at some point the hitchhiker drugged Megee's drink. Megee said that although he normally always opened his own drinks from the car refrigerator, on this occasion he allowed his passenger to open one for him. Later, in his 2010 autobiography, Megee said that there had been three men sitting on the roadside, who had run out of petrol, and that he had offered to give one of them a lift to a petrol station. Megee also posited that he could have been stabbed with a drugged-syringe during a struggle. Either way, Megee later recalled feeling increasingly \\"dazed and confused\\", and then blacked out before he recovered consciousness hours later. He also said that his attackers did not leave him immediately: they over-powered and stunned him. He later awoke in their camp. They had a gun, wrote Megee, but never used it; they did bring him water. After an unknown period, the carjackers lifted camp and disappeared. Before they left, they stole his shoes, but left him with $12.30 which had been in his pocket. When he regained consciousness, he said, he was in a hole, covered in black plastic, which had had \\"some rocks and dirt thrown on top\\". Megee suggested that it was only the attempts by four dingoes to claw him that woke him up. =Journey across the desert= Megee walked for ten days through the northeastern fringe of the Tanami Desert. He often lost consciousness through heat exhaustion, as temperatures regularly went above . According to Mark Clifford, a local man who later witnessed Megee's arrival, although the temperatures were high, it was also the middle of the wet season during the time, which was in Megee's favour. When combined with the abundance of small wild animals and Megee's \\"hardy constitution\\", his chances of survival were, with hindsight, actually relatively good. However, it was never clearly established precisely how Megee became as lost as he did. Megee said that he survived by eating leeches, insects, snakes, ants and lizards, and edible plants. He drank water from \\"various dams and waterholes\\" and scavenged in the bush every evening, eating \\"only one meal a day, just enough to stay alive\\". When water was unavailable, he drank his urine after chilling it to suppress the flavour. Megee‚Äî\\"baked in the day and frozen at night\\"‚Äîcreated temporary shelters from the sun out of old branches, and eventually found a decrepit windmill. Megee said that he made \\"a little humpy out of a feed trough that was at some cattle yards, obviously a mustering point, I thought to myself, so I've dragged it up on top of the dam, flipped it over and dug a hole and just lived in there for 10 weeks.\\" Megee became dangerously weak, to the extent that he was unable to travel as far on his daily foraging expeditions. At one point he suffered an abscess of the tooth that‚Äîweakened as he was‚Äîcould have been fatal, and which he prised out of his mouth with his car keys. =Rescue and recovery= Megee was eventually discovered about from Birrindudu Station, about southwest of Katherine, Northern Territory. His rescuers were local station hands and their trainees, known as jackaroos. By now, Megee was starving, sunburnt, and suffering from malnutrition and exposure. Birrindudu Station manager, Mark Clifford, described Megee as \\"just a walking skeleton\\" when he was brought to the station, and said that the area he was found in was one of the \\"most isolated places in Australia\\". On 5 April 2006 Megee was flown to the Royal Darwin Hospital, where medical staff described him as \\"emaciated, but...well hydrated\\". While in Darwin Hospital, Megee was interviewed by Northern Territory police, although they dismissed suggestions that there was any question of criminal activity on Megee's part. Indeed, they said they were unable to find any evidence of criminality at all, or even Megee's stolen car. Megee discharged himself from hospital after six days. Aftermath Royal Darwin Hospital, where Megee began his recovery Megee's Challenger was never recovered, and Megee himself lost , or over half his original bodyweight, which was over . The Sydney Morning Herald subsequently suggested that there were \\"some doubts\\" over elements of Megee's account, and reported that Megee was attempting to sell his story to \\"a commercial television station\\". It was also reported that the police, too, initially \\"had doubts about the story because of Megee's previous minor drug convictions\\". Megee refuted allegations that his account was in any way misleading and even offered to appear live on television and eat frogs to prove he was telling the truth. ABC Radio reported that Megee had told his story to them for free‚Äîalthough only after trying, unsuccessfully, to persuade the station to match a A$15,000 offer he said he had received from elsewhere. The doctor who treated Megee in Darwin commented that it was \\"very difficult to either deny or validate\\" his story, as he had responded so well to the treatment provided by dieticians, nutritionists and physicians. Bush Tucker Man Les Hiddins‚Äîconsidered an expert on outback survival‚Äîacknowledged that Megee's survival was not as surprising as might have been thought. It was possible, he said, to survive in the bush for up to three years, and that \\"there are some areas where it's difficult to survive, and others where you can\\". For example, the area where Megee was, Hiddins described as \\"dry country which is, you know, that's pretty severe country in there\\". Other survival experts credit Megee's survival on his \\"instinctively solving the basic requirements of water, food and shelter‚Äîand adopting a survival mindset that pulled him through\\". Megee subsequently wrote a book on his experience and emigrated to Dubai to work in construction.

He and fellow American Curtis Carter, who signed with KR, have been credited for revolutionizing the Icelandic basketball scene after they became the first foreign born professional players in the Icelandic Basketball League in 1975. Early life Rogers was born in Thompson, Texas and grew up in Houston with seven other siblings. Iceland In September 1975, Rogers became the first foreign born professional basketball player in Iceland when he signed a three-month contract with √Årmann in preparations for their games against Honka Playboys in the FIBA European Cup Winners' Cup. His first games for √Årmann where during the annual Reykjav√≠k Basketball Tournament. √Årmann finished second in the tournament, behind reigning national champions √çR, and Rogers led all players in scoring with 113 points in five games for an average of 22.6 points per game. On October 30, Rogers scored 24 points for √Årmann in a disappointing 65-88 loss against the Honka Playboys in the first leg of the FIBA European Cup Winners' Cup. The first meeting between Rogers and Curtis Carter on December 16 was highly anticipated and did not disappoint. It was a tightly played and ended with an 86-81 victory for √Årmann. But with 54 seconds remaining in the game, with the score tied at 81-81, Carter got into a fight with Rogers and knocked him down. The punch was caught on a picture and made the front page of Dagbla√∞i√∞ the day after, as well as the headline in √ûj√≥√∞viljinn \\"Jimmy won the duel - The Truck won the boxing\\". Both players received a one-game suspension for the fight from the disciplinary court of the Icelandic Basketball Federation and where threatened with a six-game suspension for any future fights. The verdict was highly criticized, both for the short suspension and for the threat of a longer suspension that only applied to them, as referees were worried that opposing players would try to harass them and goad into a fight. In the end, Rogers and √Årmann came out on the top in the league after beating KR in the last game of the season, guaranteeing them the first place and the national championship. Rogers came second in the race for the scoring title, finishing with 365 points behind Carter's 451 points. On April 1, 1976, √Årmann won Njar√∞v√≠k, 98-89, in the Icelandic Cup finals behind Rogers 32 points.

He was granted a leave of absence from the club in middle of December, with √Årmann undefeated in first place, to return to the United States due to personal reasons.

It was founded in 1913 as successor to the Clearfield Herald. It has a circulation of about 12,000 and is published six days a week. The paper was originally a vehicle for progressive politics and the \\"Bull Moosers\\", and the 1913 change in ownership and renewed focus led to an immediate jump in subscribers. (The progressive party in Pennsylvania at the time was known as the \\"Washington Party\\" for historical reasons.) It was bought by a group of business people with John Bixler put in as editor. It opposed the re-election of Senator Boies Penrose in 1913. In 1914, the paper accused then-gubernatorial candidate Martin Brumbuagh of being drunk while touring Clearfield county during his campaign. Bixler apologized for reprinting what was a possible lie. Henry Stough, an anti-liquor activist, had made the accusation and the paper had mentioned the attack. Bixler initially stated that because the paper had not made the assertion and just reported the attack, the event was correctly reported. Stough also claimed he had not directly said Brumbaugh was drunk In 1945, publisher G. Albert Stewart urged newspapers to support the World War II effort, even in the last days of the war. Braton Gardner soon succeeded him as publisher. The Progress was sold to the Community Media Group in 2015.

People with disabilities in Togo face many unique challenges. Disability in Togo is often seen as a curse or sign of witchcraft, leading to poor outcomes for people with disabilities. Accessibility in the country is lacking. However, Togo has signed onto the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and has created plans to encourage greater inclusion for people with disabilities in the country.  Demographics  Census data from 2010 shows that approximately 1.36% of the population of Togo has a disability of some type. Like many other countries in Africa, children in Togo often become disabled due to various complications, disease, poor diet and other causes.  Cultural attitudes towards disability  Children who are born with a disability in Togo, like in some other West African countries, can face violence at home, school or from other members of the community. Disability is seen as a sign of witchcraft and is considered taboo by some communities. Other times, the disability is considered the \\"result of a demon in the family.\\" Children with disabilities might also face neglect at home. Children born with a physical disability are viewed as \\"a non-human spirit,\\" by some families. Some parents deliberately keep their children out of school to protect them from abuse there. People with disabilities in Togo in general were considered cursed and that the disability could be contagious. Violence against children with disabilities and their deaths often goes unreported to authorities. Often entire families are ostracized because of one family members' disability. People with mental disabilities in Togo may be chained up in places known as prayer camps. These camps are religious institutions where individuals are restrained, not given psychiatric help and are prayed over in an attempt to heal the individuals. In Togo, there are several prayer camps which use different methods, often based on the camp's head pastors' personality.  Policy  There is a lack of inclusion for people with disabilities in leadership positions in Togo. In 2013, J√©r√©mie Yao Vidja, who is visually impaired, became the first person with a disability to run for elected office in Togo and he was later elected to the Togolese National Assembly. The government in Togo signed on to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2011. In 2016, Togo's Ministry of Social Action created a committee dedicated to \\"fostering social inclusion for people with disabilities.\\" In 2017, Universal Health Coverage was given to all students living in Togo. = Infrastructure = Togo's public buildings are still not fully accommodating to people with physical disabilities. In addition, there is no legislation requiring accessibility in public areas. = Education = Students with disabilities taking CISTEM courses at the United States Embassy in Lome, Togo in October 2015. People with disabilities were first allowed to attend public schools in the 1970s. Also in the 1970s, German and American charities set up special-needs schools, focusing on students with visual impairment. By 2014, there were nine schools and centers for children with intellectual disabilities, with most located in Lom√©. Also by 2014, schools for those with hearing impairment had been created. Efforts at including students with disabilities has started to increase. In 2014, there were hundreds of students with various physical disabilities were enrolled in universities around Togo, including 27 visually impaired students at the University of Lom√©. = Non governmental organizations = Non governmental organizations recognize that they need to work closely with the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education in Togo. Humanity & Inclusion (HI), started a trial program in Togo and other African countries to help produce 3D-printed prosthetic limbs for amputees in need.  Disability culture  = Sports = Participating in sports among people with disabilities is increasing, with hundreds participating in various trials in 2013 leading up to the pan-African competitions.

It has the ability to glide above the surface of the water to escape from predators. Description The species can reach a length of . It is similar in appearance to the tropical two-wing flyingfish (Exocoetus volitans) which shares much of its range, but differs in certain characteristics; the head is quite blunt, the forehead sloping steeply down in front of the eyes; the pectoral fins extend as far as the base of the caudal fin; the origin of the anal fin is slightly in front of the origin of the dorsal fin, and the dorsal fin is colourless. Both these two-winged species have very small pelvic fins, whereas other so called four- winged species of flyingfish have pelvic fins that extend at least as far as the origin of the anal fin. Like all flying-fishes, E. obtusirostris exhibits countershading, being darkish blue dorsally and white ventrally. Distribution and habitat At one time E. obtusirostris was considered to be a circum-global species, but the similar populations of different oceans were later split into three separate species. As now understood, it is endemic to tropical and subtropical parts of the Atlantic Ocean. In the western Atlantic its range includes the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico and in the eastern Atlantic it extends from Namibia to Madeira, the Azores and possibly the westernmost Mediterranean Sea. It occurs in surface waters, both near the coast and in the open ocean, at depths down to about . Ecology The diet of E. obtusirostris consists of small planktonic invertebrates, mostly copepods and chaetognaths. It is consumed by various predatory fish and by squids, dolphins and seabirds. Fish become mature when they are about in length. The female produces a number of bundles of eggs over a period of around five days, producing an average of 10,000 eggs. All fish will die soon after breeding. Status Exocoetus obtusirostris is not the subject of a fishery and no particular threats to it are known. It is common in the Gulf of Mexico but its conservation status in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea are less well known. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed its status as being of \\"least concern\\".

Around this time she started her research into Richard II, from which she produced the article \\"The Lancastrian faction and the wonderful parliament\\", read at the International Historical Congress in Oslo in 1928. Working with Vivian Hunter Galbraith, Clarke published an edition of the Dielacres Chronicle in 1930 on the subject of the deposition of Richard II. Clarke was developing an interest in iconography at this time, attracting high praise for her article on the Wilton diptych in 1931, whilst she was studying Irish high crosses. She partnered with No√´l Denholm-Young to work on an edition of the Kirkstall Chronicle, and a paper on \\"Forfeitures and treason in 1388\\". During this period she started a study of the \\"Modus tenendi parliamentum\\", which is considered her most important work. It was published posthumously under the title Medieval representation and consent in 1936. Clarke continued to work after a diagnosis of cancer, dividing her time between Oxford and periods of rest in Carnmoney. Her last article was \\"The origin of impeachment\\" in 1934. She didn't produce the volume on the 14th century for the Oxford history of England. Clarke died in Carnmoney on 17 November 1935.

Major John McMurray purchased the paper in 1878; his co-owner was William Leader. McMurray owned the paper and was its editor for over 30 years. When he died, in 1920, Major McMurray passed the paper down to his son, Harry McMurray. Harry died just a few months later and the paper was passed down to his sons H.E. McMurray and John J. The Jeffersonian Democrat was purchased in 1990 by Independent Publications (then McLean Publishing Co.) At the time it had a circulation of 3,000 papers. In 1993 Independent Publications launched the Tri-County Sunday which served as a combined Sunday issue for three of its papers including the Democrat. Community Media Group of Frankfort, Illinois bought the paper in 2013 as part of a multi-paper deal.

He is known for the role he played in defining the terms under which Savoy was annexed to France in 1860. Life =Early years= Charles Pierre Bertier was born on 25 July 1821 in Aix-les-Bains, Savoy. He became an attorney in Chamb√©ry. He was made a magistrate, but was dismissed in 1855. Bertier then became director of the Courrier des Alpes. In 1858 three newspapers were published in Savoy, all in French. The leading paper was the Courrier de Alpes, edited by Bertier, a talented writer. It supported the monarchy and the church. The Gazette de Savoie gave the government position and defended the policies of the Premier, the Count of Cavour. The Progr√®s espoused democratic ideals. It struggled in a region where there was strong support for individual freedom but also for traditional rights and ranks. On 25 July 1859 the doctor and journalist Gaspard-Antoine D√©nari√©(fr), Bertier and thirty other notables of Chamb√©ry asked King Victor-Emmanuel II about the future of Savoy. They were no longer particularly interested in becoming part of the nascent Kingdom of Italy, which was engaged in costly wars to impose central government on the principalities, had started to destroy ecclesiastical institutions despite opposition from the Savoy deputies, was even ready to dethrone the Pope. Instead, they hoped the king would restore sovereignty to Savoy. =Annexation of Savoy = In 1860 Napoleon III made the senator Armand Laity(fr) \\"Extraordinary Imperial Commissioner\\" with responsibility for propaganda for annexation of Savoy to France. At the same time a committee was formed for this purpose headed by Count Am√©d√©e Greyfi√© de Bellecombe(fr), a lawyer at the Court of Appeal of Chamb√©ry, which included Charles Bertier Director of the newspaper Courrier des Alpes. On 15 February 1860 Bertier was the leader of a group of 15 notables who issued a declaration in which they supported uniting Savoy with France and opposed detaching the northern part of Savoy and annexing it to Switzerland. On 10 March 1860 Bertier and Am√©d√©e Greyfi√© de Bellecombe went to Paris and met Foreign Minister √âdouard Thouvenel to explain the views of the people of Savoy on becoming part of France. Bertier also met Adolphe Billault, Minister of the Interior. In a letter of 25 June 1870 Bertier said he had told Billaut that the people of Savoy would only vote for annexation if three conditions were met. Savoy had to pass to France entirely, with no dismemberment. It had to be divided into two departments corresponding to the two provinces of Savoy. Finally, the Court of Appeal of Chamb√©ry must be preserved. The imperial government accepted the last request with no difficulty. In its issue of 13 March 1860 the Courrier des Alpes, the official organ of the annexation published throughout Savoy, stated \\"We are authorized to announce that Savoy will be divided into two departments with Chamb√©ry and Annecy for chief towns and that an imperial court will be maintained in the first of these two cities.\\" Bertier was one of the five leaders of a deputation of forty notables of Savoy who met the Emperor Napoleon III to inform him of the unanimous wishes of their country, the others being Greyfi√© de Bellecombe, de Lachenal, Ruphy and Dessaix. The emperor received them in a solemn audience on 21 March 1860 and promised to satisfy their wishes. He noted that it was unique for such a change of borders to take place not through conquest or through an uprising, but through the free consent of the legitimate sovereign supported by the people. The Treaty of Turin in which the king of Sardinia ceded Savoy and the County of Nice to France came into force on 24 March 1860. =Later career= Bertier was a member of the Conseil d'√âtat from 1860 to 1870. He was made a Knight of the Legion of Honour on 14 August 1862. Bertier, Master of Requests first class, was named governor of Martinique by decree of 31 October 1866. On 29 December 1866 he was promoted to Officer of the Legion of Honour. By order of the governor on 8 January 1867 the interim governorship pending his arrival was assigned to Andr√© C√©sar V√©rand. Bertier's first order as governor was issued in Fort-de-France on 28 February 1867. At the start of the French Third Republic Bertier returned to Chamb√©ry and resumed his career as an attorney. He died on 29 January 1882 in Chamb√©ry. In February 1882 the Courrier des Alpes noted that, \\"We were surprised that none of the gentlemen of the Prefecture represented the government at the funeral of a man who had contributed so much to the annexation of Savoy. Before being Republican, one can be French.\\" In the inventory in 1931 Bertier's tomb was reported abandoned. It was not transferred when the Paradis cemetery was moved in the early 1950s.

The station is expected to handle around 20,000 passengers and arrivals per day. History The station, designed by Benthem Crouwel Architects, is situated beneath the Europaplein in the Zuidas neighbourhood in front of the main entrance of the Amsterdam RAI Exhibition and Convention Centre. The station has two side platforms of 130 meters long and approximately 4.5 meters wide at its narrowest point, which widens to 8 meters at each platform end where the entrances are located. The station was the only one on the Noord/Zuid line built using cut-and-cover methods. At 8 meters below sea level, the platforms can be accessed by fixed staircases (in addition to up-only escalators, as well as lifts). The station has two entrances both in front of the convention centre, the northern entrance in front of the Europe Complex, and the southern entrance in front of the Holland Complex. The station is within walking distance of the Amsterdam RAI railway station which lies to the south. The artwork at platform level is a photo collage by artist Gerald van der Kaap. The collages span the length of the station and are featured on both platforms. The municipal government selected his work by special committee in May 2013.

The paper had 24 stockholders, residents of county holding 151 shares. By 1880, W.W. Thompson became sole owner of the paper's shares. The paper was purchased by David Butterworth in December 1886. Butterworth had previously published the Potter County Journal for 9 years. Under his \\"clever management\\" Potter Enterprise became the leading paper in the county. Butterworth died suddenly in 1901 and his son sold the paper to M.J. Ostrander, who made the paper into a strict Republican newspaper. M.T. Stokes joined the paper as publisher and editor around 1903 and became known for his \\"aggressive politics and fearless opposition to many interests, business and political.\\" Stokes made many enemies during his time at the paper, and is reported to have been kicked down by a bank president, horsewhipped by a woman, and paddled by a printer. There were also numerous libel suits against the paper while it was under Stokes. Things became so bad that in 1913, \\"political antagonists\\" set off dynamite in the Potter Enterprise printing plant. Stokes ran for Congress as a Washington Party candidate in 1914, but was labeled as a joke. Stokes was accused of blackguardism when he used the Potter Enterprise to abuse his Congressional opponent. In 1920, Stokes sold his interests in the paper in 1920, and the Potter Enterprise continued to be the top paper in the county. Stokes sold the paper to A.A. Bernard and William Fish, who were owners of the rival Potter Democrat. The paper stayed with the Fish family for a number of years. Bill Fish Jr. became co-owner of the paper in 1957, along with his wife Jill, after having worked at the paper since he was in high school. In 1958, the Enterprise acquired the Galeton Leader Dispatch. After Bill Fish Jr. died in 1977, Jill remained as the publisher of the paper until she sold it in 1983. The paper was purchase by Stauffer Media, though Fish Sr.'s grandson, Paul Heimel, was appointed editor of the paper. In 1986, Heimel left the Enterprise to work at the Potter County Leader and soon after, the Leader Publishing Company purchased the Enterprise. The paper was renamed as the Potter Leader- Enterprise. The paper was purchased by Community Media Group and is operated under its Tioga Publishing Group. In 2017, Philip Husick II was named Publisher for the Tioga Publishing Group. In 2018, The Potter Leader- Enterprise was named one of the eight best newspapers in Pennsylvania. Notable Coverage In 2010, The Potter Leader-Enterprise broke the news that the company Adelphia Communications Corporation was involved in illegal activity. The paper published a full securities filing that detailed illegal activities by the company and founder John Rigas and his sons.

Constructed in four phases between 1911 and 1967, the finished construction was the largest brick building in Europe at the time. The granary closed in 1988 and was demolished in 2002; the site is now occupied by part of the Glasgow Harbour development. History The first Meadowside Granary was a thirteen-storey, thirteen-bay brick building. Both it and the adjacent Meadowside Quay were built by Glasgow engineer William Alston for the Clyde Navigation Trust between 1911 and 1913. The site, on the north bank of the River Clyde at Castlebank Street, Partick, was formerly Meadowside football ground, which had been the home of Partick Thistle F.C. from 1897 until 1908. During construction, damage was caused by a severe storm on 27 November 1912 that blew down four cranes at the site. After opening, Meadowside became the most important grain store in the United Kingdom during World War I. The granary was first extended in 1937, when a second building was added. A further extension in 1960 cost ¬£3 million and added 500,000 tons of capacity to double the existing storage. The fourth and final building was completed in 1967 and added a further 80,000 tons at a cost of ¬£1.5 million. High level gantries were added to link the buildings. When completed, the Meadowside complex was the largest grain storage facility in the UK and the largest brick building in Europe, with over five million bricks used in its construction. The Glasgow Harbour development now occupies the former granary site The Upper Clyde was still a thriving port in the 1960s, but shipping declined thereafter. Meadowside was closed in 1988 and finally demolished in 2002. Port operators Clydeport was taken over in 2003 by the Peel Group, who subsequently used the land for the first phase of the Glasgow Harbour regeneration project. The site of the granary is now occupied by residential apartments.

Education  Steve Minn earned a bachelor's degree in management from Syracuse University and holds an MBA in urban development and finance from the Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University.  Career  = Lupe Development = Since 1989, Minn has worked for Lupe Development. As vice president and chief financial manager, he oversees the planning, acquisition, budgeting, finance and construction management responsibilities. Since 2002 he has managed the development and construction of more than 1,000 units of housing and more than 2 million square feet of mixed use, commercial, and industrial property. During his career, he has also developed a number of homeless veterans housing complexes. In 2018, Lupe Development announced it would build 111 affordable housing units in Minneapolis, using a $1.2 million grant and $2.375 million loan from the city. The development will include housing for homeless veterans. = Elected and appointed government positions = Steve Minn was elected to and served on the Minneapolis City Council from 1994 to 1999, representing Ward 13,https://www.linkedin.com/in/steve-minn-38617a14b/ while rising the ranks to become Minority Leader. He is not affiliated with a political party; rather, he ran as an independent. In 1997, he won the election with 59.28 percent of the vote. In 1993 he won with 53.09 percent. In 1999, he resigned his position to join the Governor Jesse Ventura's administration, first as State Commissioner of Public Service in 1999, and then as State Commissioner of Commerce from 2000 to 2001. He was also appointed by the Minneapolis mayor as the Minneapolis Public Housing Authority Commissioner.  Policy issues  = $15 per hour minimum wage = In June 2017, the Minneapolis City Council quickly passed a $15 minimum wage over the strong objections of workers and businesses. The council's vote took place one week after the release of a study showing the high cost of Seattle's minimum wage. When Minneapolis first began to consider raising the local minimum wage to $15 per hour, Minn came out publicly in opposition. He believed that such a wage would hurt future affordable housing developments in the city. Affordable housing rents are on a fixed schedule that is determined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Landlords cannot raise the rents to cover increased costs, and they are not allowed to pass on higher utility costs to their tenants. Minn believes that the $15 per hour minimum wage would dissuade developers from developing affordable housing units in the future for these reasons. = Affordable housing = In Minnesota, cities are able to enter into contracts with existing residential building owners that keep rents and income restrictions below 60 percent of the area median income. In effect, this decreases the properties' taxable rate by 40 percent. The tax loss is much lower than the cost of replacing a \\"lost affordable unit.\\" Minn advocated for landlords utilizing these policies to keep rents from rising. Minn also advocated for the government to pay landlords competitive rents under the Housing Choice Voucher (Section 8) program. He believes that these policies, when used, would allow landlords of older buildings to keep those buildings, make some improvements, and hold rent at a steady amount. = Public works = While serving on the Minneapolis City Council, Minn introduced legislation that would implement 24-hour snow plowing in the city. His underlying reason was to create a strategy to minimize the creation of potholes on the city's streets.http://www.alexandergray.com/attachment/en/594a3c935a4091cd008b4568/Press/594a5dbd5a4091cd008b8f94  Boards and commissions  Minn has been appointed to several civic boards, including: * State Environmental Quality Board * University of Minnesota Commission on Excellence * Minneapolis Community Development Agency Ad Hoc Advisory Committee on Housing * Mississippi River Critical Area Rulemaking Project * AEON Board of Advisors * Summit Academy Construction Advisory Board He also served on the board of directors of Bridgewater Bank, a financial institution based out of Bloomington, Minnesota.

The first season, consisting of 8 episodes, was released on Netflix on April 11, 2019. The series is produced by The Asylum, the same production company behind Z Nation, and is written and directed primarily by Hyams, with Abram Cox writing and directing additional episodes. Jaime King stars in the lead role as Rose, a mother who is separated from her daughter during the earliest and most deadly days of a zombie apocalypse. The series garnered moderate approval from critics. Many of the filming locations are in Calgary, Alberta in Canada. In November 2019, Netflix renewed the series for an eight-episode second season.  Plot  Six weeks after the start of the zombie apocalypse, Rose (Jaime King) is separated from her daughter, Anna, and she embarks on a harrowing journey to find her. Thrust alongside a small group of refugees in North America, she must brave a hostile new world and make brutal decisions during the most deadly summer of a zombie apocalypse.

The series was created by Z Nation co-creator and executive producer Karl Schaefer alongside the flagship series' co-executive producer John Hyams. Schaefer and Hyams also serve as showrunners for the prequel series. On November 20, 2019, the series was renewed for a second season which will consist of 8 episodes. = Writing = At the 2018 San Diego Comic-Con, Schaefer noted that \\"Black Summer is before the apocalypse got weird and was just scary.\\" He said that the horror series is not intended to be the funny version of The Walking Dead that Z Nation is, but would instead be more of an \\"old-school\\" take on zombie lore. This was echoed by producer Jodi Binstock, who stated that the series is \\"not tongue-in-cheek, it's very very serious: it's as if the zombie apocalypse really happened in 2018 and explores what that would be for all of us.\\" As the series does not feature any of the characters from Z Nation, Binstock later distanced the series from the \\"spin-off\\" label, explaining that \\"Black Summer is referred to in Z Nation as the summer where everything went to hell, so that is where Black Summer picks up.\\" Elaborating, Schaefer described the events of Black Summer as \\"the low point of the apocalypse\\" and established it as taking place \\"about four months into the apocalypse, [...] when 95% of the population dies over the course of the summer.\\" Within that context, Hyams stated that the \\"essence\\" of the story is about a mother being separated from her daughter. \\"The story is: what would a mother do to find her child? And what we learn is that she would do anything.\\" Hyams, who wrote the majority of the series' episodes, also said that the series would explore the idea of an American refugee crisis. Schaefer, Abram Cox, and Daniel Schaefer will also write episodes for the series. Schaefer stated that the series is not going to be episodic, but will instead be an 8-hour \\"chunk\\" to work through. This was confirmed by Binstock, who added that Black Summer would employ \\"a completely different approach\\" than Z Nation, \\"in that it's much more like a chapter in a book. You don't necessarily do the cliffhangers on a commercial break ‚Äì it's keeping you going so that you've got to binge it.\\" = Casting = Alongside the series' order in July 2018, Jaime King was confirmed to star in the lead role. On July 29, King announced via her Instagram account that Justin Chu Cary would portray a character named Spears. On August 7, Kelsey Flower revealed that he had joined the cast as Lance and described his character as \\"the guy that's terrible at the Apocalypse. You'd think he'd be the first to die.\\" On August 16, Gwynyth Walsh and Christine Lee were reported to have joined the cast in undisclosed roles. On October 13, it was reported that deaf Syrian refugee Mustafa Alabssi had been cast as Ryan, a deaf character. Sal Velez, Jr. will also star in the series as William Velez. Erika Hau will have a recurring role in the series. Upon release of the series' first trailer, it was reported that Aidan Fink and Kash Hill would also star in the series. = Filming = Production for the series had officially commenced by July 23, 2018 in and around Calgary, Alberta, Canada, with filming partially taking place at Queen Elizabeth High School, Stampede Park, McMahon Stadium and under the Calgary Tower. The series continued production in the smaller communities of Irricana, Beiseker and Cochrane before returning to Calgary in mid-to-late September. On September 26, it was reported that King had been hospitalized for three days due to injuries sustained while on set, with King simultaneously confirming that production for the series had wrapped. John Hyams directed the majority of the series' episodes. Abram Cox will also serve as a director on the series. Netflix announced on September 28th, 2020 that production of season 2 was underway following a months-long shutdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Filming for Black Summer season 2 originally began in early 2020 but on March 18th, 2020 production was postponed for 2 weeks. The pandemic took hold and the show was put on temporary hiatus. Filming once again commenced in High River, Alberta in early September, 2020. = Connection to Z Nation = The connection between Black Summer and its parent series take a similar approach as the relationship between Fear the Walking Dead and The Walking Dead, as there are no plans for any of the characters from Z Nation to appear in the companion prequel series. Z Nation actor DJ Qualls revealed at San Diego Comic-Con that the Syfy series takes place \\"quite a long time\\" after the event of Black Summer, making him feel that the cast is \\"too old\\" for a crossover to work. However, the two series do share \\"most to all of [their] writing, directing, and producing staff\\" as well as a production company, The Asylum. The show's starring actress Jaime King has said that the two series have \\"nothing to do with\\" each other.https://screenrant.com/black-summer-not-z- nation-prequel-series-jaime-king-netflix/  Release  The first season of the series, consisting of 8 episodes, was released for streaming on Netflix on April 11, 2019. The first trailer for the series was released online on March 19, 2019. Reception On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds an approval rating of 76% based on 17 reviews, with an average rating of 6/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Black Summer has enough undead carnage and a sinewy pace to please zombie fans, but the series suffers from scant characterization and doesn't add much storytelling meat to the genre's gnawed-on bone.\\" On the positive end of the spectrum, Stephen King praised Black Summer, stating: \\"Just when you think there's no more scare left in zombies, THIS comes along. Existential hell in the suburbs, stripped to the bone.\\" The New York Times wrote, ‚ÄúIf Andrei Tarkovsky and John Carpenter had teamed up to direct a zombie show, it might have looked something like this formally daring Netflix series.‚Äù In April 2019, Black Summer was the most watched show on Netflix in the United Kingdom.

Oil on canvas. National Portrait Gallery, London. Magema Magwaza Fuze (c. 1840‚Äì1922) was the author of Abantu Abamnyama Lapa Bavela Ngakona (The Black People and Whence They Came), the first book in the Zulu language published by a native speaker of the language. Born in Zululand, he was brought up from about 12 years of age by Bishop John William Colenso and converted to Christianity. Following his education at the mission, he trained as a printer and compositor on Colenso's press before starting his own printing business. He wrote for a number of Zulu newspapers and in 1896 travelled to the island of Saint Helena to be the secretary to Dinuzulu kaCetshwayo, king of the Zulus, returning to Natal in 1898. Abantu Abamnyama was published in 1922 and in an English translation in 1979. It has been described as one of the principal sources of Zulu history.  Early life  Magema Magwaza Fuze was born near present day Pietermaritzburg in Zululand around 1840 to Magwaza, son of Matomela, son of Thoko. The amaFuze were a sub- clan of the amaNgcobo. Nothing is known of his mother. His birth name was Manawami but he was given the nickname Skelemu, derived from the Afrikans word skelm for rascal or trickster. He told his parents that he would not be raised at home but would work for an important white man. Fuze was raised from the age of about 12 by John William Colenso, the first Bishop of Natal. His year of birth was estimated by Colenso on the basis that Fuze was about 12 years old when he first met him. Colenso converted him to Christianity and baptised him in 1859, giving him the Zulu name Magema. Colenso never gave his converts English or Biblical names. He was educated at the Ekukhanyeni (\\"place of enlightenment\\") mission station.Fuze, Magema Magwaza Papers. Campbell Collections, University of KwaZulu-Natal. Retrieved 2 August 2018.  Career  In the 1850s, Fuze trained as a printing compositor on Bishop Colenso's printing press. He was writing in Zulu from a young age and chose to write only in that language. His first piece was an essay describing the daily activities at Ekukhanyeni. Another early piece was an account of day to day dialogue in Zulu, Amazwi Abantu (The People's Voices). He first appeared in print in J. W. Colenso's, Three Native Accounts (1860) telling his experience of Colenso's visit to King Mpande in 1859. He printed Bibles using the press at Ekukhanyeni during Colenso's trips to England and eventually set up his own printing business in Pietermaritzburg His account of his solo visit to Zululand in 1877 was published in MacMillan's Magazine in 1878 as \\"A Visit to King Ketshwayo\\". He also wrote letters to and articles for newspapers such as Ilanga lase Natal and Ipepo Lo Hlanga. In 1896 he travelled to the island of Saint Helena to be the secretary to Dinuzulu kaCetshwayo, king of the Zulus, who was in exile on the island after leading a rebellion. While on the island he entered into a correspondence with Alice Werner of the School of Oriental Studies. He returned to Natal with Dinuzulu on the SS Umbilo, early in 1898. Some time after 1900 Fuze wrote Abantu Abamnyama Lapa Bavela Ngakona at the request of the readers of his journalism, but it was not immediately published due to lack of money. It was published privately in 1922, making Fuze the first native Zulu-speaker to publish a book in the language. It was reviewed by Alice Werner in the Journal of the African Society, one of the few reviews given to it at the time, but not until 1931.\\"Some Native Writers in South Africa\\" by Alice Werner, Journal of the African Society, Vol. 30, No. 118 (1931), pp. 27‚Äì39.

Hlonipha Mokoena of the University of the Witwatersrand describes the book as significant not just for its use of the Zulu language and its historical content which makes it one of the principal sources of Zulu history, but as an example of the work of one of the group of mission-educated converts to Christianity known in South Africa as the amakhowla (believers) who marked the transition from an oral tradition to a literate culture.

The picture depicts the Twelfth Night celebrations marking the end of the Christmas festivities and the beginning of Epiphany. It is the date when the Three Kings arrived at the stable in Bethlehem to pay homage to the newborn Jesus. Here Steen depicts in his typical style the indoor celebrations in a well-to-do Dutch household. Children are playing on the floor with three candles symbolic of the three kings, whilst at the table, between the carousing adults, another boy offers a youngster dressed as a king a bite of his festival waffle.
