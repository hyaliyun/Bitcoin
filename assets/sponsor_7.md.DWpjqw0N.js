It was purchased by George Washington University in 1999, and is now known as the Mount Vernon Campus of The George Washington University. Founding of Mount Vernon Seminary and 204 F Street, NW Mount Vernon College was founded in 1875, but its roots trace back to 1868, when Elizabeth J. Somers began tutoring the young daughters of prominent Washington men in her house at 204 F Street, NW in Washington, D.C. At the time, there were no schools for the education of girls in Washington, D.C. Her first three students were the daughters of Judge Dennis Cooley‚ÄîClara, Minnie and Mary. Their father, Judge Cooley, approached Mrs. Somers and asked her to teach his daughters in preparation for their attendance at Vassar College. When Mrs. Somers began teaching the Cooley girls, she began receiving similar requests to teach other children. Her small school grew. Seven years later, in 1875, Elizabeth Somers officially opened Mount Vernon Seminary, a day school for young ladies, that offered a six-year course of instruction, including four high school and two post high school, college years. The school was named after Mount Vernon Place Methodist Church in Baltimore, which was founded by Somers' brother, Thomas Eddy. The school included in its students the daughters of prominent men in Washington, including senators and congressmen. The school and students took full advantage of their Washington, D.C. location to further their education. Students reportedly visited the Volta Place laboratory of Alexander Graham Bell, to test the newly invented telephone. Bell's daughters, Elsie Bell Grosvenor (class of 1897) and Marian Bell Fairchild (class of 1895) all attended Mount Vernon Seminary, as well as several of his granddaughters and nieces. 1100 M Street, NW: 1880‚Äì1917 The enrollment at the Seminary increased and within five years, the school had outgrown its F Street location. Mrs. Somers moved the school to a new location at 1100 M Street, NW. The school remained on M Street for 37 years. During those years, the school underwent a period of tremendous expansion. By 1882, Mrs. Somers had purchased three additional houses next to the original location. She built an enclosed courtyard to serve as a recess area, and a tennis and basketball court. Between 1890 and 1917, the student body counted more than 100 boarding students and 50 day students. By that time, the school had built a supportive alumnae base that returned to the school for alumnae events and reunions. The group became organized as the Mount Vernon Alumnae Association in 1885, and has been in existence continuously since. During this period, beginning in 1893, the final two years of the school were referred to as \\"the collegiate course\\",Mount Vernon College Faculty Handbook, 1988‚Äì1989, History. designed to prepare young women for entrance into four year colleges. By 1905, Mount Vernon Seminary graduates were being accepted into leading four year women's colleges. The school boasted a rigorous academic curriculum. In order to graduate, Seminary students had to complete the formal process of 'Senior Essays', in which they completed primary research and wrote on a current political or social topic. These essays were read at Commencement exercises and awards were granted for the best essays. Some of the topics included controversial subjects of the time such as women's suffrage, child labor, the effects of poverty on children, and prohibition. During this time, students came from all across the United States to attend Mount Vernon, as well as Hawaii, Japan, and Syria. In 1915, Mrs. Somers announced her retirement and Adelia Gates Hensley, a Mount Holyoke College graduate, became the second president of Mount Vernon Seminary. The school was outgrowing its M Street location and its enrollment continued to increase. Nebraska Avenue Campus, 1917‚Äì1942 In 1917, the school moved to a campus located on Nebraska Avenue. Mrs. Somers, although retired, remained active in the operation of the school. She sold her M Street property to the YWCA, in keeping with her dedication to educating girls and young women. World War I forced students to quickly become involved in war efforts such as organizing First Aid classes and rolling bandages for wounded soldiers. The Seminary was assigned a ward at Walter Reed Hospital and students made care packages for hospitalized soldiers. Of the 20 graduates in the class of 1920, eight continued their education at four year colleges including University of Wisconsin, Northwestern University, University of Montana, Stanford University, and University of Texas. This was not common practice for women at the time, and testified to the solid education they received while at the Seminary. By 1923, graduates were attending University of California at Berkeley, Columbia University, Stanford University, Cornell University, Smith College, Wellesley College and The University of Chicago. In 1923, Adelia Gates Hensley died, and one year later, Elizabeth Somers. Although Mrs. Somers was the founder of the school, Mrs. Hensley had seen the school through a period of tremendous growth, and is credited with substantially improving the faculty. She was replaced by Jean Dean Cole, a former Seminary student and Mount Holyoke College graduate. Under her leadership, the school established a Junior College as a separate unit. Mount Vernon Seminary and Junior College operated together, but with a clear distinction between the two‚Äîthe four year preparatory school and the two year junior college section. Until that time, students had to study for a complete six years before receiving a diploma. In 1936, Jean Dean Cole resigned. Mr. George Lloyd became the fourth president of the college and his wife, Mrs. Olwen Lloyd became Headmistress in 1938. During World War II, volunteer war work became a part of life at Mount Vernon, with students participating in air raid drills, nurses' aid training, and Red Cross work. In 1942, the United States Navy informed Mr. and Mrs. Lloyd that they planned to take over the Nebraska Avenue campus and use its facilities for the war effort; to be called the Naval Communications Annex for intelligence work. Students went home for Christmas break not knowing if their school would re- open after the holidays. The Board of Trustees began searching for a new location for the school. The Nebraska Avenue campus was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. Spring Valley, 1943‚Äì1946 In early 1943, the campus was relocated to the top floor of a Garfinckel's department store building in the Spring Valley neighborhood of Washington, D.C. All but nine students returned to the school which re-opened on February 1, 1943; This was a spread out campus located in the store and different homes that were purchased in the neighbourhood; 162 students had to be boarded out. While in Spring Valley, the school began examining its programs and realized that it was operating essentially two different schools, the Seminary and the junior college. This placed the school under a severe financial and administrative drain. The school considered closing one arm of the school but tabled the idea at the time. The school applied for accreditation and began awarding the Associates of Arts degree in 1944 to junior college graduates. Foxhall Road 1946‚Äì1999 In 1944, Mount Vernon was granted compensation of $1.038 million from the United States Navy for the military takeover of its property. Originally $800,000 had been offered, a fraction of what the buildings and grounds were worth. The school then purchased of property for a new campus located on Foxhall Road in Washington, D.C. An academic building, four dormitories and a dining room were built, and other buildings gradually added. During the 1960s, the junior college developed new majors in an effort to place emphasis on those subjects which fit well with the capital city, such as those in government and politics, international relations and fine arts. The interior design program in the Junior College was also enhanced; the school phased out its vocational programs such as home economics and secretarial studies to develop its higher education curriculum. During the same period, the Seminary remained one of the most academically rigorous private secondary institutions in the nation and drew record numbers of students from around the country, graduating the largest classes in the Seminary's history. However, deciding that it was financially impossible to run two separate institutions, the Board of Trustees chose in 1965 to close its historic, respected Seminary to build up its collegiate program. The last Seminary class was graduated in 1969. The school was then officially renamed Mount Vernon Junior College. Mount Vernon was dedicated to remaining a women's college but faced significant financial struggles due to declining enrollments; the opening of previously all-male institutions to coeducation negatively impacted Mount Vernon and all women's institutions during that era. By 1973, in order to meet the contemporary needs of women, the school began awarding the Bachelor of Arts degree, first in Public Affairs and Government followed by Business Administration, Childhood and Special Education and the Visual Arts. In a move to seek additional revenue, the college began a continuing education program. In 1976, Mount Vernon College became an accredited four year college. Recent History, 1999‚Äìpresent In 1997, the Board of Trustees decided that the College would close as an independent institution. As of June 30, 1999, Mount Vernon became affiliated with George Washington University. The school is now known as The George Washington University ‚Äì Mount Vernon Campus . Before being purchased by GW, only female students lived on the campus, but now male and female students live on the campus. GW also constructed new athletic fields and other facilities.

The story was the earliest fiction that James included in the New York Edition (1907‚Äì09) of his works. Set in England, the tale shows James' strong interest in the contrast between the Old World and the New. In fact, the difference between America and Europe erupts into open conflict in the story, which leads to an ironic ending. Plot summary The narrator meets fellow American Clement Searle at an old-fashioned London inn. Searle has long wanted to settle in England to escape what he considers his arid life in America. But he is physically ailing, and he's also depressed because his lawyer cannot uphold his claim to a share in a country estate currently owned by Richard Searle, a distant relation. Clement and the narrator visit the estate, where they meet the ethereal Miss Searle, who supports Clement's cause. They also meet Miss Searle's brother Richard, who is at first suspicious and then outright hostile and combative toward Clement. Upset by the conflict Clement and the narrator travel to Oxford, where they help a gentleman, Mr Rawson, down on his luck to travel to America. Clement is now very sick and sends for Miss Searle. She responds to his call and tells him that her brother has been thrown from a horse and killed. Clement might now have a real chance for a share of the estate, but the opportunity comes too late for him. He dies and is buried in the England which proved so inhospitable to him. Key themes Clement Searle is an early example of James' imaginative and sensitive protagonists who are often defeated by less fastidious adversaries. The perhaps overly blunt irony of the story is that Clement might have realized his dream of living on an English estate if his physical frailty had not betrayed him. The story shows James still in his apprentice stage. Although written in an assured and fluent manner, there are many passages of local color description that intrude rather obviously into the narrative. These passages do give substance to Clement's dream of settling and living in the England he has long idealized. Of course, Clement's creator would realize that dream by living and prospering in England for most of his adulthood. The story also plays on another common theme in James' fiction: the simultaneous allure and danger of experience. The closer Clement gets to his goal of a home in the English countryside, the sicker he becomes. James' fiction would often show imaginative characters getting near the dense, \\"passionate\\" experience they desire, only to find that such experience can be destructive as well. Critical evaluation In his New York Edition preface James admitted the story's technical shortcomings. But the tale meant much to him as an early example of his international theme, the vivid contrast between Europe and America. Critics have generally agreed that the story makes the theme immediate and appealing, though there has been disagreement as to whether the tale is really all that much better than other early fiction James excluded from the New York Edition. Some critics have expressed impatience with Clement Searle as an impractical dreamer and a weak example of James' \\"poor sensitive gentlemen.\\" Clement's physical illness makes him even less effective in the crude business of the world than some of James' other defeated protagonists. But his desire for a new and more emotionally fulfilling existence may gain him sympathy from readers who can identify with his dreams. Publication history \\"A Passionate Pilgrim\\" first appeared in two instalments in The Atlantic Monthly of 1871 (27(161) (March 1871): 352‚Äì371; and 27(162) (April 1871):478‚Äì499. James revised the text for inclusion in A Passionate Pilgrim and Other Tales, his first short story collection and indeed his first published book. There it appears as the first of six stories (pages 7 to 124). A Passionate Pilgrim and Other Tales was published on 31 January 1875 under the imprint \\"Boston: James R. Osgood and Company\\", and sold for $2 each. The initial printing was of 1500 copies, but not all copies were bound immediately: about 400 copies that were bound in 1878 or later have the imprint of Houghton Osgood & Co. on their spine. There was no English edition, but copies of the American edition were imported, hand-stamped \\"London: Tr√ºbner & Co.\\" or \\"London: Tr√ºbner & Co. 57 & 59 Ludgate Hill.\\", and sold for 10/6. James further revised the text of the story for a continental edition, published by Leipzig: Tauchnitz in 1884 together with \\"The Siege of London\\" and \\"The Point of View\\". It went through a fourth authorial revision before appearing in Stories Revived, a collection of east stories by James that had not yet appeared in book form in an English edition. Stories Revived was published in 1885 by London: Macmillan & Co., initially in a three-volume edition, and shortly afterwards in a two-volume reprint. It was revised for a fifth time for the New York Edition, appearing in 1908 in Volume 13. This is the last published edition in James' lifetime, so as with many other \\"New York Edition\\" texts it is widely regarded as the authoritative text. Since James' death \\"A Passionate Pilgrim\\" has been collected numerous times: for example, in The Novels and Stories of Henry James, the first posthumous collection of James' works (1921‚Äì23); in Leon Edel's The Complete Tales of Henry James (1862‚Äì1864); in the unfinished Oxford edition of The Tales of Henry James (1873‚Äì84); in an Everyman's Library edition in 1999; and, the same year, in The Library of America collection of James works.

He married his cousin Penelope, suo jure Countess of Dumfries daughter of Charles, Lord Crichton on 26 February 1698. Dalrymple was a Shire commissioner for Ayrshire in the Parliament of Scotland from 1702 to 1707. He was a court representative there who made little contribution. He was appointed joint muster master general for Scotland in 1706. He followed the Court line faithfully over the Union, and was appointed a commissioner of the Equivalent in 1707 and as one of the Scottish representatives to the first Parliament of Great Britain from 1707 to 1708. At the 1708 British general election he was returned in a ffierce contest as Member of Parliament for Clackmannanshire. He was supported by Lord Mar, the principal magnate in the shire, who was said to have created some ‚Äòfictitious votes‚Äô for him. There was a petition but it was ignored. He was Sheriff of Clackmannan from 1708 to his death. In February 1709 Dalrymple was granted a vacant company in the 3rd Foot Guards (Scots Guards), at the request of his father. He probably did not go to Spain with his regiment, and so avoided its surrender at the Battle of Brihuega. He continued to support the Court in Parliament and presented documents from the Equivalent commissioners on 3 March 1709. In 1710 he voted for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell. Clackmannanshire did not elect at the 1710 British general election and Dalrymple was no longer on good terms with Mar by the time of the 1713 British general election. At the 1722 British general election Dalrymple was returned as MP for Wigtown Burghs on his family's interest. He continued to support the Administration. At the 1727 British general election he was returned as MP for both Wigtown Boroughs and for Wigtownshire and chose to sit for Wigtownshire. He went into opposition in 1733 with his brother, the 2nd Earl of Stair, and stayed there. He was returned again at the 1734 British general election. Dalrymple died on 30 November 1744. He had six sons and two daughters. His eldest surviving son, William, had succeeded to his mother's title as Earl of Dumfries. His second son, James, inherited the earldom of Stair in 1747, which on his death in 1760 also passed to William.

They are often used for motorcycles, motor scooters, go-karts, all-terrain vehicles, radio-controlled vehicles, portable tools and garden machinery (such as lawnmowers, cultivators, and string trimmers). Characteristics Villiers engine in a 1959 Bond Minicar Compared with multi-cylinder engines, single-cylinder engines are usually simpler and compact. Due to the greater potential for airflow around all sides of the cylinder, air cooling is often more effective for single cylinder engines than multi-cylinder engines. This reduces the weight and complexity of air-cooled single-cylinder engines, compared with liquid-cooled engines. Drawbacks of single-cylinder engines include a more pulsating power delivery through each cycle and higher levels of vibration. The uneven power delivery means that often a single-cylinder engine requires a heavier flywheel than a comparable multi-cylinder engine, resulting in relatively slower changes in engine speed. To reduce the vibration level, they often make greater use of balance shafts than multi-cylinder engines, as well as more extreme methods such as a dummy connecting rod (for example the Ducati Supermono).Methods of Balancing Single Cylinder Engines. Joseph R. Harkness. SAE Transactions. Vol. 77, Section 3: Papers 680436‚Äì680591 (1968), pp. 2329-2338 Suzuki's Supermono Engine Design. A second con-rod without a piston. Ben Purvis.

Most single-cylinder engines used in motor vehicles are fueled by petrol (and use a four-stroke cycle), however diesel single-cylinder engines are also used in stationary applications (such as the Lombardini 3LD and 15LD). A variation known as the split-single makes use of two pistons which share a single combustion chamber.

Single cylinder engines also remain in widespread use in motorcycles, motor scooters, go-karts, auto rickshaws, and radio-controlled models. From 1921-1960, the Lanz Bulldog tractor used a large horizontally- mounted single cylinder two-stroke engine. However they are rarely used in automobiles and tractors these days, due to developments in engine technology. Single cylinder engines remain the most common engine layout in motor scooters and low-powered motorcycles. The Honda Super Cub (the motor vehicle with the highest overall sales since its introduction in 1958) uses a four-stroke single-cylinder engine. There are also several single-cylinder sportbikes (such as the KTM 690 Duke R), dual-sport motorcycles (such as the BMW G650GS) and the classic-styled Royal Enfield 500 Bullet. The Moto3 class in the MotoGP World Championship have used four-stroke 250cc (15.2 cu in) single cylinder engines since the class replaced 125cc two-strokes in 2012.

The Missal contains all that is to be sung during Mass by the priest at the altar, while the Gradual contains all the music sung by the choir. The standard Roman Gradual contains complex Gregorian Chant while the Graduale Simplex substitutes easier Gregorian chants. All of these are in Latin, and are published for use throughout most of the Latin Rite (the vast majority of Roman Catholic parishes). Of Eastern Catholic rites, several of these have hymnals and service books translated in whole or in part into English. The Byzantine Rite Catholics generally use the same music as the Eastern Orthodox, although some specific Catholic translations of some hymn books into English do exist. All of the Byzantine Rite churches, and their Eastern Orthodox counterparts, use essentially the same lyrics in their hymns; the primary difference between different Byzantine Rite Catholic churches, such as between Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church and the Melkite Catholic Church of Antioch, is in the form of the music used. The churches of the Rusyn ethnic group, which following the Union of Brest became Eastern Catholics developed a form of congregational singing known as Prostopinije; recently, many Rusyns in the United States and central Europe have rejoined the Eastern Orthodox church, but Prostopinije remains in use by both groups of Carpatho-Rusyn heritage, and has been adapted for use in both traditional and modern English. Of the other Eastern Catholic Rites, the hymnals and service books of the Maronites have been translated into English, however, for other Eastern Catholic arites, often only the liturgy of the Mass has been translated into English, frequently without seasonal propers. The Latin Rite contains three other liturgical traditions still in use: the subtly different Rite of Braga, which is mostly like the Tridentine Mass but differing in a few minor points, historically used in Portugal before the introduction of the Novus Ordo Mossae, and the substantially different Ambrosian Rite, used by most Catholic parishes in Milan and some adjoining regions, and the Mozarabic Rite, which is also very different from the Roman Rite; at one time it was the standard liturgy throughout most of Spain during the period of Moorish occupation; later, its use dwindled, and it is now celebrated daily in a single chapel in the Toledo Cathedral built especially for that purpose; it sees very limited use elsewhere. These rites have only partially been translated into English, and are never celebrated in English, the diaspora from their locales having adopted the Roman Rite. There are also several monastic rites slightly different from the old Tridentine Mass, such as the Dominican Rite and the Carthusian Rite. The latter remains in use, exclusively in Latin; the former was translated entirely into English, but is always celebrated in Latin; its use has become rare, but it is still celebrated on occasion. There exist official English translations of the Missal and Breviary of the Dominican Rite, but not of the other distinctive monastic usages. It has been the practice to publish hymnals of songs in the vernacular language for more than 400 years, and many of these now contain some Latin Gregorian chants.

Byzantine Chant is the original musical tradition of the Eastern Orthodox Church, but this developed into a large number of regional variations, including the tonal, polyphonic four-part harmony of the Russian, Ukrainian and Bulgarian churches, and the three part melodies of the Church of Georgia.The Blackwell Companion to Eastern Christianity; the Oxford History of Christian Worship All of the Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic churches share a common set of hymnals, which provide the basic text for the hymns. The Octoechos contains the hymns sung in each of the eight tones, used throughout most of the year; the Triodion contains the special hymns and liturgical propers of Lent and Holy Week, the Pentecostarion, also known as the Flowery Triodion, contains the equivalent proper hymns for Pascha (Easter), Brightweek, and the period of time lasting through the liturgical season generally known as Eastertide in the West, including the feast of the Ascension, Pentecost and culminating on the first Sunday after Pentecost, All Saints Day (according to the Byzantine liturgical calendar.The Orthodox Church, by Metropolitan Kallistos Ware The Menaion contains the hymns for various holidays and feasts throughout the year. Variants of it include the Festal Menaion, containing only the most important feasts of the Lord and of the Theotokos, the General Menaion, which provides abstract services for particular classes of saint, and the Monthly Menaion, a twelve volume set, all of which has been translated into English, containing all the proper hymns (canons, troparia, kontakia) for the feast says of individual saints throughout the year. Lastly, the Irmologion, not specifically translated into English but included in other volumes, such as some editions of the Octoechos and Pentecostarion, contains the Irmoi, a standard set of responsaries sung during the canons at Matins.The Festal Menaion, translated by Metropolitan Kallistos Ware and Mother Mary All of these works aside from the Irmologion exist in English translations, in various forms, including anthologies. One of the oldest and most comprehensive is The Divine Prayers and Services of the Orthodox Church, compiled by Fr. Seraphim Nassar, which contains substantial excerpts from the Octoechos, the Menaion, the Triodion and the Pentecostarion. Oriental Orthodox hymnals Like the Byzantine Rite, the West Syriac Rite uses an eight mode system of chant similar to Byzantine Chant and Gregorian Chant, however, traditionally this was not notated, but rather, the melodies were passed down via oral tradition. The principal hymnal of the Syriac Orthodox Church is the Beth Gazo (\\"Treasury\\"); proper hymns for various feasts are also found in the books of the liturgy, the Shi'mo, or Divine Office, and the Fanqitho, which replaces the Shi'mo in Great Lent, Holy Week, Pascha and during major feasts throughout the church year. Of these, only the book of the Liturgy containing the Anaphoras in various forms and the Shi'mo, have been translated into English.Margoneetho: Shriac Orthodox Resources The Coptic Rite also lacks a system of musical notation; its system of chant, Tasbeha, is somewhat less complex than West Syriac Chant; it is not based on eight modes, but rather a few sets of melodies for use on different occasions; it is passed down primarily as oral tradition, and certain portions of it, for example the chanting of the priests, rely on improvization based on the use of standard musical phrases. The Coptic Euchologion contains the hymns of the Divine Liturgy, whereas the books of the Annual Psalmody and the Khiak Psalmody contain the hymns of the divine office, the latter specifically for the season of Advent. There is also a book of offices for Holy Week, and various books containing special services such as funerals, marriages and ordinations, all of which have been translated into English. There also exist trilingual hymnals containing the Divine Liturgy of St. Basil set to Western notation.The Blackwell Companion to Eastern Christianity In contrast, both the Armenian Rite and Ethiopian Rite make use of musical notation, which in the case of the Ethiopian church is ancient, dating back to the 6th century; however, these churches serve their liturgies exclusively in Classical Armenian and Ge'ez respectively, and consequently, very little of their hymnals or other service books have been translated into English. The hymnals and service books of the Ethiopian church are particularly obscure. Hymnals of the Church of the East The Assyrian Church of the East, the Ancient Church of the East, the Chaldean Catholic Church and the Syro Malabar Catholic Church use the East Syriac Rite, which like the West Syriac Rite lacks a system of musical notation and is instead passed down through oral tradition; it makes use of the following hymnals: the \\"Turgama\\" (Interpretation), containing hymns sung by deacons during the liturgy (our Graduals and Sequences), the David (Dawidha = Psalter), \\"Khudhra\\" (= \\"cycle\\", containing antiphons, responsories, hymns, and collects for all Sundays), \\"Kash K√µl\\" (= \\"Collection of all\\"; the same chants for week-days), \\"Kdham u-Wathar\\" (= \\"Before and after\\"; certain prayers, psalms, and collects most often used, from the other books), \\"Gezza\\" (\\"Treasury\\", services for feast-days), Abu-Halim (the name of the compiler, containing collects for the end of the Nocturns on Sundays), \\"Bautha d'Ninwaie\\" (= \\"Prayer of the Ninevites\\", a collection of hymns ascribed to St. Ephraem, used in Lent). The Baptism Office (\\"Taksa d'Amadha\\") is generally bound up with the Liturgies. The \\"Taksa d'Siamidha\\" has the ordination services. The \\"Taksa d'Husaia\\" contains the office for Penance, the \\"Kthawa d'Burrakha\\" is the marriage service, the \\"Kahneita\\", the burial of clergy, the \\"Annidha\\" that of laymen. Lastly the \\"Khamis\\" and \\"Warda\\" are further collections of hymns (see Badger, \\"The Nestorians and their Rituals\\", London, 1852, II, 16-25). Naturally not every church possesses this varied collection of books, and most have not been translated into English. Nonetheless, there are 19th century translations available of the Divine Liturgy and the Divine Office.1911 Catholic Encyclopedia Notes and references Category:Lists of books by type Category:Christian music lists ","title":"List of English-language hymnals by denomination"},{"id":"3888960","text":"State Route 154 (SR 154) is a state highway in the area around Atlanta in the U.S. state of Georgia.

Route description =Southwest of Atlanta= SR 154 begins at an intersection with SR 54 in Sharpsburg, in Coweta County. It heads northwest and intersects with SR 34 just west of Peachtree City and continues northwest where it has an interchange with Interstate 85 (I-85) at exit 51. Less than north, SR 154 meets US 29/SR 14 and turns north and runs concurrent with US 29/SR 14 to the northeast. In Palmetto, US 29/SR 14 (Roosevelt Highway) split to the northeast, while SR 154 heads north, concurrent with US 29 Alternate/SR 14 Alternate through town, until US 29 Alternate/SR 14 Alternate depart to the east-northeast, along South Fulton Parkway. The route continues to the north and intersects SR 70 (Cochran Mill Road). The two roads begin a concurrency to the northwest. They meet SR 92\\\\. The three highways cross the Chattahoochee River, which marks the Coweta‚ÄìFulton county line. Then, they intersect SR 166 (Duncan Memorial Highway), which joins the concurrency. The four routes head to the northeast concurrently, until SR 92 (Fairburn Road) splits to the northwest and the other three highways heads east to cross over the Chattahoochee River again, and cross back into Fulton County. About later, SR 70 (Fulton Industrial Boulevard SW) departs to the northeast, while SR 154/SR 166 continue to the east. Just a little bit later, they cross SR 6 (Camp Creek Parkway), entering the Sandtown community on its way to the Ben Hill neighborhood of Atlanta, northeast of which they have an interchange with I-285 (The Perimeter/Atlanta Bypass). =Inside the Perimeter= Belvedere Park SR 154/SR 166 head east as the Arthur B. Langford Jr. Parkway, a limited-access freeway that was originally named the Lakewood Freeway and was planned as I-420. It runs along the East Point‚ÄìAtlanta city line, with a brief cross into East Point proper, before running along the city line again. The Parkway passes Fort McPherson Army base. The concurrent routes meets US 29/SR 14/SR 139 (Main Street/Lee Street SW). SR 154 heads north-northeast into Atlanta proper, concurrent with these three highways. Just before reaching I-20, SR 139 departs to the west (on Ralph David Abernathy Boulevard), while US 29/SR 14/SR 154 continue to the north-northeast. They cross under, but don't have an interchange with, I-20. After only about , US 29 departs to the northwest, concurrent along Chapel Street SW, along with SR 3 Connector. SR 14/SR 154 heads northeast and cross over, but don't intersect, US 19/US 41/SR 3\\\\. At the intersection with Spring Street SW, SR 14 abruptly ends, and SR 154 continues eastward. A short distance later, it crosses over, but doesn't have an interchange with, I-75/I-85. SR 154 parallels I-20 along Memorial Drive SE, intersecting US 23/SR 42 (Moreland Avenue SE), which forms the Fulton‚ÄìDeKalb county line. Then, it meets SR 155 (Candler Road SE).

He held important commands in the Imperial Japanese Army during the Second Sino-Japanese War, and during World War II in the Burma Campaign and defense of the Japanese homeland late in the war. He was also the elder brother of General Torashir≈ç Kawabe. Biography =Early career= A native of Toyama prefecture, Kawabe graduated from the 19th class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1907 and the 27th class of the Army Staff College in 1915. From 1927 to 1929, he served as an instructor at the War College. He was then assigned as a military attach√© to Switzerland from 1918 to 1921 and to Berlin, Germany from 1929 to 1932. Promoted to infantry colonel in 1932, he served in a number of staff assignments on his return to Japan, before being assigned command of the IJA 6th Infantry Regiment from 1932 to 1933.Ammenthorp, The Generals of World War II Kawabe went on to be Commandant of the Infantry School from 1933 to 1934, and was Chief of 1st Section within the Inspectorate General of Military Training from 1934 to 1936. He was promoted to major general in 1936. =Second Sino- Japanese War= At the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War Kawabe was sent to China to take command of the Permanent China Brigade, had been involved in the Marco Polo Bridge Incident. As the war expanded he was made Deputy Chief of Staff of the North China Area Army from 26 August 1937 until 14 April 1938 when he became Chief of Staff Central China Expeditionary Army from 15 February 1938 to 31 January 1939. Kawabe was promoted to lieutenant general in March 1939. During his time in China, he was involved in the Battle of Xuzhou, Northern and Eastern Honan, Battle of Wuhan, Canton Operation, Battle of Nanchang, Battle of Suixian-Zaoyang, Battle of Changsha (1939), and the 1939-40 Winter Offensive. From 12 September 1939 to 14 October 1940 Kawabe was recalled to Japan, and held the powerful post of Inspector-General of Military Training. However, he returned to China as commander in chief of the IJA 12th Division in March 1940, serving under the Kwantung Army. Promoted to commander in chief of the IJA 3rd Army in March 1941, he subsequently was Chief of Staff of the China Expeditionary Army from 17 August 1942 to 18 March 1943. =Pacific War= General Masakazu Kawabe with Burmese leaders during his time as commander of the Japanese Burma Area Army, Rangoon 1943. In March 1943, Kawabe was transferred to the southern front as Commander in Chief of the Burma Area Army. Arriving in Burma he was convinced to support Renya Mutaguchi, commander of the 15th Army and an old comrade-in-arms, in his plans for a pre-emptive attack against British forces at Imphal. The goal of this offensive was to disrupt the Allied build-up in that area, and perhaps, if all went well, make way for an invasion of Assam and British India. This plan was strongly opposed by most of Kawabe's commanders as well as Masazumi Inada, Vice-Chief of Staff of the Southern Expeditionary Army based in Singapore. Especially the difficult supply situation was thought to be a major obstacle. However, in October 1943, Inada was removed from his position due to a diplomatic incident with Thailand and in December the plan was approved by General Hisaichi Terauchi and Prime Minister Hideki T≈çj≈ç on the understanding the operation would be a purely defensive one.Budge, The Pacific War Online Encyclopedia Mutaguchi's plan was a tremendous disaster for the Japanese army, resulting in the highest casualties of any operation in the entire war, and the loss of Burma. During the later stages of this offensive, Kawabe was bedridden with amoebic dysentery. Kawabe was relieved by General Heitar≈ç Kimura on 30 August 1944 and returned to Japan.Hayashi, Kogun The Japanese Army in the Pacific War Kawabe served for a short time on the Supreme War Council. In the final stages of the war, experienced commanders were needed to organize the defenses of the Japanese home islands. Kawabe became Commander in Chief of the Central District Army on 1 December 1944, he also became Commander in Chief of the 15th Area Army from its formation on 1 February 1945 to 7 April 1945. Kawabe was promoted to full general in March 1945. On 8 April 1945 he took command of Air General Army, consisting of the remaining air units in Japan, Korea and Okinawa, for the final defense of Japan against the anticipated Allied invasion. After the surrender of Japan, Kawabe was retained by the SCAP occupation authorities to assist with the demobilization of the Japanese military, replacing Kenji Doihara after the latter was arrested and tried for war crimes. Kawabe retired at the end of 1945 and died 20 years later.Fuller, Shokan Hirohito's Samurai See also * Organization of Japanese Expeditionary forces in China'' References =Books= External links World Statesmen - Myanmar (Burma) Notes Category:Japanese generals Category:Japanese military personnel of World War II Category:Administrators in British Burma Category:People from Toyama Prefecture Category:1886 births Category:1965 deaths Category:Burma in World War II Category:Japanese military attach√©s ","title":"Masakazu Kawabe"},{"id":"3888982","text":"John Dalrymple (c. 1699 ‚Äì 23 February 1742) was a Scottish Member of Parliament (MP) in the British Parliament.

Konotop serves as the administrative center of Konotop Raion. Konotop is administratively incorporated as a city of oblast significance and does not belong to the raion. Konotop is located about 129 km from Sumy, the oblast administrative center. It is host to Konotop air base. Population: History During the beginning of the 17th century, Cossacks were first based in that area. The settlement was first mentioned in 1634 in various documents as Novoselytsia. In 1642 a Polish fortress was built in that place named after the river Konotopka. Probably the river disappeared, and another one was created, Yezuch. The fortification became a key point in the struggle against the Moscow state. In 1659 the Battle of Konotop took place near the city, in which Cossacks led by Ivan Vyhovsky (allied with Poles and Crimean Tatars) defeated Muscovite forces. In 1782 Konotop was granted municipal rights. During World War II, Konotop was occupied by the German Army from 3 September 1941 to 6 September 1943. Details of this are recounted in the book The Forgotten Soldier by Guy Sajer In 2015, the city elected Artem Semenikhin of the far- right Svoboda as its mayor. Semenikhin reportedly has the number \\"14/88\\" displayed on his car and has refused to display the city's official flag because it contains a star of David, and has implied that Jews were responsible for the Holodomor. Climate Economy The main industrial enterprises of the city include the Konotop Casting and Mechanical Plant, the Motordetal Plant, the Konotop Fittings Plant, the Konotop Car Repair Plant, the Aviakon Aircraft Repair Plant, a mechanical plant, a garment factory, a meat processing plant (Konotopmyaso OJSC), a dairy plant, and a bakery plant. Konotop is an important mechanical engineering center, food production center. Transport Railway station The city is an important transportation center.

Career He began his career as at French club AJ Auxerre, but left in 1992 for England, where he spent the vast majority of his career. His first English club was Leeds United, joining for ¬£60,000. He made just 17 league appearances in three years at the Yorkshire club, then one of the top clubs in England. Moving to Wigan Athletic in November 1995 for a ¬£100,000 fee, he made 217 appearances in six years. Wigan won promotion to Division Two in 1997. Whilst at Wigan he also played in the final as they won the 1998‚Äì99 Football League Trophy. In November 2001 he joined Wrexham on a free transfer. He played just 15 times for the Welsh club, and Wrexham were relegated from Division Two that season. In August 2002, Sharp left for Huddersfield Town on another free transfer.

He had made 46 league appearances - exactly half of Scunthorpe's league matches over the two years with the club. Sharp joined Shrewsbury prior to the 2005-06 season, with manager Gary Peters installed him as club captain. However, in early 2006, loss of form resulted in Shrewsbury fans turning against him, and Peters was forced to drop him from the team at the end of February 2006. Playing on only two further occasions in the following six weeks, he was released. Sharp joined Hamilton Academical, in the Scottish Football League First Division, on an amateur basis in November 2006. He made his debut against Livingston in December 2006.

Her husband was Fu Xiong (ËãªÈõÑ), the Prince of Donghai and brother of the founding emperor Fu Ji√†n. She became empress dowager in 357 after her son Fu JiƒÅn (note different tone) seized power in a coup from his tyrannical cousin Fu Sheng (Fu Ji√†n's son) and claimed the title \\"Heavenly Prince\\" (Tian Wang). In addition to Fu JiƒÅn, she had at least one other son with Fu Xiong, Fu Shuang (ËãªÈõô) the Duke of Zhao. Empress Dowager Gou had been widowed in 354 when Fu Xiong died. It is commonly believed that after her husband's death, she carried on an affair with her cousin Li Wei (ÊùéÂ®Å), whom Fu JiƒÅn treated effectively like a second father. Around the new year 358, Empress Dowager Gou saw that Fu JiƒÅn's older brother Fu Fa (ËãªÊ≥ï) the Duke of Donghai (not her son) had many visitors, and she became concerned that if he became increasingly powerful, he would pose a threat to Fu JiƒÅn, and therefore she, after consulting with Li, ordered Fu Fa to commit suicide. This incident showed that she had substantial power during Fu JiƒÅn's early reign. However, after this incident, her power appeared to begin to gradually dissipate, and few references were made of her from this point on. In late 367, Fu Shuang, in conjunction with Fu Sheng's brothers Fu Liu (ËãªÊü≥) the Duke of Jin, Fu Sou (ËãªÂªã) the Duke of Wei, and Fu Wu (ËãªÊ≠¶) the Duke of Yan, rebelled and sought Former Yan aid, threatening to tear Former Qin apart, but after Former Qin's regent Murong Ping refused them aid, the rebels collapsed in 368‚Äîand after the incident, Fu Liu's family was killed, while Fu Wu and Fu Shuang's sons were spared but not allowed to inherit their titles‚Äîwhile Fu Sou, who was ordered to commit suicide, had all of his sons spared and created dukes, and this led to one of the few references to her, as she questioned Fu JiƒÅn why he did not permit Fu Shuang's title to be retained while permitted Fu Sou's sons to have duke titles. Fu JiƒÅn's response was that the empire was built by Fu Ji√†n, and that his sons must all have heirs, and that Fu Shuang, in rebelling, abandoned both his empire and his mother and therefore did not deserve an heir. No other act of Empress Dowager Gou was mentioned in history. The final reference to her was in 371, when Fu JiƒÅn was out hunting and stayed at the hunt for more than 10 days, and an actor named Wang Luo (ÁéãÊ¥õ) tried to persuade him to end his hunt by telling him that he should be mindful of the empress dowager's welfare, implying that she was still alive then.

Sights The cathedral of the Holy Spirit, founded in 1735 in place of a wooden church, is a four-pillared cathedral designed in the Ukrainian Baroque style and is surmounted by three pear-shaped domes, each placed on a tall cylinder. Although the cathedral dates back to the 1740s, the building of the nearby belfry and winter church was not undertaken until 1780. Another noteworthy building is the church of the Ascension, which also has three domes, but was constructed later, in 1795‚Äì1801, and adjoins a Baroque belfry built in 1753‚Äì63. Local government Beside the city itself, the city municipality also serves as government for a village Kolisnykove and a settlement Luchky. The city also has administration of the surrounding Romny Raion.

The last beach is a narrow strip under the cliff of a part of Perunika Glacier terminating on the coast. Bulgarian Beach is surmounted by a chain of five hills comprising Hesperides Hill, Pesyakov Hill, Sinemorets Hill, Spanish Knoll and Belozem Hill. In summer the area is predominantly snow-free and crossed by four meltwater streams draining the north-western slope of the Balkan Snowfield, with stream mouths located at the western extremities of each beach.

Farther east, the road heads through a mix of farmland and woodland with some homes. PA 34 curves south and then east to reach its northern terminus at US 11/US 15 just west of the Millersburg Ferry across the Susquehanna River. History The section of current PA 34 between Mount Holly Springs and Carlisle was chartered as part of a private turnpike known as the Hanover and Carlisle Turnpike in 1812, connecting Hanover with Carlisle. This turnpike provided an improved trade link between the Cumberland Valley and Baltimore. When Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, what is now PA 34 was designated as Legislative Route 41 between Gettysburg and Carlisle, Legislative Route 40 between Carlisle and New Bloomfield, and as part of Legislative Route 31 between New Bloomfield and Newport. PA 34 was designated in 1928 to run from US 15 (now US 15 Bus.) in Gettysburg north to US 11 in Carlisle along a paved road. The same year, the road between US 11 in Carlisle and PA 5 (now PA 274) Mecks Corner was designated as PA 33 while the road between Mecks Corner and US 22 (Juniata Parkway) east of Newport was designated as part of PA 5; the entire length of the road between Carlisle and Newport was paved. By 1930, Red Hill Road/Hunters Valley Road between Newport and US 11 south of Liverpool was an unnumbered unpaved road. In 1937, PA 34 was extended north from Carlisle to US 22 east of Newport, replacing the PA 33 designation between Carlisle and Mecks Corner and the PA 5 designation between Mecks Corner and Newport. In addition, Red Hill Road was paved between Newport and Bucks Valley Road. By 1941, Hunters Valley Road was paved between Cherry Road and US 11/US 15. The remainder of Red Hill Road/Hunters Valley Road was paved by 1960. In 1963, PA 34 was extended south from Gettysburg to US 15 near Fairplay, following the former alignment of US 15 after that route was moved to a bypass of Gettysburg. By 1966, the south end of the route reverted to its current location at US 15 Bus., with US 15 Bus. replacing the route to the south of Gettysburg. PA 34 was extended north from Newport to US 11/US 15 south of Liverpool in 1970.

Hector reformed the Rock and Roll Trio before starting two more short-lived bands, the Way of Life and the Mod Section, and went on to form the proto-punk band Crushed Butler in 1969 with drummer Darryl Read and bassist Alan Butler. After a brief flirtation with EMI Records, the band was renamed Tiger, until Darryl left to join the glam rock group Dizzy, then they changed name again to Helter- Skelter. With the addition of drummer Gary Anderson, the band became the Hammersmith Gorillas, taking their name from London's pro-Castro activist group the Hammersmith Guerillas. The band's debut release was a cover version of the Kinks' \\"You Really Got Me\\" on the Penny Farthing label, produced by Larry Page, and timed to coincide with the tenth anniversary of the original release.Korpar-Migrenne, Philippe (1998) \\"JESSE HECTOR & THE GORILLAS ‚Äì The Story\\", Damaged Goods Records They then signed to Chiswick Records, recording two singles for the label, and building a loyal fanbase, before moving on to Raw Records.Larkin, Colin (1992) \\"Gorillas\\", in The Guinness Who's Who of Indie and New Wave Music, Guinness Publishing, In 1976, they played at the Mont-de-Marsan Punk Festival in the south of France along with the Damned and Eddie and the Hot Rods.

They returned to Chiswick in the early 1980s for the \\"Move It\\" single, before splitting up after Butler died from injuries sustained in a horse riding accident. Hector continued to regularly perform live around London, working with a new band, Jesse Hector & The Sound, in the early 1990s, with bassist Kevin White and drummer Gilles Baillarguet. The band issued a single in 1991, \\"Leavin' Town\\" on the Clawfist label. When the group split in 1993, Hector assembled a new band, the Gatecrashers, named after a Gorillas single, contributing to several retro- garage rock compilations and releasing an EP in 2000, Keep on Moving.

He was the son of Murong Huang (Prince Wenming), and later served as the regent for his brother Murong Jun (Emperor Jingzhao)'s son Murong Wei (Emperor You).  Early life  Murong Ke was Murong Huang's fourth son, by his concubine Consort Gao. In the Book of Jin, Murong Ke was described as over 2.1 metres tall and had an imposing look when he was just 15 years old. In his youth, he became known for his deep-thinking and tolerance of others, but was not viewed highly by his father because his father did not favor his mother. Only after he turned 14, when his father began to be impressed by the strategies that he had, was he given important responsibilities. Sometime before 345, he was given the important defense post of Liaodong (ÈÅºÊù±, in modern Liaoyang, Liaoning) with the responsibility of defending the eastern border against Goguryeo. In 345, he was sent by Murong Huang to launch an attack on Goguyreo, and the attack was successful. In 346, formally under the command of his brother, the heir apparent Murong Jun, but with him in actual command, he attacked Buyeo (Fuyu (Â§´È§ò) in Chinese), capturing its capital and its king Fuyu Xuan (Â§´È§òÁéÑ). In 348, Murong Huang neared death, and he told Murong Jun that he should rely on his brother Murong Ke if he wanted to accomplish great things. He died soon thereafter and was succeeded by Murong Jun, who made Murong Ke one of his major generals.  During Murong Jun's reign  In 349, as rival Later Zhao was collapsing in light of internecine wars between the sons of the deceased emperor Shi Hu and his adoptive grandson Shi Min, Murong Jun, under the advice of another brother Murong Ba, planned an invasion into the North China Plain, and Murong Ke was one of the major generals for the planned invasion. In 350, Former Yan forces quickly captured Later Zhao's You Province (ÂπΩÂ∑û, modern Beijing, Tianjin, and northern Hebei). Murong Ke's military discipline was said to be so strict that not even trees and grass were harmed as his army marched through a region, and he quickly seized a number of commanderies in Ji Province (ÂÜÄÂ∑û, modern central Hebei) from Ran Wei, the new state established by Shi Min (who had by now changed his name to Ran Min, back to the family name that his father had before he was adopted by Shi Hu). In 352, Ran Min marched north, ready to engage Former Yan forces. Former Yan soldiers were apprehensive of Ran Min's reputation for being a fierce warrior, but Murong Ke devised a plan to trap Ran, whose forces were largely infantry and had been based in forests. Murong Ke pretended to repeatedly lose engagements, and Ran Wei forces were drawn into the plains. Murong Ke then put his cavalry into square formations, with horses locked in formations with chains, and the Ran Wei infantry could not stand the pressure and collapsed. Ran Min was still battling when his horse suddenly died, and he fell and was captured. Murong Jun executed him and then marched on to the Ran Wei capital Yecheng (ÈÑ¥Âüé), where Ran Min's wife Empress Dong, his crown prince Ran Zhi, and high level officials continued to try to fend off Former Yan for a while, but late in 352, Yecheng fell, and most of Ran Wei's territory fell to Former Yan. When Murong Jun then claimed imperial title, he created Murong Ke the Prince of Taiyuan in 353. During the next few years, as a number of former Later Zhao generals were still trying to maintain independence and vacillated between Former Yan, Former Qin, and Jin, Murong Ke was involved in a number of successful campaigns to destroy them or force their submission. These included campaigns against Su Lin (ËòáÊûó) in winter 352, Li Du (ÊùéÁä¢) in summer 353, and L√º Hu (ÂëÇË≠∑) in spring 354. In 356, Murong Ke further defeated Duan Kan (ÊÆµÈæï), the Jin vassal who had occupied Shandong Peninsula under the title Duke of Qi, sieging his heavily fortified capital Guanggu (Âª£Âõ∫, in modern Qingzhou, Shandong) and forcing his surrender. In 358, he repelled a Jin attack led by Zhuge You (Ë´∏ËëõÊî∏) and further counterattacked, seizing a number of Jin commanderies south of the Yellow River. Around new year 360, Murong Jun grew ill, and he told Murong Ke that since his 10-year-old son, Murong Wei the Crown Prince, was too young, and that the empire was facing threats from Jin and Former Qin, he was ready to pass the throne to Murong Ke. Murong Ke declined, persuading Murong Jun that if his abilities were capable of ruling over the empire, then they were also capable of assisting the young emperor. Murong Jun soon died, entrusting his son to Murong Ke, Yang Mu (ÈôΩÈû™), his uncle Murong Ping the Prince of Shangyong, and Muyu Gen (ÊÖïËºøÊ†π), but with Murong Ke as regent.  As regent for Murong Wei  Murong Ke soon had to face a challenge against Muyu Gen, who considered himself the senior official, having accomplished much during the reigns of Murong Huang and Murong Jun, and was unwilling to submit to the much younger Murong Ke. He first tried to create a rift by trying to persuade Murong Ke to take over the throne‚Äîwhich Murong Ke rebuked him about but declined to kill him despite suggestions to do so from Murong Chui (formerly known as Murong Ba) the Prince of Wu and Huangfu Zhen (ÁöáÁî´Áúü). Instead, Muyu then tried to persuade Murong Jun's wife Empress Dowager Kezuhun and the young emperor that Murong Ke and Murong Ping were planning a rebellion. Empress Dowager Kezuhun believed him, but the emperor did not and refused to authorize action. After Murong Ke heard about this, he executed Muyu and his coconspirators. With Murong Jun recently deceased and a major purge having followed, the officials in the Former Yan regime all were terrified, but Murong Ke calmed them by calm demeanor‚Äîincluding only having one servant accompany him wherever he went, without heavy guards. As far as his military command style was concerned, this was said about it in Sima Guang's Zizhi Tongjian: :Murong Ke did not rely on terrorizing his army with punishments, but relied on kindness and faithfulness. He calmed his soldiers and paid attention to important things, and did not micromanage. Everyone felt protected by order. In ordinary times, the military laws were relaxed, and it might appear as if he lacked discipline and could be defeated easily. Instead, reality was that he paid great care to defense, and enemies could not get close. Therefore, he never lost a battle. Indeed, in recorded history there was not a single mention that Murong Ke lost a battle. He was also described as a capable regent, being humble and willing to listen to suggestions. He did not deal out heavy punishments for officials' mistakes, and he consulted with Murong Ping on all important decisions. In 361, a magician much favored by the young emperor, Ding Jin (‰∏ÅÈÄ≤), tried to flatter Murong Ke by persuading him to kill Murong Ping and take all power. Murong Ke, instead, had the magician executed. Later that year, L√º Hu, whom Murong Ke had forced the surrender of years earlier, rebelled, and Murong Ke defeated him, forcing him to flee to Jin. In 364, Murong Ke led an army against Luoyang, which had been in Jin hands since 356. In 365, after a fierce attack, Luoyang fell, and he captured the Jin general Shen Jing (Ê≤àÂãÅ), whom he initially wanted to spare, but who continuously refused to submit and therefore whom his deputy Muyu Qian (ÊÖïËºøËôî) insisted on executing. Murong Ke, upon return to Yecheng, stated that he felt ashamed that he was unable to preserve Shen's life and allow his abilities to be used by Former Yan. In 366, both he and Murong Ping offered to resign their posts and return all authority to the 16-year-old emperor Murong Wei. Murong Wei declined. In 367, Murong Ke grew ill. He was afraid that a post that was part of his responsibility, the commander of the armies, would be given in an inappropriate person. He therefore tried to persuade Murong Wei's older brother Murong Zang (ÊÖïÂÆπËáß) the Prince of Le'an and Murong Ping that the post should be given to Murong Chui, whose abilities he was greatly impressed with (but who had been viewed with suspicion by Empress Dowager Kezuhun). On his death bed, he also tried to persuade the young emperor of the same thing. However, after he died later that year, Murong Ping disagreed and took most of the power, giving the commander of the armies post to Murong Wei's younger brother Murong Chong the Prince of Zhongshan. What Murong Ke feared happened, as with Murong Ping in charge, Former Qin destroyed Former Yan in 370, just three years after his death. (As Former Qin's capable prime minister Wang Meng approached the Former Yan capital Yecheng, his army showed the same discipline that Murong Ke's did, and the people joyously stated, \\"We have met the Prince of Taiyuan again!\\" Upon hearing this, Wang, who had been quite confident about his own abilities, became impressed at Murong Ke, and sent messengers to offer sacrifices to him.)

It rises on the southern edge of the Northern Black Forest at Kniebis near Bad Griesbach im Schwarzwald. The source farthest from the mouth is that of the Sch√∂ngrundb√§chle which rises at a height of around in the parish of Zuflucht near the old youth hostel. After flowing through its steep mountainside klinge it is joined by other streams to form, first, the Old (Alter), then the Wild Rench (Wilder Rench), which first becomes the Rench below Bad Griesbach. The Rench runs in a prominent southerly arc through the Central Black Forest and crosses the hilly region of Ortenau with its orchards and vineyards before breaking out into the Rhine Plain. After just under 57 km it discharges, together with the M√ºhlbach, into the Rhine at 314.7 km between Helmlingen (Rheinau) and Lichtenau. The upper Rench valley around Bad Peterstal-Griesbach initially cuts into the forested bunter sandstone plateaux before entering a more open, very rugged valley with steep relief, whose centre is the little town of Oppenau. There it is joined from the right by the Lierbach, well known for the All Saints Waterfalls. In Lautenbach the valley broadens suddenly into the Foothill Zone with the town of Oberkirch at the foot of the vineyards and the little town of Renchen, whose environs are dominated by orchards. The B 28 federal road, long an important transverse route across the Black Forest, runs through the Rench valley linking the Strasbourg area with the upper Neckar region. It climbs steeply above Bad Griesbach in hairpin bends to the Alexanderschanze (968 m). The Rench Valley Railway starts at Appenweier and runs as far as Bad Griesbach. It has also contributed to the development of the thermal baths in the Rench valley, which had already been established in the 16th century in Bad Griesbach, but which soon extended to Bad Antogast near Oppenau (especially for the nobility), Bad Peterstal and Bad Freiersbach (today part of Bad Peterstal-Griesbach). The \\"Rench Flood Canal\\" was built between 1936 and 1953 at the Acher Rench Correction to divert flood waters. It branches off the Rench at Erlach, picks up the Acher Canal at Rheinau and merges with the actual Rench at Memprechtshofen.

Svitlov√≥ds‚Äôk, ) is a city in central Ukraine located on the Dnieper River in the Kirovohrad Oblast. Administratively, Svitlovodsk is incorporated as a city of oblast significance. It also serves as the administrative center of Svitlovodsky Raion (district), to which it does not belong. Its population is approximately . In 1962 - 1969 the city carried the name Kremhes due to the fact that it is a city-satellite of Kremenchuk. Cannon monument in Svitlovodsk Palace of Culture War memorial Kremenchuk dam History The city was developed and spread outward from the dam. The original point of the city was to house all of the dam workers and to be near the dam. Now most of the electricity is generated from the dam and is used in the town. The definite start of the city was the 1950s ‚Äî before that, Svetlovodsk (literally - Bright Waterway) didn't exist, the name was invented by Khrushchev's regime, to replace the town of Novogeorgievsk that was in the flood plain of the new hydro-electric station. When the dam was done, the then Soviet leader Khrushchev attended the opening ceremonies, the city started to expand with all of the energy. It expanded westward along the coast and generally, the wester the city, the more recent it is. In local culture, the city is known as Old City and New City, but, of course it is still the same Svetlovodsk. The reason for having such a power plant out in the middle of nowhere was simple: the power was needed for smelting of defense industry grade metals and alloys, the facility being \\"Secret\\" for many years, but is still operating today as a private enterprise. Environment The area around Svetlovodsk is relatively clean. The city itself has many plants and trees, the most noted is the rows of trees that go linear to Lenin Street. The city has itself been old and has some examples of old trees. The area around the city is relatively clean, mostly being small villages and forest. The one noted polluting facility is the smelter. It's been operating for decades, without any pollution controls during the Soviet era, and with little control from the current Ukrainian government. Generations of people were exposed to heavy metals pollution, though no definite studies are known to exist. The reservoir has been polluted for years, and in summertime green algae takes over parts of it, producing fish-kills and introducing odors to the area. Transportation The transportation in the city is limited to buses and a train the runs along the dam and goes to village. There are plenty of private run bus lines, using mini buses, though the main buses still work. There is a working bus station near the east side of the city. Highlights of the city The townhall is in the \\"Old Svitlovodsk\\" area, the eternal fire memorial is just below near the airplane memorial. The city is a birthplace of the Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko and Ukrainian politician Mykola Martynenko. The market is located in the \\"New Svitlovodsk, featuring lots of goods for buying and selling. There are two monuments near the market. Below them are a series of water fountains that go downward. There is a bus top near the dam where buses depart to many locations, as well a train station.

A colorful individual and an ambitious writer, he was \\"an American with a great mission,\\" in the words of his friend, the critic Benjamin De Casseres, and that mission was to educate Americans about the best cultural achievements, native and European, of his time. From 1892 to 1899, he was the husband of the sculptor Clio Hinton.Woman's who's who of America, 1914-15 Biography Huneker was born in Philadelphia. Forced by his parents to study law, he knew that a legal career was not what he wanted; he was passionately interested in music and writing, hoping one day to be a concert pianist and a novelist. At twenty-one, he abandoned his office job and Philadelphia ties and (with his pregnant girlfriend, then wife) left for Paris, telling his parents that he was departing only the night before the ship sailed.Schwab, p. 18. Biographical information for this entry is taken from Schwab's biography, the only full-length study of Huneker's life and career. On a tight budget supplemented with money his parents sent, he studied piano under Leopold Doutreleau in Paris and audited the piano class of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin's pupil Georges Mathias. He also began a lifelong immersion in European art and literature and was thrilled to catch sight on his wanderings through the city of Victor Hugo, Ivan Turgenev, Gustave Flaubert, Guy de Maupassant, and √âmile Zola as well as √âdouard Manet and Edgar Degas.Schwab, p. 23. That year abroad changed Huneker's life. Huneker and his wife and child returned to Philadelphia the following year, but he was never happy again in his native city and longed for the wider stage of New York, where he hoped to try his luck as a journalist while he continued his study of music. He moved to New York City in 1886, having abandoned his wife and child.Schwab, p. 34. There he scraped by, giving piano lessons and living a downtown bohemian life, while he studied with Franz Liszt's student Rafael Joseffy, who became his friend and mentor. (Huneker's musical gods were Liszt, Chopin, and Brahms. He published a biography of Chopin in 1900 and wrote the commentary on Chopin's complete works for Schirmer's music publishing company. His analysis of the piano solo works of Johannes Brahms, written shortly after that composer's complete works were published posthumously, is still highly regarded.) By the 1890s, after finally giving up his dream of a music career for himself, he was working full-time as a freelance critic responsible for covering the music, art, and theater scene of New York. A voracious reader, he also became a prolific and entertaining book reviewer. In the history of American journalism, Huneker is principally associated with the New York Sun, a lively, respected New York daily which prided itself on its opinionated political commentary and extensive coverage of the arts. He was the paper's music critic from 1900‚Äì1902 and its art critic from 1906‚Äì1912. He also published in a range of high-circulation and small-press journals, both mainstream and avant-garde, over a thirty-year period: e.g., Harper's Bazaar, M'lle. New York, Metropolitan Magazine, North American Review, Puck, Reedy's Mirror, Scribner's Magazine, The Smart Set, Theatre and Town Topics. His reviews, columns, and interviews with major artistic figures from various magazines and newspapers were reprinted in several books published by Charles Scribner between 1904 and 1920. Yearly trips to Europe throughout his life also afforded James Gibbons Huneker the opportunity to report to Americans on new developments in the visual and performing arts. In an age of largely parochial criticism, he was more sophisticated and knowledgeable about modern art and music than many of his colleagues, and he saw himself as a someone who was explicitly working for America's cultural coming-of-age. Huneker was known for his passionate enthusiasms, self-taught erudition, and sometimes extravagant prose style. Gustave Moreau's art \\"recalls an antique chryselephantine stature, a being rigid with precious gems, pasted with strange colors...yet charged with the author's magnetism...possessing a strange feverish beauty.\\"James Gibbons Huneker, Promenades of an Impressionist (Scribners, 1910), p. 352. A critic was one who \\"sits down to a Barmecide feast, to see, to smell, but not to taste the celestial manna vouchsafed by the gods.\\"Schwab, p. 96. At other times, Huneker wrote with admirable brevity and acuity: Ernest Lawson's landscapes were created with \\"a palette of crushed jewels,\\" and the Ash can painter George Luks was \\"the Charles Dickens of the East Side.\\" At a time when conservative tastes dominated American cultural life, he stated his credo boldly in a New York Sun column in 1908: \\"Let us try to shift the focus when a new man comes into our ken. Let us study each man according to his temperament and not ask ourselves whether he chimes in with other men's music. The giving of marks in schoolmaster's fashion should have become obsolete centuries ago. To miss modern art is to miss all the thrill and excitement our present life holds.\\"New York Sun (2/9/08), p. 8. Part of Huneker's notoriety in his day was connected to the flamboyant persona he established. He was known as a tirelessly social man with an enormous capacity for liquor and stimulating conversation, which (given his extensive erotic experiences) could be quite ribald. His friend H. L. Mencken described his dinner table conversation as \\"a really amazing compound of scandalous anecdotes, shrewd judgments, and devastating witticisms.\\"Mencken, p. 15. Numerous memoirs from the period recall him as an unforgettable personality. Huneker's last years were spent in financially straitened circumstances. He continued reviewing concerts to the end of his life, but his freelance work, however prolific, had never afforded him a large income and the sales figures for his many books were moderate at best. He died in New York City of pneumonia in 1921, at the age of sixty-four. He was survived by his second wife and one child, his son by his first marriage. Music critic In the 1880s, Huneker served as the music editor of the Musical Courier, followed by stints with the New York Sun, the New York World, the New York Times, and the Philadelphia Press. In his columns, he proselytized for Richard Wagner, Claude Debussy, Richard Strauss and Arnold Schoenberg, long before their work was generally accepted, and wrote about all of the major conductors and opera singers of his time. He was a particular (sometimes obsessive) fan of the opera singer Mary Garden, renowned for her singing in Pell√©as and M√©lisande and Thais, whom he called \\"an orchidaceous Circe...the nearest approach to Duse on the lyric stage.\\"Schwab, p. 257. He expressed reservations that have not stood the test of time, believing that the music of Giacomo Puccini and Sergei Prokofiev would eventually fall out of favor, but many of his judgments have proved prescient. Art critic Though his love of Renaissance art, especially the Flemish realism of Hans Memling and Jan van Eyck, had been formed in his early trips to Europe and often guided his tastes, Huneker was appreciative of the new, more experimental art of Post-Impressionists like Paul Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh, Henri de Toulouse- Lautrec, Odilon Redon, and Henri Matisse and, among Americans, the modern artists of Alfred Stieglitz's circle (e.g., John Marin, Marsden Hartley), the African-American Impressionist Henry Ossawa Tanner, and the realists of the Ashcan School. He was close friends with the Ash Can painter George Luks, whom he regarded as one of the greatest of American painters. As one more radical school of art followed another in the pre-World War I period, though, Huneker's openness was sorely tested. The famous Armory Show of 1913, America's first large-scale introduction to modernism, presented him with formidable challenges; he did not find much to praise in Paul C√©zanne or the Cubists, Futurists, or Dadaists. Picasso always remained a mystery to him, and he felt that his friend Alfred Stieglitz had made a grave mistake in exhibiting the work of the modern primitive Henri Rousseau, whose work he found \\"pathetically ludicrous.New York Sun (12/4/10), p. 4. Literary critic Huneker's support of the new realism of Theodore Dreiser, Stephen Crane, and Frank Norris put him in the forefront of literary critics c. 1900-1910; he was on particularly friendly terms with Dreiser, having praised Sister Carrie and helped Dreiser with his revisions of Jennie Gerhardt.Schwab, p. 199-200. A reader of eclectic tastes, he also wrote in praise of Friedrich Nietzsche, Anatole France, Thomas Hardy, George Moore, Maxim Gorky, Joseph Conrad, Edith Wharton, and Jules Laforgue. Forty years before the Henry James revival, he proclaimed James the greatest American novelist. He was the first American literary critic to review, in 1917, James Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.Schwab, p. 240. He was energetically outspoken about literary censorship and the failure of American publishers to provide readers with the sophisticated publications literate Europeans took for granted. He was uncomfortable on the subject of homosexuality, however, which left him in the end feeling skeptical about the merits of Walt Whitman and Oscar Wilde. (Huneker was a fiction writer himself, publishing two volumes of short stories, Melomaniacs and Visionaries, and in the last year of his life published a racy novel, Painted Veils.) Theater critic Huneker's tastes in drama were particularly modern. He recommended Henrik Ibsen, August Strindberg, Anton Chekhov, George Bernard Shaw (intermittently), Gerhart Hauptmann, Arthur Schnitzler, and Frank Wedekind to American audiences long before most theatergoers were ready to accept their works. Wedekind's Spring's Awakening especially appealed to him as \\"a milestone in the modern theater's fight against sexual taboos.\\"Schwab, p. 211. He took particular pleasure in describing and praising the talented actresses of the day (e.g., Sarah Bernhardt, Eleanora Duse, Alla Nazimova, Julia Marlowe, Minnie Fiske) when they took on challenging roles. He deplored the fact that the American stage was largely given up to \\"eye and ear tickling\\" while a dramatic renaissance was taking place abroad.Schwab, p. 73. Edith Wharton, who regularly read his reviews, thought Huneker \\"a breath of fresh air blowing through the stale atmosphere of the theatre.\\"Schwab, p. 145.

History The city was established by the Polish colonization of the Dzikie polie in 1615 as Krylow (), part of the Korsun starosta. The settlement was established on the right bank of Dnieper near Tiasmyn river. Some historical facts state that the residents of the city in 1616 accounted for 200 courts and implying of population of some 1200 people. At that time the settlement received the Magdeburg rights. It also received a status of sloboda which excused the city of a land tax for the next 30 years. The by court registration of the city in 1631 accounted for 50 settled houses and 200 estates. During the Cossack uprisings in the mid 17th century the city suffered from the numerous attacks. Since the partition of Poland, the city was transferred to the Russian Empire. In 1795 became the city of Aleksandria, Russian Empire. Several years prior to that in the city was based the Myrhorod Regiment and in 1741 the city accounted for 400 courts with 2000 population. In 1752-1764 was one of the two major cities of the New Serbia and housed one company of the Pandury Regiment. In 1808 the city accounted only for some 45 courts with 550 residents. In 1860 the city was renamed Novogeorgievsk. It was part of the Aleksandriysky Uyezd of Kherson Governorate. In 1894 the city accounted for 1634 courts (12653 residents) and 350 desiatinas of land. There were three Russian Orthodox churches, a synagogue, a church school, two middle schools, a hospital, eleven factories and other. During the World War I the city housed the Crimean Cavalry Regiment and the Eighth Reserve Cavalry Regiment of the Russian Army. The city was one of the battlegrounds during the war and was protected by a citadel and an unfinished belt of forts. Evacuation of its inhabitants, however, came too late because the trains were deployed to evacuate Warsaw. An account cited that 85,000 prisoners were taken at Novogeorgievsk by the Germans. In 1959-1961 after the construction of the Kremenchuk HES the population of the city was evacuated to Svitlovodsk as its territory has been flooded. The city was part of the territory, which included 9,900 homesteads, that was destroyed because of the reservoir. Some parts of the city that stayed on the higher lands were preserved and transformed into the village of Nahirne (today in Svitlovodsk Raion).

It was established by the Philippine government on July 22, 1916, during the American Occupation. The bank was acquired by tycoon Lucio Tan after it was privatized by the government, and became the first universal bank in the Philippines in 1980. After its merger with the Tan-owned Allied Bank on February 9, 2013, PNB became fifth largest private domestic bank in the country. To date, PNB has a total domestic footprint of 713 branches and more than 1,400 ATMs strategically located nationwide. PNB maintains its position as the Philippine bank with the most extensive international reach with more than 70 overseas branches, representative offices, remittance centers and subsidiaries across Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and North America. History Philippine National Bank, 50 Centavos (1917). Emergency circulating note for World War I. =Early years= The Philippine National Bank was established as a government-owned banking institution on July 22, 1916. Its primary mandate was to provide financial services to Philippine industry and agriculture and support the government's economic development effort. World War I, then raging in Europe, generated huge demand for the country's major exports namely: sugar, copra, coconut oil, Manila hemp and tobacco. However, not much was being done to develop the industries that produced these sought-after crops since access to credit facilities was limited. To solve this problem, Henderson Martin, Vice Governor of the Philippines, together with Miguel Cuaderno (who later became Central Bank governor) drafted a charter for a national bank. On February 4, 1916, Public Act 2612 was passed by the Philippine Legislature providing for the establishment of PNB to replace the small P1 million government-owned Agricultural Bank. PNB's first head office was the Masonic Temple along Escolta, Manila, the \\"Wall Street of the Philippines\\" then, in the bustling district of Santa Cruz in Manila. An American, Henry Parker Willis, was its first president. With PNB's establishment, Filipinos had a bank of their own. PNB was authorized to grant short and long-term loans to agriculture and industry. Filipino farmers then could avail of loans with interest between 8% to 10% per annum. PNB was also authorized to receive deposits, open foreign credits and rediscount bills. On July 24, 1916, PNB established its first branch outside Manila in Iloilo. In 1917, PNB opened its first non-Philippine branch in New York. The following year, it established five more domestic branches and another outside the Philippines in Shanghai, China. =As the de facto Central Bank and National Treasury= PNB has also functioned as the de facto Central Bank of the Philippines until 1949. It was given the special power to issue circulating notes. PNB briefly ceased operations in January 1942 but reopened the next month under the supervision of Japanese authorities. After the Second World War, PNB reopened immediately and acquired the assets and assumed the liabilities of the banking division of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. With the establishment of the Central Bank in 1949, PNB's role as issuer of currency notes, custodianship of bank reserves, sole depository of government funds and clearing house of the banking system ceased. =PNB investments= In 1955, it was authorized to operate as an investment bank with powers to own shares and to issue debentures. In 1963, it established the National Investment and Development Corporation to engage primarily in long-term and equity financing of business ventures. PNB transferred to its new Head Office along Escolta in 1966 and launched the first on-line Electronic Data Processing System in the Far East. Between 1967 and 1979, PNB opened offices in London, Singapore, Jakarta, Honolulu and Amsterdam, and 14 provincial branches. It also started the Dollar Remittance Program. In 1980, PNB became the first universal bank in the country. However, it encountered difficulties in the mid-80s as a result of the economic downturn triggered by the assassination of Senator Benigno S. Aquino Jr. and in 1986 received assistance from the government. For a while the bank was headed by Roberto Benedicto, a classmate of President Ferdinand Marcos and the head of the sugar industry monopoly. He also owned Overseas California Bank in Los Angeles, California, along with Marcos. In 1990, Benedicto agreed to turn over ownership of that bank to the Philippine government in return for criminal racketeering and conspiracy charges against him being dropped. PNB bought the bank for $10 million and merged it into their Century Bank affiliate in Los Angeles.Marcos Crony Agrees to Surrender L.A. Bank : Philippines: In return, the U.S. will drop charges. Prosecutors say firm was created to launder money. Los Angeles Times April 26, 1990Other News: Two Filipino-Owned Banks Are Merging Los Angeles Times May 15, 1992 =Privatization= The privatization started in 1989 when 30 per cent of its shares were offered to the public and it was listed on the stock exchange. In 1992, PNB became the first Philippine bank to reach P100 billion in assets. Later that year, privatization continued with a second public offering of its shares. In 1995, PNB moved to its headquarters to the PNB Financial Center, Central Boulevard (now Diosdado Macapagal Boulevard), Pasay. In 1996, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the Bank's new Articles of Incorporation and by-laws and the change in the status of PNB from a government-based to a private corporation with the control of the government reduced to 46 per cent. =21st century= In early 2000, the Lucio Tan Group became the single biggest private stockholder. In less than one year, the group pumped nearly P20 billion of fresh capital into the bank. In late 2000, when PNB suffered huge withdrawals, mainly from the government accounts, the government provided P25 billion in financial aid. In May 2002, the Philippine government and Lucio Tan signed an agreement to swap the government's loans to shares. The accord increased the government's stake to 45 percent from 16 percent and reduced Lucio Tan's holding to 45 percent from 67 percent. Lucio Tan and the government also agreed that year to sell three-quarters of their combined stake within five years. Also the same year, PNB hired 40-year old Lorenzo V. Tan as its youngest bank President. Following the senior management's Good Bank-Bad Bank strategy, PNB finally posted an income of P52 million (as restated from an earlier reported figure of P168 million, due to changes in Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) in 2003, after several years of being in the red. The bank was able to repeat this feat and reported an income of P353 million by end-2004. In August 2005, PNB became fully privatized. The joint sale by the Philippine government and the Lucio Tan Group of the 67% stake in PNB was completed within the third quarter of 2005. The Lucio Tan Group exercised its right to match the P 43.77 per share bid offered by a competitor and purchased the shares owned by the government. The completion of sale is expected to speed up the development of PNB's franchise and operational competitiveness. Despite being fully privatized, PNB continued to be a government depository bank until May 3, 2007. ATMs in Baguio PNB has remittance centers in the United States, Canada, England, Spain, the Netherlands, France, Germany, Austria, Italy, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia and in countries in the Middle East. PNB has also stepped up its marketing efforts to overseas Filipino workers with its PNB Global Filipino Money Card. Complementing PNB's banking activities are its subsidiaries like PNB General Insurers, a non-life insurance company; PNB Capital, an investment bank; PNB Securities, a stock brokerage outfit and PNB Forex, which engages in foreign exchange trading. It also has a majority stake in PNB-Japan Leasing Corp. For life insurance requirements of PNB clients, it has a substantial equity stake in Beneficial PNB Life. Merger with Allied Banking Corporation On December 7, 2007, the Supreme Court of the Philippines affirmed a judgment dismissing the state's sequestration of Lucio Tan's companies: \\"There can be no question that indeed, petitioner's (the government's) orders of sequestration are void and have no legal effect.\\" The landmark decision would trigger a planned merger between PNB and Tan's own Allied Banking Corporation. Edgar Bancod, research head, ATR-Kim Eng Securities, stated that the merged bank would become the country's 4th biggest after Metrobank, Banco de Oro, and Bank of the Philippine Islands.Supremecourt.gov.ph, G.R. Nos. 173553-56, PCGG vs. Lucio Tan, First Division, Dec. 7, 2007 On December 12, 2007, official statements from PNB and Allied Bank confirmed the impending merger of both banks by early 2008. In August 2009, PNB and Allied Bank were expected to complete their merger within the next six to nine months after the latter sells its 28% stake in California-based Oceanic Bank.\\"PNB targets Chinese remittances\\" As of July 7, 2010, the remaining stumbling block to the merger was addressed as the latter found a buyer for its minority stake in a California-based bank.\\"Last obstacle to PNB-Allied Bank merger removed\\" The move is seen to pave the way for the merger.\\"Allied Bank sells stake in US-based Oceanic Bank\\" On February 9, 2013, the PNB-Allied Bank merger was completed, with Philippine National Bank as the surviving brand. The merged bank became the 4th largest private domestic bank. Tarriela will be the chairman and Mier will be the chief executive of the merged bank.

Teachings He was a contemporary of Rabbi Ammi. He rarely discussed Halakhot, and his discussions of them were not original.Shabbat 64b Once he recited a Halakhah in the patriarch's mansion, without naming its author, which provoked Ammi to ask: \\"Is it his own?

Thus, to explain the juxtaposition of the laws of sacrifice and priestly vestments,Exodus 28-29 he argues that the priestly vestments were to provide atonement just as the sacrifices do. He represents the miter as atoning for haughtiness, and cites R. Chanina as saying, \\"That which rests highest on the priest atones for one's considering himself high\\"; and similarly with the rest of the priestly garments.Zevachim 88b; Arachin 16a; compare Yerushalmi Yoma 7 44b; Leviticus Rabbah 10 Referring to God's appearance in the burning bushExodus 3:2-4 he remarks, \\"The Holy One‚Äîblessed be He!‚Äîsaid to Moses, 'When I will it, one of my angels stretches forth his hand from heaven and reaches to the ground,' as Scripture says,Ezekiel 8:3 'He put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head'; and when it so pleases me, I make three angels sit under one tree;Genesis 18:4 when I choose, my glory fills the universe, as it is written,Jeremiah 23:24 'Do I not fill heaven and earth? says the Lord'; and when I so willed, I spoke to Job in a whirlwind, as it is saidJob 38:1, 40:6 \\"The Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind\\"\\".Exodus Rabbah 3, where the interpretation is somewhat forced The same idea, though in different form, is found elsewhereGenesis Rabbah 4, Pesikta Rabbati 1:47 in the name of R.

The family considers the city of Ban√≠ (Province of Peravia) as the center of its Dominican heritage. In 2020, they welcomed King Juan Carlos I, monarch emeritus of Spain, who stayed in a magnificent complex of the Franjul family. Origins The origins of the family can be traced to the region of Asturias, Spain. Members of the family emigrated to the Dominican Republic in the 19th century, and settled in the small town of Bani, in the Dominican province of Peravia, west of the Dominican capital of Santo Domingo. Dominican historians consistently argue about the Family's origins. Some have recently argued that the phonetics of the surname is one of Arab descent, which implies the family is one of Moorish descent. The Moors were the medieval Muslim inhabitants of al-Andalus (the Iberian Peninsula including the present day Spain and Portugal) and the Maghreb, whose culture is often also called \\"Moorish\\". The first Dominican-born member of the family was Francisco Fanjul, whose father became a naturalized Dominican citizen after the Dominican Republic gained its independence from Haiti in 1844. It was then when, because of a misunderstanding in pronunciation, the family name was mistakenly changed from \\"Fanjul\\" to \\"Franjul\\" in official census records of the time. Other members of the family settled in Cuba, and later fled to the United States after Fidel Castro took power in 1959. While family members in the Dominican Republic became the \\"Franjul\\" family, those who settled in Cuba remained as \\"Fanjul\\". Today most members of the Franjul family reside in the Dominican Republic. The first family reunion between the \\"Franjuls\\" and \\"Fanjuls\\" took place in 1995 in La Romana, Dominican Republic. Although the surname \\"Franjul\\" is also known to exist among families in the Balkans, no links have been proven to exist.

Along with cities of Shakhtarsk and Torez, it is surrounded by Shakhtarsk Raion, according to the regional territorial division. The eastern edge of Snizhne is adjacent to administrative border of Luhansk Oblast. Its population is approximately . History The settlement was established in 1784 as a \\"winter place\\" Vasylivka (Vasilyevka) by Don Cossacks and was part of the Taganrog city municipality. In 1864 it was renamed as Snizhne/Snezhnoye which literally means Snowy. During the 2014 pro- Russian unrest in Ukraine the town was held by separatists. On July 15, 2014, rockets from an unidentified aircraft struck the town hitting an apartment building and a tax office, leaving at least eleven people dead and eight injured. Separatists blamed the Ukrainian Air Force for the attack, but Ukrainian sources denied it and stated that since the incident where an An-26 plane was shot down on July 14, 2014, they have carried out no flights there.

The protocol is named for the islet transplantation group at the University of Alberta in the Canadian city of Edmonton, where the protocol was first devised in the late 1990s, and published in The New England Journal of Medicine in July 2000. Procedure The Edmonton protocol involves isolating islets from a cadaveric donor pancreas using a mixture of enzymes called Liberase (Roche). Each recipient receives islets from one to as many as three donors. The islets are infused into the patient's portal vein, and are then kept from being destroyed by the recipient's immune system through the use of two immunosuppressants, sirolimus and tacrolimus as well as a monoclonal antibody drug used in transplant patients called daclizumab. History Islet isolation and transplantation was pioneered by Paul Lacy throughout the 1960s. He and Walter Ballinger together were able to restore normoglycaemia in diabetic rats following the transplantation of isolated islets into the rodent's livers. Scientists have not yet successfully translated Lacy's success in rodents to humans. The Edmonton protocol was primarily developed by James Shapiro (transplant surgeon), Jonathan Lakey Ph.D., Dr Edmond Ryan (endocrinologist), Gregory Korbutt Ph.D., Dr. Ellen Toth, Dr. Garth Warnock, Dr. Norman Kneteman, and Ray Rajotte Ph.D., at the University of Alberta Hospital and the Surgical-Medical Research Institute. The first patient was treated using the Edmonton protocol in March 1999. The protocol was first published in the New England Journal of Medicine in July 2000. The NEJM report was exciting for the diabetes field because the seven patients undergoing the Edmonton protocol remained insulin- independent after an average of 12 months. Current review It has been reported that of thirty-six patients transplanted, only sixteen (44%) were insulin-independent after one year; ten (28%) had partial graft function after one year; and ten (28%) had complete graft loss after one year. Insulin independence is not usually sustainable in the long term, but the transplanted islets still function enough to provide protection from severe hypoglycemic episodes and unawareness. A webpage maintained by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) indicates that the Collaborative Islet Transplant Registry's 2010 annual report :presented data on 571 patients who received pancreatic islet allo-transplants between 1999 and 2009. ... [A]bout 60 percent of transplant recipients achieved insulin independence‚Äîdefined as being able to stop insulin injections for at least 14 days‚Äîduring the year following transplantation. : :By the end of the second year, 50 percent of recipients were able to stop taking insulin for at least 14 days. However, long-term insulin independence is difficult to maintain, and eventually most recipients needed to start taking insulin again. : :The report identified factors linked to better outcomes for recipients, including : : age‚Äî35 years or older : lower pre-transplant [serum] triglyceride, or blood fat, levels : lower pre-transplant insulin use : :The report noted that even partial function of the transplanted islets can improve blood glucose control and reduce the amount of insulin needed after loss of insulin independence. The major problem limiting islet transplantation therapy for type 1 diabetic individuals is the lack of organ donors. Citing the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, a NIDDK webpage says that \\"in 2011 there were about 8,000 deceased organ donors available in the United States. However, only 1,562 pancreases were recovered from donors in 2011. Also, many donated pancreases are not suitable for extracting islets for transplants because they do not meet the selection criteria, and islets are often damaged or destroyed during processing. Therefore, only a small number of islet transplants can be performed each year. \\"Since 2000, Several hundred people have received islet transplants, by a year after transplant, 50 - 68% of patients do not need to receive additional insulin, but by five years after the procedure, fewer than 10% of total patients are free of daily insulin supplementation.\\"Hole's Essentials of Human Anatomy & Physiology, Tenth Edition pg 309 References Further reading * Shapiro AMJ, Lakey JRT, Ryan EA, Korbutt GS, Toth E, Warnock GL, Kneteman NM, Rajotte RV.

Signed with the pen-name Rob- Vel, the story was titled Groom au Moustic‚Äìh√¥tel (Bellboy at the Hotel Mosquito, named after another of Dupuis magazines). Later the same year, he created Spirou's inseparable companion, the squirrel Spip, for the story L‚Äôh√©ritage. When Velter was drafted and wounded in 1940, his wife Davine (Blanche Dumoulin) took over the strip for a while. After the war, Velter published a number of strips, including Le P√®re Pictou, Les Tribulations du Chien Petto, Bibor et Tribar and M. Subito, but he was never able to reach the broad popularity of Spirou again.

The club was founded on 13 June 1904 by the sons of the more well- heeled residents of the city as a rival to the worker-based club SV Sodingen.  History  After World War I and occupation of the Ruhr by the French in 1923, the club was dissolved, but still carried on unofficially. It was reconstituted in 1925 through fusion with Fortuna Herne to play as Westfalia Fortuna Herne. The union was good for the club, which advanced to upper league play in 1930, and made it as far as the semi-finals in the national championship the next season. When German football was reorganized under the Third Reich, Herne was not selected for play in the first tier Gauliga Westfalen, but did manage to play their way into the premier circuit the next year. They competed at that level until the collapse of the league system at the end of World War II. After the war, Herne again found itself left out of the newly re-organized upper league until they managed to earn promotion in 1954. They then went on to win the Oberliga West in 1959 and finish second in 1960, but did not have much success in the subsequent national championship playoff rounds. Despite delivering consistently solid results in the post-war period, the club missed qualifying for the Bundesliga ‚Äì Germany's new professional football league ‚Äì in 1963 with an unexpectedly poor finish in the 1962‚Äì63 season that saw the team relegated.The Abseits Guide to German Soccer Sixteen years of mediocre play in tiers II and III followed.

When the firm went bankrupt in late 1979 the club was forced to withdraw after just one match of the 1979‚Äì80 season. They picked up play next season in the Amateur Oberliga Westfalen (III) before slipping again, this time to the IV and V level divisions. The club was promoted after the 2005‚Äì06 season and played in the Oberliga Westfalen (V). On 22 October 2009 the club announced its bankruptcyWestfalia Herne droht die Insolvenz through its Chairman Horst Haneke to the media. Westfalia survived to play in the NRW-Liga from 2008 to 2012 after the Oberliga Westfalen was disbanded.

It is endemic to S√£o Miguel Island, in the Azores archipelago of Macaronesia in the North Atlantic Ocean. Taxonomy The Azores bullfinch was first described in 1866 by British ornithologist Frederick Godman. It was formerly regarded as a subspecies of the Eurasian bullfinch (Pyrrhula pyrrhula), but was split off in 1993.BLI (2009).British Birds According to a 2001 study by Arnaiz-Villena et al. all birds belonging to the genus Pyrrhula originated from the pine grosbeak. Description The bullfinch has a length of 15‚Äì17 cm and a weight of about 30 g, with males being slightly larger than females.BLI factsheetSPEA: PrioloRamos (1998) Relative to most other finches in its family it is plump, with shorter wings and a longer tail. The plumage pattern is similar to that of the Eurasian bullfinch, though colouration is more sombre, lacking its bright pink underparts. It has a black cap, face, wings and tail; the rest being greyish or pale grey-brown. Males and females are virtually identical in appearance, though males may exhibit a faint pinkish suffusion on the belly and flanks.Ramos (1995), p. 5. The contact call is a distinctive short, flute-like, melancholic whistle.SPEA: Priolo Distribution and habitat The bullfinch is now largely restricted to a small area (c. 580 haRamos (1995), p. 6.) of native laurisilva forest at the eastern end of S√£o Miguel, 300‚Äì-800 m asl, mainly centred on Pico da Vara in the Serra da Tronqueira range, but also seasonally (September to December) around Salto do Cavalo, further westwards in the range. The latter population probably comprises juveniles following post-fledging dispersal. The species has never been recorded from the western end of the island.Ramos (1995), pp.3‚Äì4. Necessary for the recovery of the Azores bullfinch is to restore its available ecological enclaves in the northern archipelago of Macaronesia. The process of species decline, which a significant portion of other endemic Azorean flora is also suffering, is favored by the expansion of invasive alien plants. Projects dedicated to saving the Azores bullfinch include the restoration of original laurel forest habitat, in the eastern monteverde of S√£o Miguel.http://www.alimochefuerteventura.com/documentos/los-ultimos-guirres-de- canarias.pdf Behaviour =Breeding= Breeding takes place from mid June to late August. Nests are built in dense vegetation in laurel forest, with two nests recorded as being 3 m above the ground, and are similar to those of the Eurasian bullfinch. Nests are double-layered with an outer layer of twigs and an inner one of grass, rootlets and moss.Ramos (2000) The clutch size is unknown. Young birds fledge from mid July, with the adults moulting from September onwards. =Feeding= The bullfinch's diet is mainly herbivorous, with the birds consuming a range of seeds, fruits, flower buds, fern sporangia and fronds (unusual in birds), and moss tips, as well as some invertebrates such as hemiptera. Native vegetation is preferred although, when the range was more extensive in the 19th century, the species was considered to be a pest in orange orchards around Furnas.Ramos (1995), pp. 4‚Äì5. The bullfinches move up and downslope through their range according to food availability during the year. Lily of the valley tree (Clethra arborea) contributes to the bullfinch's diet. This evergreen shrub or small tree, once believed to be endemic to Madeira but now known to have existed in the past on the Canary Islands (where it is considered extinct), raises questions about how it should be treated in the Azores. While it is considered exotic, it is possible that it was native to the Azores, disappeared from there before any botanist had the chance to record it, and was then reintroduced more recently. Despite being an \\"alien\\" species, it is a notable element of the bird's diet and therefore plays some role in its survival. Status and conservation The population of the bullfinch is small; it was estimated to comprise 30‚Äì40 pairs in the late 1970s, 100 pairs in 1989, and between 60 and 200 pairs in the early 1990s, though in 2008 it was estimated at 775 individuals.Ceia (2008) It is the most threatened passerine bird and the second rarest bird behind the northern bald ibis in Europe. The population was once larger, and spread over a wider range, but both numbers and range have declined since the 1920s following the destruction of areas of its forest habitat for grazing and agriculture, as well as afforestation and invasion by introduced plants, especially Japanese cedar.Ramos (1995), p. 4. The entire range of the species is protected as a Special Protection Area, the Pico da Vara / Ribeira do Guilherme SPA (a Natura 2000 site), under European Union legislation. The main approach to conserving the species is the protection and restoration of threatened native laurel forest vegetation.

Administratively, Pavlohrad is incorporated as the town of oblast significance and serves as the administrative center of Pavlohrad Raion which it does not belong to. Its population is approximately . The rivers of Vovcha (runs through the city towards the Samara River), Hnizdka (), Kocherha () flow through Pavlohrad. The area of the city is . There are 20 schools and 1 lyceum in the city.  History  Pavlohrad is one of the oldest settlements in Dnipropetrovsk oblast. The first references to it are from the 17th century. At the beginning of the 1770s, Zaporozhian Cossack Matvii Khizhnyak built winter quarters, which soon became known as sloboda Matviivka. In 1779, Matveevka was renamed to Luhanske, as the latter became headquarters of the Luhansk pikemen regiment headed by M. I. Golinishchev-Kutuzov. With the establishment of Yekaterinoslav Viceroyalty in 1783, Pavlohrad, named in honor of the future Emperor Paul –Ü (), became a part of this administrative unit as a district town. In 1784, Pavlohrad received city status. There were 426 homes and 2419 inhabitants in the city at the end of 18th century. The citizens of Pavlohrad lived in wattle and daub. The first stone building was the Svyato-Vosnesensky Cathedral on Soborna ploshcha (eng.: cathedral square). The first blazon of the city was affirmed on July 29, 1811, the second one on September 26, 1979. The first citizens were Cossacks of Samarsky and Kalmiussky Palanki and demobilized military. The city plan by Scottish architect W. Geste was affirmed by emperor Nicholas I on July 31, 1831. Litvinskiy house In 1871, local merchant A.K.Shalin was elected the first head of the city. The central street was named after him (ul. Shalinskaya, (eng: Shalinsky street) later renamed ul. Lenina, (eng.: Lenin street)). (In 2015, the Ukrainian government approved laws that outlawed communist symbols and street names.) Currently the street is named Soborna. Merchant of –Ü–Ü Guild A.V.Permanin was elected as city governor in 1892. Under his leadership the city started to develop rapidly: a lot of churches, temples, barracks, gymnasiums, factories and plants were built. In the 1870s, a railway was built between St. Petersburg and Simferopol, passing through Pavlohrad. In 1896, the Golenishchev-Kutuzov family built the \\"Earl's Theatre\\". In 1930, an uprising against Soviet rule took place in Pavlohrad. From 1780 to 1941, a significant Jewish community existed in the city. The pre-Holocaust Jewish population was approximately 4,000. The city was destroyed in 1941 during the Nazi occupation. During the Holocaust a concentration camp was located in Pavlohrad and a large part of the community died during the war and during the mass executions. The Pavlohrad Jewish cemetery contains not only Jewish, but also Christian burials, which were agreed to by the leaders of the local Jewish community in 1995. On May 22, 2011, it was reported that unknown persons had desecrated the cemetery in the town - tombstones were turned over and broken in an apparently anti-Semitic act. Pavlohrad Mechanical Plant The city is home to Pavlohrad Mechanical Plant (PMZ) that was established in December 1963 as a specialized production facility of the Plant no. 586 (now Pivdenmash Production Association). PMZ is a factory dedicated to assembly, perfection and production of solid-fueled rocket engines and missiles. By 1975 PMZ became the largest solid-rocket factory within the Ministry of General Machine Building of USSR. PMZ made fuel tanks for booster rockets and plastic ICBM rocket motor casings; parts, components, and assemblies for aerospace systems manufacturing.

It is an American college football rivalry between the Colorado Buffaloes football team of the University of Colorado and Colorado State Rams football team of Colorado State University. The winner of the game receives the Centennial Cup. It began in 1893 and was played annually from 1899 to 1958, except for 1901, 1905, and 1943‚Äì44. It was revived in 1983 and played periodically until it was cemented as an annual rivalry in 1995. Since 1998, the game has usually been played in Denver, Colorado, at Mile High Stadium and its replacement, Empower Field at Mile High, although the 2004, 2005 and 2009 games were played at Folsom Field in Boulder. Broncos Stadium is considered neutral ground for both teams and has a greater capacity than either university's home stadium (Folsom Field and Canvas Stadium). Since the annual game was renewed in 1995, it has been played only once at Colorado State, in 1996 at the Rams' former home of Hughes Stadium. In August 2009, both universities agreed to extend the Showdown until 2020, with the 2010‚Äì19 games all to be played at Broncos Stadium. The game was played in Boulder as planned in 2009.

Because the Pac-12 restricted member schools to conference play in fall sports in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the game was canceled for 2020, which will mark the first year since 1994 without the rivalry game. The next scheduled games are on September 16, 2023 in Boulder and September 14, 2024 in Fort Collins.https://fbschedules.com/ncaa/colorado/ Game results See also * List of NCAA college football rivalry games References Category:College football rivalries in the United States Category:Colorado Buffaloes football Category:Colorado State Rams football Category:1893 establishments in Colorado ","title":"Rocky Mountain Showdown"},{"id":"3889676","title":"Imaginations (album)"},{"id":"3889685","text":"A church in Pryluky Pryluky ( ) is a city located on the Udai River in Chernihiv Oblast, north-central Ukraine. Serving as the administrative center of Pryluky Raion (district), the city itself is incorporated as a city of oblast significance and does not belong to the raion. Located nearby is the Pryluky air base, a major strategic bomber base during the Cold War, which is Ukraine's largest airfield. Population: History Archeological excavations have shown that a settlement on the territory of the present-day city dates back to the second millennium BC. According to one explanation, the city derived its name from its location, being situated on a turn in the river that looked like a bow when viewed from above. Another theory holds that the city's name connotes the idea of being situated ‚Äúon floodplain meadows‚Äù. Pryluky was first mentioned in 1085 by Prince Volodymyr Monomakh in his Precepts To My Children. That year the city-fortress sheltered the prince and his entourage from the horde of Polovtsy and soon the prince's armed forces, strengthened by the Pryluky militia, routed the enemy. However, in 1092 the Polovtsy attacked the fortress once more wiping out the whole population and sacking the city. Later, the city was repeatedly plundered by eastern nomadic tribes and became a centre of internecine wars between Ruthenian princes. In 1239, Pryluky was destroyed by the Mongols; in 1362, the city was conquered by Lithuanian feudal lords. But the citizens always staunchly defended Pryluky, fighting for their freedom and dignity. After the Union of Lublin of 1569, according to which the city came under the rule of the Polish nobility, many inhabitants of Pryluky and nearby villages began to run away, seeking freedom in the vast Dnieper steppes. Oppressed peasants from other areas of central and eastern Ukraine took refuge there too. Settlements founded by the runaways in the late 15th- early 16th centuries occupied large territories in the vicinity of Kyiv and Cherkasy. Thus grew the Cossack community. Scared by the proliferation and popularity of Cossacks, Poland tried to suppress this spontaneous resistance but did so in vain. In the 17th century the Cossacks took part in the Khmelnytsky uprising. The fertile soil of the Udai basin proved itself attractive not only to marauders, but also to hard-working people fleeing from backbreaking toil. The number of inhabitants of Pryluky and adjacent villages grew considerably in the 17th century. One of the documents kept in the archives of Stockholm, Sweden stated that there were 800 chimneys, i.e. 800 houses, in Pryluky in 1632. Assuming that each house accommodated at least six persons, about 5,000 people lived in the city at that time. In 1648, Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky introduced a new system of territorial-administrative division in Ukraine, having divided the country into regiments. Under this system the city of Pryluky became the military center of the Pryluky Regiment and Colonel Ivan Shkurat-Melnychenko was appointed its first commander. The regiment comprised about 2,000 Cossacks, who actively participated in many battles during the war of 1648‚Äì1654. For instance, the entire Pryluky Regiment of Cossacks, led by I. Shkurat, died fighting valiantly in the Battle of Berestechko in 1651. The Pryluky Regiment, under Colonel Yakiv Voronchenko, demonstrated thorough military prowess in defeating a large Polish unit in June 1652. The regiment also took part in campaigns against Poland and Turkey. Girded with a high rampart surmounted by guns, the city of Pryluky looked quite formidably at the time. However, in the second half of the 18th century, the border was moved far to the south for political and military reasons and the necessity for fortified cities like Pryluky disappeared. Olexandr Yakubovych was the last colonel of Pryluky. In 1781, the Cossack regime was abolished in Ukraine and Pryluky became an uyezd of the Malorossiya Governorate, and from 1802 the Poltava Governorate. Since 1932 it has been a city within the Chernihiv Oblast. During World War II, Pryluky was occupied by the German Army from September 18, 1941 to September 18, 1943. During the occupation, Jews were recruited for forced labor. On October 15, 1941 a murder operation that had several Jewish victims was carried out.http://www.yadvashem.org/untoldstories/database/index.asp?cid=506 A ghetto was established at the beginning of 1942. From January 1942 groups of 30-40 young healthy men were systematically taken from the ghetto and executed at an unknown location. Most of the Jews of Pryluky were killed in a mass murder operation in May 1942. Another mass murder was carried out by Germans in Pryluky on September 10, 1942. Jews from Polova, Ladan, and Linovitsa of Pryluky County and from Kharitonovka, Podol, Radkovka and Malaya Devitsa of other counties of the Chernigov District were murdered in Pryluky.http://jewua.org/priluki/ Pryluky is on the list of Ukraine's oldest cities, and in 1995 it was entered in the register of Ukrainian historical cities. Under the auspices of the ‚ÄúInnovations in Cultural Development of the Regions‚Äù program, the Pryluky local government is taking measures to restore old folk art traditions as well as seeking historical and architectural records of the city. City inhabitants hope that with time, Pryluky will become a part of the Golden Ring of the Chernihiv Region tour.

Apart from the diminutive Baroque church of St. Nicholas (1720), the town possesses two cathedrals. The old five-domed cathedral was built by Cossacks in the 1710s and 1720s in a simplified brand of Mazepa Baroque. The new Neoclassical cathedral (1806) has one cupola and is dedicated to the Nativity of the Theotokos.

J. H. Goodwin and C. van Riet Lowe in 1929 to a Middle Stone Age stone tool manufacturing style after the site of Stilbaai (also called Still Bay) in South Africa where it was first described. It may have developed from the earlier Acheulian types. In addition to Acheulian stone tools, bone and antler picks were also used. Its start and end are calculated at 71.9 ka and 71.0 ka. At present, too few data exist to limit the 95% confidence intervals of these date to more than 4 to 5 ky. However, available data are consistent with a duration of less than 1 ky. Sampson in 1974 questioned its existence on the grounds that sites were not properly described and they lacked stratigraphic integritySampson GS. (1974). The Stone Age Archaeology of Southern Africa. Academic Press, New York. However, more recent work from sites such as Blombos Cave and Sibudu Cave attest to its existence. It is broadly analogous to the Mousterian culture in Europe. Olduvai Gorge has within its many ages of tools, some of the Stillbay variety. Tools and fire Researchers have concluded that Stillbay people prepared the silcrete stone out of which they made their stone tools with preheating in human made fire to increase its workability. Experiments involved slowly heating silcrete stones to ~350 ¬∞C. Thermoluminescence confirmed that all stones analysed (limited to 26 in number due this being a destructive process) had been heated to this temperature. Heat treatment not only increases the length of flakes that can be removed from about a half-inch to 2 inches but makes them thinner, and sharper as they can remove flakes at angles nearly parallel to the stone's surface. Heat treatment allows greater precision of fracture due to increasing the uniformity of the stone's fracture response when hit. This research identifies this not only with Stillbay sites dated to 72,000 BP but ones that could be as old as 164,000 BP. Kyle Brown, one of the scientists responsible for this research has been quoted as making a link with the existence of language: \\"These people were extremely smart ...

Additionally, as the secretary for Marvel Comics editor Stan Lee and the fledgling company's receptionist and fan liaison during the 1960s Silver Age of Comic Books, she was a key participant of and witness to Marvel's expansion from a two-person staff to a pop culture conglomerate. Steinberg appeared in fictionalized form in Marvel Comics, spoke at comic book conventions and was the subject of a magazine profile. Early life The daughter of a taxi-driver father and a public-stenographer mother, Steinberg was born in Boston, Massachusetts, United StatesSteinberg in and raised in that city's Dorchester and Mattapan neighborhoods. There she attended Roxbury Memorial High School for Girls, serving a term as president of the student council. Steinberg majored in History at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where she was a sister of Sigma Delta Tau sorority and received her B.A. in 1960. Afterward, while working as a service representative for the New England Telephone Company in Boston, she was a volunteer on Ted Kennedy's first U.S. Senatorial campaign. After moving to New York City in 1963, Steinberg additionally worked in what she said was \\"in a minor way\\" for Robert F. Kennedy's Senate bid. Career = Marvel Comics in the Silver Age = Steinberg in 1980 In March 1963, Steinberg moved to New York City, and in the career-girl fashion of that era spent some months living at a YWCA and job-hunting through employment agencies. \\"After a couple of interviews, I was sent to this publishing company called Magazine Management,\\" she said in a 2002 interview. \\"There I met a fellow by the name of Stan Lee, who was looking for what they called then a 'gal Friday' ... Stan had a one- man office on a huge floor of other offices, which housed the many parts of the magazine division ... Magazine Management published Marvel Comics as well as a lot of men's magazines, movie magazines, crossword puzzle books, romance magazines, confession magazines, detective magazines ... Each department took turns, one day a week, covering the switchboard...when the regular operator took her lunch break\\".\\"Flo Steinberg Interview\\", pp. 9-B to 10-B Marvel's only staffers at that time were Lee and Steinberg herself, with the rest of the work handled freelance.Steinberg in Salicrup, Zimmerman, p. 60. De facto production manager Sol Brodsky \\"would come in and set up an extra little drawing board where he would do the paste-ups and mechanicals for the ads,\\" Steinberg said. She recalled that the \\"first real Bullpen\\" ‚Äî the roomful of artists at drawing boards making corrections, preparing art for printing, and, as envisioned later within Marvel's letter pages and \\"Bullpen Bulletins\\", a mythologized clubhouse in which the likes of Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, Don Heck and others would be found kibitzing ‚Äî was created when Marvel moved downtown a few buildings from 655 Madison Avenue to 635 Madison Avenue. \\"Stan finally had his own office. There was a big space with windows where I was, and Sol Brodsky, now on staff, had his own desk\\".\\"Flo Steinberg Interview\\", p. 10-B She said that at the time, \\"[Y]ou were lucky to make $60 a week starting ... and Stan offered me $65, which was a big incentive to sign on!\\".Steinberg in Salicrup, Zimmerman, p. 65. In addition to serving as Lee's secretary, Steinberg coordinated with and cajoled artists to turn their work in by deadline, responded to fans' letters, including sending paying members the Merry Marvel Marching Society fan-club kit, and sending artwork to the Comics Code Authority to be examined in order to carry the industry's self-censorship Comics Code seal.Steinberg in Salicrup, Zimmerman, pp. 63, 65, 67. She also had to field uninvited fans who would appear at the office, hoping to meet the comics creators. \\"[P]eople started coming up to the office. And I would have to go out and see what they wanted. And little kids would try to run by me ... and I would have to trip them. ... Everyone thought that it was nice that the kids were coming up, but at the same time ... this was a business, y'know.\\"Steinberg in Salicrup, Zimmerman, p. 61. Artist Jim Mooney once recalled, The all-purpose Steinberg ‚Äî given the sobriquet \\"Fabulous Flo\\", in the manner of many other Marvel Comics endearments ‚Äî said that she Steinberg became exposed to the underground comix scene after meeting and becoming friends with Trina Robbins, who had come to the Marvel offices to interview Lee for the Los Angeles Free Press alternative newspaper. Through her, Steinberg became acquainted with contributors to the New York City alternative paper the East Village Other, and met underground cartoonists. Journalist Robin Green, who succeeded Steinberg at Marvel in 1968, wrote in Rolling Stone: = Later career = Editor-publisher Steinberg's Big Apple Comix (Sept. 1975). Cover art by Wally Wood.

Working for the trade group the American Petroleum Institute, she edited pamphlets and technical manuals for 2 1/2 years, leaving when the organization relocated to Washington, D.C.Steinberg in Salicrup, Zimmerman, p. 68. By this time she had become friends with New York City underground comix cartoonists including Trina Robbins, Kim Deitch, Michelle Brand and Roger Brand. After those artists moved to San Francisco, California, the center of the underground comix scene, Steinberg in the latter half of 1970 moved there as well. She befriended cartoonists including Art Spiegelman and worked for Gary Arlington's San Francisco Comic Book Company before leaving the city after a year. Steinberg moved back to her family in Boston for a short while and then returned to New York City. There, she recalled in 1984, her Marvel-artist friend Herb Trimpe \\"had a studio in the upper 80s [of Manhattan] that he wasn't using so I stayed there and went job hunting.\\" Steinberg found work running Captain Company, the mail-order division of the horror-comics magazine firm Warren Publishing, staying three years.

Little is known of his life before his arrival in Rome, where he worked between 1619 and 1626, and where he was influenced by the work of Caravaggio.

He painted both secular and religious subjects; an example of the latter is The Crucifixion with St. Vincent de Paul (Paris, The Louvre). After 1626 Tournier was active in southern France. He died in Toulouse. His work The Carrying of the Cross, painted around 1632, originally hung in the Toulouse chapel of the Company of the Black Penitents. During the French Revolution it was confiscated by the state and moved to a museum, from where it was stolen in 1818. After being lost for nearly two centuries, it reappeared in 2009 during an art collector's estate sale in Florence; when the Weiss Gallery of London purchased it in a Paris auction in 2011, the French government classified it as stolen property and banned it from leaving the country.

The IB Program is an intensive pre-university program that polishes students into globally-minded and well- rounded individuals. Students apply for the IB program as elementary students in grade 8, and enter high school as pre-IB students in grade 9. For two years, teachers will prepare students in pre-IB for the rigorous course work they will be taking in their last two years of high school. The actual IB curriculum begins in grade 11, when IB candidates will start the rigorous two- year program modelled after numerous education systems of countries all over the world.

It runs from Kenaston Boulevard (Route 90) to Grant Avenue (Route 105). Waverley Street serves as a major route to get to and from the industrial and commercial areas between McGillivray and Bishop Grandin Boulevards. The speed limit along the route south of Wilkes Avenue is 80 km/h (50 mph). Near Taylor Avenue, Waverley crosses the city's main Canadian National Railway line, where passing trains frequently cause major traffic delays. The city is currently building an underpass to alleviate the problem, planned to be opened in Fall 2019. Not all of Waverley Street is incorporated into Route 80. North of Grant Avenue, Waverley Street is a one- way residential street running southbound through the River Heights neighbourhood, starting at Wellington Crescent. South of the Perimeter Highway, Waverley Street is as an unnumbered local road that runs south to Provincial Road 247. Prior to the extension of Route 90 to the Perimeter Highway, this section connected to Route 80 at the Perimeter Highway.

Columbia Township is the official government name, while Columbia Station is the post office name, and tends to be the town name used by residents. The post office name was chosen to differentiate the township from other Columbia Townships statewide, located in Hamilton and Meigs counties. As of the 2010 census, the township had a population of 7,040.  Geography  According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which , or 0.85%, are water. The west branch of the Rocky River and Plum Creek flow through the township from south to north. Columbia Township is part of Greater Cleveland.

History  Columbia Historical Marker Columbia Township is part of the Connecticut Western Reserve, lands ceded in 1786 by Connecticut after the American Revolution. In 1805, two years after Ohio became a state, the federal government finalized treaties with local American Indians. The reserve was surveyed and parcelled into rough blocks (smaller than the typical townships in the midwestern United States). The Bronson and Hoadley families of Waterbury, Connecticut, pooled together $20,087 to purchase a township. On April 4, 1807, they drew Township 5 N, Range 15 W from a random selection of townships in the reserve, purchasing the land site-unseen. Bronson House Museum Columbia Township has been continuously inhabited since 1807, the longest settlement in the Western Reserve west of the Cuyahoga River. It has other firsts in the area: the first classroom (Bronson cabin, summer of 1808), first teacher (Sally Bronson, 1808), first white child born (Sally Hoadley), first gristmill (summer of 1809), first cemetery (1811), first doctor (Zephaniah Potter, 1809), and first organized church society (Episcopal, 1809). The Bronson House Museum (built c. 1850, 13646 W River Road) is the last home of Sally Bronson. Other Columbia Township buildings in the National Register of Historic Places include the Columbia Town Hall (added 1976, #76001468, 25496 Royalton Road) and the Columbia Baptist Church (added 1976, #76001466, 25514 Royalton Road). The Copopa School was built in 1921. The name originates as follows: Farming has historically been the most significant employer in Columbia Township and the surrounding townships, but in the second half of the 19th century, sandstone from the local quarries was mined and widely distributed. Two of the township's quarries were Jaquay Quarry and an area which later became known as Wildwood Lake. Both Jaquay and Wildwood were used as swimming parks in the late 20th century, with Wildwood operating until 2001. On April 11, 1965, an F4 tornado swept through Columbia Township before dissipating to the east in neighboring Strongsville. At the 2007 Homecoming, Columbia Township celebrated its bicentenary. For the previous fifty years, the township had not experienced the urban sprawl that developed in neighboring areas, but the number of farms in the township has fallen significantly.  Parks  Columbia Reservation Columbia Veteran's Memorial The Lorain County Metro Parks opened the Columbia Reservation in 2003, a park with of high-quality wetlands in the floodplain of the west branch of the Rocky River. The park has of trails running through ponds, marshes, wet meadows and swamps. The park is popular with bird watchers, as more than 50 species of birds, including the great blue heron, can be seen there. An additional are planned to be added to the park.

This is further explained in FAA Advisory Circular 121-24C, which stated that video offered several advantages over the standard manual demonstration, but only provided that the airliner has the required video and sound systems to exhibit the video properly. = 1980s and early 1990s = As in-flight video entertainment systems were beginning to see mainstream introduction, airlines began producing safety demonstration videos to be used in lieu of or in tandem with a manual demonstration performed by one or more flight attendants. Notable examples include Trans World Airlines, Pan Am, and Northwest. Early videos from the late 1980s sometimes omit warnings about electronic devices, as it was less of a concern at the time. Since smoking was still acceptable on many airliners, these videos feature antiquated reminders about smoking on board, including acceptable locations to do so and a command to stop smoking should the oxygen masks be deployed. Videos of this era often use 2-dimensional animation or very primitive 3D computer generated imagery to illustrate elements of the demonstration. While animation is usually used sparingly, some videos are fully animated (usually in 3D), such as ATA's circa-1994 safety video. When videos of this time were captioned, it was usually only captioned in the language already being spoken on the audio track. Bilingual videos typically had the primary language's instructions repeated verbally immediately afterward, but almost never had the secondary language captioned. Arguably, elements of the demonstration were either overexplained, underexplained, or poorly described during this time. For instance, TWA's safety video mentioned a \\"slight burning odor\\" when oxygen masks are in use. Most demonstrations were also lacking in their explanation of electronic device policies as portable electronic devices were only beginning to become a concern. Videos were typically designated to a specific model of aircraft but shared certain assets between videos produced by the same airline, including film recorded on a completely different aircraft. This practice continues to the modern day, although it is variably less prevalent than during the 1980s and 1990s. = Late 1990s and Early 2000s = By this point, airlines had found a refined format for their safety videos. Most videos, though produced differently, kept the same basic script with the same points. For instance, the Delta Air Lines safety video from 2000 and 2001 quoted one of their early '90s videos almost verbatim for most of the runtime. Electronic device policies were also updated to include that cellular phones and other radio-based electronics are not permitted to be used at any time while other devices may be used in-flight but must be shut off for take-off and landing.  Effectiveness  Research conducted at the University of New South Wales in Australia questions the effectiveness of these briefings in conveying key safety messages for passengers to recall and act upon in an emergency.Molesworth, B. R. C. (2014). Examining the Effectiveness of Pre- Flight Cabin Safety Announcements in Commercial Aviation. International Journal of Aviation Psychology, 24(4), 300-314. In one study, a range of pre- recorded safety briefings were tested. One safety briefing contained humor, another was void of humor (said to reflect a standard style briefing), and another used a celebrity to sell the importance of the safety briefing and the messages contained within. Not long after being exposed to the briefing, individuals recalled approximately 50% of the key safety messages from the briefing featuring the celebrity, 45% from the briefing containing humor, and 32% from the briefing void of both a celebrity and humor. Two hours post exposure to the pre-flight safety briefings, recall decreased on average by 4% from the original levels across all conditions.

The park is most famous for its formal gardens, but it also preserves the original habitat of a northeast Florida barrier island. Ecology Habitats preserved by the park include beach, coastal scrub, coastal hammock, and tidal marshes. Flora Vegetation includes southern live oaks (Quercus virginiana), magnolias, hickories (Carya spp.), cabbage palmettos (Sabal palmetto), and saw palmettos (Serenoa repens). Plants that can be found in the gardens are roses, camellias, and azaleas, among others. Fauna Wildlife include sea turtles, Florida gopher tortoises, West Indian manatees, white-tailed deer, raccoons, bobcats, foxes, Virginia opossums, eastern gray squirrels, pileated woodpeckers, northern cardinals, bald eagles, peregrine falcons, and Florida scrub jays. History The park's land has a rich history. Native Americans found the area a productive hunting and fishing area. After European settlement of Florida, the property had a number of owners and was used for various agricultural purposes. One owner was a surveyor named George Washington, a relative of President George Washington. In 1936, Louise Powis Clark, wife of the industrialist Owen D. Young purchased the property as a winter retirement home. She devised the name \\"Washington Oaks\\" for the property and is responsible for developing the park's formal gardens, citrus groves, and house. Mr. Young died in 1962 and Mrs. Young donated the property to the State of Florida in 1964. Her donation specified that the \\"gardens be maintained in their present form\\". Recreational activities The park has such amenities as beaches (on both the Matanzas River and Atlantic Ocean), bicycling, fishing, hiking, picnicking areas and wildlife viewing. The original residence has been converted into a visitor center with interpretive exhibits. Hours and admission Florida state parks are open between 8 a.m. and sundown every day of the year (including holidays). An admission fee is required.

It is closely related to androstenedione (androst-4-ene-3,17-dione). Biological activity Androstenediol is a direct metabolite of the most abundant steroid produced by the human adrenal cortex, DHEA. It is less androgenic than the related compound, Œî4-androstenediol, and has been found to stimulate the immune system. When administered to rats, androstenediol, in vivo, has approximately 1.4% of the androgenicity of DHEA, 0.54% of the androgenicity of androstenedione, and 0.21% of the androgenicity of testosterone.Coffey, DS (1988) \\"Androgen action and the sex accessory tissues\\". In E Knobil, J Neill (eds), The Physiology of Reproduction. Raven Press, New York, pp 1081-1119. Androstenediol possesses potent estrogenic activity, similarly to DHEA and 3Œ≤-androstanediol. It has approximately 6% and 17% of the affinity of estradiol at the ERŒ± and ERŒ≤, respectively. Although androstenediol has far lower affinity for the ERs compared to the major estrogen estradiol, it circulates at approximately 100-fold higher concentrations, and so is thought may play a significant role as an estrogen in the body. Chemistry Androstenediol, also known as androst-5-ene-3Œ≤,17Œ≤-diol, is a naturally occurring androstane steroid. It is closely related structurally to androstenedione (A4; androst-4-ene-3,17-dione), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA; androst-5-en-3Œ≤-ol-17-one), and testosterone (androst-4-en-17Œ≤-ol-3-one), as well as to 3Œ≤-androstanediol (5Œ±-androstane-3Œ≤,17Œ≤-diol). Derivatives and analogues of androstenediol, such as the 17Œ±-substituted methandriol (17Œ±-methylandrostenediol) and ethinylandrostenediol (17Œ±-ethynylandrostenediol) as well as the naturally occurring 19-norandrostane derivative norandostenediol (19-nor-5-androstenediol), have been synthesized and studied. Methandriol and its esters are androgens and anabolic steroids while ethinylandrostenediol is an estrogen. Research =Radiation countermeasure= Androstenediol has been investigated for use as a radiation countermeasure. Its value as a radiation countermeasure is based mainly on its stimulation of production of white blood cells and platelets. Its potential use as a radiation countermeasure was developed by the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (AFRRI) and subsequently studied by AFRRI and Hollis-Eden Pharmaceuticals under the proposed brand name Neumune for the treatment of acute radiation syndrome. The clinical trials with rhesus monkeys were successful. According to the Hollis-Eden report, only 12.5% of the 40 Neumune-treated animals died versus 32.5% in the placebo group.Hollis- Eden Pharmaceuticals Reports Publication of Results Demonstrating the Ability of NEUMUNE(R) to Increase Survival in a Primate Model of Lethal Radiation Injury, February 26, 2007. Hollis-Eden had applied for a contract from the U.S. Government under the BioShield Request for Proposals (RFP) for radiation countermeasures. After being encouraged for 2.5 years that Neumune was in the competitive range, on March 9, 2007, the RFP was canceled by HHS.

Together with Brinkmann, he also developed the Plantri programme for generating planar triangulations and planar cubic graphs.Siemion Fajtlowicz (ed.), Graphs and Discovery: DIMACS Working Group, Computer- generated Conjectures from Graph Theoretical and Chemical Databases, American Mathematical Soc., 2005 p.x.

Biblical cyphers Outside of his specialty, McKay is best known for his collaborative work with a group of Israeli mathematicians such as Dror Bar-Natan and Gil Kalai, together with Maya Bar-Hillel, who rebutted a Bible code theory which maintained that the Hebrew text of the Bible enciphered predictive details of future historical events. The paper in question had been accepted for publication by a scientific peer-reviewed journal in 1994.Doron Witztum, Eliyahu Rips, and Yoav Rosenberg, 'Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis,' Statistical Science, Vol. 9 (1994) 429-438.Brendan McKay, Dror Bar-Natan, Maya Bar-Hillel, Gil Kalai, 'SOLVING THE BIBLE CODE PUZZLE,' Statistical Science, Vol. 14 (1999) 150-173.Jordan Ellenberg, How Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking, Penguin, 2014 pp.99-101. Their rebuttal, together with a paper written by an anonymous mathematician, argued that the patterns in the Bible that supposedly indicate some hidden message from a divine source or have predictive power can be just as easily found in other works, such as War and Peace.'Equidistant Letter Sequences in Tolstoy's War and Peace.' The discredited theory was taken up by Michael Drosnin.Sharon Begley, 'Seek And Ye Shall Find,' The Daily Beast 8 June 1997. Drosnin said he was convinced of this theory when one of its exponents stated that the Torah predicted the Iraqi wars. He expressed his certainty publicly that such coded messages could not be found in any other work than the Bible, and, in an interview with Newsweek, he challenged: > \\"When my critics find a message about the assassination of a prime minister > encrypted in Moby Dick, I'll believe them.\\" Using the Bible decryption method espoused by the group led by Eliyahu Rips, McKay quickly found some nine references to Yitzhak Rabin's assassination in Herman Melville's masterpiece. He also showed that the same technique allowed him to find ostensible mentions of Diana, Princess of Wales, her lover Dodi Fayed, and their chauffeur Henri Paul in the same novel.G√©rald Bronner, Belief and Misbelief Asymmetry on the Internet, John Wiley & Sons, 2016 pp.50-51. This debunking disproof of a theory that the bible encrypts secret messages containing future world history achieved international fame for McKay outside of his specific field of combinatorics.

Formerly a separate settlement, it is even older than Gdynia by several centuries. Etymology Both the Polish and then German name of the town, as well as various other names for it used in the past (among them Oxsiua, Oxive, Okciua, Oxue, Oxivia, Oxiuia, Oxiwia, Oxiew and Oxivija) stem from a Scandinavian word oxihoved meaning oxen head. History In the pre-historic times the Oksywie Heights, overlooking the Bay of Gda≈Ñsk, was settled by the members of the Oksywie culture, named after the burial places located just outside Oksywie. With time the area was settled by Slavs and became part of Pomerania. Christianised relatively early, the settlement housed the first Catholic shrine erected in 1124 by ≈öwiƒôtope≈Çk, Duke of Pomerania. Throughout the ages, the settlement shared much of its history with the surrounding region and with the nearby town of Gda≈Ñsk (German: Danzig), which developed into a regional capital. After the World War I, when Poland regained the area after more than 100 years of partitions, the town of Oksywie became the first base of the Polish Navy. It served this role until the outbreak of World War II. During the Polish Defensive War of 1939, the area was the battlefield of the 9 days long battle of Kƒôpa Oksywska, in which the Polish forces under Col. Stanis≈Çaw DƒÖbek defended the area between September 10 and September 19. During the last stages of the war, the area yet again became a battlefield, this time between March 28 and April 5, 1945, when the area of the Oksywie Heights became the last stand of the surrounded German forces in Pomerania. Currently, the borough of Oksywie is notable as the seat of the Academy of the Polish Navy. It was also the namesake of ORP Oksywie.

The work, set mostly in Greece, is primarily a series of character studies, interwoven with a plot about a mysterious \\"language cult\\" that is behind a number of unexplained murders. Among the many themes explored throughout the work is the intersection of language and culture, the perception of American culture from both within and outside its borders, and the impact that narration has on the facts of a story. While initially some reviewers found The Names intellectually rich but unsuccessful as a novel, it became regarded in subsequent years as one of DeLillo's best works. Plot summary Themes =Language= At the core of the book is the problem of language. Language is the way we connect with the world; thus, it is a means of opening the world or of controlling it. It is these two concepts of language which struggle against each other throughout the book. The latter concept (language as a means of control) is embodied in the character of the archeologist Owen Brademas. =Religion= One character says, \\"It is religion that carries language. Language is the river of God.\\"p. 192, original Knopf hardcover edition If language is the means of relating to the world, or even making the world,p. 152, original Knopf hardcover edition then religion in turn circumscribes or frames language. Language for DeLillo, arises in an awe towards the things of the world. That awe is religion. Religion is thus in some sense a surrender, a concession that things are fundamentally outside one's control.p. 276, original Knopf hardcover edition =Writing= As a manifestation of language, the written word is the most susceptible to control. Letters are static while spoken words are elusive. Writing can thus be a desire for a full presence \\"a lost language, free from ambiguity.\\"p.174, It is this aspect of writing that appeals to Owen Brademas. He is seeking a language that has been \\"subdued and codified\\", simplified into parallel structures.p. 80, original Knopf hardcover edition But writing can also be a recovery or articulation of \\"ancient things, secret, reshapable.\\"p. 313, original Knopf hardcover edition In this second type of writing, the mystery of the world is retained. In The Names it is a child, the narrator's son Tap, who most purely practices this type of writing. Unlike Owen, for whom \\"correctness\\" in speech is very important, Tap's writing is full of lively misspellings, prompting his father to look at objects in a new way. =Politics= The theme of control is also visible in the discussion of politics carried on throughout the book. Politics is where the element of control reveals itself most visibly: as in Empire; in the United States' relations with other countries; in the activities of corporations; in the relationship between men and women; in the behavior of terrorists. Nonetheless, the relationship between the \\"stronger\\" and the \\"weaker\\" is not simply reducible to \\"oppressor\\" and \\"oppressed\\". Sometimes the weaker force is complicit with,p. 235, original Knopf hardcover edition or distorts the nature of,p.317, original Knopf hardcover edition the stronger. Reception In The New York Times, Michael Wood dubbed DeLillo an author of ‚Äúextraordinary verve and wit‚Äù and described The Names as \\"a powerful, haunting book, formidably intelligent and agile\\", but wrote that \\"it also feels a little blurred, its insights scattered rather than collected.\\" Wood argued, \\"It is true that American fiction is full of people stranded between plotlessness and paranoia, between making no sense of their lives and making too much, and it would be a good defense of Mr. DeLillo to say that he has dramatized this dilemma strongly. But it would only be a defense, and 'The Names' is still a hard book to hold in the mind.‚Äù Jonathan Yardley of The Washington Post strongly praised the depiction of the community of Americans in Athens, writing that \\"his portraits of individual members of the community are sharp and true, his depiction of a world on the brink is wittily clinical, his dialogue is crisp and interesting\\". However, Yardley also wrote that the novel \\"takes on too many themes and wanders in too many directions to find a coherent shape\\", describing Axton's observation about language on the Parthenon as appealing but also arrived at \\"by so circuitous a route that many readers probably will lose patience along the way.\\" Yardley referred to The Names as \\"the work of a writer of clear if chilly brilliance\\", and argued that the moments when the author \\"thinks as keenly as he writes [...] are concentrated in the first of the book‚Äôs three principal sections\\". A reviewer for Kirkus Reviews expressed similar reservations. The reviewer praised the scene in which Axton seduces the corporate wife, stating that \\"as long as DeLillo stays within [the] class of the edgy and expatriate, bis [sic] novel is fine--gritty and adhesive\\", and argued that \\"the larger theme is, as usual with DeLillo, the foulness of modern life--its sullying, cheapening progress.\\" But the reviewer also wrote that \\"while other DeLillo books (even the weaker ones) have presented that theme with an insistent, disturbing blade of glittering scorn, this time there's more somber meditation . . . while only a few scenes flare.\\" In his 1987 book-length study of DeLillo's works up to that point, however, Tom LeClair lauded The Names as DeLillo's finest work. David Cowart said the same in 2008. In 2007, The Names was listed in New York as one of the author's supreme achievements along with White Noise, Libra, and Pafko at the Wall, with a reviewer writing, \\"Mixing DeLillo‚Äôs brilliant gloss on America‚Äôs place in the world in the seventies with a comic portrait of a failing marriage and Pynchonesque story of a mysterious, murderous cult, The Names is a summa of everything he‚Äôd learned up to that point, his last and greatest seventies novel, and one of his greatest novels, full stop.\\" In 2006, Geoff Dyer wrote in The Daily Telegraph that he considered The Names to be the \\"great leap forward\\" in DeLillo's career; Dyer later hailed it in The Guardian as \\"a prophetic, pre-9/11 masterpiece: a 21st-century novel published in 1982\\", and argued that it should have been one of three novels by the author (along with White Noise and Underworld) to win the Man Booker Prize. In a review of a later book by the same writer, Joshua Ferris mentioned the dialogue of the British security consultant Charles Maitland (such as his complaints about new people's republics emerging and areas' names being changed) as an example of DeLillo's skill with sentences, arguing that the author \\"artfully reveals Maitland‚Äôs Western view of things while guiding the reader to ask: Who‚Äôs changing the names, and why? Smile, and the history of colonialism and the civil wars it ignited will be scrubbed out with a quip.\\" Jeff Somers ranked it fourth among 17 books by DeLillo and wrote, \\"Challenging and cerebral, the central question of the novel concerns how far context and words go towards shaping perception and, therefore, reality?\\" Paul Petrovic, Fran Mason, and Eileen Battersby have claimed the novel to be underrated, with Battersby writing, \\"Richard Ford conveys what America sounds like, how it thinks. But DeLillo explains how it fears; he describes America‚Äôs communal dread.\\" Interpretation Michael Wood interpreted the language cult as representing \\"the arbitrary, the meaningless not as chaos and confusion but as heartless, pointless pattern,‚Äù noting one character's view that they \\"mock our need to structure and classify, to build a system against the terror in our souls.\\" Film adaptation It was announced on April 7, 2015 that American writer- director Alex Ross Perry has optioned The Names for a film adaptation.

Breakston and directed by Breakston and Kenneth G. Crane from a screenplay by Walter J. Sheldon. Sheldon's script was based on Breakston's story which he originally titled The Split. The film starred Peter Dyneley as a foreign correspondent in Japan who is given an experimental drug which causes an eye and eventually, a second head to grow from his shoulder. Tetsu Nakamura played the mad scientist, Dr. Suzuki, with Tamoko Takechi as his horribly mutated wife, Emiko. Plot American foreign news correspondent Larry Stanford (Dyneley) has been working out of Japan for the last few years, to the detriment of his marriage. His last assignment before returning to his wife in the United States is an interview with the renowned but reclusive scientist Dr. Robert Suzuki (Tetsu Nakamura), who lives atop a volcanic mountain. During the brief interview, Dr. Suzuki amiably discusses his work on evolution caused by sporadic cosmic rays in the atmosphere, and professes that he has discovered a method for producing evolutionary change by chemical means. Suzuki serves Larry a drugged libation, causing him to fall into a deep sleep. Announcing to Tara (Terri Zimmern), his voluptuous assistant, that Larry is the perfect candidate for his latest evolutionary experiments, he injects an unknown substance into Larry's shoulder. Upon waking, Larry is oblivious to the true situation and accepts Suzuki's invitation to spend the next week vacationing with him around Japan. Over the next few days, Suzuki uses Tara as a beguiling distraction while conditioning Larry with mineral baths and copious amounts of alcohol, exacerbating the pain in Larry's shoulder. Meanwhile, Larry's estranged wife (Jane Hylton) has traveled to Japan to bring him back home with her. When confronted, Larry refuses to leave his new life of women and carousing. After a few drinks that night, Larry examines his painful shoulder to discover that a large eyeball has grown at the spot of Dr. Suzuki's injection. Becoming aloof and solitary, Larry wanders Tokyo late at night. He murders a woman on the street, a Buddhist monk and a psychiatrist, while slowly changing form, culminating in his growing a second head. Seeking a cure, Larry climbs the volcano to Dr. Suzuki's laboratory where Suzuki has just informed Tara that Larry has become \\"an entirely new species\\" and beyond remedy. Entering the lab, Larry kills Suzuki and sets the building on fire as Tara flees. Larry splits into two completely separate bodies, bringing himself back to normal. The monstrous second body grabs Tara, and throws her into the volcano. As Larry's wife and the police arrive, he pushes the second body into the volcano. Larry, now cured, is taken away by the police, although it remains unclear how much moral or legal responsibility he has for his violent actions. The movie ends as Larry's wife and his friend discuss the good that remains in Larry.

The film had various working titles, including Nightmare and The Two-Headed Monster. It was photographed by David Mason and edited by Kenneth G. Crane. Shinpei Takagi handled the special effects, George Wyman played the titular monster and Hirooki Ogawa composed the soundtrack. Release Lopert Pictures released The Manster in the United States on March 28, 1962 as a double feature with Eyes Without a Face. In the United Kingdom, The Manster was released as The Split. Sources state different release dates for the film. AllMovie states that the film was released in the United States on July 1, 1959. In his book The Japanese Filmography, Stuart Galbraith IV wrote that the film was first released in Japan in 1961, followed by an American premiere on March 28, 1962. The American Film Institute also states that the film premiered in the United States in San Francisco on March 28, 1962, at a run time of 72 minutes. The film was shown on Elvira's Movie Macabre and later released on DVD. Reception In a contemporary review, the Monthly Film Bulletin reviewed a 67-minute version of The Manster titled The Split. The review called the film to be \\"a pathetic pot-boiler\\", \\"never frightening\\" and an \\"incredibly far- fetched rehash of all the ingredients of the convention SF-horror film\\". The review criticized the fact that the second head of the character appears to only \\"bob up and down on the actor's raincoated shoulder, only visible in night scenes and never in close-up\\". In a retrospective review, AllMovie film critic Hal Erickson wrote, \\"Manster is a favorite among campy horror aficionados and for good reason as it is both unintentionally funny and genuinely creepy...Wait till you see the climax, with the hero battling himself on the edge of a live volcano\\".

A New South Wales State of Origin head coach, Murray coached extensively at the highest club level: coaching the Illawarra Steelers, the Hunter Mariners, the Leeds Rhinos, the Sydney Roosters and the North Queensland Cowboys between the years 1991 and 2008. He also coached the Fiji national rugby league team, the City New South Wales rugby league team and the Australian women's team. He was named Dally M Coach of the Year in 1992. Personal life Murray was born in Peak Hill, New South Wales to James Murray and Shirley Gallagher. He was the youngest of five siblings. He married Amanda Jurd on 15 December 1984. On their ninth wedding anniversary they had a daughter. Playing career =Parramatta= Having starred for the Parramatta third-grade side in the middle 1970s, Murray took over as captain of the Eels' reserve grade side in 1977. He was regarded as too skilful for reserve grade rugby league, owing to his great organisational ability, which had him known as \\"little Artie\\" after Arthur Beetson. With international halfback John Kolc suffering ankle ligament damage, Murray spent some time in first grade during 1977, but returned to captain the reserve grade side to a premiership when Kolc was fit. 1978 saw Murray take over from Kolc as first grade halfback for most of the year, but the emergence of soon- to-be champion Peter Sterling caused him to flirt between the grades in 1979 and 1980. In 1979 he captained the reserves to their third premiership in five years. =South Sydney= Murray moved to Souths in 1981 and played fairly regularly in first grade until he left at the end of 1983 to play in the country. Coaching career Murray began his coaching career with appointments as reserve grade coach at Penrith, where he won a premiership in 1987 and helped develop many of the future 1991 first-grade premiership team, and Balmain. =Illawarra Steelers= Murray was made coach of the Illawarra Steelers for the 1991 Winfield Cup season. He guided the club to its first finals appearance in 1992 and during his tenure, the Steelers won more games than they lost. He was dismissed as coach in April 1995 after he facilitated negotiations between Steelers players and representatives of the rebel Super League organisation. He was the only person out of the countless players, coaches and administrators involved with the Super League saga to lose his job as a direct consequence. Murray was the coach of the Fiji team in the 1995 World Cup, winning one game and losing two. =Hunter Mariners= Installed as coach of Super League's Newcastle-based Hunter Mariners team, Murray was able to construct a competitive team despite the apathy of the local community who were mostly supportive of the Newcastle Knights still playing in the Australian Rugby League's premiership. Although they made the final of the World Club Challenge in their first season, the Mariners were shut down as a condition of the establishment of the National Rugby League. =Leeds Rhinos= Left without a team to coach in Australia, Murray joined the Leeds Rhinos in the Super League, directing the team to their 1998 Super League Grand Final loss to the Wigan Warriors and 1999 Challenge Cup victory over the London Broncos. Murray signed a deal to coach the North Sydney Bears for the 2000 NRL season. However, before he could take up this position, the club was excluded from the competition and forced to merge with the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. =Sydney Roosters= After the resignation of Phil Gould as coach of the Sydney Roosters, Murray was quickly named as his replacement. In 2000, Murray proceeded to guide the Roosters to their first grand final since 1980, although they would lose 14‚Äì6 to the Brisbane Broncos. Murray was also the NSW City Origin coach from 2001 to 2005. Despite a sixth-place finish in 2001, Murray was sacked by the Roosters two days after the end of the season. =North Queensland Cowboys= After starting 2002 in his former profession as a teacher of mathematics, he was made head coach of the North Queensland Cowboys to replace the sacked Murray Hurst in April. After three seasons of steady improvement, the Cowboys made the NRL finals for the first time in 2004 and finished one game short of the grand final. They improved on their efforts in the following season, reaching the 2005 NRL Grand Final, the Cowboys' first, which they lost to the Wests Tigers by 30 to 16. Murray coached City to victory in the annual contest against Country Origin in 2002, 2003 and 2005. In 2006 Murray was named coach of the Illawarra Steelers \\"Team of Steel\\", celebrating their 25th Anniversary. Murray was appointed coach of the New South Wales rugby league team for the 2006 State of Origin series; despite winning the first game by just one point (17-16) they lost the series to Queensland by two games to one. In National Rugby League season 2006 the Cowboys missed the finals and finished in ninth position. Murray was re- appointed as New South Wales coach in 2007, with the full support of the North Queensland Cowboys board. Once again New South Wales lost the series by two games to one. In August 2007, Murray announced that he would step down as coach of New South Wales. On 19 May 2008, Murray resigned as coach of the North Queensland Cowboys. Later career In 2010 Murray was appointed as the head coach of the Australia women's national rugby league team, the Australian Jillaroos. The team would go on to win the World Cup against New Zealand in 2013, where they dedicated their win to Murray.

Chambers' widow self-published the book with Alden in Oxford circa 1927 (McFarland, \\"Abandoned to God\\", 1993, p.278). The book was first published in America by Dodd, Mead, & Co., in 1935. The copyright was renewed in 1963 by the Oswald Chambers Publications Association, Ltd. The \\"Updated Edition in Today's Language,\\" edited by James Reimann, has appeared in a variety of formats since 1992. It relies on the New King James Version of the Bible, and has become a series of Christian devotional journals, calendars, and children's books. The title is taken from one of Chambers's sermons, where he says \\"Shut out every consideration and keep yourself before God for this one thing only- My Utmost for His Highest\\". The book is considered to be one of the most popular religious books ever written, inspiring several people such as columnist and author Cal Thomas and President George W. Bush. My Utmost for His Highest has been officially translated into over 39 languages and has never been out of print. Synopsis and history My Utmost for His Highest is broken down into 366 sections for each day of the year, meant to be read daily for inspiration. The book was published after Oswald's death in 1917, with his wife Gertrude Hobbs compiling the passages after his death from her shorthand notes. The devotionals in the book cover a range of subjects, from what a person should pray for to reflections on the follower's daily activities.

His work is an ode to femininity which revives the Mediterranean ideal of beauty. Richard Guino brings about a synthesis full of sensuality between classicism and modernity, using a great variety of techniques and materials ‚Äì wood, wax, marble, bronzes, terracottas, plasters, ivories, glass, ceramics, majolicas, drawings and paintings. His fruitful collaboration with Pierre-Auguste Renoir constitutes a rare episode in the history of Art. Origins and Catalan youth Richard Guino was born on May 26, 1890 in Girona, Catalonia, Spain, the son of an ebony cabinet maker. His parents sent him to school in a Marist college where he underwent an extremely rigid education. A precocious sculptor, he entered the Art School of Girona at a very young age and left in 1906 to follow the courses of the Superior School of Fine Arts in Barcelona ‚Äì Pablo Picasso's father was one of his teachers. He participated in collective exhibitions in Girona (1908) and Barcelona (1910) where Aristide Maillol, 30 years his elder, discovered him. Considering him \\"the most gifted European sculptor of his generation\\", Maillol asked him to join him in France to work at his side. Paris Guino settled in Paris in 1910, in a studio located in Rue Daguerre in the Montparnasse neighborhood, and he assisted Maillol in his studios in Paris and Marly-le- Roi. He attended the Ranson Academy in Montmartre where he met Maurice Denis, for whom he realized notably a few low reliefs for the Th√©√¢tre des Champs- √âlys√©es. He exhibited at the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Decorateurs, at the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts, at the Galerie Druet and at the Galerie Marseille and Vildrac. Count Kessel and Art dealer Ambroise Vollard purchased his works. His drawings also were exhibited, he realized striking inks of Isadora Duncan dancing, sketched from life. He worked mainly on feminine figures, supple and powerful: Torso with drapery, Woman bather squatting, The Egyptian woman, Woman with mandolin and others. The Renoir-Guino sculptured work It was around that time and at the request of Vollard that Maillol attempted to sculpt with Renoir. The old Master, urged on by Vollard, wished to explore sculpting. Handicapped by rheumatoid arthritis, he continued to paint, brushes slipped between his paralysed fingers, protected by narrow bandages. The dealer, who was admiring a medallion the painter had made of his youngest son Claude, took into his head to ‚Äúfind him a pair of hands‚Äù. Now Maillol was an accomplished artist, he could only do \\"Maillol\\" so... he presented Guino. Vollard, enthusiastic, arranged for him to meet with Renoir in 1913 and hired him at his own expense. An adventure began then between the young sculptor and the old painter, qualified as \\"miraculous\\" because of the communion of spirit and sensitivity which developed between the two artists. This collaboration lasted until 1918, in Essoyes first then at the ‚ÄúCollettes‚Äù, Renoir's villa in Cagnes-sur-Mer in Provence. This resulted in the creation of an ensemble of pieces considered at the zenith of modern sculpture: the Small Venus, the Venus victrix, the Judgement of P√¢ris, and the Large Washer Woman. When Renoir died in 1919, the sculptures were publicised and exploited as his alone by Vollard then by Renou. Sculptor, ceramist, sketcher artist and painter Guino, whom his libertarian sense kept away from any spirit of claiming, pursued his personal work. After his five years of collaboration with Renoir, intimately wounded by this denial of his creative share which commercial reasons motivated, attempted to reinvent himself, to change his style, exploring new techniques, in parallel to his sculptured work. He signed a contract with the Galerie Hebrard in Paris, which devoted three large personal exhibitions to him in 1919, 1922 and 1923. Interested in decorative arts, he realized numerous glazed ceramics and a few pieces of furniture. A long collaboration began in 1922 with the factory of S√®vres which for more than ten years rendered editions of his models in stoneware and bisque. In 1923, he participated in the spring exhibition of Barcelona, exhibited paintings and drawings at the Galerie Devauchez and some pieces at the Mus√©e Galliera, at the Salon des Tuileries and at the Salon de la des Artistes D√©corateurs. In 1924 he exhibited at the Mus√©e des Arts D√©coratifs which acquired Woman with Tambourine. His drawings were exhibited at the Maison Barbedienne, his sculptures at the Salon de la Societ√© des Artistes D√©corateurs. He signed a contract with the editing house Colin which for ten years would edit bronzes from his models. In 1925, Guino attended the International Exhibition of Decorative Arts of Paris where he obtained honorary diplomas for metal and ceramics. He also participated in the exhibition of contemporary French Art in Japan. That same year, he obtained French citizenship and married Gabrielle Borzeix; together they went on to have six children: Georges, Claude, Evelyne, artistes Michel Guino, a sculptor, Marie Guino-Ronchi, a painter, and Jean Borzeix, who died prematurely. Guino settled with his large family in a bigger studio in Antony, outside of Paris, next to his friend and photographer Bougourd, who was part of the joyful band of artists who lent life to Rue Daguerre. In 1928, he entered the XIth competition of the Mus√©e Galliera, bronze section. In 1929, exhibitions at the Galerie Hector Brame of drawings and small plates for book binding, at the Salon des Ind√©pendants and at the Salon de la Soci√©t√© des Artistes Fran√ßais (Salons of 1930, 1931, 1932, 1933 and 1934). In 1931, he exhibited again at the Salon des Ind√©pendants and signed a contract with the editing house Susse fr√®res, with which he would collaborate until 1955. The Renoir-Guino sculptured work II The ‚Äúenigma of the Renoir sculpture‚Äù was not solved until sixty years after its creation, at the end of a long action initiated in 1965 by Michel Guino, son of Richard Guino and himself a sculptor, who laboured to divulge his father's sculpture. After a close analysis of the pieces, of the processes which directed their creation and after the hearing of numerous artists, Richard Guino was recognized co-author in 1971 by the Third Civil Court of the Tribunal de Paris and the issue was settled by the Supreme Court of Appeal in 1973. The art historian Paul Haesaerts specified as early as 1947 in his book Renoir sculptor (Ed. Hermes, Bruxelles): ‚ÄúGuino was never an actor merely reading his text or a musician interpreting mechanically his score. The latter content themselves with being performers, in no way do they participate in the creative process. Guino was involved body and soul in the creative act. We can even affirm that if he hadn't been there, the sculpture of Renoir would have never seen the light. Guino was indispensable.‚Äù The action was not entered against Renoir, a twist which was conveyed in numerous texts and newspaper articles referring to the case. The goal of the lawsuit was to unveil the exceptional account of this process of creation and to bring to light the original contribution of Guino to the sculptured work, initially obscured by Vollard. A sculptor's ‚Äúassistant‚Äù reproduces or enlarges an already existing model. Guino on the other hand, did a transposition of techniques: we pass from the painting of Renoir to the sculpture of Guino, the spirit of the painting will manifest in the spirit of the sculpture. Transmutation confirmed between two artists. This phenomenon was able to take place thanks to their friendship and intense commonality of vision. The painter at his canvas, on the first floor of the villa and the sculptor shaping the clay in his studio of the garden of the ‚ÄúCollettes‚Äù. And it is this unique and rare point which characterizes this work of art. Exhibitions Upon his death, Richard Guino's studio contained more than 200 sculptures (wood, bronzes, terra cottas, plasters, ivories, glasses), numerous ceramics and majolicas, more than 200 paintings (portraits, landscapes, still lifes) and 3000 drawings (watercolors, gouaches, wash drawings, engravings, lithographs, monotypes, drawings in red chalk, charcoal drawings )... His numerous erotic drawings, recently disclosed, bring to light the dionysiac aspect of this artist of uncommon destiny. * Renoir-Guino.

It is a satirical story set on the fictional campus of Beauchamp University in Northern California. Particle physicist Alice Coombs rooms with narrator Philip Engstrand, an anthropologist researching conflicts between and within disciplines. Their relationship drives the romantic aspect of this story. The novel deals thematically with many of the philosophical issues pertaining to modern quantum physics, as well as human interaction with artificial intelligence.Jonathan Lethem: As She Climbed Across the Table Plot Lack is an emptiness created in a particle collider. Professor Soft theorized that the experiment would replicate the Big Bang and opened a wormhole to a microscopic universe and that this wormhole would close shortly after it was created, leaving the new universe attached to reality. The wormhole however is not accompanied by any events to indicate it is a physical object and so it is named Lack. Lack is characterized by its inexplicable preferences, as some particles and objects enter the space where Lack should be and fail to appear on the other side. Professor Alice Coombs is the first to discover that Lack only absorbs certain items. It takes her keys, but not a paperclip. Its only consistent property seems to be that, when Lack refuses an object once, it would forever refuse to consume that object. The physicists in Coombs's lab become obsessed with Lack, which appears to have its own personality and preferences. Alice develops a personal relationship with the artificial intelligence that they have created, while Philip becomes jealous of their relationship. Philip begins to get involved after B-84, a laboratory animal (cat) enters Lack. This consumption of B-84 causes a campus wide protest. In an attempt to impress Alice, Philip breaks up the protest by giving a speech about how a single cat being destroyed is minimal and their efforts would better spent on larger problems in the world. Instead of impressing Alice, she becomes defensive of Lack and locks herself in its chamber. After a night of drinking, Philip comes back to his apartment to see that Dr. Soft has brought Alice there. She is asleep but Dr. Soft suspects that she may have tried to enter Lack and that she is no longer capable of running experiments on Lack. This causes Dr. Soft to divide Lack's time up among capable people. He does not want to interrupt Alice's research so he gives her time but asks Philip to monitor her. He also claims a portion of Lack's time for himself, his graduate students, and an Italian physics team headed by Carmo Braxia. Despite all of the new people studying Lack, still very little progress is being made both on the grounds of explaining Lack and in restoring Philip and Alice's relationship. Undergraduate students build a device out of only things Lack consumes and try to feed it to Lack but Lack refuses it. Alice tries to give Lack pictures of herself but even those are refused. Even the Italian Physicist seems to be lost, that is until Braxia tells Philip his theory. He claims Lack is a new universe that doesn't have intelligent life. He says that because of the strong anthropic principle, a universe cannot exist if there isn't conscious life to observe it. Since Lack does not contain any conscious life it clings to our reality that does. The personality it developed was that of the first conscious person it encountered, Alice. What it absorbs is what she likes. With his new knowledge, and in a state of drunkenness, Philip sets out to be the first lover in history to ever have a definitive answer as to whether or not he is loved back. He enters Lacks chamber and slides himself into Lack. He wakes up the next morning realizing he is no longer in the universe he was the night before. After retrieving B-84 as proof of the universe, Philip heads back to Lack and climbs in. However, instead of going back to reality as he expects, he enters a new universe that has no light. The universe is inhabited by Evan and Garth, two blind men who had also climbed into Lack. The two men help Philip climb into Lack once again. This time, instead of entering a new universe, he merges and becomes one with Lack. Alice, feeling that Philip and Lack are now one thing, attempts one last time to enter Lack. Characters *Philip Engstrand:An anthropology professor at the University at Beauchamp who is known as the Dean of Interdiscipline for studying the relationships in academic environments. He strives to win back Alice's love after she becomes obsessed with Lack. *Alice Coombs: A physicist who tries to understand Lack as an intelligent being instead of a physics experiment. *Doctor Soft: Lack's creator. He allows Alice to take over research into Lack after she shows Lack has a preference for certain particles which he thought was impossible. *Garth Poys: A blind man who has blindsight. This allows him to get past the observer problem. *Evan Robar: Garth's friend who is also blind but amaurotic. *Carmo Braxia: An Italian physicist who is interested in studying the physics behind Lack. He is the one who finally cracks the mystery. *Cynthia Jalter: A therapist who studies coupling. She gets to know Philip through Evan and Garth whose relationship she is studying. She tries to help Philip understand that Alice no longer gives him the attention he needs because of lack and that she is bad for him. *Georges De Tooth: A professor that Philip convinces to research Lack by treating it as a self-contained text. Reception Reviewers considered the book a light read that was entertaining. Steven E. Alford says \\"It embodies a distilled, gentle, silly look at the world\\". Another common agreement is that Lethem defies the boundaries in traditional genres. Glen Engel-Cox points out that instead of like a traditional science fiction, focusing on a \\"driven scientist in that endless pursuit of knowledge\\", As She Climbed Across the Table focuses on \\"someone like us [a science fiction reader], intrigued by the type but not one of them himself.\\" It received some criticism for inaccuracies in scientific principles. Eric Weeks compares it to The Tao of Physics with its \\"muddled attempts to be philosophical about quantum mechanics which fail to get the physics correct.\\" He also talks about how it contains bad physics jokes that he finds distracting.

He studied art at Cummings School of Art in Des Moines, Iowa and graduated from Grinnell College, Iowa in 1921. This was followed by further study at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts. He started his design career in 1933, with the Hammond Clock Company and, in 1934-1935, became a design consultant with Zenith Radio. This involvement with Zenith was to last until his death. He designed many of Zenith's pre-war portable radios, and virtually their entire \\"Trans-Oceanic\\" line. His other radio designs included a \\"universal portable\\" AC/DC radio with batteries (1940), the \\"Poket\\" radio in 1941, and the \\"Transoceanic Clipper\\" in 1942. Although Zenith wanted him to work full-time as an employee, and head an in-house industrial design group, Budlong wished to remain independent to retain other clients. However, he did relocate his offices to the Zenith building on 333 Michigan Avenue, Chicago, that housed Zenith's corporate showrooms. His other major clients included Sunbeam, Sears-Roebuck, and Victor Cash Register. For Sunbeam, he designed the T-20 Toaster in 1950 - a newer type of appliance that lowered bread automatically, and raised itself silently when done - and worked with Sunbeam staff designer Ivar Jepson on the \\"Shavemaster\\" (1950) electric shaver. This model had a smooth, rounded head and an ergonomic shape to be held in the palm of the hand, rather than the previous elongated shape held like a hammer. Budlong's business was taken over after his death in 1955 by one of his associates, Ken Schory Sr. and renamed Ken Schory Associates.

It is situated 113 km south of Queenstown, 59 km east of Te Anau and 100 km north of Invercargill. It had a usually resident population of 210 according to the 2013 New Zealand census. The town is located in a very scenic area, with the mountains of Fiordland creating a beautiful backdrop, with the West Dome (1,271 m) and Mt Hamilton (1,487 m) being prominent land marks.  Agriculture  The town's main industry is agriculture, with many dairy, cattle, deer, and sheep farms nearby. The town was originally based situated around the four original stations; Centre Hill, Castlerock, West Dome and Dunrobin. Dairy farming has become the major industry of the area. Many large dairy farms have been established over the past ten years, converting from past sheep and other mixed farming activities. . In the 1890s Mossburn farmer George Chewings developed a successful grass seed for the district‚Äôs infertile soil. Chewings fescue Festuca rubra subsp. commutata was an ideal constituent in lawn turfs around the world and was used on the playing surface Wimbledon and landing strips in World War 2.  Deer Capital  Mossburn lays claim to being the Deer Capital of New Zealand. This is based on the origins of the successful live deer recovery in the wild by helicopter and subsequent first deer farm in New Zealand being established in 1972. This was spurred on by the high venison prices at the time and the near epidemic population levels of red deer in the wild after their introduction earlier in the century. There still remains many deer farms in the community and the Silver Fern Farms venison processing plant which is a major employer for the community.  Rail  Mossburn's greatest burst of economic activity came as a result of the construction of the Manapouri Power Station. The Mossburn Branch railway had terminated in the town since 1887 and was the closest railway terminus to the project. Previously, the line had been served by two mixed trains of both passengers and freight per week (only freight after 4 October 1937) from Lumsden on the Kingston Branch, but with the commencement of the Manapouri project as well as other government development programmes such as agricultural expansion, one and sometimes two trains would arrive daily from Invercargill. By the start of the 1980s, these projects were complete and the railway closed on 13 December 1982. The Railway Hotel (build 1922) remains as one of the towns social centers, and subsequent old railway lines have been converted into the Around the Mountains Cycle Trail.  Cycle Way  Around the Mountains Cycle Trail was one of the New Zealand Cycle Trail Quick-Start projects, with $4 million being allocated to complete the Walter Peak to Mossburn stage. Stage One was opened by Deputy Prime Minister, Bill English, in a ceremony at nearby Lumsden on 1 November 2014. The trail begins in Kingston utilizing old railway lines past Garston, Athol, Lumsden and Mossburn to then travels past the Mavora Lakes to end at Walter Peak. Tussock reserve west of Mossburn  Wind Farm  During the later part of 2006 and early part of 2007, White Hill Wind Farm was constructed with 29 turbines each of 2.0 MW. In total, it can produce enough electricity to power 30,000 homes when at full capacity. This brought further local employment and financial benefits to the district. The wind farm was officially opened by the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Helen Clark, on 8 June 2007. This project has been greatly supported by the local community and created interest in New Zealand as an example of an alternative energy resource. Now yearly there is a mountain bike race through the wind farm, the White Hill Classic, that draws in mountain biking enthusiasts from the within region and around the country.

His father, an editor, and his mother, a novelist, are thrown into despair when Toby is expelled from school because he has been taking drugs. At a loss as to what to do in order to help their son, Charlie and Maggie Flower keep projecting their own goals and aspirations onto their son. They still talk about his going to university despite Toby's assertion that he is not interested in further education. Toby eventually breaks out of that stifling atmosphere, leaves home and moves to London, where he lives in a basement flat without keeping in touch with his parents. Charlie and Maggie Flower finally turn to a psychiatrist friend of theirs who agrees to have Toby hospitalised and treated for mental illness. As it happens, in London Toby associates with Hermia, the psychiatrist's young but rather unattractive daughter, and makes her pregnant. When their parents conspire and talk Hermia into having an abortion, they unwittingly cut the last remaining bond with their son. Toby fetches Hermia from her parents' home, and the young couple move in with Toby's maternal grandmother, a frail old woman who all along has been sympathetic to the young people's needs.

McGaugh (born December 17, 1931) is an American neurobiologist and author working in the field of learning and memory. He is a Distinguished Professor Emeritus in the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior at the University of California, Irvine and a fellow and founding director of the Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory. Education and positions McGaugh received his B.A. from San Jose State University in 1953 and his Ph.D. in psychology from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1959. He was briefly a professor at San Jose State and then did postdoctoral work in neuropharmacology with Nobel Laureate Professor Daniel Bovet at the Istituto Superiore di Sanit√° in Rome, Italy. He then became a professor at the University of Oregon from 1961 to 1964. He was recruited to the University of California, Irvine, in 1964 (the year of the school's founding) to be the founding chair of the Department of Psychobiology (now Neurobiology and Behavior). He became dean (1967‚Äì1970) of the School of Biological Sciences and Vice Chancellor (1975‚Äì1977) and executive Vice Chancellor (1978‚Äì1982) of the university. In 1982, he founded the Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory and remained director from 1982 to 2004. Early research findings McGaugh's early work (in the 1950s and 1960s) demonstrated that memories are not instantly created in a long-term, permanent fashion. Rather, immediately after a learning event, the memory is labile and susceptible to influence. As time passes, the memory becomes increasingly resistant to external influences and eventually becomes stored in a relatively permanent manner, a process termed memory consolidation. McGaugh found that drugs, given to an animal shortly after a learning event, influence the subsequent retention of that event. The concept of such \\"post-training\\" manipulations is one of McGaugh's greatest contributions to the field of learning and memory because it avoids many potential confounds, such as performance effects of the drug, that may occur when a drug or other treatment is given prior to the training. Over the ensuing decades, McGaugh and his research colleagues and students extended the findings into a long-term investigation of emotionally influenced memory consolidation. As most people realize, they have stronger memories for long-ago events that were emotionally arousing in nature, compared with memories for emotionally neutral events (which may not be remembered well at all). McGaugh's research examined how emotional arousal influences memory consolidation. In particular, he has found that stress hormones, such as epinephrine and cortisol, mediate much of the effects of emotional arousal on subsequent retention of the event. These hormones, in turn, activate a variety of brain structures, including the amygdala, which appears to play a key role in modulating memory consolidation. The amygdala, when activated, influences a variety of other brain structures, including the hippocampus, nucleus accumbens and caudate nucleus that process different aspects of memory. It is through this \\"orchestration\\" of brain structures that memories are eventually formed and stored, though the exact nature of memory storage remains elusive. Honors received McGaugh has been recognized in honor of his achievements, accomplishments, and contributions to the field of learning and memory. In 1981 he was honored with the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award from the American Psychological Association. He received a Merit Award from the National Institute of Mental Health in 1987. McGaugh was elected a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in 1989 and was also elected a member of the Brazilian and Mexican academies of science. He was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and has served as president of the Association for Psychological Science and the Western Psychological Association. He was selected as a William James Fellow, Association for Psychological Science, 1989. Other honors include the John P. McGovern Award from the American Association for the Advancement of Science, 1996 and the Robert S. Dow Neuroscience Award, 2000. The University of L'Aquila, Italy, honored him with the Laurea Honoris Causa in 2001. In 2006 the Western Psychological Association awarded him Lifetime Achievement Award. He received the Norman Anderson Lifetime Achievement Award from the Society of Experimental Psychologists in 2008 where he was elected a Fellow in 1991. He was also honored in 2009 with the Karl Lashley Prize in Neuroscience from the American Philosophical Society. In 2015 he received the Grawemeyer Award for Psychology [(University of Louisville)]. He was also presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award [(Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, University of California, Irvine)] in 2015.

OCTA Chapters work closely with National Trails System partners to help interpret and sustain the quality of outdoor recreation experiences along these trail corridors. For example, OCTA's guide to Mapping Emigrant Trails (MET Manual) became the National Park Service's benchmark protocol for GPS- assisted topographical mapping along other historic and scenic trails. Three major historical trails crossed America's western territories as wagon train routes to Santa Fe, Oregon, and California. The Santa Fe Trail began in 1821 as a foreign trade route to New Mexico. It was unique in American History due to its overland commerce routes rather than seafaring transportation. The Oregon Trail became more heavily traveled in 1843 by settlers wanting to establish new homes in the northwest. Other pioneers forked off on the equally long and grueling California Trail to seek their fortunes in the gold fields.

He is often called the 'father of Iraqi modern art.'  Life and career  Hassan was born in Baghdad in 1914 into a poor family. His father had died before the infant, Hassan, was born. As a child, he helped his mother who made folkloric clay statues of Arab Bedouins and local farmers. As a young boy, he visited his uncle who was working as a gardener for King Faisal I where the King saw the boy drawing a horse. Recognising his talent, the King promised to give the young artist a scholarship. However, the King died in 1933 before he could carry out his promise.\\"Profile: Faik Hassan,\\" Al Jazeera, 31 October 2005, Online\\" During the early 1930s, Hassan gave art lessons at a local school, and when the new King Faisal II visited his school, he ordered that Hassan be sent to Paris to study art, thus fulfilling his father's earlier promise to the young boy. Hassan was also allocated a private French tutor so that he could learn French prior to his departure.Sabrah,S.A. and Ali, M.,\\" Iraqi Artwork Red List: A Partial List of the Artworks Missing from the National Museum of Modern Art, Baghdad, Iraq, 2010, p. 10 He graduated from the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, Paris in 1938.Iraqi Artists at the Art History Archive, retrieved June 14th 2007.

Established in 1959, the College caters for students in years 7 to 12. The school's Principal is Loretta Wholley. History Merici College is named in honour of Italian saint St. Angela Merici. The College is the oldest Catholic girls' school in Canberra. It was founded in 1959 as Canberra Catholic Girls' High School. The letters CCGH can be seen on the original gates at the Ipima Street side of the building. At that time, although there were several Catholic boys' schools in the area, there was no equivalent institution for female Catholic students. The founding of Merici is unusual among Catholic schools in that, rather than being established by a single order of nuns, it was originally intended as an archdiocesan school. The school was staffed by nuns from six different orders; the Sisters of Mercy, the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart, the Presentation Sisters, the Ursuline Sisters, the Brigidines and the Sisters of the Good Samaritan. When a second Catholic girls' college opened in Canberra in the 1960s, the school became known as Braddon Catholic Girls High School. In 1977 following a decline in enrolments it was decided to trial co-education with seven boys enrolling. The name was changed to Braddon Catholic High School. 1978 saw the largest intake of boys with 49 in total enrolling. During 1978 it was decided that the school should once again return to being a girls only school with a decision being taken to no longer enrol boys. A letter was sent out to parents of the boys already at the school suggesting that it might be preferable for the boys to enroll at Daramalan College, St Edmund's College, or Marist College Canberra. The total number of boys dwindled over the ensuing years to just four boys during 1983. In 2009 the College celebrated its Golden Jubilee. Pastoral care system Merici College has a vertical pastoral care system. This system replaces the more common Australian system of having a year coordinator assigned to each year group. Upon enrolment to the school, each student is assigned to one of six houses, each associated with one of the founding religious orders. The houses are: Penola (white and black), Balgo (yellow), Brescia (purple), Ningil (red) (named for a mission in Papua New Guinea founded by Nano Nagle's Presentation Sisters), Seiwa (named after Seiwa College) (blue) and Tullow (green). Students remain in their appointed house throughout their time at the college. They are also assigned to a vertically integrated pastoral care class consisting of students from all year levels in the same house. Community involvement Merici College has a St. Vincent de Paul Society. Each year, Merici participates in sporting events organised by various Canberra sporting bodies. Sports that the school competes in include: soccer, softball, netball, hockey, basketball, volleyball, swimming, water polo, track and field, touch football, golf, tennis, equestrian and snow sports. The school is affiliated with Associated Southern Colleges. Merici College is the sister school of Marist College Canberra.

The school's official name was shortened to the \\"University of Florida\\" in 1909. and Florida State University,Florida State University was first known as the West Florida Seminary from its founding until 1901, then as Florida State College from 1901 to 1905, as the Florida Female College from 1905 to 1909, and from 1909 to 1947 as the Florida State College for Women. Adding to the confusing succession of names, the Florida Legislature granted the West Florida Seminary the right to call itself the \\"University of Florida\\" from 1885 to 1903, although it is unclear how widely used this title was, given that the school continued to call itself the West Florida Seminary and then Florida State College throughout this period. Aspiring to refashion Florida Agricultural College into a more comprehensive university, the legislature renamed it the \\"University of Florida,\\" a name which it used exclusively from 1903 to 1905. As a result of the Buckman Act, Florida Agricultural College was abolished and its academic programs merged into the new University of the State of Florida in 1905. and he played an important role in the organization, growth and ultimate success of both institutions.

It is named after Lord Hardinge, who was the Viceroy of India from 1910 to 1916. The bridge is long. Construction Construction of the through truss bridge began in 1910, though it was proposed at least 20 years earlier. It was constructed by Braithwaite and Kirk Company based on design of Sir Alexander Meadows Rendel. It was completed in 1912, and trains started moving on it in 1915. Brief history Hardinge Bridge construction (1910) The construction of a railway bridge over the Padma was proposed in 1889 by the Eastern Bengal Railway for easier communication between Calcutta and the then Eastern Bengal and Assam. In 1902, Sir FJE Spring prepared a report on the bridge. A technical committee reported that a bridge could be constructed at Sara crossing the lower Ganges between the Paksey and Bheramara Upazila stations on the broad gauge railway from Khulna to Parbatipur Upazila. The construction of the bridge started in 1910 and finished two years later. The bridge comprises 15 steel trusses. The main girders are modified \\"Petit\\" type. The most difficult task of the operation was to prevent bank erosion and to make the river flow permanently under the bridge. For this, two guide banks of the \\"Bell-bund\\" type named after J. R. Bell were built on either side, each extending upstream and downstream from the bridge. The ends of the river banks were curved inward and heavily pitched with stone. Hardinge Bridge was severely damaged during the Liberation War of Bangladesh of 1971.[http://www.bharat- rakshak.com/1971/Dec12/index.html More information on the Liberation War of Bangladesh damage It happened on 13 December 1971, when the Indian Air Force plane bombed on the 4th guarder from the Paksey side. As the Pakistani army was on retreat towards Jessore (their last stronghold) Hardinge Bridge was strategically very important. The allied force damaged the bridge. The Japanese Government helped to reconstruct the bridge. It is the second largest railway bridge in Bangladesh. Another bridge named Lalon Shah Bridge for road transport beside the Hardinge Bridge has recently been constructed.

Nonnebakken (literally, \\"The Nun Hill\\") is a hill in Odense, Denmark. It is the site of one of Denmark's six former Viking ring castles, built during the reign of Sweyn Forkbeard, who had forced his father Harold Bluetooth to leave the country and seek refuge by the Jomsvikings on Wollin (modern Poland) around 975. The fort enabled its occupier command of the Odense River passing next to the hill. The name refers to a benedictine nunnery located here in earlier times. At the end of the 12th century, the nuns left the site to build a new church in Dalum to the southeast, now a suburb of Odense. The earthwork ramparts can be recognized in the \\"panorama of Odense\\" in the medieval tome Civitates Orbis Terrarum from Georg Braun and Frans Hogenberg. The panorama appears as plate 30 in Volume 5, finished in 1598.Although first published in 1612-18 in Cologne? Plate 30 was engraved in 1593, based on information from Heinrich Rantzau or from sketches he gave in order. It also appears on the panorama of Odense published by Braunius in 1593. The archaeological remains of Nonnebakken took heavy damage during the late 19th century, when a building for the Odd Fellow lodge was constructed on the site. In the 20th century, scientific excavations led by Fyns Stiftsmuseum revealed that the circular castle had an inner diameter of 120 m and was built in the years 980-1000, similar to the other Viking ring castles.  Excavation and finds  Although finds have been reported from 1775 and 1889, the extent of the whole structure was first determined in 1953. In 1988, archaeological excavations was conducted in relation to a construction project involving cable laying. A filled ditch with a pointed profile around the fortress was observed. It was at least 4 m wide and 2 m deep, with a berm of maximal 10-12 m. The latest filling could be dated to the time of the nunnery. The profile of a pointed bottom ditch 8 m wide and some 4 m deep, was also excavated in the northeast and the northwest. During excavations prior to larger construction works for heating pipes in 1995/97/98, a ditch 11 m wide and 3 m deep was observed.

After serving his sentence he became one of the colony's ex-convict school teachers. Through his agitation for education reform, he played an important role in \\"shaping the education system and political policies in the colony\\". He later distinguished himself as a journalist. James Elphinstone Roe was born in Kirkby on Bain, Lincolnshire, and baptised there on 18 October 1818. His father was Rev. Thomas Roe, the town's rector, and his mother was Catherine Sarah n√©e Elphinstone. Nothing is known of his childhood, but in June 1836 he began studies at Worcester College, Oxford. During his university years he was a member of the Oxford Movement, an organisation that aimed to return the Church of England to its Catholic roots, and which later collapsed after one of its leaders renounced the Church of England and converted to Catholicism. Although Roe himself remained an Anglican throughout his life, he was often sympathetic to and supportive of Catholic causes, and had a number of Catholic friends. Roe graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1841, and is thought to have taken his holy orders shortly afterwards. In August 1843, he married Susannah Moore. They would have fourteen children, of which nine survived beyond childhood. In 1861, James Roe was convicted in the Old Bailey of forging a money order. Apparently Roe had expected to be left money by an uncle, Edward Roe, but a cousin had induced the uncle to make a will in the cousin's favour only a week before the uncle's death. After the uncle's death, Roe had produced a money order for ¬£6000 apparently made out to him from the uncle. The cousin challenged the authenticity of the order, and Roe was charged with forgery. The prosecution's case mainly hinged upon evidence suggesting that the date stamp on the envelope in which the money order was claimed to have been sent had been faked. Roe was found guilty and sentenced to ten years' penal labour. According to Rica Erickson, his family always believed in his innocence. Roe was transported to what was then the British penal colony of Western Australia on board the York, arriving in December 1862. He received his ticket of leave in August 1864, and took work as a privately employed schoolmaster at York. Four months later his family arrived in Western Australia on board the Hastings. Roe met his family at Fremantle and immediately escorted them back to York. It is said that Roe's wife refused an offer of hospitality from Bishop Hale's wife Sabina at Fremantle, because the offer did not include her husband. During their time at York, the financial needs of the large family kept Roe and his wife separated. Susannah Roe found work teaching a class in the town, and James Roe worked at the Seven Mile Spring on the road to Guildford, probably also as a teacher. Susannah Roe Roe was probably more highly qualified to teach than anyone else in the colony at the time, but his convict status, especially the fact that he had not yet received his conditional pardon, would normally have precluded him from being offered an official teaching position. However Bishop Hale, who was also chairman of the Board of Education, sympathised with the family's plight, and in 1866 he tried to secure for Roe and his wife a joint appointment to a new school at Greenough. Unable to organise accommodation for Roe's large family, the Board of Education eventually appointed only James Roe to the position, but arranged for Susannah Roe to be offered a position at a private school in Geraldton. James Roe started at Greenough early in 1867, and by April the local Education Board reported positively on his progress. Susannah Roe was then transferred to his school, and the couple were finally able to live under the same roof. This arrangement was to last only nine months, however, as in January 1868, Susannah Roe was transferred to a new school at South Greenough. Roe's relationship with his local Education Board began to sour in 1870, after the appointment of Hayes Laurence as its chairman. Roe and Laurence immediately found themselves on opposing sides of one of the most controversial issues of the day: the question of whether Catholic schools should receive a government grant. Laurence and other Protestants on the Board interpreted Roe's support for the measure as \\"a sign of pro-Popery\\". It is also thought that Roe contributed to his disfavour with the Board by voicing his strong views on school management. These issues were cited in a list of complaints sent to Roe in the middle of the year. A few months later he was late to school one day, and the local Board unanimously asked the General Board to dismiss him. The parents of forty-two of the forty-six school children signed a memorial to the General Board stating that Roe had their full confidence, but the request of the local Board was endorsed nonetheless, and Roe was dismissed. Having been dismissed from his post, Roe was now able to speak freely on the education system in which he had worked. On 28 January 1871, he wrote a long letter to the Fremantle Herald, outlining a series of recommendations for education reform. He proposed: #That attendance should be made compulsory; #That the ages of attendance should be raised; #That good books and teaching aids should be provided, instead of the current \\"execrable rubbish... bad grammar, bad English, bad taste and unutterable tediousness\\"; #That salaries should be raised substantially to attract decent teachers; #That qualified inspectors should be appointed to assess the quality of teaching; #That teaching should be secular only; #That control of the education system should be in the hands of a secular board or minister of education. Later that year, the Elementary Education Act 1871 was passed, and some of Roe's proposals were adopted. Attendance of children who lived within three miles of a school was made compulsory, the ages of attendance was raised, and a system of inspection was introduced. Within his lifetime, Roe would see more of his measures introduced: salaries were raised and large numbers of trained teachers recruited; and responsibility for administration of government schools was passed to a minister of education responsible to parliament. For the next two years Roe and his family remained at Greenough. Susannah Roe continued in her teaching post at South Greenough, and Roe leased a small farm and cut sandalwood. He also acted as agent, auctioneer and clerk for Henry Gray. He also began to work as a local correspondent for the Fremantle Herald, and in 1873 this resulted in an offer of full-time work as a reporter on the newspaper. At the end of the year, Susannah Roe resigned her job as a teacher, and the family moved to Perth, where Roe took up his position with the Herald. Shortly afterwards he joined James Pearce and William Beresford as co-editors. He worked at the paper for the rest of his life, by which time Beresford had died, and Pearce had sold the Herald to the Inquirer. Susannah Roe died in 1887. James Roe found it increasingly difficult thereafter to live on the money he made from the Herald, so from 1890 he also worked in his daughter's market garden. He died in May 1897. James Roe's daughter Helen married Patrick Stone, who later became a Member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly. His daughter Georgina married Joseph Walton, and another daughter Agnes married Herman Moll.

It can be produced by one of two factors. 1\\\\. Perched coastlines can be created by higher sea levels in the past than today. For example during the last Ice Age interglacial period, climates were significantly warmer than today, and thermal expansion of the oceans, together with increased melting of glaciers, meant that sea levels were higher than they are today. This has created evidence of perched coastlines all around the world. 2\\\\. Perched coastlines can be created through coastal uplift from local geological processes, particularly along the edges of rift valleys or subduction zones of tectonic plates.

Originally created in 1994 for The Batman Adventures Annual #1, a series published by DC Comics, based on Batman: The Animated Series, Roxy was incorporated into The New Batman Adventures in the episode \\"The Ultimate Thrill\\", which first aired on September 14, 1998. Shortly thereafter, Roxy appeared in \\"Knight Time\\", an episode of Superman: The Animated Series. Roxy later appeared in several comic books based on the TV show. In 2006, the character was introduced to the main DC Universe. Appearance Roxy wears a black tank top under a brown pilot's jacket. She wears what seem to be black leggings and a visor. She has a holster for a ray gun. She is a busty, tall and slender woman with red hair and black lipstick. Fictional character biography =DC Animated Universe= Roxy Rocket was first seen in the projects in the DC Animated Universe voiced by Charity James. In her appearance on The New Batman Adventures, Roxanne \\"Roxy Rocket\\" Sutton was formerly a stunt double for a Hollywood actress. However, she lost her job after she tried to make her stunts too dangerous for any company to insure her. Out of work, but still hungering for thrills, Sutton began stealing jewels for Penguin, while slightly seducing him. Unlike other villains in Gotham City, Roxy's crimes were fairly benign. She was always the one being put at risk. Batman also took risks in his attempts to catch Roxy in midair chases, leading Roxy to believe Batman was a kindred spirit who understood the pleasure of risk-taking. In the end, however, Roxy realized her feelings were unrequited when Batman had her arrested as the police approach the area. When she asked what this was, Batman quoted \\"My game and you lost.\\" Roxy next appeared in \\"Knight Time\\", an episode of Superman: The Animated Series. In what amounts to a cameo appearance, Roxy tries her luck in Metropolis where she ends up tipping off Superman to the fact that Batman is conspicuously absent in Gotham. Unlike Batman (who cannot fly), Superman picks Roxy off her rocket speeder with no effort at all. The episode eventually leads to a team- up between Robin and Superman. Roxy Rocket appears in The Batman Adventures Annual #1 where she vows to \\"straighten up and fly right\\". However she is seen robbing a safe on a security camera, but it turns out she was framed by Catwoman. Angered at this, she tries, along with Batman, to apprehend her which results in a fight between the two women. Catwoman tries to hold her hostage with the intent of killing her but Roxy manages to get away and knocks her off the rooftop with a punch. Roxy makes the effort to save her but Catwoman slashes her hand instead choosing to fall down into the alleyway below. Roxy expresses worry and extreme remorse thinking that she has killed her but Batman reassures her that Catwoman still has \\"eight more lives\\". In Justice League Adventures #6, Hawkgirl posed as Roxy Rocket. In Justice League Adventures #10, Roxy Rocket made a cameo where she uses a rocket pack instead of her usual rocket speeder. =Comics= Roxy Rocket makes a cameo appearance in the pages of Detective Comics #822, written by Paul Dini. She is trying to shake Batman off her rocket after she has stolen ion thruster plans from Gotham's S.T.A.R. Labs. This does not work. They crash high on the Sprang River Bridge and it takes Batman an hour and a half to get them both down. This is her first appearance in the DC Universe. After a lengthy absence from the DCU, Roxy made her first proper appearance in Batgirl #6-7, as one of the villains in Roulette's game, and is shown battling the new Batgirl, Stephanie Brown in the Batgirl #7 cover.http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/files/2009/11/bgv2-cv7.jpg Roxy appeared in Batman: Black and White #1.

She also appears in Batman: White Knight #3-4, as part of a group of mind-controlled villains. Analysis Series producer and writer Paul Dini has said that Roxy had always been a favorite of his. \\"She's a character Bruce Timm and I created for the first Batman Adventures Annual,\\" Dini said. \\"We always liked her, so we created a television story for her. Sparks fly in that one.\\" Bruce Timm called the television episode \\"probably the most blatantly risque episode we've ever done.\\"Dini, P. (2009). \\"Batman: Mad Love and other Stories\\" Powers and abilities Roxy has no powers, but she has an arsenal of skills that gave Batman a challenge. She has displayed an exceptional skill in acrobatics and stunts due to her former employment as a stunt double. She has a skill in flying her trademark rocket , and has enough knowledge in mechanics to be able to repair it. She is also very skilled in hand to hand combat, as she was able to easily defeat Jay, Lark, and Raven, the Penguin's henchwomen, who have been trained so well they were fighting on par and sometimes gaining the upper hand on Batwoman.

History Following the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, K≈çchi Castle was constructed in what was then the province of Tosa. It was built by Yamanouchi Kazutoyo, who took control of the province after the Tokugawa victory. The castle was constructed as part of the move from Urado to the more defensible Otakasa (alt. Odakasa) area.K≈çchi City Online Guide, \\"Sightseeing in Kochi City\\" in English (archive) Construction was begun in 1601 and was completed in 1611. Much of the original fortress burned down in 1727; it was reconstructed between 1729 and 1753 in the original style. The castle underwent major restoration from 1948 to 1959. Though no battles were fought at the castle, it is noteworthy because the castle is the original structure, and not a post-war replica. It is also the only castle in Japan to retain both its original tenshu, or keep, and its palace, the residence of the local daimy≈ç. _Architecture in the Feudal Style: Japanese Feudal Residences_ , Hashimoto Fumio, trans. and adapted by H.

Both failed. The first attempt was by Otakasa Matsuomaru sometime during the late Heian or Kamakura periods. The second was in 1588 by the conqueror of Shikoku, Ch≈çsokabe Motochika. The area around the hill at this time was extremely swampy, due to the influx of alluvial sediments from the Kagami River. Consequently, previous builders were never successful in establishing a permanent fortress on the site where K≈çchi Castle stands today.Kochi City Online Guide, \\"History\\" in English =National Treasure Status= As one of only twelve intact castles in Japan, K≈çchi Castle was popularly called a National Treasure (ÂõΩÂÆù) before the 1950 National Treasure Protection Law (ÊñáÂåñË≤°‰øùË≠∑Ê≥ïÊñΩ) was enacted. After the law was passed, it was demoted to the status of Important Cultural Asset (ÈáçË¶ÅÊñáÂåñË≤°).Wikipedia page on K≈çchi Castle in Japanese family crest Tosa kasiwa(Yamanouchi clan) =In popular culture= K≈çchi Castle can be seen in the background of the animated film Ocean Waves (I Can Hear the Sea) by Studio Ghibli, during the class reunion scene. The castle figures prominently in the film The Harimaya Bridge. Key scenes in the movie take place in the courtyard just inside the Oteman Gate, on the top level of the castle itself, and at the entrance to the castle grounds just outside the Otemon Gate. Structure Two rivers, the Kagami River and the Enokuchi River, form the outer moat of the castle. The tower is five stories high and sits atop Otakasa Hill, commanding an extensive view of the city. It rises above the Kaitokukan (palace), which was constructed in the Shoin style of the Edo period. The castle retains this structure today and has been fitted with period-appropriate items in the lower rooms. In addition to a tearoom, genkan (entrance area), and latrine, the Kaitokukan contains eight traditional rooms, ranging in size from three to twelve tatami. It is surrounded by a veranda on the east and south sides. The Kaitokukan also burned during the fire of 1727, but it was not repaired until 1747, with work completed in 1749. Visiting Castle and central K≈çchi city K≈çchi Castle is located in downtown K≈çchi. The main entrance is directly across from the west entrance of the Obiyamachi shopping area. Visitors are asked to remove their footwear before entering the building, however slippers are provided. As the castle is quite old, the tatami rooms are visible but not accessible. There is a small museum area with information entirely in Japanese. This museum houses several cultural artifacts of the Tosa region not native to the castle itself. The upper rooms of the tower are all empty, but visitors are allowed to climb to the top. There is a railing but no net around the balcony. Handicap access is extremely limited, as the approach to the castle involves many steps, and there is no elevator. The castle grounds are now a public park, and a popular location in spring for hanami. They contain the Prefectural Library and the K≈çchi Literary Museum, in addition to statues of notable scions of the Yamanouchi family.

In the book, Singer argues that the view of human nature provided by evolutionary science, particularly by evolutionary psychology, is compatible with the ideological framework of the Left and should be incorporated into it. Summary Singer believes that the Left will be better able to achieve its social and economic goals if it incorporates the more accurate view of human nature provided by evolutionary science: \\"To be blind to the facts about human nature is to risk disaster\\". For example, Singer argues that the Left's view of human nature as highly malleable, which he identifies with Marxism and the standard social science model, is incorrect. Singer argues that evolutionary psychology suggests that humans naturally tend to be self-interested. He further argues that the evidence that selfish tendencies are natural must not be taken as evidence that selfishness is right. He concludes that game theory (the mathematical study of strategy) and experiments in psychology offer hope that self-interested people will make short-term sacrifices for the good of others, if society provides the right conditions. Essentially, Singer claims that although humans possess selfish, competitive tendencies naturally, they have a substantial capacity for cooperation that has also been selected for during human evolution. Reception The philosopher Philip Kitcher has criticised the book's handling of sociobiology, saying that it contains \\"credulous retailing of sociobiological speculations\\" while noting that \\"much of this book is admirable in its clarity, directness, and grasp of central points\\".

The Master of Divinity (M.Div.) degree program began in Fall 2018.http://www.synod.com/synod/eng2018/20180608_enhtsgraduation.htmlhttp://www.nysed.gov/common/nysed/files/htos- borapprovalsubstchg-accessible.pdf It is not to be confused with Holy Trinity Seminary in Dallas, Texas or Holy Trinity College and Seminary in New Port Richey, Florida. Background The mission of Holy Trinity Orthodox Seminary is to serve the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia by preparing students for service to the Church. It trains students in disciplines that are preparatory for active service to the Church as clergy, monastics, choir directors and cantors, iconographers, and lay leaders to realize this mission. As the only seminary of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia, the Seminary welcomes applicants not only from the United States but also from abroad. It serves parishes in all corners of the world. With the immigration of Russians to the United States, United Kingdom, and other western nations since the Revolution in the early 20th century, many members of ROCOR are now primarily English-speaking. In addition, the English language has gained prominence as an international language. Therefore, Holy Trinity Orthodox Seminary offers instruction in English to English-speaking seminarians. The Russian language continues to be taught at HTS. The Seminary emphasizes the importance of the spiritual life in theological education. Active participation in the life of the Holy Trinity Monastery, on whose premises the seminary is located, allows students to participate firsthand in the spiritual depth of the Orthodox Church and gives future clergy the rare opportunity to gain a thorough foundation in and experience of the Orthodox liturgical life. The Seminary strives to preserve the high scholarly standards, teaching, and traditions of the Russian Orthodox Church. The Seminary is located near New York's historic Mohawk Valley, which runs through the center of the state west of the Hudson River. It is located one mile north of the village of Jordanville in Herkimer County, within a triangle formed by Cooperstown, Utica and Albany, capital of the state. The seminary was founded in 1948 under the auspices of Holy Trinity Monastery, and the Seminary's life continues to be intimately bound with that of the Monastery. History Holy Trinity Orthodox Seminary was founded in 1948 by Archbishop Vitaly (Maximenko) under the auspices of Holy Trinity Monastery, located near Jordanville in Herkimer County in the Mohawk Valley. The life of the Seminary continues to be intimately interwoven with that of the Monastery. The Seminary was first established as a school for the young members of the monastic brotherhood. Founders Archbishop Vitaly and Dean Nicholas Alexander created an institution that has developed as a theological school for Orthodox Christian students from all over the world. Pastoral courses were developed to serve the needs of non-Russian speakers, as many members of the church in the early 21st century are English speakers, either as first or second languages. The seminary has also expanded its mission by adding a Summer School of Liturgical Music. These changes augment the main mission and goal of the seminary: to serve the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR) through preparing students for service in the Church. This is the only Seminary of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia. The Seminary admits applicants not only from the US, but also from abroad. It emphasizes the importance of spiritual life in theological education. Active participation in the life of the monastery allows the students to experience firsthand the spiritual depth of the Orthodox Church. Future clergy have a rare opportunity to gain a thorough foundation and experience of the Orthodox liturgical life. The seminary strives to preserve the high scholarly standards, teachings, and traditions of the pre-revolutionary Russian Orthodox Church. Its library, print shop, publications, museum, and archives play an important role in achieving this goal. Publishing By maintaining a religious printing press, the Monastery fills a considerable need among the faithful. Several periodicals are printed in Russian and English, containing articles on contemporary religious issues, lives of saints, sermons, questions of theology, etc. Both students and faculty participate in the writing, editing and printing of these magazines. Many of the students are engaged in translating articles for publication.

A historically important link between underground comix and what would later be called alternative comics, this 36-page, 6\\" √ó 9\\" hybrid with glossy color covers and black-and-white interiors contains 11 sometimes sexually frank stories by such mainstream creators as Neal Adams, Archie Goodwin, Denny O'Neil, Herb Trimpe, Al Williamson, and Wally Wood. The creators were mainly friends of Steinberg, working for a low page rate. Most of its stories revolve around New York City (colloquially known as the Big Apple) during a particularly low ebb in the city's finances, crime situation, race relations, and infrastructure. Publication history The one-shot comic book was among a handful of 1960s-1970s precursors of the independently produced comics that first proliferated with the 1980s rise of \\"direct market\\" comic-book stores. Other such early links between underground comix and modern independents include Mike Friedrich's Star*Reach and Wood's own witzend. Critic Ken Jones, in a 1986 retrospective review, suggested that Big Apple Comix and Mark Evanier's High Adventure may have been \\"the first true alternative comics\\". Cited in The comic featured writer-editor Goodwin displaying his cartoonist abilities; Adams and a fledgling Larry Hama sharing vertically split pages to parallel a street prostitute with a corporate secretary using sex to further her career; and Wood's story \\"My Word\\", a bitter parody of the Al Feldstein-scripted \\"My World\\" that Wood illustrated in EC Comics' Weird Science #22 (Dec. 1953). Linda Fite and John Verpoorten handled production work for the comic, released with an indicia date of September 1975. Steinberg printed 20,000 copies.

Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) has been identified as the major etiological agent of human dental caries. The development of a vaccine for tooth decay has been under investigation for more than 30 years. In 1972, a caries vaccine was said to be in animal testing in England, and that it would have begun human testing soon. Intrinsic difficulties in developing it, coupled with lack of strong economic interests, are the reasons why no such vaccine is commercially available . Several types of vaccines are being developed at research centres, with some kind of caries vaccines being considered to diminish or prevent dental caries' impact on young people. Attempts using antibodies Early attempts followed a traditional approach to vaccination where normal S. mutans was introduced to promote a reaction from the immune system, stimulating antibody production. Planet Biotechnology developed a monoclonal antibody against S. mutans, branded CaroRx, produced with transgenic tobacco plants. It is a therapeutic vaccine, applied once every several months. Phase II clinical trials were discontinued in 2016. The International Association for Dental Research and American Association for Dental Research announced a study performed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences which looked at using an inhaled vaccine that uses a protein filament as a delivery vehicle. Trials performed in rats showed an increase in antibody response along with a decrease in the amount of Streptococcus mutans adhering to teeth, leading to significantly fewer cavities observed among the test population. Attempts using replacement therapy On a different line of research, Jeffrey Hillman from the University of Florida developed a genetically modified strain of Streptococcus mutans called BCS3-L1, that is incapable of producing lactic acid ‚Äì the acid that dissolves tooth enamel ‚Äì and aggressively replaces native flora. In laboratory tests, rats who were given BCS3-L1 were conferred with a lifetime of protection against S. mutans. BCS3-L1 colonizes the mouth and produces a small amount of a lantibiotic, called MU1140, which allows it to out-compete S. mutans. Hillman suggested that treatment with BCS3-L1 in humans could also provide a lifetime of protection, or, at worst, require occasional re-applications. He stated that the treatment would be available in dentists' offices and \\"will probably cost less than $100.\\" The product was being developed by Oragenics, but was shelved in 2014, citing regulatory concerns and patent issues. In 2016, Oragenics received a 17-year patent for the product. On rare occasions the native S. mutans strain escapes into the blood, potentially causing dangerous heart infections. It is unclear how likely BCS3-L1 is to do the same. Another approach is being pursued by BASF, focused on replacing native lactobacillus flora with a variety dubbed L. anti-caries, which prevents S. mutans from binding to enamel. However, it is not a long- term vaccination in that no attempt is being made to have a self-sustaining population of L. anti-caries. The intent is that the L. anti-caries population would be frequently replenished through use of a chewing gum containing the organism. The University of Leeds has also begun researching a recently discovered peptide known as P11-4. When applied to a cavity and coming in contact with saliva, this peptide assembles itself in a fibrous matrix or scaffold, attracting calcium and thereby allowing the tooth to regenerate. The Swiss-based company Credentis has licensed the peptide and launched a product called Curodont Repair in 2013. Recent studies show a positive clinical effect. DNA vaccines  DNA vaccine approaches for dental cavities have had a history of success in animal models. Dental cavity vaccines directed to key components of S. mutans colonization and enhanced by safe and effective adjuvants and optimal delivery vehicles, are likely to be forthcoming. S. mutans believe that rational target for developing an anti-caries vaccine is protein antigen, which has an adherent functional and important immunogenic regions. Bacteriophage treatment The use of Enterococcus faecalis bacteriophages as a form of treatment for caries has been considered, as they are capable of maintaining persistent stability in human saliva.

Masters of Mass Production, p. 277, Bobbs-Merrill Co., Indianapolis, IN, 1945. Early years William Bushnell Stout was born March 16, 1880 in Quincy, Illinois. He graduated from the Mechanic Arts High School, in St. Paul, Minnesota in 1898. He then attended Hamline University, and transferred in his second year to the University of Minnesota, being forced to quit due to extreme eye problems. He married Alma Raymond in 1906. Stout was interested in mechanics, especially aeronautics, founding the Model Aero Club of Illinois. In 1907 he became Chief Engineer for the Schurmeir Motor Truck Company and in 1912, he became automobile and aviation editor for the Chicago Tribune. In the same year he founded Aerial Age, the first aviation magazine ever published in the United States. He was also a contributor to the Minneapolis Times under the pen name, \\"Jack Knieff.\\"Ford 1993, p. 276. Automotive career Stout Scarab In 1914, Stout became Chief Engineer of the Scripps-Booth Automobile Company. His \\"Cyclecar\\" had caught the attention of Alvan MacCauley who subsequently brought Stout to Packard Motors in Detroit. He had become General Sales Manager of the Packard Motor Car Company and in 1916, when they started an aviation division, they asked Stout to become its first Chief Engineer. In 1919 he started the Stout Engineering Company in Dearborn, Michigan, complete with a research section and later built the prototype Stout Scarab car in 1932. In 1934 he founded the Stout Motor Car Company.Ford 1993, p. 278. The \\"beetle-like\\" Scarab featured an all-aluminum tubular airframe covered with aluminum skin, with the engine compartment at the rear, a sealed storage compartment in front of a passenger compartment with reclining aircraft-type seats. The front or nose of the vehicle contained the spare tire. Only nine Scarabs were ever built and although advanced, the public never appreciated the innovative features of the vehicles. In the mid-1930s, Stout in co- operation with L.B. Kalb of Continental Motors, a major manufacture of lightweight air cooled aircraft engines, and did some extensive research and pre-production development into rear engine drive automobiles which were powered by aircraft engines. Stout even commissioned the well known Dutch auto designer John Tjaarda to design some streamlined car bodies, although none of the car designs ever reached production.\\"Airplane Engine Adopted To Streamline Car.\\" Popular Mechanics, February 1935. In the last years of World War II, Stout, in co-operation with Owen-Corning, began what was called Project Y to build a one-off car for evaluation of ideas like a frame-less fiberglass body, belt drive rear wheel drive, a suspension which kept the vehicle from leaning into turns by adjusting the suspension using compressed air, and push button electric doors. When the vehicle was made public in 1946, Stout picked the name Forty-Six for that year. Some firms considered producing the Forty- Six, but as Stout stated he doubted there would be much of a market for a $10,000 dollar car, the estimated price if it had been mass-produced.\\"GLASS CAR Needs No Frame.\\" Popular Science, July 1946, pp. 84‚Äì85.; Hacker, G. \\"The Project Y Forty Six Stout.\\" Forgotten Fiberglas, May 2011. Aviation career Ford Trimotor Stout's aviation career began as a result of his success in his automotive efforts. He began to build a number of all-metal aircraft designs, which, like the earliest aircraft designs of Andrei Tupolev in the Soviet Union, was based on the pioneering work of Hugo Junkers. In February 1923, newspapers carried stories of the test flights of the Stout Air Sedan with Walter Lees as the pilot. In 1924 his company, the Stout Metal Airplane Company, was bought by the Ford Motor Company. Stout developed a thick-wing monoplane, and his design of an internally braced cantilevered wing improved the efficiency of aircraft. This led to the development of the famous \\"Batwing Plane\\" and the all-metal \\"Torpedo Plane\\". After his career at Packard Motors, he left for Washington to serve as the advisor to the United States Aircraft Board. Stout developed an all-metal transport aircraft for mail use, the Stout 2-AT. His three engine follow-on, the Stout 3-AT, was underpowered, and did not perform as well, leaving Stout out of the engineering role in his company newly acquired by Ford. The redesigned 3-AT did form the basis for the popular Ford Trimotor aircraft. In August 1925, Stout inaugurated Stout Air Services, which operated the first regularly scheduled airline in the United States. Stout also built the Liberty-powered all-metal monoplanes to initiate this service. Later, between 1928 and 1932, the airline flew passengers and Ford cargo between Dearborn, Chicago and Cleveland. In 1929, Stout sold Stout Air Services to United Airlines. After the Great Depression in 1929 reduced sales of the Trimotor aircraft, Stout left Ford in 1930. Although no longer with Ford, he continued to operate his Stout Engineering Laboratory. Stout also invested in the short-lived Wichita, Kansas based Buckley Aircraft Company, developing the all-aluminum Buckley LC-4.Skyways, July 1999. In 1930 Stout said: \\"Aviation in the U.S. has been stagnating for two years. We are all copying. Aviation has shown no progress ... comparable to that made in radio and talking pictures. Think how many copies have been made of the plane Colonel Lindbergh used on his flight across the Atlantic ... of other famous planes. None of us are building the plane that the public wants to buy, and that proves we are standing still.\\"\\"Stout Belief.\\" Time magazine, May 26, 1930. Retrieved: February 2, 2011. In 1943 Stout sold the Stout engineering laboratory to Consolidated Vultee Aircraft Corporation becoming the Stout Research Division of Consolidated. He was named the director of Convair's research division through World War II.Ford 1993, pp. 276, 317. While at Consolidated, Stout promoted three designs for postwar production, including a flying car using a Spratt wing.Flying Magazine, August 1945, p. 78. Stout's other innovations included the Skycar, an automobile/airplane hybrid and a Pullman Railplane and Club Car. He is also known as the originator of prefab housing and the sliding car seat. All of these innovations were modern in design, incorporating many features new in both appearance and function, features not yet available in vehicle design. Death Stout retired to Phoenix, Arizona and died on March 20, 1956, four days after his 76th birthday.\\"Designed the First All-Metal Passenger and Military Planes in America.

CTD (Crushed-to-Dust) Cube: The 3 Faces of Grip Strength. IronMind There are differences from brand to brand, but the common features of standard grippers are that they use a torsion spring fitted with two handles. The exact dimensions of these elements vary, as well as the materials used to make them; the springs are made from various types of steel, and the handles are generally made from wood, plastic, steel or aluminum. History Grippers from the early part of the 20th century to the middle of the 20th century typically had wooden handles, were quite easy for a strong person to close and were a regularly advertised product in bodybuilding-weightlifting magazines.Hoffman, Bob.

Variations of this basic movement include negatives [see below], and a variety of partial movements. For example, if the strength of the gripper is beyond that of the user, the user might apply maximum force, moving the handles as far as possible, even if the handles cannot be made to touch. Another partial movement involves using two hands to squeeze the handles within approximately 19 mm (3/4 inch) of each other, releasing one hand and then using the other hand to make the handles of the gripper touch each other. Negatives involve starting the gripper handles touching and then resisting as the gripper opens up, in an eccentric contraction. Training Historically, users trained with grippers by doing high repetitions, but it has been argued that while this was necessary in the days before more challenging grippers were available, this is an inefficient way to increase strength, and that lower repetitions are preferred, consistent with other strength-training protocolsTraining manual for Captains of Crush Grippers.

Handgrippers: Closing The Gap. MILO: A Journal For Serious Strength Athletes, Volume 4 - Number 2 (July 1996), pp. 22- 23. IronMind. one of many training innovations he pioneered.Brookfield, John. The Mastery of Hand Strength. Second Edition. IronMind. Armwrestlers were among the first to establish specific training protocols using grippers, as part of a larger strength training program for their sport.Doherty, Mark J. Arm- Wrestling For Everyone. Quinlan Press: Boston, 1986. Ratings and accuracy To explain the amount of variability to expect, grippers have been likened to uncalibrated barbell plates,IronMind Catalog. 1999‚Äì2000. Vol. 9, p. 38 which at its most basic level means that they will have greater variations than calibrated barbell plates (i.e., barbell plates that must conform to narrowly defined, pre-established standards), but there is evidence that substantial levels of accuracy are achievable for grippers. Grippers are commonly rated in such units as pounds per square inch to inch-pounds to inches, but arguments have been presented that in many cases these numbers have little real meaning and in all cases they are not as transparent as the label (in pounds or kilos) on a barbell plate, so they should be viewed with caution. Similarly, ‚Äúcalibration‚Äù is sometimes misused, as when a gripper is rated, whether subjectivelySiversson, Mikael. Gripper in Competition. Iron Grip, Vol. 3, No. 2. Edited by David Horne & Elizabeth Talbott, pp. 24-25. or objectively, instead of made to conform to an external standard. Misconceptions Along with misstatements about calibration, two other misconceptions about grippers were introduced in 2003. One of the notions was that the characteristics of the springs in grippers would change over the course of a certain number of repetitions before they stabilized, in a process that was labeled ‚Äúseasoning.‚Äù An alternative view is that a spring will bend when the force required to close the gripper exceeds the spring's mechanical limits, but that such bending does not occur in grippers that are properly designed and built. Such bending would make the gripper easier to close on successive attempts, while the grippers with springs that did not bend would remain constant. The arm of a torsion spring with the sharper bend was termed the ‚Äúdogleg‚Äù, and while noting that it would make no difference in the force required to close the gripper, it was stated that it took ‚Äúless effort‚Äù to initially deflect the gripper if one pushed on the dogleg. Others have argued that grippers are symmetric with regard to forces applied to the handles and that the dogleg is another myth, and this has been demonstrated with an analysis of the underlying physics. but the concepts remain in use.Piche, Bill. KTA [formerly: Kinney Training Adapted]. c. 2003 Subjective reports and objective facts about grippers don't always match. Non-traditional grippers Traditional grippers are used by the whole hand at once, although the thumb is stationary and the other four fingers apply the force required to close the gripper, but specialty grippers exist that allow the fingers to be trained one or two at a time. Traditional grippers have handles of fixed lengths, but at different times, grippers have been introduced that have variable-length handles, allowing the user to change the amount of leverage and the range of motion involved when closing the gripper.Lewis. Jim. JB Gripper Basic Training Manual, 2007. Collectors Grippers have a longstanding tradition in physical culture and different models are sought out by specialist collectors, with England‚Äôs David Horne possibly having the world‚Äôs foremost collection.Horne, David & Talbott, Elizabeth.

Its population is approximately 15,553, consisting largely of families engaged in fishing or the tourism industry and foreigners from the United States, Canada and Europe. While the local economy was, for many years, based on fishing and shipping, it has shifted towards tourism in the last 20 years. In October 2002, to mark the city's 150th anniversary, it was formally designated the \\"Port of San Juan del Sur\\" and a \\"Tourism City of Nicaragua.\\" San Juan del Sur, set beside a crescent-shaped bay, was a popular resting place for gold prospectors headed to California in the 1850s. Correspondingly, San Juan del Sur served as a hub for Cornelius Vanderbilt Lines. A statue of the Christ of the Mercy sits above town on the northern end of the bay. The Mirador del Cristo de la Misericordia sits on one of the highest points on the bay and is one of the tallest Jesus statues in the world. The town is near the site where Survivor: Nicaragua and Survivor: Redemption Island were filmed. Those seasons aired in 2010 and 2011, respectively. The 29th U.S. Survivor season, Survivor: San Juan del Sur (2014), was also filmed there, as was Season 30, Survivor: Worlds Apart, which aired in 2015.

Moore is best known to Louisiana history, of which he was a keen student, for a physical confrontation that he had on the streets of downtown Shreveport with the legendary Huey Pierce Long, Jr.T. Harry Williams, Huey Long (1969) Of humble origin, Randle Moore was born to John Milton Moore and Jennie Elizabeth Mooring (n√©e Jones), both Tennessee natives. His father was a farmer; so Moore spent much of his young life helping in the cotton fields. He eventually worked for others in the area at times for as little as fifty cents a day. In his thirteenth year, Randle raised an eight-bale cotton crop on his own, and used the proceeds to take a course at Draughon's Business College in Texarkana, Arkansas. The skills he acquired there, along with his natural acumen and experience, would serve him for the rest of his life. At sixteen, Moore found work in Texarkana, Texas, as a clerk in a general store, where he stayed for three years. Following his clerical work, Moore and his colleague Oliver K. High founded the Moore-High Shoe Company in Texarkana, in which he maintained a controlling interest for many years.Henry E.

In 1900, Moore married the former Martha Susan Frost, the daughter and sister, respectively, of eminent Arkansas lumbermen Enoch Wesley Frost and Edwin Ambrose Frost. Randle and Susie had four children: Wesley Frost Moore, Virginia Elizabeth Moore Lewis, Edwin Ambrose Moore, and Randle Thomas Moore, Jr. In 1901, Moore organized the Sabine Lumber Company in Zwolle, a community in Sabine Parish. The town only had about 275 inhabitants, and had been incorporated but two years earlier. As a result of his prominence in running the Frost Sawmill there, he also served as mayor. His interest in lumber was the direct result his marriage to Susan Martha Frost, whose father had founded the Frost-Trigg Lumber Company and, later, the Frost-Johnson Lumber Company. Moore subsequently became the president of the board of the company after the convalescence and death of his father-in-law. By 1905, Moore had left his father-in-law's company and taken over management of the DeSoto Land & Lumber Company, relocating his family to Mansfield, and taking a seat on the DeSoto Parish Police Jury‚ÄúAt Zwolle.‚Äù The Shreveport Times, 19 Apr. 1902, p. 2. He had other business interests too, including the then-fledgling Kansas City Southern Railway, which acquired the Louisiana and Arkansas Railroad. In addition, he founded, owned, and operated the Commercial Building Company until 1956. He was also the vice president of both the City Savings Bank and Trust and the newly founded Commercial National Bank in Shreveport. He never forgot his roots in the lumber trade, however, and served as vice president of the Peavy-Byrnes Lumber Company, vice president of the Peavy-Moore Lumber Company, vice president of the Peavy- Wilson Lumber Company, vice president of the Bank of Commerce and Trust Company at Mansfield, vice President of the K.

His mother was actress Elizabeth Christie, and his uncle was writer Robert P. T. Coffin. He began acting while he was in high school and thereafter joined traveling stock companies. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in speech from the University of Washington at Seattle, Washington. He worked as a news analyst and sportscaster until spotted by a Hollywood talent scout. His stolid looks were said to have served him well in his later roles.  Career  In 1940, Coffin appeared as Phillips in Chasing Trouble, a comedy espionage film. He is perhaps best known for his role as Jeff King in Republic Pictures' King of the Rocket Men (1949), the first of three serials starring the \\"Rocketman\\" character. During the 1940s and into the early 1950s Coffin appeared in other movie serials, including Dick Tracy's G-Men (1939), Jesse James Rides Again (1947), Bruce Gentry (1949), Pirates of the High Seas (1950), Mysterious Dr. Satan (1940), Sky Raiders (1941), Holt of the Secret Service (1941), Perils of Nyoka (1942), Federal Agents vs. the Underworld (1949), and Radar Patrol vs. Spy King (1950). In 1955, he joined Peter Graves, William Schallert, and Tyler McVey in the episode \\"The Man Who Tore Down the Wall\\" of NBC's Hallmark Hall of Fame. He had guest starred in the series Adventures of Superman, sometimes playing a \\"good guy\\", sometimes a \\"bad guy\\". In 1954 he appeared as Principal Garwood in Stamp Day for Superman which was produced by Superman, Inc. for The United States Department of the Treasury to promote the purchase of U.S. Savings Bonds. He also had a role in the very first TV episode of The Lone Ranger, as Captain Dan Reid of the Texas Rangers, the older brother of the man who would become The Lone Ranger after his brother and four other comrades were murdered by outlaws. From 1951 to 1955, he appeared eight times as Colonel Culver in the Bill Williams syndicated television series, The Adventures of Kit Carson. He appeared nine times as banker Tom Barton in the syndicated half-hour color western series, The Cisco Kid, starring Duncan Renaldo and Leo Carrillo. In 1956, Coffin appeared in different roles in six episodes of the syndicated series, Judge Roy Bean, with Edgar Buchanan, Jack Buetel, and Jackie Loughery. He also appeared as a guest star in the ABC western series, The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp, starring Hugh O'Brian in the title role. Coffin appeared in the role of Col. Willis Murdock on the ABC/Warner Brothers western series, Colt .45 in the 1960 episode, \\"The Cause\\". On February 9, 1960, Coffin appeared as Grey Gordon in \\"The 10 percent Blues\\" of the ABC/WB crime drama, Bourbon Street Beat, with Andrew Duggan, Richard Long, and Van Williams. He guest starred as well on the ABC/WB western series, The Alaskans. Coffin starred as Captain Thomas H. Rynning in his own syndicated series 26 Men (1957), based on official files of the Arizona Rangers in the final days of taming the \\"Old West\\" before Arizona statehood in 1912. Kelo Henderson appeared with Coffin in the role of Deputy Clint Travis. In 1966, Coffin played Joshua Bean, the older brother of Roy Bean (played by Tom Skerritt) in the episode \\"A Sense of Justice\\", of the syndicated western series Death Valley Days. The segment is set in San Diego, California, where Joshua Bean was the founding mayor. He appeared in other Death Valley Days episodes too, including \\"The Hat That Huldah Wore\\" with Anna-Lisa and \\"Hugh Glass Meets The Bear\\" with John Alderson, both also in 1966. In 1954, Coffin committed a noted blooper on the Climax! live television anthology series, in \\"The Long Goodbye\\", in which Coffin's character was depicted as lying dead. The actor did not realize he was still on frame, resurrected himself, and walked off camera. Despite this mishap, the actor was cast and appeared in another episode of Climax!, \\"Escape From Fear\\", in 1955. He appeared in comedy too, including episodes of Father Knows Best, Hey, Jeannie!, I Love Lucy, Batman, and Walter Brennan's The Real McCoys.  Personal life  Coffin married model Vera Duke, nee Veta Hetman, January 6, 1948 in California. Coffin died of lung cancer in Santa Monica, California, at the age of 80. His ashes were scattered at sea.

It was executed by Bernard Kettlewell, working as a research fellow in the Department of Zoology, University of Oxford. He was investigating the cause of the appearance of dark-coloured moth since Industrial Revolution in England in the 19th century. He conducted his first experiment in 1953 in the polluted woodland of Birmingham, and his second experiment in 1955 in Birmingham as well as in the clean woods of Dorset. The experiment found that birds selectively prey on peppered moths depending on their body colour in relation to their environmental background. Thus, the evolution of a dark-coloured body provided a survival advantage in a polluted locality. The study concluded that \\"industrial melanism in moths is the most striking evolutionary phenomenon ever actually witnessed in any organism, animal or plant.\\" It is now regarded as the classic demonstration of Charles Darwin's natural selection in action and one of the most beautiful experiments in evolutionary biology. Background The Industrial Revolution in Great Britain caused extensive pollution, and industrial cities such as Manchester and Birmingham were covered with black soot. R.S. Edleston was the first to identify the unusual black peppered moth in 1848 in Manchester. By the end of the century, it was recorded that the black moth, the carbonaria type, outnumbered (90% in some regions) the natural white ones, named typica. There were conflicting ideas as to the biological basis of this industrial melanism. Humidity, environment, heredity, disease, temperature and protection (such as camouflage) were the factors put forward. J. W. Tutt was the first to come up with natural selection as an explanation, and stated in 1894 that the phenomenon was due to selective predation by birds. With the rise of evolutionary statistics, the theoretical background was set. For example, J.B.S. Haldane estimated in 1924 the rate of evolution by natural selection in the peppered moth in his first series of A Mathematical Theory of Natural and Artificial Selection. He estimated that for the peppered moth having reproductive cycle in a year, it would take 48 generations to produce the dominant (melanic or black) forms, and the melanic population could dominate the entire moth population after 13 generations. He concluded that \\"the only probable explanation is the not very intense degree of natural selection\\". University of Oxford zoologist E. B. Ford supported the bird-predation hypothesis. To experimentally investigate the issue he recruited Bernard Kettlewell in 1952 under a grant from Nuffield Foundation. =Biology of the peppered moth= Peppered moth insularia on the bark of a lichen-covered birch By the time of Kettlewell, it was known in England that there were three varieties of peppered moth. The normal, typica, is whitish-grey in colour with dark speckles on the wings. The colour was a perfect camouflage on light- coloured trees covered with lichens. The new form, carbonaria, was completely black. There was an intermediate form, called insularia, which was light- coloured with speckled wings, but distinct from typica in that it was not whitish. The moths were active at night, and rested on tree trunks and boughs during the day. The experiment The main experiment, called mark-release- recapture, started in the summer of 1953 and lasted for three years. It consists of two continuous phases. =Preparation= Kettlewell first devised a standard procedure for scoring the moths. It was necessary to determine how far apart the moths should be placed so they were indistinguishable from their backgrounds. Correct separation would result in effective and selective predation by birds, because if the moths were all too close then birds would be able to differentiate even well camouflaged individuals. He tested his scoring method in the woodlands near Birmingham by releasing 651 peppered moths (consisting of typica, carbonaria and insularia), and then at an aviary at the Research Station in Madingley in Cambridge. In the aviary he released 69 moths, which he allowed two great tits (Parus major) to prey upon. He found that the initial procedure failed, as the birds actively looked for any moth, regardless of their colour or background. He succeeded only by using freshly captured moths consisting of 9 black and 8 white types, which he released separately. He found that the birds preferentially caught the moths according to the background colour on which the moths were present. =First phase= For his first experimental site, Kettlewell chose Christopher Cadbury Bird Reserve, near Rubery, Birmingham, because it was heavily polluted, but still inhabited by a number of bird species. He caught all three types of peppered moth and marked them underneath their wings with cellulose paint, so that he would be able to identify them later from non-experimental individuals after recapture. He started capturing the moths on the night of 26 June 1953, and lasted till 5 July. Out of his total capture, he selected 630 (447 carbonaria, 137 typica, and 46 insularia) male moths and released them into the woods. Within two days, 149 moths were recaptured, out of which carbonaria was 27.5%, typica 13%, and insularia 17%. (The total capture after release was 770, but 621 of them were non-experimental moths, i.e. not bearing the paint marks.) Thus their survival values were 5.72%, 1.48%, and 4.32% respectively. This shows that black moths had the best survival advantage in a darkened and polluted environment. =Second phase= To compare the conditions of predation in different environments Kettlewell planned to perform similar experiment in both polluted and clean environments. In 1954 he surveyed several woodlands including Devon and Cornwall, but found them unsuitable because of presence of some carbonaria forms, which indicated unclean environment. Finally he went to Deanend Wood in Dorset, which was well covered with lichens. He found only the white type, including 1 insularia form, indicating clean environment. In mid-June 1955 he started the experiment. He brought along 3,000 carbonaria type. After several days, he found that out the total 190 moths eaten by birds in the wild, 86% were the black type while only 14% were the white type. In his release-and-recapture experiment for 11 days, he used 799 moths, and his recapture rate was 13.7% for the white type, but only 4.7% for the black type. Immediately after completion, he headed back to Birmingham, now accompanied by the renowned ethologist Niko Tinbergen. Tinbergen was responsible for filming the experiment, particularly to verify whether or not birds were the main predators. Out of 227 moths they released, 154 were carbonaria, 64 typica, and 9 insularia. The recapture rate within two days was 82%, 16%, and 2% respectively. It was another success, with Tinbergen capturing live movie clips of birds eating the moths. =Conclusion= The conclusion of Kettlewell's experiment can be summarised as follows: #Birds were the main predators of moth. #Moth were eaten by birds selectively in both polluted and clean forests, indicating camouflage efficiency of the different varieties of moths. #The more conspicuous form of moth was always less in number after recapture; i.e. the white type in Birmingham, and the black type in Dorset. #In clean and lichened area, dark moths remained scarce and were rapidly eliminated because of their conspicuousness even when experimentally introduced. Criticisms Theodore David Sargent, professor of zoology at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, published a critique of Kettlewell's work. Based on his experiments between 1965 and 1969, he concluded that it was not possible to reproduce Kettlewell's results, and said that birds showed no preference on moth on either black or white tree trunks. He suggested that Kettlewell had trained the birds to pick moths on tree trunks to obtain desired results. Michael Majerus's 1998 book Melanism: Evolution in Action is an adaptation of Kettlewell's The Evolution of Melanism, which discussed criticisms of Kettlewell's original experimental methods. When the biologist Jerry Coyne reviewed this book in Nature, he stated that the most serious problem was that only two peppered moths had been found on tree trunks. He also wrote that the white moths had increased in numbers before the lichen had returned and that Kettlewell's findings of moths choosing matching backgrounds had not been replicated in later experiments. Coyne compared his reaction to \\"the dismay attending my discovery, at the age of 6, that it was my father and not Santa who brought the presents on Christmas Eve\\". He concluded that \\"for the time being we must discard Biston as a well-understood example of natural selection in action, although it is clearly a case of evolution. There are many studies more appropriate for use in the classroom\\" and that further studies of the animal's habits were needed. Contrary to this review, Majerus had stressed that the basic findings from that work were correct, and that differential bird predation of polluted environment \\"is the primary influence of the evolution of melanism in the peppered moth\\". Coyne's statement that only two peppered moths had been found on tree trunks was incorrect, as the book gives the resting positions of 47 peppered moths Majerus had found in the wild between 1964 and 1996; twelve were on tree trunks (six exposed, six unexposed), twenty were at the trunk/branch joint, and fifteen resting on branches. Majerus found that the review did not reflect the factual content of the book or his own views, and cited an assessment by the entomologist Donald Frack that there was essentially no resemblance between the book and Coyne's review, which appeared to be a summary of the Sargent et al. paper rather than Majerus's book. The review was subsequently picked up by the journalist Robert Matthews, who wrote an article for The Sunday Telegraph, 14 March 1999, claiming that \\"the rise and fall of the peppered moth, is based on a series of scientific blunders. Experiments using the moth in the Fifties and long believed to prove the truth of natural selection are now thought to be worthless, having been designed to come up with the 'right' answer.\\" Majerus regarded this view as surprising, and not one that would be shared by those involved in the field. He noted numerous scientific inaccuracies, misquotations and misrepresentations in the article, but thought this was common in press reports. He stated that he had spoken to Matthews for over half an hour and had to explain many details as Matthews hadn't read the book, but \\"Even then, he got nearly everything wrong.\\" =Of Moths and Men= The 2002 book Of Moths and Men, by the journalist Judith Hooper, said Kettlewell's experiments had appeared to be \\"the slam-dunk of natural selection\\", but argued that the cause of the dark forms appearing was still an \\"irreducible mystery\\". Although not a creationist herself, Hooper argued that the peppered moth experiments failed to represent evolution. She claimed that Kettlewell's field notes could not be found and suggested that his experiment was fraudulent, on the basis of Sargent's criticisms alleging that the photographs of the moths were taken of dead moths placed on a log. She said that E. B. Ford was a \\"Darwinian zealot\\", and claimed that he exploited the scientifically naive Kettlewell to obtain the desired experimental results. She then alleged that scientists in general showed \\"credulous and biased\\" acceptance of evolution. The book's reception led to claims that the peppered moth evolution story ought to be deleted from textbooks. Scientists have examined the allegations made by Hooper, and found them to be without merit. Majerus described the book as \\"littered with errors, misrepresentations, misinterpretations and falsehoods\\". David W. Rudge, after critical analyses of Kettlewell' works, declared that \\"none of Hooper's arguments is found to withstand careful scrutiny\\", and that all \\"these charges are baseless and stem from a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of science as a process.\\" He concluded \\"that Hooper does not provide one shred of evidence to support this serious allegation.\\" =Religious controversy= Creationists have disputed the occurrence or significance of the melanic carbonaria morph increasing in frequency. When serious criticism and controversy arose, the story was picked up by creationists. Coyne's review was taken up by intelligent design creationists, and at a seminar presenting the wedge strategy on 13 March 1999, creationist and professor of law Phillip E. Johnson said that the moths \\"do not sit on tree trunks\\", \\"moths had to be glued to the trunks\\" for pictures and that the experiments were \\"fraudulent\\" and a \\"scam.\\" This led Frack to exchange with intelligent design proponent Jonathan Wells, who conceded that Majerus listed six moths on exposed tree trunks (out of 47), but argued that this was \\"an insignificant proportion\\". Wells wrote an essay on the subject, a shortened version of which appeared in The Scientist of 24 May 1999, claiming that \\"In 25 years of fieldwork, C.A. Clarke and his colleagues found only one peppered moth on a tree trunk\\", and concluding that \\"The fact that peppered moths do not normally rest on tree trunks invalidates Kettlewell's experiments\\". In 2000 Wells wrote Icons of Evolution, in which he claims, \\"What the textbooks don't explain, however, is that biologists have known since the 1980s that the classical story has some serious flaws. The most serious is that peppered moths in the wild don't even rest on tree trunks. The textbook photographs, it turns out, have been staged.\\"Wells J. (2000). Icons of Evolution: Science or Myth? Why Much of What We Teach About Evolution is Wrong. Regnery Press, Washington, D.C., p. 138 (book available from Iconsofevolution.com) The arguments were dismissed by Majerus, Cook and Bruce Grant who describes Wells as distorting the picture by selectively omitting or scrambling references in a way that is dishonest. Professional photography to illustrate textbooks uses dead insects because of the considerable difficulty in getting good images of both forms of moth in the same shot. The scientific studies actually consisted of observational data rather than using such photographs. The photographs in Majerus's Melanism: Evolution in Action are unstaged pictures of live moths in the wild, and the photographs of moths on tree-trunks, apart from some slight blurring, look little different from the \\"staged\\" photographs. While an experiment did involve the gluing of dead moths to trees, this practice was just one of many different ways used to study different individual elements of the overall hypothesis. This particular experiment was not meant to exactly reproduce natural conditions but instead was used to assess how the numbers of moths available (their density) affected the foraging practices of birds. On 27 November 2000, the school board of Pratt County, Kansas continued efforts to favor intelligent design teaching by requiring the use of alternative resources, such as Of Pandas and People designed by Wells and other ID scholars. (In the book Wells accused Kettlewell's experiment as \\"fraudulent\\" and \\"staged\\".) Coyne and Grant wrote a letter to The Pratt Tribune in which they defended the moth experiments and revealed the misrepresentations by Wells.

Deep Eddy is the oldest swimming pool in Texas and features a bathhouse built during the Depression era by the Works Progress Administration. The pool began as a swimming hole in the Colorado River, became a resort in the 1920s, and is today a popular swimming pool operated by the City of Austin.  History  Deep Eddy Bathing Beach in the 1920s. Deep Eddy began simply as a swimming hole in the Colorado River that flows through Austin. Cold springs rose from the river banks and people swam in the river where a large boulder formed an eddy. In 1915, A.J. Eilers, Sr. bought the land surrounding the swimming hole and built the concrete pool. The pool served as the centerpiece of a resort, the Deep Eddy Bathing Beach, which featured cabins, camping, and concessions. Lorena's Diving Horse was one popular attraction. As seen in historic photographs, a ramp led to a diving platform over the pool's deep end from which the horse and rider would dive. Other pool amenities included a zip line across the pool and a tall slide, while other attractions included a diving baby and a Ferris wheel. In 1935, the City of Austin bought the property for $10,000. Two weeks after the purchase, a massive flood on the Colorado River destroyed the bathhouse and other improvements, and filled the pool with mud and debris. The Works Progress Administration and the city of Austin jointly funded the rebuilding of the bathhouse, which was designed by Austin architects Dan Driscoll and Delmar Groos. The pool opened as a public park in July 1936. Over time, the city has put the property to a variety of uses. While the pool continues in operation, the city separated the western edge of the land as a park and playground named after A.J. Eilers. The city also converted Deep Eddy's bathhouse to alternative uses including a long service as a wildlife science exhibit. In 2004, for safety reasons, the city removed the 70-year-old, cottonwoods that surrounded the pool. Historical marker at Deep Eddy Pool Deep Eddy Pool is listed as a historic landmark on the National Register of Historic Places and has been the inspiration of various works of art. Architectural design elements were replicated by Dan Driscoll in his design of the Barton Springs Pool Bathhouse in 1946, Texas musician Jimmie Dale Gilmore wrote the song \\"Deep Eddy Blues\\" about the pool and the nearby bar, the Deep Eddy Cabaret.  The pool today  Deep Eddy Pool is popular with adult recreational swimmers for its lap swimming pool and with children for its large wading pool. The pool is fed with clear, cold water from two wells, one at 300 ft and a second new one at 400 ft, and is not chlorinated. Water temperature varies between 66 and 75 ¬∞F (20 and 25 ¬∞C). The lap swimming pool is generally open during daylight hours all year, though hours are shortened during winter months. The lap and the wading pool are open from March 14 through October 31, 2015, 8:00am to 8:00pm.http://www.austintexas.gov/department/deep-eddy-pool In summer months, the pool sponsors Splash Party Movie Nights, showing family films on an inflatable movie screen visible by swimmers and waders. The pool supports a number of sporting events, including the Deep Eddy Mile swimming competition.  Bathhouse restoration  Most of the original bathhouse was closed to the public for many years. The Friends of Deep Eddy, a non-profit association of swimmers and other parks advocates, began a fundraising campaign to renovate the bathhouse to its historic condition in 2002. First construction on the project began in 2005 when the Friends group replaced the dilapidated roof. Final construction and reopening of the bathhouse took place in June 2007.  2012 renovations  In Spring 2012 the City of Austin rebuilt the pool due to severe leaking and cracking of the pool slab. Work crews removed and replaced, or capped over with new reinforced concrete, the entire pool bottom. The pool's west end was lengthened and a beach-type (zero-depth) entry was added. The project also included repair of the pool walls, widening of the pool deck, and adding new coping around the pool edge. The pool side pump house building was removed and replaced, and a new storage building was added to the east of the pool.

It is a sequel to 1942: The Pacific Air War. The stock standard version simulates the Battle of Britain, and the Allied Air offensives in Western Europe during World War II in 1943‚Äì1945.  Gameplay  European Air War consists several modes; a Quick Start option, which allows immediate undefined play; a Single Mission option, which allows selection of aircraft and mission type, and a campaign mode called Pilot Career. The Pilot Career mode, allows the user to take the role of a pilot in the RAF, Luftwaffe or USAAF and play in any of three time eras, the Battle of Britain in 1940, the Allied Air offensives in 1943, and the Air offensives before and after D-Day until the end of the war in 1944‚Äì45. During a Pilot Career player actions will directly affect the progress of the war, including delaying or bringing forward the invasion of Europe. Players may also rise up the ranks, starting as a non- commissioned officer to full officer commanding a fighter squadron (or staffel) and assuming responsibility for the men and machines under the player's command. As a squadron commander a player can select the rosters and weapons loadouts for use in missions, selecting between disposable fuel tanks, rockets, or bombs to assist in completing assigned missions. The AI in European Air War is flexible, with several difficulty settings that can be altered by the user to ensure the game remains challenging for a long period of time. AI pilots within the player's squadron can be controlled by the user in Quick Start and Single Mission options, and gradually become available as the player receives promotions within their squadron in a Pilot Career.

However, in 1898 he became a member of the Polish Socialist Party (PPS) and in 1902 he had to flee to Krak√≥w, then in Austro-Hungarian Galicia, in order to avoid arrest by the Okhrana. There he joined the Medical Faculty of the Jagiellonian University and, simultaneously, Faculty of painting at the Academy of Fine Arts. In 1904 he finally left the studies and devoted himself entirely to politics. A close friend of J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, Minkiewicz entered the Central Committee of the PPS. He was also an active member of various paramilitary organizations, including the Organizacja Bojowa of the PPS-Revolutionary Faction, the ZwiƒÖzek Walki Czynnej and the ZwiƒÖzek Strzelecki.

M. Coetzee, winner of the 2003 Nobel Prize in Literature. The novel consists of two separate stories, \\"The Vietnam Project\\" and \\"The Narrative of Jacobus Coetzee.\\" Plot The first story, \\"The Vietnam Project\\", relates the gradual descent into insanity of its protagonist Eugene Dawn. Eugene works for a U.S. government agency responsible for the psychological warfare in the Vietnam War. However, his work on mythography and psychological operations is taking a heavy toll on him; his fall culminates in him stabbing his own son, Martin. The second story, \\"The Narrative of Jacobus Coetzee\\", which takes place in the 18th century, is an account of a hunting expedition into the then \\"unexplored\\" interior of South Africa. After crossing the Orange River, Jacobus meets with a Namaqua tribe to trade, but suddenly falls ill. He is attended to by the tribe and gradually recovers, only to get into a fight for which he is expelled from the village. His last slave dying on the way home, he returns alone and later organizes a punitive expedition against the Namaqua. The narrative concludes with his execution of the slaves that deserted him on the previous journey and the massacre of the tribe. Development history Coetzee began working on the novel whilst he lived in London. He would visit the British Museum and research accounts of early explorers and travellers within South Africa. When he moved to Texas in the late 1960s he continued to research the subject, but still had not begun writing. Coetzee began writing the novel when he moved to Buffalo, New York, in January 1970. The novel stemmed out of a New Year's resolution to \\"stop thinking and planning and actually start writing\\".Coetzee, J.M. 'Voice and Trajectory: An Interview with J.M. Coetzee.' Salmagundi 114/115 (1997):pp. 82‚Äì102, p.97 Reception According to the literary critic Dominic Head, who has published two book-length studies on Coetzee, \\"it has become a truism in criticism of Coetzee that Dusklands introduces a new postmodernist strain in the novel from South Africa.\\"Head, D. (1997), p.28 From the time of its initial publication in 1974, it has generally garnered positive responses from readers and critics, many of whom admire its presentation and critique of the violence inherent in the colonialist and imperialist mentality of the Western world. On the other hand, those who've \\"found fault with Dusklands have tended to concentrate on the obliquity of the book's method: Coetzee is condemned for failing to offer a more direct rejection of the colonial violence he represents.\\"Head, D. (1997), p. 29 When Per W√§stberg delivered the Presentation Speech at the 2003 Nobel Prize award ceremony, he singled out Dusklands in his talk: Popular culture Dusklands is seen in the movie G.I. Jane, being read by Command Master Chief John James Urgayle (portrayed by actor Viggo Mortensen). Further reading References Category:1974 novels Category:Novels by J. M.

They were one of the first bands to fuse rock and experimental music. Like a few other acts of the time (most notably the United States of America), they consciously tried to combine the contemporary sounds of rock with electronic instruments and avant- garde compositional ideas. The 1960s ‚Äì the original group The original group comprised three core members: founder and bassist Louis \\"Cork\\" Marcheschi, guitarist David Blossom, and his wife, vocalist Nancy Blossom, augmented by Kim Kimsey (drums) and Larry Evans (guitar). Cork Marcheschi (born 1945) grew up in Burlingame, California. In his teens, he performed with the Ethix, who played R&B; music in clubs around San Francisco and in Las Vegas, and released one experimental and wildly atonal single, \\"Bad Trip\\", in 1967, with the intention that the record could be played at any speed. Interested in the ideas of experimental composers like Edgard Var√®se, John Cage, Terry Riley, and George Antheil, he constructed his own custom-made electronic instrument from a combination of elements like theremins, fuzzboxes, a cardboard tube, and a speaker from a World War II bomber. David and Nancy Blossom brought both psychedelic and jazz influences to the band. Together, the trio recorded a demo which led to a deal with Limelight Records, a subsidiary of Mercury Records. They released one album, Cauldron, in December 1967. It contained eleven songs, including \\"Fantasy\\", \\"Red the Sign Post\\" and \\"God Bless the Child\\", a Billie Holiday cover. It was an intriguing mix of jazzy psychedelic rock tunes with fierce and advanced electronic sound effects. \\"I don't know if they are immature or premature\\", said critic Ralph J. Gleason. The record sold few copies at the time, although the group had a small but intense following in San Francisco and also toured with other acts including Blue Cheer, Chuck Berry and Fairport Convention, when the band was augmented by Robert Goldbeck (bass). They broke up in late 1969 when most of its members joined the musical Hair, Nancy Blossom becoming the lead in the San Francisco production and later singing in Godspell. Larry Evans returned to his hometown of Muncie, Indiana where he fronted several club groups until his death in 2008. The 1990s ‚Äì reformation Interest in Fifty Foot Hose resurfaced in the 1990s, as they became recognized as precursors to the electronic rock sounds of groups like Pere Ubu, Chrome and Throbbing Gristle, and Cauldron was reissued on CD. By this time, Marcheschi had become a respected sculptor, specializing in public work using neon, plastic, and kinetic characteristics. In 1995, Marcheschi reformed the group for live performances in San Francisco, with a new set of musicians. These performances led to the release of the album Live & Unreleased, which was followed in 1997 by a new studio album, Sing Like Scaffold. On the latter album, Fifty Foot Hose essentially comprised Marcheschi (on echolette, twin audio generators, squeaky stick, white noise generator, theremin, spark gap, and saw blades), Walter Funk III (jokers Ulysses and Cupid constructed by Fred 'Spaceman' Long, Bug (Tom Nunn), vocoder, Hologlyphic Funkaliser and other electronix), Reid Johnston (guitube, guitar, tools, horns, harmonium, hardware, bikewheel), Lenny Bove (bass, electronics, vocals), Elizabeth Perry (vocals), and Dean Cook (drums). Funk and Johnston subsequently formed the avant-garde electronic band Kwisp, the first of whose two albums also featured Marcheschi. In 2006 Marcheschi, Funk, Johnston and Konstantine Baranov (producer of Sing Like Scaffold), known as CWRK Musical Environments, installed a public sound installation in an atrium in Hong Kong.

With a focus on STEM learning, the Museum's mission is to create a place of lifelong learning where people of all ages embrace science as a way of knowing about themselves, their community, and their world. The museum exists in the midst the Northgate Park neighborhood, bisected by Murray Avenue. The main building is located on the north tract, along with the Butterfly House, Hideaway Woods, Farmyard, Sprout Cafe, Explore the Wild nature park, Catch the Wind, Dinosaur Trail, and the narrow gauge Ellerbe Creek C.P. Huntington train ride. The Museum features both indoor and outdoor learning environments. The southern tract is now largely devoted to parking and administrative buildings, including a parking deck completed in early 2018. Prior to the construction of the new main building in the early 1990s, the structures on the southern tract contained the bulk of the museum's exhibit space.  History  Richard (Dick) Wescott, played a major role in the development and growth of the MLS during his tenure as director of the MLS. He began there as a volunteer, soon became the curator, and by 1970 had become Executive Director, although he continued to fill the role of curator as well. Over the years, both he and the Museum flourished. By the early 70's, when the name was changed to the NC Museum of Life and Science, the little green hut on Murray Avenue had grown into a complex with several buildings housing a wide range of collections, artifacts, models, and murals, highlighted through a number of permanent exhibits. With the support of local friends and board members like Carolyn London and the late Dr. Kenneth Hall and the building of new relationships with others, such as the late Louis Purnell, at the National Air & Space Museum and Michael Collins, an Apollo 11 crew member, the museum continued to grow, building one of the finest collections of space memorabilia in the country. This exhibit featured a representation of the Apollo 11 flight and the first human step onto the moon and included one of only four, extant Lunar Landing Modules(LEM), as well as a one-of-a- kind walk through the entire process of launching a rocket, designed specifically for blind visitors. The museum also grew a significant collection of live animals and Dick began to collaborate with Jim Fowler and others, as they planned for the creation of an exhibit in and around the abandoned rock quarry across the street from the original complex. The narrow gauge railroad, which remains operative, was the first step in building a unique exhibit of native species living in a natural habitat. Dinosaur Trail - more than twenty life-size models have resided along the banks of Ellerbee Creek, for some thirty years now - designed and constructed by Dick, with the help of a handful of volunteers and his ever- present \\"right hand, \\" the late Willie Holloway, after a visit to the museum by the late Dr. Louis Leakey. In the late 70's, he and Margie relocated to Augusta, GA. where he was Director of the Augusta-Richmond County Museum for the next fifteen years.  Exhibits  = Main Museum Building = The 2-story main building of the museum houses exhibits about weather, sound, math, health, building and engineering, and native North Carolina wildlife. The building also includes a 6 years and younger play area and a hands-on lab that does frequently rotating topics and activities.https://www.lifeandscience.org/exhibits = The Farmyard = The farmyard is home to a variety of farm animals including a donkey, goats, chickens, bulls, and pigs. The more recent additions to the farmyard are several alpacas. The farmyard offers guests the chance to see how zoos provide enrichment for animals as well as weekly up-close experiences guided by animal keepers. There are several other hands-on activities within the farmyard. = Hideaway Woods = In 2015, the Museum opened Hideaway Woods, a two-acre, nature discovery environment featuring eight tree houses, a flowing stream bed, and fanciful nature sculptures. The space also includes hammocks and an enclosed area for younger explorers. The play zones throughout this exhibit emphasize the importance of nature play. = Aerospace = The Project Mercury space capsule used in the November 29, 1961 Mercury-Atlas 5 mission, on which the chimpanzee Enos became the only chimpanzee and third primate to orbit the Earth, is exhibited at the museum The MLS has historically been most notable for its Aerospace exhibit, which focuses on the early NASA space program. Most of the artifacts on display are on long-term loan from the National Air and Space Museum. Many of these are significant Project Apollo-related artifacts, such as a Moon rock, Neil Armstrong's dosimeter, an Apollo Command Module test vehicle, a portion of an Apollo Lunar Rover, and a full-sized mock-up of a Lunar Module. The MLS came into possession of these artifacts through the influence of James E. Webb, the second NASA administrator and a native of North Carolina. Instrumental in the acquisition of the NASA artifacts was Richard Wescott, the executive director of the museum at the time. Aerospace includes a hands-on aerodynamics space, Launch Lab, that features paper airplane launchers and wind tunnels. = BioQuest = In the mid-1990s, the Museum announced a 4 phase expansion to their outdoor exhibits they called BioQuest. BioQuest included the construction of new exhibit spaces: Magic Wings Butterfly House, Explore the Wild, Catch the Wind, and the Dinosaur Trail and Dig. = Magic Wings Butterfly House = A major attraction at MLS is the three-story glass Magic Wings Butterfly House, which opened April 17, 1999, a butterfly zoo and tropical conservatory featuring a community of several hundred tropical butterflies representing dozens of species, as well as an array of tropical plants. The Bayer CropScience Insectarium, located in the Magic Wings Butterfly House, features exotic insects from around the world. This exhibit was the first of the BioQuest expansion to be completed. = Explore the Wild = Explore the Wild is home to American black bears, red wolves, lemurs, and radiated tortoises. It features a boardwalk over a preserved natural space, plus many multimedia exhibits. The exhibit opened in May 2006. The museum is part of preservation efforts for the red wolves and radiated tortoises. In spring 2017 the red wolf pair housed at the museum had a litter of 4 pups.https://www.wral.com/destination-catching-glimpses-of-the- red-wolf-pups-at-the-museum-of-life-and-science/16765044/ These pups accounted for 2% of the entire red wolf population at the time. As part of the red wolf Specific Survival Plan the museum participates in, the family of wolves was moved to another facility in New York and a new pair of wolves came to the museum. Spring 2018 brought a litter of 2 pups to the new red wolf pair. The four wolves remain at the museum for the time being. In 2018 the museum joined efforts for radiated tortoise conservation after the April 20, 2018 discovery of 10,000 housed illegally in Madagascar.https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/04/wildlife-watch- radiated-tortoises-poached-madagascar/ The museum hosted a fundraiser to raise money for the tortoises at the museum and a conservation group in August 2018. = Catch the Wind = Sailboat pondCatch the Wind opened in the Summer of 2007 and features seven exhibits showing how the wind influences our environment. Seed tower A interactive tower elevates oversized representations of seed pods of trees native to North Carolina and drops them demonstrating how wind affects their travel. The centerpiece of the area is a elliptical sailboat pond where visitors can sail remote controlled sailboats. Kiosks throughout the area allow visitors to listen to audio tracks of narratives, poems, and stories about the wind. Catch the Wind also houses the Into the Mist exhibit that features artificial turf areas that fill with mist at the press of a button. This area is popular during the hot North Carolina summers as children can run through the cool mist. Many guests choose to come dressed in bathing suits or waterproof shoes. = Dinosaur Trail = Long a local favorite, the original Prehistoric Trail featured a number of life-size plaster amphibians, reptiles and dinosaurs set along a woodland path. The Brontosaurus is visible from Murray Avenue. According to a 1965 pamphlet, the trail's original lineup featured a Seymouria, an Eryops, a Dimetrodon, an Araeoscelis, a Saltoposuchus, a Yaleosaurus, a Plateosaurus, and a Camptosaurus. Later additions included a T-Rex and a Triceratops. The trail also provided models of a mammoth and a rhinoceros for scale. The creatures were built by Richard Wescott over a four-year period, culminating with the exhibit's completion in 1967. It was renamed the Dinosaur Trail in 1986. While most of the models still exist, the trail was rendered largely impassable by Hurricane Fran in 1996 and has since fallen into disrepair. Between 2006 and 2009, local residents worked with the museum to remove some of the debris from the trail. The brontosaurus model was vandalized during the early morning hours of June 1, 2009, when vandals removed a large portion of the neck and the entire head. At a later date, the head was found, and the Brontosaurus was repaired and improved through a partnership with the local Northgate Park neighborhood. The final phase in the BioQuest expansion project, a new dinosaur trail opened in July 2009. The new trail is house within the northern tract of the museum, separate from the original trail located near Ellerbe Creek. It features life size models of Albertosaurus, Styracosaurus, Troodon, Maiasaura, Stygimoloch, Alamosaurus, Leptoceratops, and Edmontonia. The dinosaur trail also features a full-sized reclining juvenile Parasaurolophus built for visitors to climb, making it especially popular. An interactive fossil dig area is also available where shovels and screens are available for children to search for, and take home, sharks teeth, coral, other fossils brought up from an abandoned mine in Eastern North Carolina which was once part of the ocean floor. = Earth Moves = Explore a cave made from sandstone, change the flow of a 20-foot waterfall, and discover interactive experiences with sand, stones, and rolling water.

Scottish society in this period was predominantly Gaelic. Early Gaelic law tracts, first written down in the ninth century reveal a society highly concerned with kinship, status, honour and the regulation of blood feuds. The early Scottish lawman, or Breitheamh, became the Latin Judex; the great Breitheamh became the magnus Judex, which arguably developed into the office of Justiciar, an office which survives to this day in that of Lord Justice General. Scottish common law began to take shape at the end of the period, assimilating Gaelic and Celtic law with practices from Anglo-Norman England and the Continent. Native Law Pre-fourteenth century law amongst the native Scots is not always well attested. There does not survive a vast corpus of native law from Scotland particularly, certainly nothing like that which comes from early medieval Ireland. However, the latter gives some basis for reconstructing pre-fourteenth century Scottish law. King Robert Bruce cites common \\"customs\\", as well as language, as features which made the Scots and Irish one people. In the earliest extant Scottish legal manuscript, there is a document called Leges inter Brettos et Scottos. The document is in French, and is almost certainly a French translation of an earlier Gaelic document. The sentence ... ... contains two Gaelic terms, and one term of Welsh origin which the French translator left alone. Cro, represents the Old Irish word cr√≥, which means homicide, or compensation for homicide (galnys, from Old Welsh galanas, means exactly the same thing in Cumbric). Enauch corresponds to Old Irish enech, which meant \\"face\\" (C/F, l√≥g n-enech meant honour price). The text contains many other Gaelic terms. Later medieval legal documents, written both in Latin and Middle English, contain more Gaelic legal terms, examples including slains (Old Irish sl√°n or sl√°inte; exemption), cumherba (Old Irish comarba; ecclesiastic heir), makhelve (Old Irish mac-shleabh; money given to a foster-child), scoloc (Old Irish scol√≥c; a low ranking ecclesiastical tenant), phili (Old Irish fili; high ranking poet), colpindach (Old Irish colpthach; a two-year-old heifer), kuneveth (Old Irish coinnmed; hospitality payment), tocher (Old Irish tochrae; dowry) and culrath (Old Irish c√∫lr√°th; surety, pledge). Additionally, we know a great deal about early Gaelic law, often called Brehon Laws, which helps reconstruct native legal practices. In the twelfth century, and certainly in the thirteenth, strong continental legal influences began to have more effect, such as Canon law and various Anglo- Norman practices. Judex A Judex (pl. judices), is what was known in medieval Gaelic as Brithem or Breitheamh, and later becoming known in English as doomster. The institution is so Gaelic in nature that it is rarely translated by scholars. It probably represents a post-Norman continuity with the ancient Gaelic orders of lawmen called in English today Brehons. However, in rare cases, the term was also used for similar Anglo-Saxon officials in the English-speaking lands of the Scottish king. Bearers of the office almost always have Gaelic names north of the Forth or in the south-west; continental names are rare. Judices were often royal officials who supervised baronial, abbatial and other lower-ranking \\"courts\\". They seem to have been officials who, at least in the thirteenth century, were designated by province, for example, we have one styled Bozli judice Mernis (i.e. \\"Bozli, Brehon of The Mearns\\"). There also existed an official called the judex regis (i.e. \\"King's Brehon\\"), and perhaps this status was a way of ranking various orders of Gaelic lawmen. Justiciar However, the main official of law in the post- Davidian Kingdom of the Scots was the Justiciar. The institution has some Anglo-Norman origins, but in Scotland north of the Forth it represented some form of continuity with an older office. For instance, Mormaer Causant√≠n of Fife is styled judex magnus (i.e. great Brehon), and it seems that the Justiciarship of Scotia was just a further Latinisation/Normanisation of that position. By the middle of the thirteenth century, responsibility of the Justiciar became fully formalized. He supervised the activity and behaviour of royal sheriffs and sergeants, held courts and reported on these things to the king personally. Normally, there were two Justiciarships, organized by linguistic boundaries: the Justiciar of Scotia and the Justiciar of Lothian. Sometimes there was also a Justiciar of Galloway. The Justiciarship of Lothian dates to somewhere in the reign of M√°el Coluim IV. As English expanded westwards in the thirteenth century and after, Lothian came to include not only the core south-east, but also subordinated the sheriffs of Stirling, Lanark, Dumbarton and even Ayr. When Edward I of England conquered Scotland, he divided it into four justiciarships of two justiciars each: Scotia north of the Grampians; Scotia south of the Grampians; Lothian; and Galloway.

Modern Solikamsk is the third- largest town in the krai, with a population of History The earliest surviving recorded mention of Solikamsk, initially as \\"Usolye-na-Kamskom\\" (–£—Å–æ–ª—å–µ –Ω–∞ –ö–∞–º—Å–∫–æ–º) dates from 1430, in connection with the discovery and exploitation by miners and merchants, probably from Vologda, of massive salt deposits on the banks of the Usolka River. The name of the town is derived from the Russian words \\"\\" (sol, meaning \\"salt\\") and \\"\\" (Kama River, flowing through the town). The rapid growth of Solikamsk in the 17th century was predicated on the establishment of the Babinov Road, which was the only overland route leading from European Russia to Siberia. This road started in Solikamsk. The Stroganov family operated the country's largest salt-mining facilities in Solikamsk and the surrounding area. The local saltworks were described in detail by Johann Georg Gmelin. In the mid-17th century Solikamsk also became the first centre of copper casting in Russia. After the establishment of iron works in Yekaterinburg and Perm and the construction of a southern highway to Siberia the importance and prosperity of Solikamsk gradually declined. Until 1923, the town was the administrative center of Solikamsky Uyezd in Perm Governorate. In November 2014 a sinkhole opened near Solikamsk because of a mining problem. =Coat of arms= Coat of arms was granted to Solikamsk on July 17, 1783. The arms show in the upper half the arms of Perm Governorate. The lower half shows a salt well, due to Solikamsk being the largest producer of salt and magnesium in Russia at the time. Cultural heritage Cultural heritage monuments in Solikamsk include a slew of old churches and several civic buildings of importance, including: *The governor's residence (1673‚Äì1688), the oldest surviving house in the Urals. *A two-storey wooden house dating from the early 18th century. *Turchaninov's residence from the 1760s and 1780s.

These wars pitted the Roman Empire against, principally, the Germanic Marcomanni and Quadi and the Sarmatian Iazyges; there were related conflicts with several other barbarian peoples along both sides of the whole length of the Roman Empire's northeastern European border, the river Danube. The struggle against the Germans and Sarmatians occupied the major part of the reign of Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius, and it was during his campaigns against them that he started writing his philosophical work Meditations. Background Secure for many years following his ascension to power, the Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius never left Italy; neither did he embark on substantial conquests, all the while allowing his provincial legates to command his legions entirely. Historian Adrian Goldsworthy posits that Pius's reluctance to take aggressive military action throughout his reign may have contributed to Parthian territorial ambitions. The resulting war between Parthia and Rome lasted from 161 to 166 AD (under the joint rule of Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus) and, although it ended successfully, its unforeseen consequences for the Empire were great. The returning troops brought with them a plague (the so-called Antonine Plague), which would eventually kill an estimated 7 to 8 million people, severely weakening the Empire. Despite the consequences of the plague, historian Kyle Harper contends that the event should not be treated as a fatal blow to the Empire. Instead, Rome's resilience was demonstrated since the Empire remained intact and Roman birth rates in the decade following the plague subsequently skyrocketed. At the same time, in Central Europe during the second-century AD, the first movements of the Great Migrations were occurring, as the Goths began moving south-east from their ancestral lands at the mouth of River Vistula (see Wielbark culture), putting pressure on the Germanic tribes from the north and east. As a result, Germanic tribes and other nomadic peoples launched raids south and west across Rome's northern border, particularly into Gaul and across the Danube. Whether this sudden influx of peoples with which Marcus Aurelius had to contend was the result of climate change or overpopulation remains unknown. Theories exist that the various Germanic tribes along the periphery of the Empire may have conspired to test Roman resolve as part of an attempt to bring to possible fruition, Arminius's dream of a future united Germanic empire. Up until these subsequent wars, the Marcomanni and Quadi generally enjoyed amicable relations and access to the Empire's wares‚Äîarchaeological evidence of Roman household goods and practices illustrate such contact. As with almost all areas within the Empire's reach, the Romans aimed for a combination of military-territorial dominance, while at the same time, engaging in mutually beneficial commerce. First Marcomannic War =First invasions= By the reign of Emperor Marcus Aurelius in 161 AD, the pressures along the Roman frontier had reached a critical point as the Germanic tribes along its borders at the Rhine and Danube came to the conclusion that their survival meant breaking into Rome's territories. Beginning in 162 and continuing until 165, an invasion of Chatti and Chauci in the provinces of Raetia and Germania Superior was repulsed. In late 166 or early 167, a force of 6,000 Langobardi and Lacringi invaded Pannonia. This invasion was defeated by local forces (vexillations of the Legio I Adiutrix commanded by a certain Candidus and the Ala Ulpia contariorum commanded by Vindex) with relative ease, but they marked the beginning of what was to come. In their aftermath, the military governor of Pannonia, Marcus Iallius Bassus, initiated negotiations with 11 tribes. In these negotiations, the Marcomannic king Ballomar, a Roman client, acted as a mediator. In the event, a truce was agreed upon and the tribes withdrew from Roman territory, but no permanent agreement was reached. In the same year, Vandals (Astingi and Lacringi) and the Sarmatian Iazyges invaded Dacia, and succeeded in killing its governor, Calpurnius Proculus. To counter them, Legio V Macedonica, a veteran unit of the Parthian campaign, was moved from Moesia Inferior to Dacia Superior, closer to the enemy. =First Roman expedition in Pannonia (168)= During that time, as plague was ravaging the empire, Marcus Aurelius was unable to do more, and the punitive expedition he was planning to lead in person was postponed until 168. In the spring of that year, Marcus Aurelius, together with Lucius Verus, set forth from Rome, and established their headquarters at Aquileia. The two emperors supervised a reorganization of the defences of Italy and the Illyricum, raised two new legions, Legio II Italica and Legio III Italica, and crossed the Alps into Pannonia. The Marcomanni and the Victuali had crossed the Danube into the province, but, at least according to the Historia Augusta, the approach of the imperial army to Carnuntum was apparently sufficient to persuade them to withdraw and offer assurances of good conduct. The two emperors returned to Aquileia for the winter, but on the way, in January 169, Lucius Verus died.Historia Augusta, Lucius Verus, 9.7‚Äì11 Marcus returned to Rome to oversee his co-emperor's funeral. =Roman expedition against the Iazyges and the Germanic invasion of Italy= In the autumn of 169, Marcus set out from Rome, together with his son-in-law Claudius Pompeianus, who would become his closest aide during the war. The Romans had gathered their forces and intended to subdue the independent tribes (especially the Iazyges), who lived between the Danube and the Roman province of Dacia. The Iazyges defeated and killed Marcus Claudius Fronto, Roman governor of Lower Moesia. However, while the Roman army was entangled in this campaign, making little headway, several tribes used the opportunity to cross the frontier and raid Roman territory. To the east, the Costoboci crossed the Danube, ravaged Thrace and descended into the Balkans, reaching Eleusis, near Athens, where they destroyed the temple of the Eleusinian Mysteries. The Germanic tribes of Central Europe in the mid-1st century. The Marcomanni and the Quadi are in the area of modern Bohemia. The most important and dangerous invasion, however, was that of the Marcomanni in the west. Their leader, Ballomar, had formed a coalition of Germanic tribes. They crossed the Danube and won a decisive victory over a force of 20,000 Roman soldiers near Carnuntum, in what is sometimes known the Battle of Carnuntum. Ballomar then led the larger part of his host southwards towards Italy, while the remainder ravaged Noricum. The Marcomanni razed Opitergium (Oderzo) and besieged Aquileia. This was the first time that hostile forces had entered Italy since 101 BC, when Gaius Marius defeated the Cimbri. The army of praetorian prefect Titus Furius Victorinus tried to relieve the city, but was defeated and possibly killed during the battle (other sources have him die of the plague). There is no consensus amongst scholars as to the year that the great Germanic invasion towards Aquileia took place. Several authors, like Marcus Aurelius' biographer Frank McLynn, accepting the date of defeat near Carnuntum as 170, place the great Germanic invasion itself three years earlier. They maintain it happened in 167 because by the year 170 the Germans would have been checked by the Praetentura Italiae et Alpium‚Äîthe fortifications which were erected in 168‚Äì169 to block a breakthrough of the Alps to Northern Italy ‚Äì whereas all sources confirm it to be a military walkover. A further argument is that the panic which gripped Rome in 167‚Äì168 would make no sense if the Germanic tribes were still on the opposite side of the Danube. Also, no source mentions the emperor being near the front when the disaster occurred, whereas by 170 Marcus Aurelius had settled there. McLynn maintains that Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus went to Aquileia in 168 to restore morale after the disaster as Aquileia makes no geographical, logistical or military sense as a base of operations for launching a campaign on the Danube in Pannonia. The reason McLynn maintains that 170 is proposed by other authors is that too much weight is given to Lucian's testimony regarding the influence of Alexander of Abonoteichos as a scapegoat for the disaster whereas it is uncertain whether Alexander was still alive by 170 and Lucian's chronology is at certain points suspect. Deviating from the above discussion in English literature, researchers in Slovenia, one of the regions affected by the Germanic invasion, accept the year 168 as the proper date, based, among other arguments, on a portrait of Lucius Verus found in Ptuj Curk, I., Arma virumque, DZS, 1999, =Roman counter-offensive and defeat of the Marcomanni= Aurelian column. An unidentified \\"rain god\\" (top right) saves the Roman army. This disaster forced Marcus to re-evaluate his priorities. Forces from the various frontiers were dispatched against Ballomar. They came under the command of Claudius Pompeianus, with the future emperor Pertinax as one of his lieutenants. A new military command, the praetentura Italiae et Alpium was established to safeguard the roads into Italy, and the Danubian fleet was strengthened. Aquileia was relieved, and by the end of 171, the invaders had been evicted from Roman territory. Intense diplomatic activity followed, as the Romans tried to win over various barbarian tribes in preparation for a crossing of the Danube. A peace treaty was signed with the Quadi and the Iazyges, while the tribes of the Hasdingi Vandals and the Lacringi became Roman allies. In 172, the Romans crossed the Danube into Marcomannic territory. Although few details are known, the Romans achieved success, subjugating the Marcomanni and their allies, the Varistae or Naristi and the Cotini. This fact is evident from the adoption of the title \\"Germanicus\\" by Marcus Aurelius, and the minting of coins with the inscription \\"Germania capta\\" (\\"subjugated Germania\\"). During this campaign, the chief of the Naristi was killed by the Roman General Marcus Valerius Maximianus. In 173, the Romans campaigned against the Quadi, who had broken their treaty and assisted their kin, and defeated and subdued them. During this campaign, a famous incident, the so- called \\"miracle of the rain\\", occurred, which was later depicted on the column of Marcus Aurelius and on coins. According to Cassius Dio, the legio XII Fulminata was hemmed in by a superior Quadi force and almost forced to surrender because of the heat and thirst. They were saved, however, by a sudden shower, which refreshed the Romans, while lightning struck the Quadi. Contemporaries and historians attributed it to divine intervention: Dio stated that it was called by an Egyptian magician praying to Mercury, while Christian writers such as Tertullian attributed it to a prayer by Christians. In the same year, Didius Iulianus, the commander of the Rhine frontier, repelled another invasion of the Chatti and the Hermunduri, while the Chauci raided the shoreline of Gallia Belgica. In the next year, the Romans marched against the Quadi, whereupon the Quadi deposed their pro-Roman king, Furtius, and installed his rival, Ariogaesus, in his place. Marcus Aurelius refused to recognize him, and turning back, deposed and exiled him to Alexandria. Thus, by late 174, the subjugation of the Quadi was complete. In typical Roman fashion, they were forced to surrender hostages and provide auxiliary contingents for the Roman army, while garrisons were installed throughout their territory. After this, the Romans focused their attention on the Iazyges living in the plain of the river Tisza (expeditio sarmatica). After a few victories, in 175, a treaty was signed. According to its terms, the Iazyges King Zanticus delivered 100,000 Roman prisoners and, in addition, provided 8,000 auxiliary cavalrymen, most of whom (5,500) were sent to Britain. Upon this, Marcus assumed the victory title \\"Sarmaticus\\". Marcus Aurelius may have intended to campaign against the remaining tribes, and together with his recent conquests establish two new Roman provinces, Marcomannia and Sarmatia, but whatever his plans, they were cut short by the rebellion of Avidius Cassius in the East.Historia Augusta, Marcus Aurelius, 24.5 Marcus Aurelius marched eastwards with his army, accompanied by auxiliary detachments of Marcomanni, Quadi and Naristi under the command of Marcus Valerius Maximianus. After the successful suppression of Cassius' revolt, the emperor returned to Rome for the first time in nearly 8 years. On 23 December 176, together with his son Commodus, he celebrated a joint triumph for his German victories (\\"de Germanis\\" and \\"de Sarmatis\\"). In commemoration of this, the Aurelian Column was erected, in imitation of Trajan's Column. Second Marcomannic War Celemantia- a Roman castellum on the left bank of Danube in Slovakia. The respite was to be brief. In 177, the Quadi rebelled, followed soon by their neighbours, the Marcomanni, and Marcus Aurelius once again headed north, to begin his second Germanic campaign (secunda expeditio germanica). He arrived at Carnuntum in August 178, and set out to quell the rebellion in a repeat of his first campaign, moving first against the Marcomanni, and in 179‚Äì180 against the Quadi. Under the command of Marcus Valerius Maximianus, the Romans fought and prevailed against the Quadi in a decisive battle at Laugaricio (near modern Trenƒç√≠n, Slovakia). The Quadi were chased westwards, deeper into Greater Germania, where the praetorian prefect Publius Tarrutenius Paternus later achieved another decisive victory against them, but on 17 March 180, the emperor died at Vindobona (modern Vienna). His successor Commodus had little interest in pursuing the war. Against the advice of his senior generals, after negotiating a peace treaty with the Marcomanni and the Quadi, he left for Rome in early autumn 180, where he celebrated a triumph on October 22.  Third Marcomannic War  Operations continued against the Iazyges, the Buri and the so-called \\"free Dacians\\" living between the Danube and Roman Dacia. Not much is known about this war, except that the Roman generals included Marcus Valerius Maximianus, Pescennius Niger and Clodius Albinus. At any rate, the victories they achieved were deemed sufficient for Emperor Commodus to claim the victory title \\"Germanicus Maximus\\" in mid-182. An inscription (CIL III 5937) describes a campaign against the Germanic tribe of the Lugii or Burii (Expeditio Burica). Aftermath The wars had exposed the weakness of Rome's northern frontier, and henceforth, half of the Roman legions (16 out of 33) would be stationed along the Danube and the Rhine. Numerous Germans settled in frontier regions like Dacia, Pannonia, Germany and Italy itself. This was not a new occurrence, but this time the numbers of settlers required the creation of two new frontier provinces on the left shore of the Danube, Sarmatia and Marcomannia, including today's Czech Republic and Slovakia. Some Germans who settled in Ravenna revolted and managed to seize possession of the city. For this reason, Marcus Aurelius decided not to bring more barbarians into Italy, but even banished those who had previously been brought there. The Germanic tribes were temporarily checked, but the Marcomannic Wars were only the prelude of the invasions that would eventually disassemble and end the Western Roman Empire in the 4th and 5th centuries.

It broadcasts a Hot Adult Contemporary radio format and calls itself \\"99.5 The River,\\" referring to the Hudson River. The station is owned by iHeartMedia as one of seven radio stations owned by the company in the Albany-Schenectady- Troy radio market. Studios and offices are at Riverhill Center on Troy- Schenectady Road (NY Route 7) in Latham, New York. The transmitter is located off Pinnacle Road in Guilderland, New York.http://radio-locator.com/cgi- bin/patg?id=WRVE-FM Though classified by Arbitron and Mediabase as a Hot AC station, WRVE has a slight lean towards adult contemporary music. Its main competitor is WYJB (B95.5). WRVE broadcasts in HD with its HD2 subchannel airing country music. That format is also heard on 250 watt translator station W260CH 99.9 MHz in Albany.Radio-Locator.com/W260CH History =Experimental Broadcasts= WRVE is among the nation's oldest FM radio stations and the first to broadcast full-time in stereo. For many years it was owned by General Electric with similarly pioneering sister stations WGY and WRGB-TV. (Both WGY and WRGB are also among the nation's oldest AM and TV stations, respectively.) WRVE traces its history to W2XAD in Schenectady and W2XOY in New Scotland, New York, two experimental frequency modulation transmitters on 43.2 MHz, which began test transmissions in 1937. The two were merged into one station with the W2XOY call sign on November 20, 1940, and a month later, the frequency was changed to 45.7 MHz as the FCC closed the 43 MHz band. In the summer of 1942, the station adopted the W85A call sign and moved to 48.5 MHz. Just over a year later (November 1, 1943), the callsign became the long-running WGFM. On June 15, 1946, WGFM complied with the FCC's postwar FM band reallocation and switched on a transmitter at 100.7 MHz in the new band; for two years, it operated on both the old and the new bands simultaneously. In May 1947, the remaining new-band transmitter moved to 99.5 MHz, where it broadcasts to this day. Although W2XOY, W85A and WGFM sometimes duplicated the programming of sister station WGY, considerable effort was made to create programming unique to the FM channel. =Stereo Sound= On June 1, 1961, at 12:01 AM (EDT), WGFM became the first FM station in the United States to broadcast full-time in stereo. With the switch to higher quality stereo sound, the station no longer duplicated the programming of WGY. At first it aired a classical music format and later it changed to beautiful music. =Rock 99= As FM radio listening grew during the 1970s, the 99.5 frequency played host to several formats. In 1973, it began airing TM's syndicated and automated Top 40 \\"Stereo Rock\\" format, calling itself \\"Rock 99.\\" The same TM format and announcer was used at other FM stations in Upstate New York during this period, including WYUT (now WXUR) in Herkimer (Utica-Rome), WKFM (now WBBS) in Fulton/Syracuse, WNOZ (now WIII) in Cortland/Ithaca, WPXY in Rochester and WBEN-FM (now WTSS) in Buffalo. In 1981, WGFM switched to a live adult contemporary format, known as \\"99 - The Light\\". In 1983, the station returned to Top 40 (this time with live personalities) as \\"99 GFM\\" and spent much of the 1980s in pursuit of competitor, 92.3 WFLY. By 1985, \\"99 GFM\\" had become the dominant Top 40 station in the Albany market. But within two years, ratings began to erode. It was during this period that General Electric sold WGFM and WGY. The stations subsequently changed owners several times during the following decade. =Electric 99= In 1987, WGFM brought in noted radio consultant Mike Joseph, who constructed an updated version of his successful Hot Hits Top 40 format. With the region's long association with General Electric, and many potential listeners employed by G.E., he dubbed the station \\"Electric 99.\\" The longtime WGFM call letters were switched to WGY-FM. The station repeatedly played only the top 30 songs of the day along with a few cuts from the top selling albums, hosted by lively disc jockeys who promoted the music, ran contests and talked up local high schools and colleges. With its ratings on the decline, WGY-FM changed its format to Oldies in October 1990. This occurred during a period when two other stations in the market were already airing Oldies music. =99.5 The River= In late 1993, Dame Media purchased WGY and WGY-FM. Dame took control in March 1994, and immediately ended the oldies format. The call letters were changed to the current WRVE and the station began calling itself \\"99.5 The River.\\" At the outset, the station was branded as \\"Rock without the Hard Edge\\" and was musically programmed as an Adult Album Alternative station, though the station's music evolved to become more mainstream. At launch The River was focused on music and offered no contests or promotions, similar to Orlando's, WMMO where DJ's would not talk over songs. When Clear Channel Communications (the forerunner to iHeartMedia) bought Dame Media in 1999, the station's format again moved to a more mainstream direction. In the middle of 2012, the station started adding in more current hits. The slogan became \\"The ‚Äô80s to Now, and Everything in Between\\". At the beginning of May 2013, WRVE removed some of its current hits and began playing more music from the mid 1990s and early 2000s. In order to keep diversity between its co-owned sister stations, WPYX (Classic Rock) and WKKF (Top 40), WRVE re-branded itself again, this time as \\"The ‚Äô90s to Now\\". left right WRVE HD-2 In 2005, WRVE added IBOC digital radio (as did Clear Channel's other Albany stations). On August 17, 2006, WRVE began airing an HD2 channel with an adult album alternative similar to, but more varied than, the original \\"River\\" format. This HD2 channel was later replaced with a Smooth Jazz channel which was formerly located on WTRY-FM. On January 14, 2015, WRVE-HD2 changed its format to country music, branded as \\"Wild Country 99.9\\" which is also heard on FM translator W260CH 99.9 FM in Albany.

The station is audible as far north as Sterling Heights, Michigan, as far east as Sandusky, Ohio, westward almost to the Indiana state line, and almost as far south as Lima, Ohio. The 101.5 frequency has featured some form of soft music format for decades, evolving from easy listening into mainstream AC. The River is locally well known, some might say infamous, for playing non-stop Christmas music between mid-November through Christmas day, one of the first AC stations in the country to do so. This tradition began in 1995 (the year the station's calls changed from WLQR-FM), several years before the practice became commonplace for AC stations around North America. The morning show of WRVF featured Toledo radio legend Jack \\"Mitch\\" Mitchell until March 31, 2006. WRVF's studios and offices are located at Superior and Lafayette in downtown Toledo. The station's transmitter is located at North Wynn Road at Cedar Point Road in Oregon, Ohio. History What is now WRVF began as WSPD-FM, signing on the air on August 11, 1946. The station served as a partial simulcast of WSPD-AM until the late 1960s when the station adopted a MOR format using Drake-Chenault's \\"Hit Parade\\" package. In 1971 the station was sold to Susquehanna Broadcasting and became a beautiful music station, known as \\"Stereo 101 - WLQR\\". It played half-hour music tapes mastered at Susquehanna's studios in York PA with local announcers Steve Kendall, Mike Stanley, Larry Weseman and Bill Stewart. The station retained this format until 1987 when it became \\"Soft Rock 101.5 WLQR\\"; by this time the station was again co-owned with WSPD. A few years later the station began stunting by playing \\"Friends in Low Places\\" by Garth Brooks with a man with a southern voice announcing that something new was coming to WLQR on Monday. The following Monday the station kept its soft AC format and became \\"101.5 The River\\", changing its call letters to WRVF. =HD Programming= Since 2007, WRVF has been broadcasting in IBOC \\"HD Radio\\": *HD1 programming is the digital version of its analog audio, while the *HD2 'channel' broadcasts a simulcast of news/talk sister station WSPD.http://hdradio.com/station_guides/widget.php?id=84 HD Radio Guide for Toledo WRVF is also the (LP) Local Primary (EAS) Emergency Alert Station in Northwestern Ohio.

After graduating from Wr√≥blewski's School in Warsaw in 1910, he moved to Vienna, where he graduated from the School of Agriculture in 1914. During his studies in the capital of Austria-Hungary, he became involved in the Dru≈ºyny Strzeleckie para-military organization and adopted the nom de guerre of Orlik (Polish for lesser spotted eagle), which later formed a part of his surname. At the outbreak of World War I he joined the Polish Legions and became one of its officers. Initially a commanding officer of a battalion of the 3rd Infantry Regiment, he went on to command a battalion in the 2nd Infantry Regiment. Wounded during the battle of Husiatyn of 20 June 1916, he was withdrawn to rear duties. Prior to the Oath Crisis of 1917 he joined the Polnische Wehrmacht, where he became an adjutant to General Felix von Barth and the inspector of training. However, after the crisis he returned to the 2nd Regiment, with which he fought the battle of Rara≈Ñcza and crossed the lines to Imperial Russian held part of Ukraine. There the brigade melted into the Allied Polish 2nd Corps. Orlik-≈Åukoski became the commanding officer of the Polish 14th Rifle Regiment within the Polish 4th Rifle Division under Lucjan ≈ªeligowski. After the battle of Kani√≥w, in which the Corps capitulated, Orlik-≈Åukoski broke through the Austrian lines to Kiev, where he became the commander of the recruitment office. A successful commander in the fights around Kuban against the Reds during the Russian Civil War, he went on to command the 2nd Rifle Regiment and then became the chief of staff of the 4th Division. As part of the J√≥zef Haller's Blue Army, in March 1919 Kazimierz Orlik-≈Åukoski left Odessa for France, where he became the commander of the Polish 48th Infantry Regiment, with which he returned to Poland. Initially in garrison duties in Sosnowiec, Orlik-≈Åukoski's unit was then moved to Pomerania, at that time being taken over from Germany, and then to the fronts of the Polish-Bolshevik War. During the Kiev Offensive ≈Åukoski became the commander of the Polish 21st Infantry Brigade. Shortly before the cease-fire he became the commanding officer of the 22nd Brigade, after which he was attached to the Polish 12th Infantry Division stationed in Tarnopol (modern Ternopil, Ukraine). At that post he served until August 1925. Then he commanded the Bydgoszcz-based Polish 15th Infantry Division (until March 1927) and the Stanis≈Çaw√≥w-based Polish 11th Infantry Division. Between 1929 and 1930 he received military training at the Ecole Superieure de Guerre in Paris and the Higher War School in Warsaw, and then returned to his previous post in the 11th Division.

The foundation of modern Sievierodonetsk is closely connected with the beginning of construction of the Lysychansk Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant within the limits of the city of Lysychansk in 1934. Donets itself was already combined with Lysychansk. The first settlement of workers on the construction site was Liskhimstroi, near by Donets. In September 1935, the first school was opened in the settlement, a silicate brick plant started production, and the first three residential two- story houses were built. In 1940, there were 47 houses, a school, a club, a kindergarten, a nursery, and 10 buildings of a chemical combine in Liskhimstroi. During the Second World War, Liskhimstroi was occupied by German troops on July 11, 1942. It was liberated by the Red Army on February 1, 1943. Work to restore and expand the Lysychansk Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant began on December 10, 1943. By 1946, the pre-war housing stock was completely restored, which amounted to 17,000 square meters. In 1950, four variants of a new name for Liskhimstroi were proposed: Svetlograd, Komsomolsk-on-Donets, Mendeleevsk, and Sievierodonetsk.

Emona Anchorage from Lyaskovets Peak in Tangra Mountains. Topographic map of central-eastern Livingston Island featuring Emona Anchorage. Bulgarian base, with Greenpeace Rock on the right. Topographic map of Livingston Island. Emona Anchorage (, ) is a roughly square embayment, the internal part of South Bay, Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica used as an anchorage for ships visiting the Bulgarian base St. Kliment Ohridski. Emona is the name of a village and, in the version of Emine, a nearby cape on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast. Location The feature is centred at . Details Entered between Hesp√©rides Point and Smolyan Point, the bay is over 100 m deep at its central portion northwest by north of Spanish Point. Northeast of Smolyan Point, a nameless 710 m wide cove is indenting for 250 m behind Rongel Reef, with a shoal east of that cape, and a small awash islet 550 m due northeast of it. Rongel Point forms the east-northeast side of that cove‚Äôs entrance. The remaining northwest coast of Emona Anchorage is, with several minor disruptions, a narrow beach under the ice-cap cliff, with Pimpirev Ice Wall, an ice form in Pimpirev Glacier running parallelly some 100 m inland. That section of the coast is 2.15 km long, featuring a single minor point lying 3.51 km north of Hesp√©rides Point and 1.97 km west-northwest of Aleko Point. An ice sea cave located 870 m east-northeast of that point and 1.45 km northwest of Aleko Point marks the beach end and the north corner of the bay. The northeast coast except for Aleko Point is formed by Perunika Glacier's snout, while Bulgarian Beach accounts for most of the southeast coast, featuring Vergilov Rocks 100 m offshore. The Emona Anchorage beaches and drifting sea ice are favoured by a fairly small number of penguins and seals, usually comprising chinstrap, gentoo and Adelie penguins, and Weddell, crabeater, leopard and incidentally fur seals. Mapping As a part of South Bay appears on earliest charts of the area. Detailed mapping in 1991 by the Servicio Geogr√°fico del Ej√©rcito with bathymetry by the Instituto Hidrogr√†fico de la Marina, Spain.

Its population is approximately . In 1952 Lysychansk became the regional center. The present borders of Lysychansk were finalized by the mid-1960s. In 1962 the city of Sievierodonetsk separated from Lysychansk and became its own independent city. In 1963 towns of Novodruzhesk and Pryvillia were included in the city limits of Lysychansk and became cities. In 1965 Lysychansk incorporated the cities of Verkhnie and Proletarsk. Now, the administration of Lysychansk Municipality includes the cities of Novodruzhesk and Pryvillia. Together with the cities of Sievierodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna and the nearest towns, the Lysychansk area constitutes a major urban and industrial hub of the Donetsk coal basin area, with a population of about 353,000 (2009).

The area is surrounded by large hills, ravines and valleys. The city is situated on the northern spur of the Donets Ridge. This picturesque area was once called \\"Deer Mountain.\\" Lysychansk lies in the continental climate of the steppe zone of Ukraine. Water resources stemming from here are one of the most important resources. Siverskyi Donets River is the main water artery of the Lysychansk and the whole region. The length of the Siverskyi Donets River within the city is 26.5 km. Verkhnia Bilenka River, a tributary of the Siverskyi Donets River, flows through the southern part of the city, the length of the river within the city is 7.7 km.

History The history of the Donetsk coal basin began in 1700 with the decree by Peter the Great to search for ore deposits, leading to the development of Lysychansk - \\"the cradle of Donbas.\\" This type of coal mining lead to spoil tips. Previously existing settlements in the area around Lysychansk were completely destroyed by the Muscovy punitive expedition against the Bulavin Rebellion. After the suppression of the uprising the area was resettled with Voronove (founded by Khokhlov's Cossacks), Syrotyne (Popov's and Sirotin's Cossacks), Borivske (partly settled by former residents of the burned the Borovskaya Sloboda), Metiolkine (Metelnikov's Cossacks) and Smolianynove (Smolkin's Cossacks).

Owned by the Mainstay Station Trust and operated by Cumulus Media, the station is the market affiliate for ESPN Radio and the Detroit Pistons radio and Ohio State Sports Networks. The WTOD studios are located in Toledo, while the station transmitter resides in nearby Whitehouse. In addition to a standard analog transmission, WTOD broadcasts over a single HD Radio channel, and is available online. History The construction permit for this station was first issued in 1990 to Dickey Broadcasting, The first assigned call letters were WUIA and then WMHE, neither were ever used. Dickey Broadcasting (which would slowly evolve into Cumulus Broadcasting) did not put the station on the air. This was due to confusion surrounding whether doing so would compromise FCC regulations. At the time, the FCC Rules prohibited a Broadcaster from having more than one AM and one FM property in the same market. Dickey Broadcasting already owned WWWM-FM (now WQQO) and WWWM 1470(now defunct). The license was sold for $149,920 in August 1993 to Toledo Radio, Inc. 106.5 Signed on in the fall of 1994, taking the call letters WBUZ. The Buzz was a Hybrid format of Harder edged Alternative rock and Album orientated (AOR) rock. The station quickly became Popular and in June 1996, Added The Howard Stern Show. Despite the station's popularity, many on the east side of Toledo complained about poor radio reception. So in August 1998, WJZE's Classic rock format was dropped for a full-time Simulcast of The Buzz. The station now referred to itself as Buzz 106.5 and 97.3. \\"Double the buzz 106.5 west 97.3 east\\" was one of the station's slogans. The station was sold to Cumulus Broadcasting in early 1999. Once Cumulus took control, Over a Weekend in late February 1999, The station Stunted with an odd mixture of different music and sounds. After the Howard Stern show on Monday, February 22, 1999, The station was re-launched as Rock 106 Toledo's Pure Rock. The Howard Stern Show was dropped in early 2000. On August 1, 2000 the WJZE simulcast was dropped in favor of a classic hits format, thus ending the LMA with RASP Broadcasting. The call letters were changed from WBUZ to WRWK. Rock 106 never caught on with Toledo radio listeners, With low ratings along with being beaten by 88.7 CIMX- FM (89x) out of Windsor Ontario. In November 2001, The owners decided it was time for a change. In November 2001, after stunting for a couple days with Swans Splashdown by J.J Perrey & Gershon Kingsley and Lonesome Road by Dean Elliot & His Big Band, The format was changed to Alternative Rock as 106.5 The Zone. The first song on The Zone was \\"I'll Be Here Awhile\\" by 311. In June 2009, The Zone's 7-year run came to an end. The Station's format changed to Sports talk, simulcasting 1470 The Ticket (now defunct). The stations were re- branded as 106.5 The Ticket, only mentioning 1470 at the top of the hour. In August 2012, the simulcast with 1470 ended when that station took on a conservative talk radio format. On January 2, 2013 WLQR-FM became an affiliate of CBS Sports Radio, then switched back to ESPN Radio in early 2016. The callsign was changed to WTOD in September 2016. On March 27, 2018, WTOD-FM was placed into the Cumulus Reorganization Divestiture Trust for a future sale.Cumulus Files Reorganization Plan With FCC; To Divest Four Stations References External links * TOD (FM) Category:Radio stations established in 1994 Category:Cumulus Media radio stations Category:1994 establishments in Ohio ","title":"WTOD (FM)"},{"id":"3891143","text":"Jason Surrell is a former show writer and producer for Walt Disney Imagineering, the division of The Walt Disney Company that designs and builds for Disney's theme parks and resort hotels.

As its name implies, Isola is situated between two arms of the Liri. The many waterfalls of this river and of the Fibreno are used by factories. History Of Volscan origin, after the fall of the Western Roman Empire Isola del Liri was ruled by the Byzantines and then the Lombards. Later it was part of the Duchy of Sora, becoming a ducal seat under the Boncompagni family. In 1796 it was annexed to the Papal States. In the early Middle Ages the town was, alternatively, under the rule of the Byzantines and the Lombards, until it became part of the county of Sora in the Principality of Capua. Isola del Liri was the feud of the dell'Isola (de Insulae) family from the 12th century to the 14th century.\\"Notizie di Famiglie Nobili ed Illustri della Citt√† e Regno di Napoli\\", Giuseppe Reccho Members of the family include Roffredo dell'Isola, Abbot of Monte Cassino, Count d'Arce,Roffredo Dell'Isola in Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani, Treccani and Bartholomew dell'Isola who enjoyed the honors in the seat of Capuano Naples. At the end of the 14th century, Isola del Liri was ceded to the Cantelmo family. It was once in the old Terra di Lavoro region of Campania, but was transferred to the Lazio during the Fascist period. Main sights The town's main sight is the Castello Boncompagni-Viscogliosi, a fortified palace near two waterfalls, Cascata Grande and Cascata del Valcatoio, each about high, and a bridge on river. It is mentioned for the first time in 1100. After the acquisition of the Duchy of Sora by the della Rovere family, it became one of their main residences. It was also housed by their successors as dukes, the Boncompagni; in the 17th century Costanza Sforza turned into a luxurious palace, with biblica frescoes and basreliefs of the duchy's lands, as well as a garden. About north of the town is the church of San Domenico, erected in the 12th century, which is said to mark the site of the villa of Cicero. Culture The official logo of the Liri Blues Festival. Isola del Liri is the seat of the eponymous blues festival since 1988. Liri Blues is an international festival has been free ever since its first year. Liri Blues is an event that happens every year during a week in July. Concerts are held in the main square (Piazza Boncompagni), in the streets and jam sessions happen late at night. In 1997, for the 10th edition of the festival, the town of Isola del Liri signed a twinning with the city of New Orleans (Louisiana, USA).

Farewell Fantastic Venus is a science fiction anthology edited by Brian Aldiss and Harry Harrison. It was first published in 1968 as a direct response to the information returned from the first space probes sent to Venus, especially the first atmospheric probe to return data, Venera 4. The first data was not returned from the surface until Venera 7 successfully landed in 1970. The book contains stories and novel excerpts from the time before Venus' true nature became apparent, when the clouded planet could still be imagined as another Earth, albeit a hotter one. From that point on, few stories would be written which did not recognize Venus as a dry lifeless world with acid clouds and a temperature high enough to melt lead. Writers such as Larry Niven (author of \\"Becalmed in Hell\\") did write about the \\"new\\" Venus, but there were to be few more transplanted jungle adventures, imagined world of oceans with monsters, or Venusians. Venus had been the best hope for extraterrestrial life, and now that hope was lost. Later, however, writers avoided this apparent impasse through using hard science fiction premises for future terraforming of Venus, or resorted to alternate world science fiction, where Venus had either been terraformed by aliens in the distant past to provide an earth-like biosphere, or had undergone different processes of planetary formation to arrive at an inhabitable alternative. Alternatively, science fantasy authors deliberately overlooked recent discoveries in favor of a setting they loved. The authors whose stories were included ranged from C.S. Lewis (excerpt from Perelandra) to Edgar Rice Burroughs (excerpt from Pirates of Venus) and from Olaf Stapledon (excerpt from Last and First Men) to Poul Anderson (The Big Rain, Sister Planet). Essays and meditations from a variety of scientists and SF writers were also included in the collection.

The station is known as 94.5 XKR, Toledo's Classic Rock. It is owned by Cumulus Media. The station's studios are located in Toledo, and its transmitter is located west of Oak Harbor, Ohio. History =WRWR= The station dates back to WRWR, which signed on January 4, 1961, serving the town of Port Clinton. The station's callsign stood for its founder, Robert W. Reider, a local resident who eventually operated WRWR, WLKR in Norwalk, WAWR in Bowling Green, and WKTN in Kenton through his \\"Ohio Radio Incorporated\\" banner. Robert W. Reider operated the station until he died on March 4, 1976, but his company continued operating the station until July 31, 1979, when WRWR, Inc., a subsidiary of Triplett Broadcasting, took over operations. =WOSE/X 94.5= On May 21, 1980, the station's callsign was changed to WOSE (for Ottawa, Sandusky, and Erie counties) with an Adult contemporary format. The station increased its power in 1981, and soon changed format to country music. However, WOSE eventually changed back to Top 40 hits less than two years later, in 1983. In 1990 it became classic rock and was known as WXKR \\"X-94.5\\". The station's transmitting power was boosted and moved closer to Toledo. =94.5 K-Rock= In March 1996, after being off the air for a couple of days, the station became \\"94.5 K-Rock, Rock's New Perspective\\" in a surprise move to try to compete with WBUZ Buzz 106.5 Toledo. The station focused on an adult alternative format with artists such as Tori Amos, Pete Droge, Rusted Root, Eels, Fastball and Red Hot Chili Peppers, with 1980s retro songs sprinkled in, each introduced as a \\"Retro Rewind from the X-K-Archives\\". The station struggled to find a niche in the market, and slowly evolved into somewhat of a mainstream modern rock format, changing its tagline to \\"Toledo's Modern Rock, 94.5 K-Rock\\". With continuing low ratings, lack of promotion, and lack of direction, the station changed ownership the next year. =Return to Classic Rock 94.5 XKR= In 1997, Cumulus Broadcasting purchased the station. The station stunted over the last weekend of January 1998 by playing the first five seconds of many classic rock songs followed by the sound effect of a needle dragging across a record. The classic rock format returned the following Monday (February 2, 1998). The station made an immediate return to the top 10 of the Arbitron ratings in Toledo. It was renamed \\"94.5 XKR\\" and has retained its format ever since, due to an upswing in the station's ratings and a subsequent drop in WJZE's ratings, which forced WJZE to drop their classic rock format later that summer.

He was captured and summarily executed by German troops during the Battle of Crete. Early life John Pendlebury was born in London, the eldest son of Herbert Stringfellow Pendlebury, a London surgeon,. and Lilian Dorothea Devitt, a daughter of Sir Thomas Lane Devitt, 1st Baronet, part owner of Devitt and Moore, a shipping company.. At the age of about two, he lost an eye while in the care of a friend of his parents. Conflicting reports of the accident were given.. He used a glass eye, which, it has been said by people who knew him, was generally mistaken for a real one.. Throughout his life, he remained determined to out-perform persons with two eyes. As a child, he was taken to see Wallis Budge at the British Museum. During the conversation, he apparently resolved to become an Egyptian archaeologist. Budge told him to study Classics before making up his mind. His mother died when he was 17, leaving him a legacy from his grandfather that made him financially independent. His father remarried but had no further children. Pendlebury got along well with his stepmother, Mabel Webb Pendlebury, and her son, Robin. He remained the centre of his father's affections, whom he called \\"daddy\\" in letters. He was educated at Winchester (1918-1923), before winning scholarships at Pembroke College, Cambridge. At the University of Cambridge he was awarded a Second in Part I and a First in Part II of the Classical Tripos, \\"with distinction in archaeology\\".. He also shone as a sportsman, with an athletics blue and competing internationally as a high jumper. He was painted by Sir William Nicholson as \\"A Cambridge Blue, John D. S. Pendlebury\\". The archaeologist During the Easter holidays of 1923, Pendlebury and a master from Winchester had travelled to Greece, Pendlebury for the first time; visiting the excavations at Mycenae, they conversed with Alan Wace, then Director of the British School at Athens. Wace remembered him as a boy who wished \\"to see things for himself\\". The visit solidified his determination to become an archaeologist. =Student at the British School= On leaving university in 1927 Pendlebury won the Cambridge University Studentship to the British School at Athens. Unable to decide between Egyptian and Greek archaeology, he decided to do both and study Egyptian artefacts found in Greece. This study resulted in his Catalogue of Egyptian Objects in the Aegean area, published in 1930. In Athens, Pendlebury stayed at the British School's student hostel, which also provided lodging for visiting scholars doing research in Greece. They dined with the students, conversing with them and each other on scholarly topics. Pendlebury wrote his first impressions to his father, that they were so learned, \\"It makes me feel such an impostor being there at all.\\". He soon found the companionship more to his liking. He hiked the Greek countryside with Sylvia Benton, who had excavated in Ithaca, competing with her to see who could walk the fastest, and became friends with Pierson Dixon, later British ambassador to France. He struck up a friendship also with another archaeology student, Hilda White, 13 years older than he and several inches shorter. Exploring the Acropolis of Athens with her, he climbed over the parapet and announced to the guard \\"I am a Persian.\\" The students explored Greece in groups, living an athletic life, in contrast to the sedentary preferences of the scholars. Pendlebury discovered 10 miles of an ancient road at Mycenae, where he also attended a village dance by a bonfire. Pendlebury also found time to play tennis and hockey, and to form an athletic team for running and jumping. He first visited Crete in 1928 with the other students. After a rough sea crossing at night they hastened on to Knossos, which Pendlebury at first concluded was \\"spoilt\\" by the restorations.. The students then toured eastern Crete by automobile over muddy dirt roads, and in frequent heavy rain and snow. At the eastern end, they attempted to reach Mochlos and Pseira by leaking boat, but failed. They were prepared to swim for it. Pendlebury wrote a poem about the fleas he encountered while lodging in Sitia. Resuming a busy life in Athens, Pendlebury was invited to his first excavation by the Assistant Director of the school, Walter Heurtley, at an ancient Macedonian site in Salonica. Hilda White was invited also and became his constant companion. Unknown to Pendlebury, a close connection had always existed between the British School and Sir Arthur Evans. Evans apparently heard of Pendlebury's activities in Crete and Macedonia. Later in the year, in more propitious weather, Pendlebury was invited to stay at the Villa Ariadne with Evans and Duncan Mackenzie. Hilda White stayed in Heraklion. She reported that Mackenzie confided to Pendlebury in having \\"my own idea,\\" which he did not tell to Evans. By the end of the visit Evans was suggesting that Pendlebury might excavate in southern Crete, or even at Knossos.. For a time Pendlebury became preoccupied with his marriage to White. His family was at first opposed to the match on the basis of the age difference. After Pendlebury wrote that they could not live without each other, the wedding was approved, after an acquaintance of one year. For a honeymoon, the couple undertook a physically arduous exploration of the mountainous northern Peloponnesus.. In the winter of 1928-1929, the Pendleburys visited Egypt for the first time. They assisted briefly in the excavation at Armant, then, late in 1928, at Tel el-Amarna. Excavations at Amarna had been started 40 years earlier by Flinders Petrie, but were then continuing under the directorship of Hans Frankfort for the Egypt Exploration Society. Hans Frankfort and his wife, Yettie, had been students at the British School before Pendlebury's arrival there. They were friends of Humfry Payne, whose wife, Dilys, would become Pendlebury's biographer in the latter part of her life. Humfry was appointed Director of the British School in 1929, still in his 20s.. John's studentship ended at the end of 1928; it was replaced by the Macmillan Studentship for another year's study, but only in Greece. The Pendleburys missed the subsequent winter at Amarna. In 1930 Payne and Dilys travelled to Crete to survey Eleutherna prior to its excavation, inviting the Pendleburys to accompany them. Humfry and Dilys stayed in the Villa Ariadne, where Evans, MacKenzie, and Gilli√©ron, Evans' fresco restorer, were at work, while John and Hilda Pendlebury joined Piet de Jong, Evans' artist, at the nearby Taverna.. Knossos had been donated to the British School in 1924, but Evans retained control for the time being, continuing the restorations, and bringing affairs there to a conclusion. The donation had not only disposed of the estate, ensuring its continuity, but gave Evans virtual control of the British School as well. One matter requiring disposition was the retirement of his Director of Excavation, Duncan MacKenzie, now past 65 and in very poor health due to alcoholism, malaria, and the effects of a career of physically demanding work at Knossos. His retirement was set for the end of 1929, but Pendlebury represented an opportunity Evans could not neglect. Pendlebury was looking for a position to begin when his studentship ran out. Someone at Knossos suggested he apply for permission to excavate in Crete. Later back in Athens his father recommended he return home and apply for a lectureship. He wrote back rejecting the plan, stating that he did not want \\"an academic life\\". Shortly afterward an unsigned, confidential telegram arrived asking if Duncan should retire in the autumn of 1929, would he be interested in the Directorship of Knossos? The telegram could only have come from Evans or Payne. Guessing Evans correctly, Pendlebury cabled back, \\"answer affirmative\\".. There is no evidence that he was party to, or even knew about, the events of that autumn. Evans claimed that he had found MacKenzie sleeping during working hours and that he was drunk. Retirement was to become effective immediately. Piet de Jong opposed this move, claiming Duncan did not drink. The truth of the story made little difference to Duncan. He was so ill that he had to be placed in the care of his family, and could not be moved from Athens. =Director at Knossos and Amarna= John Pendlebury in 1934 In the autumn of 1929 Arthur Evans appointed Pendlebury curator of the archaeological site at Knossos to replace MacKenzie. He was not required to assume the post of Knossos Curator until the spring of 1930. Meanwhile, he and Hilda toured Sicily and hiked over the mountains between Athens and Thebes. John taught Hilda the sport of fencing. He organised a student hockey match with a team from the Royal Navy. An article of his attempting to fit the siege of Troy into history was attacked by H. R. Hall of the British Museum. Pendlebury was outraged at this first professional critique of his work, claiming he had supported his conclusions fully with data. The Pendleburys arrived at the Villa Ariadne in March to assume the new post, but there was no improvement in contention. Almost immediately they received a second shock. A student at the British School had been invited to photograph some Greek vases in a private home and, during the shoot, the police burst in, arresting the owners of the vases for trying to sell antiquities out of the country. Spyridon Marinatos, director of the Museum at Heraklion, wrote a note of protest to Pendlebury who demanded an investigation. Humfry Payne complained to the Ministry of Archaeology. Ultimately the British School was exonerated with an apology. Hall died in October. Of John, Dilys Powell wrote, \\"He would never ignore an offence\\".. By the time Pendlebury assumed the curatorship of Knossos, the site was overgrown, animals browsed freely among the ruins, and some buildings were in disrepair. In addition, the remaining agricultural land had to be leased. Visitation increased, much from dignitaries who required hosting. Sir Arthur Evans arrived with detailed instructions. While Evans refurbished the Taverna, situated on the edge of the Villa Ariadne property, with furniture and rugs, Pendlebury began sorting crates of artefacts from the excavation. He planned to add an archaeological library to the villa, now the headquarters of the British School on Crete. The Pendleburys were to occupy the Taverna, which, like the Villa, was a social centre for the archaeologists when the curator was not in residence. Piet de Jong had left Knossos to be with Humfry Payne during a new excavation at Perachora (near Corinth). Because of the amount of work, which kept the Pendleburys and Evans busy from dawn until dusk, John welcomed the end of the season in July. Arthur and John excavated the Theatre Area. Evans' enthusiasm for his young acolyte was not entirely reciprocated. Pendlebury wrote to his father, \\"Evans is obviously itching to get my time here extended. That I will not have.\\" When Evans left for the season, he wrote, \\"We have got rid of Evans thank the Lord ...\\". The Pendleburys returned home for a visit, not knowing that, in a single season, John had established a reputation for being a man willing and able to take the responsibility of leadership. He began work on his Guide to the Stratigraphical Museum. Meanwhile, Frankfort had resigned suddenly from the directorship at Amarna to excavate in Iraq. In a crisis, the Egypt Exploration Society made a bid for Pendlebury's services, offering him the directorship of the excavation. The latter could hardly say no to this fulfillment of a lifelong ambition. He accepted. At age 26 he now held two of the most important positions in Aegean archaeology. He did not see a conflict. The climatic differences between Greece and Egypt made it possible to excavate in both countries each year: Egypt in the winter, Crete in the spring, with a break in the summer. Pendlebury brought enthusiasm and colour to the excavation at Amarna, during which a handful of Europeans supervised up to 100 native workers. John had learned sufficient Arabic to get by from a textbook in 1928. Hilda learned practical Arabic from the servants. The living arrangements for the director and other Europeans were not entirely modest; however, Pendlebury was democratic in his bearing and manner, a policy on which he and Evans had been united. Just as Evans as a young reporter in the Balkans had purchased formal Turkish garb to wear at social occasions, Pendlebury purchased formal Cretan garb to wear on similar occasions at Amarna. In a photograph, however, he is shown shirtless posing wearing ancient Egyptian faience. He scowls, poking fun, perhaps, at ancient Egyptian statuary. He impressed the then British directors of Egyptian archaeology to such a degree that at the end of the first season he was offered a permanent post at the Cairo Museum. He turned it down, reporting privately that he did not wish \\"a stationary job\\".. In 1932 Pendlebury inherited the tedious work of cataloguing about 2000 sherds that had been excavated from Knossos. Evans went home, not to return until 1935, which relieved Pendlebury greatly. As assistants in the cataloguing task, he used his wife and two graduate students at the British School, Edith Eccles and Mercy Money-Coutts. That year also he built a tennis court at the site and added a nursery to the Taverna for his first child, David, born in England. Hilda rejoined him as soon as she could. In 1934 they had a daughter, Joan. Much of the tension between Evans and Pendlebury came from their disagreement on the nature of the Knossos Guidebook. Pendlebury wanted to write the work himself according to his own outline, express his own views fully, have it published under his name, and get paid for it. Evans wanted merely a summary of Palace of Minos to be produced as part of Pendlebury's curatorship; however, he did want Pendlebury to ghostwrite it. The latter flatly refused. George Macmillan, of Evans' publishing firm, was called in to negotiate. He successfully wined, dined and convinced Pendlebury to undertake a compromise work. The book, published in 1933, was mainly written by Pendlebury, with additions and a foreword by Evans. Pendlebury had at last seen Evans' point of view on the restorations. He wrote in the Preface: \\"Without restoration, the Palace would be a meaningless heap of ruins ... and would eventually disappear completely.\\" The book sold out very quickly, leaving none for distribution at Knossos. On complaining to MP, Harold Macmillan, Pendlebury was told that the MP himself would look into procuring more copies.The previous two paragraphs rely on =Freelance archaeologist= Pendlebury was Director of Excavations at Tell el-Amarna from 1930 to 1936 and continued as Curator at Knossos until 1934. By then it was clear to the scholars and archaeologists who were on the board of the British School that he was spreading himself too thin. Pendlebury had formulated a new plan, to write an archaeological guide to all of Crete. It required extensive explorations of all of Crete, which he began in 1933. His successor at Knossos, R. W. Hutchinson, later wrote such a guide, which the board did not find objectionable, but in 1934 they wrote to Pendlebury stating that they had changed the terms of the Curatorship. From then on the Curator was \\"not expected\\" to conduct \\"independent archaeological work out of reach of Knossos.\\" Complaining that the board had \\"cracked the whip,\\" Pendlebury resigned. He was solicitous about indoctrinating his successor, R. W. Hutchinson, who arrived with his family in 1935. In that year Evans visited Knossos for the last time to attend the unveiling of his statue. The Pendleburys were also present. Hard feelings had vanished.. From 1936 he directed excavations on Mount Dikti in eastern Crete and continued there until war was imminent.Powell, Dilys. the Villa Ariadne. (1973), London: Hodder and Stoughton, .Swansea University (Classics) British School at Athens =Archaeological approach= Pendlebury was one of the early archaeologists who engaged in environmental reconstruction of the Bronze Age; for example, as C. Michael Hogan notes, Pendlebury first deduced that the settlement at Knossos appears to have been overpopulated at its Bronze Age peak based upon deforestation practices.C. Michael Hogan, Cydonia, The Modern Antiquarian, 23 Jan. 2008 War service =The \\"vigorous romantic\\"= Patrick Leigh Fermor said:Leigh Fermor, Patrick. J. Pendlebury and the Battle of Crete. The Spectator p.57-58. (20 October 2001) in Patrick Leigh Fermor (ed Artemis Cooper). Words of Mercury, London: John Murray. (2003) > \\"He [Pendlebury] got to know the island inside out. ... He spent days above > the clouds and walked over 1,000 miles in a single archaeological season. > His companions were shepherds and mountain villagers. He knew all their > dialects ...\\" Manolaki Akoumianos, Evans' Cretan foreman at Knossos, said:This often repeated quote apparently derives from Hilda Pendlebury, John's widow, according to Vronwy Hankey in . > \\"...[he] knew the whole island like his own hand, spoke Greek like a true > Cretan, could make up mantinadas all night long, and could drink any Cretan > under the table.\\" These two quotes together comprise an explanation of why Pendlebury, a man of no military experience, chose to leave archaeology at the peak of his career to assume a difficult and dangerous role in the defence of Greece. Antony Beevor, historian of the Battle of Crete, attributes to Pendlebury the same conventional motive often attributed to British partisans of Hellenic causes starting with the Greek War of Independence in the early 19th century: > \\"Although an archaeologist, and an Old Wykehamist of conventional > background, John Pendlebury was a vigorous romantic.\\" =The path to special operations= In July 1939, Pendlebury reached an intermission of his work in Crete; An Introduction to the Archaeology of Crete was published and work had stopped at the excavation of Karphi. John and his family left Heraklion, where they had been staying, to return to England. John had some work he wanted to finish at Cambridge. A number of sources say that in August 1939, he was placed on the \\"reserve of officers\\".For example, Dixon in his obituary of Pendlebury: This is the officer sign-up list for the Territorial Army (TA), the volunteer reserve of the British Army. Officer recruits would pursue their civilian careers until called up. His work at Cambridge completed, John took his family to the Isle of Wight for a holiday. There, the Pendleburys heard on the radio on 3 September that the United Kingdom was at war with Germany. Pendlebury was commissioned on the General List in January 1940. He was appointed British vice-consul at Candia (the Venetian name for Heraklion) in June 1940, but his job title did not hide the nature of his duties. He immediately set-to working up his outline plans: improving the reconnaissance (routes, hiding places, water sources) and sounding out the local clan chiefs like Antonios Gregorakis and Manolis Badouvas. Turkey had relinquished control over Crete only 43 years before and these kapetanios would be the key to harnessing the Cretan fighting spirit. In October, on Italy's attempted invasion of Greece, Pendlebury became liaison officer between British troops and Cretan military authority. In January 1941, he took part in an unsuccessful raid on Kasos, one of the Italian Islands of the Aegean. =Involvement in the Battle of Crete= By the time Germany had occupied mainland Greece in April 1941 Pendlebury had laid his plans, which could not include the Cretan division of the Greek army which was captured on the mainland. The invasion of Crete began on 20 May 1941, Pendlebury was in the Heraklion area where it started with heavy bombing followed by troops dropped by parachute. The enemy forced an entry into Heraklion but were driven out by regular Greek and British troops and by islanders armed with assorted weapons. Suda Bay War Cemetery On 21 May 1941, when German troops took over Heraklion, Pendlebury slipped away with his Cretan friends heading for Krousonas, the village of Kapetanios Satanas, which was some to the southwest. They had the intention of launching a counterattack, but on the way there Pendlebury left the vehicle to open fire on some German troops, who fired back. Some Stukas came over and Pendlebury was wounded in the chest. Aristea Drossoulakis took him into her nearby cottage and he was laid on a bed. The cottage was overrun and a German doctor treated him chivalrously, dressing his wounds; he was later given an injection.Nicholas Hammond, from chapter \\"John Pendlebury\\" in John Pendlebury in Crete. Cambridge: University Press (1948). The next day Pendlebury had been changed into a clean shirt. The Germans were setting up a gun position nearby and a fresh party of paratroopers came by. They found Pendlebury who had lost his dog tags and was wearing a Greek shirt. As he was out of uniform and could not prove that he was a soldier, he was put against a wall outside the cottage and shot through the head and the body. =Epilogue= Captain Pendlebury was buried nearby but later reburied outside the western gate of Heraklion. He now lies in the Suda Bay War Cemetery maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (Grave reference 10.E.13).

Braun has also played right field during his career, first base, and was a third baseman during his rookie season. Braun was a two-time All-American at the University of Miami, where he was named \\"National Freshman of the Year\\" by Baseball America in 2003. The Brewers drafted him in the first round (fifth overall) in the 2005 MLB draft. He was the team's Minor League Player of the Year in 2006. Braun was considered a five-tool player for his ability to hit for power and average, his baserunning speed, and his excellent fielding and arm strength. He was ranked number seven by the Sporting News in its 2012 list of the 50 greatest current players in baseball. He was named the National League Rookie of the Year in 2007, has won five Silver Slugger awards (2008‚Äì12), and won the NL Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) in 2011. He was named to five straight All-Star games (2008‚Äì12), and then a team-high sixth All-Star Game in 2015. Braun has led the NL three times in slugging percentage (in 2007, while setting the major league rookie record, 2011, and 2012), three times in extra- base hits (2008, 2011‚Äì12), and once each in hits (2009), home runs (2012), and runs (2012). On defense, he led all major league outfielders in fielding percentage in 2008, led NL left fielders in fielding percentage twice (2009 and 2011), and led NL left fielders in range factor in 2009 and 2012. His 128 home runs through 2010 were the 8th-most by any major leaguer ever through their first four seasons. Braun came under scrutiny for a testosterone test that he failed in 2011 and then for his connection in 2012 to the Biogenesis of America clinic that provided performance-enhancing drugs to professional baseball players. On July 22, 2013, Braun was suspended without pay for the remainder of the 2013 season and playoffs (totaling 65 regular-season games) for violating the league's drug policy. In the six full seasons prior to his suspension in 2013, Braun was a five-time All-Star and five times posted a batting average above .300 with more than 30 home runs. In the six seasons subsequent to his suspension, Braun has been named an All-Star once, and has had only one season with 30 home runs and a batting average over .300. In 2015 (his second year back), he was an NL All-Star and finished the season as one of the top 10 in the league in both slugging percentage and stolen bases. He then rebounded further in 2016, batting .305, with his sixth 30-home-run season. Through 2020, he led all active ballplayers in career power-speed #, and was 4th in extra base hits, 5th in triples, home runs, RBIs, and slugging percentage, 7th in hits, doubles, and runs scored, and 10th in stolen bases and OPS. After the 2020 season, Braun was ranked first on the Brewers' all- time list in career home runs and power-speed #, second in doubles, extra base hits, and RBIs, and third in runs scored, hits, triples, walks, stolen bases, slugging percentage, and OPS. Amateur career Ryan Braun was born on November 17, 1983, to Joe and Diane Braun. He and his younger brother Steve were raised in Los Angeles. He grew up a Los Angeles Dodgers fan. Braun's PONY League teammates included Jack and Matt Cassel, Jason and Jarron Collins, as well as Jon Garland. Braun later picked up basketball, which became his favorite sport, and soccer, in which he played forward. By the time he entered high school, Braun chose to focus solely on baseball. Braun attended Granada Hills High School in Granada Hills, Los Angeles, California. He was a four- year letterman on the school's baseball team, and three-year team captain and Most Valuable Player (MVP). He played shortstop and pitched through his junior year. As a sophomore in 2000, he recorded the highest batting average of his prep career (.456), while posting a .654 on-base percentage (OBP). During his junior year, he hit .421, with a .668 OBP. Braun capped off his high school career by batting .451 as a senior, with an OBP of .675, and breaking the school record for career home runs with 25.Mulhern, Tom, \\"Brewers: Braun's start a smashing success\\", Wisconsin State Journal, July 21, 2007.

In the postseason he led the Brewers with a .405 batting average, while driving in a team-best 10 RBIs. Braun was awarded the 2011 NL Outfielder Silver Slugger Award, winning it for the fourth year in a row. That set a Brewers team record, and he became the fourth NL outfielder to win the award four years in a row. He was named the team's 2011 MVP in unanimous voting by the Milwaukee chapter of the BBWAA. On November 22, Braun was named the NL MVP award winner for the 2011 season, receiving 20 of 32 first place votes. 2012: All Star, Home Run Champion, Silver Slugger, 40‚Äì30 club On April 30, 2012, he became the first player to hit 3 home runs in one game at Petco Park.

It marked Braun's fifth All-Star honor, tying him with Cecil Cooper and Paul Molitor for the most in Brewers franchise history. On July 20, Braun had his 1,000th career hit. He accomplished the feat in his 815th game, sooner in his career than Pete Rose, the all-time hits leader, who did it in his 831st game. On September 16, Braun hit his 200th career home run in his 867th game, against the New York Mets, faster than all but four active players in the Majors (Ryan Howard, Albert Pujols, Adam Dunn, and Alex Rodriguez). In his following at bat, Braun hit another home run, his 40th of the year, the first time he had reached the 40-home-run mark. In 2012, Braun led the National League in home runs (41), runs scored (108), total bases (356), and power-speed number (34.6), and led the league in OPS (.987) and extra-base hits (80) for the second consecutive year.

On July 22, 2013, Braun was suspended without pay for the remainder of the season after admitting to using performance-enhancing drugs during his 2011 NL MVP season, thus violating the Basic Agreement and its Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program. 2014 After the Brewers traded right fielder Norichika Aoki to the Royals for pitcher Will Smith, Braun moved to right field, opening a spot for Khris Davis to play left field. In 2014, Braun batted a career-low .266, with 19 home runs while leading the Brewers with 81 RBIs and tying for the team lead with 6 triples. He finished the season with 230 career home runs, tied with Prince Fielder for second on the all-time Brewers list, trailing only Robin Yount (251), and during the season he tied Brewers records with 3 home runs and 7 RBIs in one game. He also became the 12th player to appear in 1,000 games with the Brewers. Braun underwent surgery in October to desensitize the pain receptors near the nerves at the base of his right thumb. The problem was affecting his grip on the bat. The surgery was performed by Dr. Vernon Williams. Through 2014, he was fifth among all active ballplayers in career slugging percentage, and second among active left fielders in career fielding percentage. 2015: All Star He was named NL Co-Player of the Week for May 17‚Äì24, along with the Pirates' Andrew McCutchen.

It was the sixth time he was selected as an All Star, a team record, surpassing the prior record shared with Cecil Cooper and Paul Molitor. On August 19, Braun hit his 252nd career home run during a game against the Miami Marlins, setting the record as All-Time Home Run leader in Milwaukee Brewers franchise history. The record was previously held by Robin Yount. For the season, Braun batted .285 with a .498 slugging percentage (9th in the league), and 25 home runs, 84 RBIs, and 24 stolen bases (8th in the NL; his 85.71 stolen base percentage was 5th in the league), with a 24.5 power-speed # (3rd in the league) and a .991 fielding percentage (2nd in the league for right fielders). It was his fourth 20/20 season, and only three other players in the majors had one in 2015.

In 2017 Braun said, \\"Frankly, in spring training, there were some more discussions with the Dodgers, which is in all likelihood the only team I would approve a trade to at any point.\\" On July 14, 2007, Braun hit his sixth career grand slam, breaking a tie with Cecil Cooper, John Jaha, and Jeromy Burnitz for the most in Brewers history. He became the only active player to lead his team's all-time list in the category. On September 8 Braun hit his 300th career home run, becoming the first player in franchise history to reach that milestone. With the home run he became the 6th baseball player to have at least 300 home runs and 180 stolen bases in his first 11 big league seasons, joining Willie Mays (368 HRs, 240 SB), Reggie Jackson (313 HRs, 188 SB), Barry Bonds (334 HRs, 380 SB), Sammy Sosa (336 HRs, 224 SB), and Alex Rodriguez (381 HRs, 205 SB). For the season, he batted .268/.336/.487 with 17 home runs and 52 RBIs, after being limited to 104 games and 380 at bats due to calf and wrist injuries.\\"Brewers: Rebuilding effort moving quickly for Milwaukee,\\" LaCrosse Tribune. 2018: 1,000th career RBI After the Brewers acquired outfielders Christian Yelich and Lorenzo Cain, they announced that they intended to have Braun play some first base during the season to ease their logjam in the outfield.

On April 6, 2019, Braun scored his 1,000th career run (third-most in Brewers history, behind Molitor (1,275) and Yount (1,632)). He was the only player of the nine active major league players with 1,000 runs scored to have scored them all for one team.\\"Ryan Braun discusses 1,000 runs scored milestone,\\" MLB.com. On May 4, Braun had the first 6-hit game of his career, tying the Brewers record, in an 18-inning game against the New York Mets, in which he drove in the winning run.

It was his 10th career 20+ home run season. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel named him the Brewers' 2010s Player of the Decade. 2020 Brewers manager Craig Counsell said that in the 2020 season Braun will spend some time at DH, but will also play right field and first base. Braun entered the final guaranteed year of his contract. He and the Brewers have a $15 million mutual option for 2021, with a $4 million buyout. On September 16, Braun hit his 350th career home run, and was fifth in homers among all active players, and tied for 95th among MLB‚Äôs all-time home run hitters (one behind Dick Allen).

They reported that Braun had tested positive for an elevated level of testosterone caused by a performance- enhancing drug and faced a 50-game suspension. The Daily News quoted a source who said that the test results were \\"insanely high, the highest ever for anyone who has ever taken a test, twice the level of the highest test ever taken\\". A second test conducted by an independent laboratory showed normal testosterone levels. Braun appealed the positive drug test in January 2012, and a three-member panel overturned the results on a 2-to-1 vote on February 22, 2012. It was the first time that an MLB player had successfully challenged a drug test result. The arbitration panel, consisting of MLB representative Rob Manfred, players' union lawyer Michael Weiner, and arbitrator Shyam Das, determined that Braun had raised valid questions about the manner in which test collector Dino Laurenzi Jr. had handled his sample. The New York Times wrote that Braun \\"won on a technicality\\". Braun's sample was collected and sealed on a Saturday. Laurenzi said that no FedEx delivery center was open, and he subsequently followed established protocol and stored the samples in a Rubbermaid container; he dropped the samples off to an open FedEx center on Monday. Braun, though, said there were at least five FedEx locations within 5 miles that were open until 9 p.m. and there also was a 24-hour location. MLB argued that there was no evidence of tampering of the sample, and the United States Anti-Doping Agency said the testosterone levels in the samples would not grow in a refrigerator over a weekend. MLB's drug-testing program states that the samples should be sent to the laboratory on the same day they are collected \\"absent unusual circumstance\\". Links to Biogenesis clinic and MLB suspension In February 2013, Yahoo! Sports reported that Braun's name appeared three times in records of Biogenesis of America, a Coral Gables clinic alleged to have distributed performance-enhancing drugs to a number of Major League Baseball players who tested positive for banned substances. One entry noted that Braun owed the clinic between $20,000 and $30,000. Braun's name was not listed next to any specific PEDs, unlike some of the other players mentioned in the records. Braun released a statement maintaining that his attorneys had retained the clinic's operator, Anthony Bosch, as a consultant during his appeal of his positive drug test the previous season, and denied any further dealings with the clinic. Later that month, ESPN's Outside the Lines obtained a new Biogenesis document from April 2012 listing Braun among three other MLB players with the notation: \\"MLB Ryan Braun + 1500.\\" An ESPN source said to be familiar with Bosch's operation claimed the list was of players who obtained PEDs from Bosch and their respective balances, with a circle around the plus sign next to a player's name indicating his balance was paid off. In late April, Bosch confirmed to ESPN that Braun's legal team merely consulted with him during Braun's appeal, and confirmed that he never spoke to Braun himself. On June 4, 2013, ESPN reported that MLB was preparing suspensions for players linked to using PEDs provided by Biogenesis of America and Bosch. ESPN reported that Braun could have been suspended for as many as 100 games if found guilty, although the appeals process could have taken months and would not have yielded a suspension until 2014. On July 22, 2013, MLB suspended Braun for the remaining 65 games of the regular season, plus the entire postseason, for his involvement with the Biogenesis clinic. Braun, who lost $3.25 million as a result, did not appeal the suspension. In a statement, he said, \\"I realize now that I have made some mistakes. I am willing to accept the consequences of those actions.\\" ESPN reported that Braun decided to \\"strike a deal\\" with MLB after being presented with the evidence against him.\\"Ryan Braun suspended rest of year\\".

In particular, it was later exposed that Braun engaged in a campaign for support from players around the league, accusing Laurenzi of being an anti-Semite. Although the standard suspension for a first offense under MLB's drug policy was, at that time, 50 games, Braun was suspended an additional 15 games for his actions during and after his appeal of the 2011 test. According to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, MLB officials were particularly angered by a speech Braun made during 2012 spring training in which he attacked Laurenzi's integrity, suggesting that he tampered with the test because he supported the rival Chicago Cubs or was personally anti- Semitic, and the integrity of the drug program as a whole. MLB considered Braun's speech, as well as his earlier attacks on Laurenzi, to be conduct detrimental to baseball‚Äîan offense punishable under the collective bargaining agreement, not the drug policy. Braun accepted the additional suspension without appeal because of overwhelming evidence in the Biogenesis case.Haudricourt, Tom. Ryan Braun suspension includes violation for basic agreement.

About that time he adopted the nom de guerre of Wir (Polish for whirlwind), which later became a part of his surname. After the Oath Crisis he was drafted into the Austro-Hungarian Army and sent to the Italian front, where he fought with distinction in shock battalion near Cortellazzo. After the war, in November 1918 he joined the Polish Army and steadily advanced through its ranks. Between 1924 and 1930 he commanded the Pi≈Ñsk-based Polish 84th Infantry Regiment.

Greenwood Publishing Group. pp. 301‚Äì302. the World Peace Council approved the Stockholm Appeal, calling for an absolute ban on nuclear weapons. The appeal was initiated by the French physicist, communist and 1935 Nobel laureate in Chemistry Fr√©d√©ric Joliot-Curie. About two weeks after the start of the Korean War, the initiative's first publication called Peacegram claimed that the appeal has already earned 1.5 million signatories. The total gathered petitions were allegedly signed by 273,470,566 persons (including the entire adult population of the Soviet Union). The appeal was also signed by many prominent public figures, artists, and intellectuals. The text of the appeal read: > We demand the outlawing of atomic weapons as instruments of intimidation and > mass murder of peoples. We demand strict international control to enforce > this measure. We believe that any government which first uses atomic weapons > against any other country whatsoever will be committing a crime against > humanity and should be dealt with as a war criminal. We call on all men and > women of good will throughout the world to sign this appeal.  Anti-Communist responses  The United States dismissed the Stockholm Appeal, with the U.S. Secretary of State Dean Acheson branding it as \\"a propaganda trick in the spurious 'peace offensive' of the Soviet Union.\\" Anti- communists in France responded to the Stockholm Appeal (French: L'Appel de Stockholm) by setting up the Paix et Libert√© group to counter the Communist propaganda with their own: one of their first posters was La Pelle de Stockholm (\\"The Spade of Stockholm\\") digging the graves of the countries in Eastern Europe that had been subjugated by the Soviets.

The park, located on a barrier island, was created on January 3, 1975, by an act of Congress. Canaveral National Seashore celebrated its 25th birthday on January 3, 2000; however, the concept for the park actually originated 44 years earlier. This 25 miles of pristine Atlantic Ocean beach, dunes and Mosquito Lagoon is the longest expanse of undeveloped land along the East Coast of Florida and as a federally protected area will remain primarily as it is today. During 1955, a National Park Service (NPS) survey team visited the Turtle Mound area and \\"found the seashore a priceless scenic and scientific resource for which there is no substitute\\". Ten years later, T. C. Wilder, president of the New Smyrna Beach (NSB) Chamber of Commerce, organized a Seashore Park subcommittee, acting on a recommendation by the East Central Florida Regional Planning Council (ECFRPC) to follow up on the NPS report. The committee included several former presidents of the NSB Chamber of Commerce. They were Dr. Cook (committee chairman), John Deal, and Walter Mulbury. Other members were Ed Hughes, mayor of NSB, Bill Owens of the ECFRPC, Volusia County Commissioner Harris Saxon, Chamber of Commerce Director William I. Smith, and Chamber of Commerce Manager Hanford Eckman. Their purpose was \\"to meet with state and NPS officials, as well as area chambers of commerce to promote the creation of a 15-mile-long National Seashore on the Atlantic Ocean south of New Smyrna Beach. The proposed name was Cape Canaveral National Seashore\\". Robert G. Howard, ECFRPC director, in a February 2, 1968, letter to the chamber, stated: \\"The proposal to preserve 9,000 acres of land between Cape Kennedy and New Smyrna Beach is without doubt the Region‚Äôs most important recreational project. The entire country today has only 10 national seashores, including Gulf Island National Seashore in the Florida Panhandle and Cape Lookout in North Carolina. No other recreation site in the Region, the State, or perhaps the Nation can compare with it\\". On April 26, 1968, the Volusia County Board of Commissioners passed Resolution No. 68-51 requesting the Department of the Interior to establish the National Seashore on the east coast of Volusia County, Florida. In 1968, William V. \\"Bill\\" Chappell was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. During his first year in office, Chappell promised the chamber that the seashore project would be one of his top priorities. He kept his word and on April 5 and 6, 1974, Congressman Roy Taylor, chairman of the house subcommittee on National Parks and Recreation, brought a congressional party to review the proposed site. A second group, including chairman of the Senate National Parks and Recreation Committee, Senator Alan Bible, visited on April 19. By this time, the original 9,000 acres had grown to 35,000. Things then began to progress quickly. The House passed the Seashore Act on December 3, as did the Senate on December 17. After 10 years of perseverance, the chamber realized its goal to establish Canaveral National Seashore when President Gerald Ford signed his approval on January 3, 1975. Local artist and environmentalist Doris Leeper was instrumental in the creation of the park. The Canaveral National Seashore is home to more than 1,000 plant species and 310 bird species. CANA occupies (including lagoons). The park's 24-mile-long beach is the longest undeveloped beach on the east coast of the state. The southern part is also known as Playalinda Beach, the middle section as Klondike Beach, and the northern section as Apollo Beach. The John F. Kennedy Space Center is located at the southern end of the barrier island occupied by Canaveral National Seashore, so access to the seashore is often restricted during launch-related activities at the space center. Mosquito Lagoon borders the other side of the cape from the seashore. The Playalinda Beach has 13 parking lots numbered from the south. The space shuttle launch facility is easily visible from the approach to Parking Lot number one.

Biography Sherf was born and spent his childhood years in Calumet, Michigan in the state's Upper Peninsula. He participated in youth ice hockey, which was popular in the cold climate of the area. By the time he graduated from Calumet High School his hockey skills were widely recognized. In the working class area where he was raised, he was destined to go to work in the copper mines in the area, continuing his hockey career in the local semi-professional leagues. A local physician took an interest in Sherf and provided him with a scholarship to attend the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Sherf attended Michigan from 1932 until 1936, majoring in history and playing hockey on the varsity team during all four years. John played hockey at Calumet High School and for the semi-pro Calumet Black Hawks before enrolling at Michigan. He played center at U of M for three seasons. No records are available for 1933‚Äì34. John was the leading scorer in the 1934‚Äì35 season with 23 goals and 14 assists in 16 games. In 1935‚Äì36, he was the leading scorer of the Western Conference with 33 goals and 10 assists in 17 games. That year, Michigan's opponents scored a combined total of only 30 goals. During his senior year Sherf was elected captain of the hockey team and later selected for the prominent senior men's honorary society, Michigauma. The honorary society was based on local American Indian traditions and each inductee was given an Indian name consistent with his college activities in the induction ceremony. Sherf's Michigauma name was \\"Flashing Feet Sherf\\", noting his skill as a hockey player. Sherf graduated from Michigan with a BA in History in June, 1936. He married Mary Gaecke in Chicago, Illinois in about 1938. They had one son, John Paul Sherf. Sherf first worked for Ford Motor Company as a summer employee during his college years, working at the 1933 Century of Progress World's Fair in Chicago. He continued his employment with Ford during the off-seasons of his professional hockey career. Following his retirement from professional hockey he returned to Ford to work full-time. During his early years with Ford, he attended Wayne State University in Detroit where he earned a Master of Business Administration degree. Sherf finished his career with Ford as a senior executive in the Manufacturing Division. Sherf served as national President of the University of Michigan M Club (alumni letterwinners) and the Detroit Red Wings Alumni Association. The University of Michigan selected Sherf as a member of their Athletic Hall of Honor in 1981, only the second Michigan hockey player so honored. Sherf was also elected to the Upper Peninsula (Michigan) Hall of Fame. He also served for more than two decades on the board of directors of Presbyterian Villages of Michigan. Athletic career Before he was awarded his degree at the annual commencement ceremony, he was signed to a contract by the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League (NHL). He played several games at the end of the 1935‚Äì36 season with the Red Wings top farm team, the Detroit Olympics. He was also called up to play with the Red Wings during the Stanley Cup playoffs that season. The 1936‚Äì37 season was Sherf's most memorable as a professional. He played with the American Hockey League's Pittsburgh Hornets, after the Detroit Olympics were moved to Pittsburgh and renamed. At the end of the 1936‚Äì37 season Sherf was called up by the Red Wings for the playoffs to help defend their Stanley Cup championship. He collected one point in five games as the Red Wings won their second straight Stanley Cup by beating the New York Rangers three games to two. He was the first American citizen to be a member of an NHL playoff championship team, having his name engraved on the Stanley Cup as a member of the champion Detroit Red Wings. Johnny Sherf continued his professional hockey career until 1944. He was a member of the Detroit Red Wings for his entire career but was often assigned to the top Red Wings farm team, the Pittsburgh Hornets. Sherf gained recognition both with the Red Wings as well as the Hornets. Because of his skating speed, he was often re-called to the Red Wings to participate in the annual NHL skills competitions. During his career he won the competition as the fastest skater in the NHL. He was also selected as a member of the American Hockey League all-star team representing the Pittsburgh Hornets. Sherf is still the seventh leading scorer in the history of the Pittsburgh Hornets, scoring 94 goals and 121 assists in 301 games played. After being called for military service in 1943, he returned to the Red Wings in 1944 before retiring from professional hockey.

WCRI and the affiliated project National Cancer Research Center (NCRC) were incorporated as nonprofit 501(c)(3) charitable organizations in 1981. Research Research by WCRI is conducted at its two laboratories. The Florida lab, called the Natural Products Laboratory, was established in 1992. WCRI is currently listed among the industry and research partners of the Florida State University College of Engineering. The Michigan lab, called the Experimental Anti-Cancer Drug Synthesis Laboratory, is located on the campus of Wayne State University and was established in 1990. The founder of WCRI was Evan Harris Walker, formerly of NASA. Dr. Walker's discovery of time delay toxin activation (TDTA) chemotherapy was a precipitating event in the formation of the Institute and formed the basis of a collaborative relationship with Battelle, which began in 1988. At least one patent has been granted to the Institute, having been filed in 2002 and awarded in 2004., WCRI has neither published research nor been awarded a patent since 2004. The address listed on the WRCI website for administrate offices is 18 N. Law StreetAberdeen, Maryland 21001. 18 N Law St., Aberdeen MD is a 3 bedroom ranch house, and is the location of Around the World Inc. Internet Cafe. Fundraising Charitable organizations differ in and are often compared on the basis of their methods of fundraising and the percentage of funds going toward primary mission aims versus administrative overhead. They also differ in the manner in which they treat donor lists and contact information. Information available from 2000-2003 indicates that WCRI applies approximately 40% of funds collected to the stated goals of the center, such as research and public education; the remaining 60% of funds raised were spent primarily on expenses incurred in raising funds, such as letters to potential donors. Fundraising for WCRI is conducted in part through the NCRC project via direct-mail campaigns. The WCRI has an extremely low zero star ranking on Charity Navigator. Charity Navigator reports that fund raising account for 89% of expenses, resulting in a very low charity effectiveness rating. Steven L. Blumenthal is listed on the WCRI website as Vice President. Mr. Blumenthal lives in West Palm Beach Fl.

Noted director Sam Peckinpah has a small, rare acting role. The film was shot in locations in Spain and Italy by cinematographer Giuseppe Rotunno. Pino Donaggio composed the musical score. The film had a very sparse theatrical release in the United States, and did not play in some cities until as late as 1984. Plot Gunslinger Clayton Drumm (Testi) is in jail, about to be hanged, when railroad company men offer him a chance to live if he will agree to murder Matthew Sebanek (Oates), a miner who has steadfastly refused to sell his land to the railroad. Although he accepts the assignment, Clayton has become weary of killing and wants to try to build a new life for himself. The would-be killer finds Matthew at his ranch and after some initial suspiciousness, Matthew and Clayton become friends, even though Matthew correctly guesses that Clayton has been sent by the railroad, the same railroad Matthew once worked and, as he admits to Clayton, killed for. Matthew is married to the beautiful Catherine (Agutter), who greatly complicates matters by falling in love with Clayton. She follows Clayton when he goes for a late night swim in the nearby hot springs. She disrobes, and Clayton has sex with her. The next morning, when Matthew discovers his wife‚Äôs infidelity, he becomes infuriated. Catherine stops him from shooting the departing Clayton. When he begins beating her, she stabs him in the back and then hits him on the head with a rolling pin. Believing that she has killed her husband, she catches up with Clayton and persuades him to escort her to Liberty, a town where she can catch the train. For money she intends to sell Matthew's special high-powered rifle which Matthew has said is worth $100. Clayton insists that he is the one who should buy the rifle and offers the $100 to Catherine. Clayton and Catherine stop for the night in a hotel in a small town where Catherine has a bath and where she and Clayton enjoy a night in bed with each other. In amorous chit-chat after they have made love, Clayton tells Catherine she is the second married woman with whom he has had sex. When Catherine inquires about what happened to the husband of the first, Clayton forebodingly says that he shot him after the husband had shot and killed his wife. In the morning at breakfast one of Matthew's brothers, Virgil, coincidentally appears and, after ordering his own breakfast and recognizing Catherine and Clayton from having been at Matthew's a day earlier for a family party, inquires, \\"Where's Matt?\\" Clayton tells him what he believes is the truth, that Catherine has killed Matthew who had attacked her and he is still \\"back at his place.\\" Virgil is intent on taking Catherine back with him and says he will challenge Clayton to draw in order to do so, but Clayton, advising him not to, easily disarms Virgil and Clayton and Catherine leave the hotel. Virgil follows them out of the hotel and, having retrieved his gun, attempts to shoot Clayton, who, warned by Catherine's \\"Look out!,\\" turns, shoots and kills Virgil. Catherine, presumably distraught at the recent turn of events, goes to a church to pray where Clayton retrieves her, and they mournfully embrace. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Matt has apparently recovered. As his wounds are being attended to, a wagon with a lone driver pulls up at the house delivering Virgil's corpse. Matt and his remaining three brothers set about burying Virgil, but, vowing to finish the burying when they return, Matt insists they leave immediately, eager to get after Clayton and Catherine. Virgil's grieving widow Barbara is left behind weeping at her husband's grave. On the trail Clayton and Catherine have stopped to rest. Catherine musingly asks, \\"What choices do I have?\\" to which Clayton replies, \\"Whoring or teaching school.\\" Catherine adds, \\"Or get married again.\\" Expressing his credo that being independent is the best way to live, he says to Catherine, \\"I need you tonight and I hate you for it.\\" So much for his philosophy of life and her (women's) prospects on the frontier. Back on the trail, the two lovers encounter a lost dwarf who's become detached from his circus, a thing Catherine has never heard of much less seen. Clayton hoists him up behind Catherine on her horse and they ride into town, presumably having arrived at Liberty where Catherine was to have taken the train. Clayton is a famous gunfighter, and the sheriff when apprised of Clayton's arrival, immediately leaves town on a supposed errand to Juarez. Clayton goes into the railroad office and returns the money he had been paid to kill Matt, reporting that Matt is dead \\"but I didn't kill him.\\" Enter a grizzled old dime-store-novelist-of-the-west (Peckinpah), who offers Catherine money to tell him her story which he promises to write up and publish, making her rich by feeding the rabid interest in the largely fictional exploits of gunfighters back east. In his pitch he points our how short-lived are gunfighters and suggests she would be wise to feather her nest which he asserts will soon be missing a mate. Clayton and Catherine, however, reject his blandishments and send him on his way. Clayton and Catherine discuss what they want to do next, Clayton suggesting the two together don't have a future, though in his telling her something of his life's story on which his reluctance to become involved in anything resembling a \\"relationship\\" is based, he does account for his (Italian) accent. The circus leaves town while Clayton is attacked on the street by Matt and his three brothers who have caught up with the fleeing lovers. With his youngest brother, Matt goes to Catherine's room, sits on her bed, and rolls a cigarette. The other two stay below shooting it out with Clayton. When Matthew hears an explosion--Clayton has found a box of dynamite sticks in the store into which he has sought refuge--he leaves Catherine in her room with his young brother who almost immediately attempts to rape Catherine. Clayton is shot in the leg but manages to get his horse and Matt's special rifle and ride out of town. Matt interrupts his wife's rape but says to his young brother, \\"Go ahead, boy. That's what whores are for. (Then addressing himself to Catherine) Get your clothes, you're going home\\" Out on the trail, Clayton performs some surgery on his leg wound, extracting the bullet, and then falls asleep. Meanwhile, the railroad men understanding that Clayton has not lived up to his part of the bargain, send two groups of gunmen to kill both Clayton and Matthew. Three of them attack Clayton in a whorehouse in which he has taken refuge. One shoots at Clayton through the window of his room, killing the young prostitute who is offering herself to Clayton, and Clayton shoots him through the same window. Clayton then shoots a second attacker through the door of his room, sending him over the railing to the floor below. The third attacker is dispatched by the whorehouse's madam, who seems to have a strong affection for Clayton as she smiles up at him while her pistol still smokes. Meanwhile, Matthew with his surviving brothers heads home to his ranch with Catherine in tow as a sort of captive--she obviously would rather be with Clayton--unaware that the other bunch sent by the railroad managers to kill him is hiding there in ambush. Simultaneously, Clayton rides as fast as his horse will carry him following the trail of Matthew and Catherine. When Matt and his crew stop for the night, Matt begins to try to woo Catherine back, taking care to offer her a blanket, since the night, he promises, will be cold. The next morning he assures her he will never hurt her again and asks why she was unfaithful in the first place. She replies that she really doesn't know why, and they continue on their way home as Clayton continues on his way after them. As Matthew and his brothers and Catherine approach the ranch, the gang lying in ambush shoots at them. Matthew's three brothers are killed but Matthew manages to gain some shelter in something like a foxhole with Catherine by his side. Soon Clayton makes his presence felt as he shoots and kills at least two of the ambushers from the hill above the ranch. The remaining two ambushers attempt to leave the ranch-house, one even trying to surrender, but Matt guns both down. After all the ambushers are dead, Matthew insists Clayton and he engage in a showdown. Clayton outdraws him, shooting Matt's gun from his hand, but refuses to kill him. Matt opines that \\"You ain't gonna last long, son. There ain't no soft-hearted gunfighters left.\\" As Clayton prepares to leave, Catherine asks him, \\"What're you gonna do?\\" to which Clayton, true to his credo, replies, \\"That's my problem,\\" and he rides off into his future without Catherine. Matthew and Catherine pack their wagon also preparing to leave. As they head up the hill away from the ranch, the camera reveals that Matthew has set fire to his house and barn.

It is a part of electrical circuits that may either enable or disable some function. Disconnect The switch shown to the right is intended to disable an electric fuel pump in automotive applications. This functionality is required in some vehicle racing applications, since an electric fuel pump may otherwise continue operating after a collision or rollover. If the fuel line is broken or the vehicle is inverted, fuel may be spilled, creating a fire hazard. A small loose weight (called a proof mass) is trapped within a spring-loaded cage. A shock in any direction will cause movement of the mass relative to the cage. If sufficiently shocked, the cage will spring open which actuates an associated switch. The switch is reset by pressing the cage closed through the flexible (red) top cover, retrapping the mass. These switches are also used to open a contactor (a large relay) to disable the high power circuit of a battery electric vehicle upon collision. Actuation A normally open switch is used to activate passenger safety equipment early in a collision, typically to pre-tension seat belts and/or to activate air-bags to protect the occupant(s) from collision with the vehicle interior or the steering wheel. Inertia switches are also used in ordnance applications for both safety (shell will not explode until it has been subjected to launch acceleration) and fuzing.

The rationale for the Iraq War (the 2003 invasion of Iraq and subsequent hostilities) has been a controversial issue since the Bush Administration began actively pressing for military intervention in Iraq in late 2001. The primary rationalization for the Iraq War was articulated by a joint resolution of the United States Congress known as the Iraq Resolution. The US stated that the intent was to remove \\"a regime that developed and used weapons of mass destruction, that harbored and supported terrorists, committed outrageous human rights abuses, and defied the just demands of the United Nations and the world.\\" For the invasion of Iraq the rationale was \\"the United States relied on the authority of UN Security Council Resolutions 678 and 687 to use all necessary means to compel Iraq to comply with its international obligations\\". In the lead-up to the invasion, the US and UK emphasized the argument that Saddam Hussein was developing weapons of mass destruction and that he thus presented a threat to his neighbors and to the world community. The US stated \\"on November 8, 2002, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1441. All fifteen members of the Security Council agreed to give Iraq a final opportunity to comply with its obligations and disarm or face the serious consequences of failing to disarm. The resolution strengthened the mandate of the UN Monitoring and Verification Commission (UNMOVIC) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), giving them authority to go anywhere, at any time and talk to anyone in order to verify Iraq's disarmament.\\"UN Security Council Resolution 1441 Retrieved 30 January 2008 Throughout late 2001, 2002, and early 2003, the Bush Administration worked to build a case for invading Iraq, culminating in then Secretary of State Colin Powell's February 2003 address to the Security Council. Shortly after the invasion, the Central Intelligence Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, and other intelligence agencies largely discredited evidence related to Iraqi weapons as well as links to Al-Qaeda, and at this point the Bush and Blair Administrations began to shift to secondary rationales for the war, such as the Saddam Hussein government's human rights record and promoting democracy in Iraq. Opinion polls showed that people of nearly all countries opposed a war without UN mandate and that the view of the United States as a danger to world peace had significantly increased. UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan described the war as illegal, saying in a September 2004 interview that it was \\"not in conformity with the Security Council.\\" Accusations of faulty evidence and alleged shifting rationales became the focal point for critics of the war, who charge that the Bush Administration purposely fabricated evidence to justify an invasion that it had long planned to launch. The US led the effort for \\"the redirection of former Iraqi weapons of mass destruction (weapons of mass destruction) scientists, technicians and engineers to civilian employment and discourage emigration of this community from Iraq.\\"Redirection of Iraqi Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Experts Short-term Program Retrieved 30 January 2008 The United States officially declared its combat role in Iraq over on August 31, 2010, although several thousand troops remained in the country until all American troops were withdrawn from Iraq by December 2011; meanwhile American troops also engaged in combat with Iraqi insurgents. In June 2014, however, US forces were reinstated in Iraq due to the escalation of instability in the region and as of June 2015, the number of American ground troops totaled to 3,550. Between December 2011 and June 2014, Department of Defense officials estimated that there were 200 to 300 personnel based at the US Embassy in Baghdad. Background The 1991 Gulf War never fully ended because no armistice formally ended it. As a result, relations between the United States, the United Nations, and Iraq remained strained, although Saddam Hussein issued formal statements renouncing his invasion of Kuwait and made reparations payments for Kuwait. The US and the United Nations maintained a policy of \\"containment\\" towards Iraq, which involved economic sanctions, Iraqi no-fly zones enforced by the United States, United Kingdom, and France (until ending its no-fly zone operations in 1998) and ongoing inspections of Iraqi weapons programs. In 2002, the UN Security Council unanimously passed Resolution 1441 demanding that Iraq \\"comply with its disarmament obligations\\" and allow weapons inspections. Iraq war critics such as former weapons inspector Scott Ritter claimed that these sanctions and weapons inspections policies, supported by both the Bush and Clinton administrations, were actually intended to foster regime change in Iraq.Scott Ritter and Seymour Hersh: Iraq Confidential Retrieved 30 January 2008 US policy shifted in 1998 when the United States Congress passed and President Bill Clinton signed the \\"Iraq Liberation Act\\" after Iraq terminated its cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors the preceding August.

One month after the passage of the \\"Iraq Liberation Act,\\" the US and UK launched a bombardment campaign of Iraq called Operation Desert Fox. The campaign's express rationale was to hamper the Saddam Hussein government's ability to produce chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, but US national security personnel also reportedly hoped it would help weaken Saddam Hussein's grip on power.Arkin, William. \\"The Difference Was in the Details\\".

The US government's belief that Iraq was developing Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs), was based upon documents which the CIA argued could not be trusted. George Bush, speaking in October 2002, said that \\"The stated policy of the United States is regime change‚Ä¶ However, if [Saddam Hussein] were to meet all the conditions of the United Nations, the conditions that I have described very clearly in terms that everybody can understand, that in itself will signal the regime has changed.\\" Similarly, in September 2002, Tony Blair stated, in an answer to a parliamentary question, that \\"Regime change in Iraq would be a wonderful thing. That is not the purpose of our action; our purpose is to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction‚Ä¶\\" In November of that year, Tony Blair further stated that \\"So far as our objective, it is disarmament, not regime change‚Äîthat is our objective. Now I happen to believe the regime of Saddam is a very brutal and repressive regime, I think it does enormous damage to the Iraqi people ... so I have got no doubt Saddam is very bad for Iraq, but on the other hand I have got no doubt either that the purpose of our challenge from the United Nations is disarmament of weapons of mass destruction, it is not regime change.\\" At a press conference on January 31, 2003, George Bush stated: \\"Saddam Hussein must understand that if he does not disarm, for the sake of peace, we, along with others, will go disarm Saddam Hussein.\\" As late as February 25, 2003, Tony Blair said to the House of Commons: \\"I detest his regime.

The failure to find evidence of Iraqi weapons programs following the invasion led to considerable controversy in the United States and worldwide, including claims by critics of the war that the Bush and Blair Administrations deliberately manipulated and misused intelligence to push for an invasion. =U.N. inspections before the invasion= Between 1991 and 1998, the United Nations Security Council tasked the United Nations Special Commission on Disarmament (UNSCOM) with finding and destroying Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. In 1996, UNSCOM discovered evidence of continued biological weapons research and supervised destruction of the Al Hakam biological weapons production site‚Äîallegedly converted to a chicken feed plant, but retaining its barbed wire fences and antiaircraft defenses. In 1998, Scott Ritter, leader of a UNSCOM inspection team, found gaps in the prisoner records of Abu Ghraib when investigating allegations that prisoners had been used to test Anthrax weapons. Asked to explain the missing documents, the Iraqi government charged that Ritter was working for the CIA and refused to cooperate further with UNSCOM. On August 26, 1998, approximately two months before the US ordered United Nations inspectors withdrawn from Iraq, Scott Ritter resigned from his position rather than participate in what he called the \\"illusion of arms control.\\" In his resignation letter to Ambassador Butler,Resignation Letter Retrieved 30 January 2008 Ritter wrote: \\"The sad truth is that Iraq today is not disarmed. ... UNSCOM has good reason to believe that there are significant numbers of proscribed weapons and related components and the means to manufacture such weapons unaccounted for in Iraq today ‚Ä¶ Iraq has lied to the Special Commission and the world since day one concerning the true scope and nature of its proscribed programs and weapons systems.\\" On September 7, 1998, in testimony to the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committee, Scott Ritter was asked by John McCain (R, AZ) whether UNSCOM had intelligence suggesting that Iraq had assembled the components for three nuclear weapons and all that it lacked was the fissile material. Ritter replied: \\"The Special Commission has intelligence information, which suggests that components necessary for three nuclear weapons exists, lacking the fissile material. Yes, sir.\\" On November 8, 2002, the U.N. Security Council passed Resolution 1441, giving Iraq \\"a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations\\" including unrestricted inspections by the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Saddam Hussein accepted the resolution on November 13 and inspectors returned to Iraq under the direction of UNMOVIC chairman Hans Blix and IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei. Between that time and the time of the invasion, the IAEA \\"found no evidence or plausible indication of the revival of a nuclear weapons programme in Iraq\\"; the IAEA concluded that certain items which could have been used in nuclear enrichment centrifuges, such as aluminum tubes, were in fact intended for other uses. UNMOVIC \\"did not find evidence of the continuation or resumption of programmes of weapons of mass destruction\\" or significant quantities of proscribed items. UNMOVIC did supervise the destruction of a small number of empty chemical rocket warheads, 50 liters of mustard gas that had been declared by Iraq and sealed by UNSCOM in 1998, and laboratory quantities of a mustard gas precursor, along with about 50 Al-Samoud missiles of a design that Iraq claimed did not exceed the permitted 150 km range, but which had travelled up to 183 km in tests. Shortly before the invasion, UNMOVIC stated that it would take \\"months\\" to verify Iraqi compliance with resolution 1441.Hans Blix's briefing to the security council Retrieved 30 January 2008 =Formal search after the invasion= After the invasion, the Iraq Survey Group (ISG), headed by American David Kay, was tasked with searching for weapons of mass destruction. The survey ultimately concluded that Iraqi production of weapons of mass destruction ceased and all major stockpiles were destroyed in 1991 when economic sanctions were imposed, but that the expertise to restart production once sanctions were lifted was preserved. The group also concluded that Iraq continued developing long range missiles proscribed by the U.N. until just before the 2003 invasion. In an interim report on October 3, 2003, Kay reported that the group had \\"not yet found stocks of weapons\\", but had discovered \\"dozens of weapons of mass destruction-related program activities\\" including clandestine laboratories \\"suitable for continuing CBW [chemical and biological warfare] research\\", a prison laboratory complex \\"possibly used in human testing of BW agents\\", a vial of live C. botulinum Okra B bacteria kept in one scientist's home, small parts and twelve-year-old documents \\"that would have been useful in resuming uranium enrichment\\", partially declared UAVs and undeclared fuel for Scud missiles with ranges beyond the 150 km U.N. limits, \\"[p]lans and advanced design work for new long-range missiles with ranges up to at least 1000 km\\", attempts to acquire long range missile technology from North Korea, and document destruction in headquarters buildings in Baghdad. None of the weapons of mass destruction programs involved active production; they instead appeared to be targeted at retaining the expertise needed to resume work once sanctions were dropped. Iraqi personnel involved with much of this work indicated they had orders to conceal it from U.N. weapons inspectors. After Charles Duelfer took over from Kay in January 2004, Kay said at a Senate hearing that \\"we were almost all wrong\\" about Iraq having stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction, but that the other ISG findings made Iraq potentially \\"more dangerous\\" than was thought before the war.Dr. David Kay Testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee (January 28, 2014). In an interview, Kay said that \\"a lot\\" of the former Iraqi government's weapons of mass destruction program had been moved to Syria shortly before the 2003 invasion, albeit not including large stockpiles of weapons. On September 30, 2004, the ISG, under Charles Duelfer, issued a comprehensive report. The report stated that \\"Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capability ‚Ä¶ was essentially destroyed in 1991\\" and that Saddam Hussein subsequently focused on ending the sanctions and \\"preserving the capability to reconstitute his weapons of mass destruction (WMD) when sanctions were lifted\\". No evidence was found for continued active production of weapons of mass destruction subsequent to the imposition of sanctions in 1991, though \\"[b]y 2000‚Äì2001, Saddam had managed to mitigate many of the effects of sanctions\\". The report concluded in its Key Findings that: \\"Saddam [Saddam Hussein] so dominated the Iraqi Regime that its strategic intent was his alone... The former Regime had no formal written strategy or plan for the revival of weapons of mass destruction after sanctions. Neither was there an identifiable group of weapons of mass destruction policy makers or planners separate from Saddam. Instead, his lieutenants understood weapons of mass destruction revival was his goal from their long association with Saddam and his infrequent, but firm, verbal comments and directions to them.\\" The report also noted that \\"Iran was the pre-eminent motivator of [Iraq's weapons of mass destruction revival] policy. ... The wish to balance Israel and acquire status and influence in the Arab world were also considerations, but secondary.\\" A March 2005 addendum to the report stated that \\"[B]ased on the evidence available at present, ISG judged that it was unlikely that an official transfer of weapons of mass destruction material from Iraq to Syria took place. However, ISG was unable to rule out unofficial movement of limited weapons of mass destruction-related materials.\\" On January 12, 2005, US military forces abandoned the formal search. Transcripts from high level meetings within Saddam Hussein's government before the invasion are consistent with the ISG conclusion that he destroyed his stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction but maintained the expertise to restart production. =Discovery of chemical weapons= During the post-invasion search for weapons of mass destruction, US and Polish forces located decayed chemical weapons that dated to the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. These discoveries led former senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) and representative Peter Hoekstra (R-MI) to say that the US had indeed found weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. These assertions were directly contradicted by weapons experts David Kay, the original director of the Iraq Survey Group, and his successor Charles Duelfer. Both Kay and Duelfer stated that the chemical weapons found were not the \\"weapons of mass destruction\\" that the US was looking for. Kay added that experts on Iraq's chemical weapons are in \\"almost 100 percent agreement\\" that sarin nerve agent produced in the 1980s would no longer be dangerous and that the chemical weapons found were \\"less toxic than most things that Americans have under their kitchen sink at this point\\". In reply, Hoekstra said \\"I am 100 percent sure if David Kay had the opportunity to look at the reports.. he would agree.. these things are lethal and deadly.\\" Discussing the findings on NPR's Talk of the Nation, Charles Duelfer described such residual chemical munitions as hazardous but not deadly. > What we found, both as UN and later when I was with the Iraq Survey Group, > is that some of these rounds would have highly degraded agent, but it is > still dangerous.

The degraded chemical weapons were first discovered in May 2004, when a binary sarin nerve gas shell was used in an improvised explosive device (roadside bomb) in Iraq. The device exploded before it could be disarmed, and two soldiers displayed symptoms of minor sarin exposure. The 155 mm shell was unmarked and rigged as if it were a normal high-explosive shell, indicating that the insurgents who placed the device did not know it contained nerve gas. Earlier in the month, a shell containing mustard gas was found abandoned in the median of a road in Baghdad. In July 2004, Polish troops also found evidence of degraded chemical weapons when they discovered insurgents trying to purchase cyclosarin gas warheads produced during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. In their efforts to thwart insurgents acquiring these weapons, Polish troops purchased two rockets on June 23, 2004. The US military later determined that the two rockets had only trace elements of sarin that were so small and deteriorated as to be virtually harmless and would have \\"limited to no impact if used by insurgents against coalition forces\\".\\"Troops 'foil Iraq nerve gas bid\\" . BBC News, July 2, 2004. Retrieved on May 22, 2007. =Conclusions= The failure to find stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq caused considerable controversy, particularly in the United States. US President George W. Bush and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair defended their decision to go to war, alleging that many nations, even those opposed to war, believed that the Saddam Hussein government was actively developing weapons of mass destructions. Critics such as Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean charged that the Bush and Blair administrations deliberately falsified evidence to build a case for war. These criticisms were strengthened with the 2005 release of the so-called Downing Street Memo, written in July 2002, in which the former head of British Military Intelligence wrote that \\"the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy\\" of removing Saddam Hussein from power. While the Downing Street Memo and the yellowcake uranium scandal lent credence to claims that intelligence was manipulated, two bipartisan investigations, one by the Senate Intelligence Committee and the other by a specially appointed Iraq Intelligence Commission chaired by Charles Robb and Laurence Silberman, found no evidence of political pressure applied to intelligence analysts. An independent assessment by the Annenberg Public Policy Center found that Bush Administration officials did misuse intelligence in their public communications. For example, Vice President Dick Cheney's September 2002 statement on Meet the Press that \\"we do know, with absolute certainty, that he (Saddam) is using his procurement system to acquire the equipment he needs in order to enrich uranium to build a nuclear weapon,\\" was inconsistent with the views of the intelligence community at the time. A study coauthored by the Center for Public Integrity found that in the two years after September 11, 2001 the president and top administration officials had made 935 false statements, in an orchestrated public relations campaign to galvanize public opinion for the war, and that the press was largely complicit in its uncritical coverage of the reasons adduced for going to war.Center for Public Integrity, January 23, 2008 Iraq: The War Card Associated Press, January 23, 2008 Study: Bush Led U.S. To War on 'False Pretenses' PBS commentator Bill Moyers had made similar points throughout the run up to the Iraq War, and prior to a national press conference on the Iraq War Moyers correctly predicted \\"at least a dozen times during this press conference he [the President] will invoke 9/11 and Al-Qaeda to justify a preemptive attack on a country that has not attacked America. But the White House press corps will ask no hard questions tonight about those claims.\\" Moyers later also denounced the complicity of the press in the administration's campaign for the war, saying that the media \\"surrendered its independence and skepticism to join with [the US] government in marching to war,\\" and that the administration \\"needed a compliant press, to pass on their propaganda as news and cheer them on.\\" Many in the intelligence community expressed sincere regret over the flawed predictions about Iraqi weapons programs. Testifying before Congress in January 2004, David Kay, the original director of the Iraq Survey Group, said unequivocally that \\"It turns out that we were all wrong, probably in my judgment, and that is most disturbing.\\" He later added in an interview that the intelligence community owed the President an apology. Comments on intelligence failure: *Kay: No evidence Iraq stockpiled WMDs  * In the aftermath of the invasion, much attention was also paid to the role of the press in promoting government claims concerning weapons of mass destruction production in Iraq. Between 1998 and 2003, The New York Times and other influential US newspapers published numerous articles about suspected Iraqi rearmament programs with headlines like \\"Iraqi Work Toward A-Bomb Reported\\" and \\"Iraq Suspected of Secret Germ War Effort.\\" It later turned out that many of the sources for these articles were unreliable, and that some were tied to Ahmed Chalabi, an Iraqi exile with close ties to the Bush Administration who was a consistent supporter of an invasion. Some controversy also exists regarding whether the invasion increased or decreased the potential for nuclear proliferation. For example, hundreds of tons of dual-use high explosives that could be used to detonate fissile material in a nuclear weapon were sealed by the IAEA at the Al Qa'qaa site in January 2003. Immediately before the invasion, UN Inspectors had checked the locked bunker doors, but not the actual contents; the bunkers also had large ventilation shafts that were not sealed. By October, the material was no longer present. The IAEA expressed concerns that the material might have been looted after the invasion, posing a nuclear proliferation threat. The US released satellite photographs from March 17, showing trucks at the site large enough to remove substantial amounts of material before US forces reached the area in April. Ultimately, Major Austin Pearson of Task Force Bullet, a task force charged with securing and destroying Iraqi ammunition after the invasion, stated that the task force had removed about 250 tons of material from the site and had detonated it or used it to detonate other munitions. Similar concerns were raised about other dual use materials, such as high strength aluminum; before the invasion, the US cited them as evidence for an Iraqi nuclear weapons program, while the IAEA was satisfied that they were being used for permitted industrial uses; after the war, the IAEA emphasized the proliferation concern, while the Duelfer report mentioned the material's use as scrap. Possible chemical weapons laboratories have also been found which were built subsequent to the 2003 invasion, apparently by insurgent forces. * *Iraqi Chemical Stash Uncovered On August 2, 2004, President Bush stated \\"Knowing what I know today we still would have gone on into Iraq. ‚Ä¶ The decision I made is the right decision. The world is better off without Saddam Hussein in power.\\" Iraqi links to terrorist organizations Along with Iraq's alleged development of weapons of mass destructions, another justification for invasion was the purported link between Saddam Hussein's government and terrorist organizations, in particular Al-Qaeda. In that sense, the Bush Administration cast the Iraq war as part of the broader War on Terrorism. On February 11, 2003, FBI Director Robert Mueller testified to Congress that \\"seven countries designated as State Sponsors of Terrorism‚ÄîIran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Cuba, and North Korea‚Äîremain active in the US and continue to support terrorist groups that have targeted Americans.\\"\\"Before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence of the United States Senate \\". Fbi.gov. February 11, 2003.\\"Mueller: 'Enemy is far from defeated' \\". CNN. February 11, 2003. As with the argument that Iraq was developing biological and nuclear weapons, evidence linking Saddam Hussein and Al-Qaeda was discredited by multiple US intelligence agencies soon after the invasion of Iraq. =Al-Qaeda= In asserting a link between Saddam Hussein and Al-Qaeda, the Bush Administration focused special attention on alleged ties between Saddam Hussein and Jordanian terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, whom Secretary of State Powell called a \\"collaborator of Osama bin Laden.\\" Soon after the start of the war, however, evidence of such ties was discredited by multiple US intelligence agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the Defense Department's Inspector General's Office. A CIA report in early October 2004 \\"found no clear evidence of Iraq harboring Abu Musab al- Zarqawi.\\" More broadly, the CIA's Kerr Group summarized in 2004 that despite \\"a 'purposely aggressive approach' in conducting exhaustive and repetitive searches for such links... [the US] Intelligence Community remained firm in its assessment that no operational or collaborative relationship existed.\\" Despite these findings, US Vice President Dick Cheney has continued to assert that a link existed between Al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which has drawn criticism from members of the intelligence community and leading Democrats. As of the invasion, the State Department listed 45 countries, including the United States where Al Qaeda was active. Iraq was not one of them. The eventual lack of evidence linking the Saddam Hussein government and Al Qaeda led many war critics to allege that the Bush Administration purposely fabricated such links to strengthen the case for the invasion. These claims were supported by the July 2005 release of the so- called Downing Street Memo, in which Richard Dearlove (then head of British foreign intelligence service MI6) wrote that \\"the intelligence and facts were being fixed [by the US] around the policy\\" of removing Saddam Hussein from power. In addition, in his April 2007 report Acting Inspector General Thomas F. Gimble found that the Defense Department's Office of Special Plans‚Äîrun by then-Undersecretary of Defense Douglas J. Feith, a close ally of Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld‚Äîpurposely manipulated evidence to strengthen the case for war. The Inspector General's report also highlighted the role of members of the Iraqi National Congress, a group headed by Ahmad Chalabi, in providing false intelligence about connections with Al-Qaeda to build support for a US invasion. =Other terrorist organizations= In making its case for the invasion of Iraq, the Bush Administration also referenced Saddam Hussein's relationships with terrorist organizations other than Al-Qaeda. Saddam Hussein provided financial assistance to the families of Palestinians killed in the conflict ‚Äì including as much as $25,000 to the families of suicide bombers, some of whom were working with militant organizations in the Middle East such as Hamas.Palestinians get Saddam funds , BBC News. March 13, 2003. Abdul Rahman Yasin, a suspect detained shortly after the 1993 US World Trade Center Bombing attacks, fled upon release into Iraq. Shortly after release, the FBI had discovered evidence linking him to the creation of the bomb. After the invasion, Iraqi government official documents translated from Arabic to English described Saddam's regime provided monthly payments to Yasin while residing in the United States. Yasin is on the FBI's most wanted terrorists list, and is still at large.Most Wanted Terrorists Human rights The US has cited the United Nations in condemnation of Saddam Hussein's human rights abuses as one of several reasons for the Iraq invasion. As evidence supporting US and British claims about Iraqi weapons of mass destructions weakened, the Bush Administration began to focus more upon the other issues that Congress had articulated within the Iraq Resolution such as human rights violations of the Saddam Hussein government as justification for military intervention.Senators Slam Shifting Iraq War Justification. Islamonline. July 30, 2003. That the Saddam Hussein government consistently and violently violated the human rights of its people is in little doubt.\\"Decades of human rights abuses in Iraq\\" . Amnesty International, retrieved on May 16, 2007. During his more than twenty-year rule, Saddam Hussein tortured and killed thousands of Iraqi citizens, including gassing and killing thousands of Kurds in northern Iraq during the mid-1980s, brutally repressing Shia and Kurdish uprisings following the 1991 Gulf War, and a fifteen-year campaign of repression and displacement of the Marsh Arabs in Southern Iraq. In the 2003 State of the Union Address, President Bush mentions Saddam's government practices of obtaining confessions by torturing children while their parents are made to watch, electric shock, burning with hot irons, dripping acid on the skin, mutilation with electric drills, cutting out tongues, and rape. Many critics have argued, despite its repeated mention in the Joint Resolution, that human rights was never a principal justification for the war, and that it became prominent only after evidence concerning weapons of mass destructions and Saddam Hussein's links to terrorism became discredited. For example, during a July 29, 2003, hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, then Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz spent the majority of his testimony discussing Saddam Hussein's human rights record, causing Senator Lincoln Chafee (R-RI) to complain that \\"in the months leading up to the war it was a steady drum beat of weapons of mass destruction, weapons of mass destruction, weapons of mass destruction. And, Secretary Wolfowitz, in your almost hour-long testimony here this morning, once‚Äîonly once did you mention weapons of mass destruction, and that was an ad lib.\\" Leading human rights groups such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International further argued that even had human rights concerns been a central rationale for the invasion, military intervention would not have been justifiable on humanitarian grounds. As Human Rights Watch's Ken Roth wrote in 2004, despite Saddam Hussein's horrific human rights record, \\"the killing in Iraq at the time was not of the exceptional nature that would justify such intervention.\\"Roth, Ken. \\"War in Iraq: Not a Humanitarian Intervention\\" Human Rights Watch. January 2004. Retrieved April 6, 2007. More broadly, war critics have argued that the US and Europe supported the Saddam Hussein regime during the 1980s, a period of some of his worst human rights abuses, thus casting doubt on the sincerity of claims that military intervention was for humanitarian purposes. Documents from the National Security Archive released in 2003 show that the US and Europe provided considerable military and financial support during the Iran- Iraq war with full knowledge that the Saddam Hussein government was regularly using chemical weapons on Iranian soldiers and Kurdish insurgents. Following along this line, critics of the use of human rights as a rationale, such as Columbia University Law Professor Michael Dorf, have pointed out that during his first campaign for president Bush was highly critical of using US military might for humanitarian ends.Dorf, Michael C. \\"Kerry Stands by His Iraq War Vote\\" . FindLaw.com, August 18, 2004. Retrieved on May 17, 2007. Others have questioned why military intervention for humanitarian reasons would supposedly have been justified in Iraq but not in other countries where human rights violations were even greater, such as Darfur. =United Nations= In the end, by Article 1 of the UN Charter, the United Nations has the responsibility: \\"To achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion.Charter of the United Nations By UN Charter Article 39, the responsibility for this determination lies with the Security Council. =Ending sanctions= US Vice President Dick Cheney, who called the sanctions \\"the most intrusive system of arms control in history\\", cited the breakdown of the sanctions as one rationale for the Iraq war. Accepting a controversial large estimate of casualties due to sanctions, Walter Russell Mead argued on behalf of such a war as a better alternative than continuing the sanctions regime, since \\"Each year of containment is a new Gulf War.\\" However, economist Michael Spagat \\"argue[s] that the contention that sanctions had caused the deaths of more than half a million children is [as were weapons of mass destruction claims] very likely to be wrong.\\" Oil =Statements indicating oil as a rationale= In 2008, President Bush issued a signing statement, declaring that he would ignore any law that prohibited using federal funds \\"to establish any military installation or base for the purpose of providing for the permanent stationing of United States Armed Forces in Iraq\\" or \\"to exercise United States control of the oil resources of Iraq.\\"\\"Bush asserts authority to bypass defense act\\" Boston Globe, January 30, 2008 According to former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, the United States didn't need to invade Iraq to control the oil.

The overtures intrigued the Bush administration but were ultimately rebuffed.\\"THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: DIPLOMACY; Iraq Said to Have Tried to Reach Last-Minute Deal to Avert War\\" New York Times, November 6, 2003 The primary reason for invading Iraq, according to those attending NSC briefings in 2002, was \\"to create a demonstration model\\" to deter anyone with the temerity to \\"flout the authority of the United States\\" in any way.\\"The One Percent Doctrine: Deep Inside America's Pursuit of Its Enemies Since 9/11\\" Ron Suskind, 2008 Bush's Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said that Bush's first two National Security Council meetings included a discussion of invading Iraq.

It was also alleged by the BBC's Greg Palast that the \\"new plan was crafted by neo-conservatives intent on using Iraq's oil to destroy the OPEC cartel through massive increases in production above OPEC quotas\\", but in reality Iraq oil production decreased following the Iraq War.Apocalypse and/or Business as Usual? The Energy Debate After the 2004 US Presidential Elections Speaking at the Catholic University of America Columbus School of Law in 2008, Chuck Hagel, the former United States Secretary of Defense, defended Greenspan's comments regarding oil as a motivation for the invasion of Iraq: \\"People say we're not fighting for oil. Of course we are.\\" General John Abizaid, CENTCOM commander from 2003 until 2007, said of the Iraq war during a round table discussion at Stanford University in 2008, \\"Of course it's about oil, it's very much about oil and we can't really deny that.\\" Many critics have focused upon administration officials' past relationship with energy sector corporations. Both George W. Bush and Dick Cheney were formerly CEOs of oil and oil-related companies such as Arbusto, Harken Energy, Spectrum 7, and Halliburton. Before the 2003 invasion of Iraq and even before the War on Terror, the administration had prompted anxiety over whether the private sector ties of cabinet members (including National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, former director of Chevron, and Commerce Secretary Donald Evans, former head of Tom Brown Inc.) would affect their judgment on energy policy. Prior to the war, the CIA saw Iraqi oil production and illicit oil sales as Iraq's key method of financing increasing weapons of mass destruction capability. The CIA's October 2002 unclassified white paper on \\"Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction Programs,\\" states on page 1 under the \\"Key Judgments, Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction Programs\\" heading that \\"Iraq's growing ability to sell oil illicitly increases Baghdad's capabilities to finance weapons of mass destruction programs\\".

Strategic importance of oil A proven oil reserves map of the world (CIA- The World Factbook, 2009). Oil exerts tremendous economic and political influence worldwide, although the line between political and economic influence is not always distinct. The importance of oil to national security is unlike that of any other commodity: > Modern warfare particularly depends on oil, because virtually all weapons > systems rely on oil-based fuel ‚Äì tanks, trucks, armored vehicles, self- > propelled artillery pieces, airplanes, and naval ships.

Such governments view their companies' global > interests as synonymous with the national interest and they readily support > their companies' efforts to control new production sources, to overwhelm > foreign rivals, and to gain the most favorable pipeline routes and other > transportation and distribution channels. Critics of the Iraq War contend that US officials and representatives from the private sector were planning just this kind of mutually supportive relationship as early as 2001, when the James Baker III Institute for Public Policy and the Council on Foreign Relations produced \\"Strategic Energy Policy: Challenges for the 21st Century,\\" a report describing the long-term threat of energy crises such as blackouts and rising fuel prices then playing havoc with the state of California. The report recommended a comprehensive review of US military, energy, economic, and political policy toward Iraq \\"with the aim to lowering anti-Americanism in the Middle East and elsewhere, and set the groundwork to eventually ease Iraqi oil-field investment restrictions.\\" The report's urgent tone stood in contrast to the relatively calm speech Chevron CEO Kenneth T.

Of 18 signatories to the 1998 PNAC letter, 11 would later occupy positions in President Bush's administration: Elliott Abrams, Richard Armitage, John R. Bolton, Paula Dobriansky, Francis Fukuyama, Zalmay Khalilzad, Richard Perle, Peter W. Rodman, Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz, and Robert B. Zoellick. Administration officials Dick Cheney, Eliot A. Cohen, and Lewis Libby were signatories to the 1997 PNAC \\"Statement of Principles.\\"PNAC \\"Statement of Principles.\\" June 3, 1997  Wolfowitz Cabal  Just after US invasion of Afghanistan, the London Observer and The Guardian reported plans to invade Iraq and seize its oil reserves around Basra and use the proceeds to finance Iraqi oppositions in the south and the north. Later the US intelligence community denied these claims as incredible and that they have no plan to attack Iraq. On October 14, 2001, The Guardian reported: > \\"The group, which some in the State Department and on Capitol Hill refer to > as the 'Wolfowitz cabal', after Deputy Secretary of Defence Paul Wolfowitz, > was yesterday laying the ground for a strategy that envisions the use of air > support and the occupation of southern Iraq with American ground troops to > install an Iraqi opposition group based in London at the helm of a new > government. Under the plan, American troops would also seize the oil fields > around Basra, in south-eastern Iraq, and sell the oil to finance the Iraqi > opposition in the south and the Kurds in the north, one senior official > said.\\" =Petrodollar warfare= Ever since the establishment of the financial institutions of the Bretton Woods system in 1944 the US dollar has been used as the world's principal reserve currency and allowed the US government to operate at a deficit with limited consequences. After years of deficit spending the Nixon Shock in 1971 ended the convertibility of US dollars to gold, and after the floating of the US dollar 1973 left it unsupported by a fixed exchange rate, the US needed another monetary system to bring stability to the markets. They achieved this when Saudi Arabia agreed in 1974 to price their oil exclusively in US dollars in return for military equipment and protection. By 1975, all of the oil-producing nations of OPEC had agreed to price their oil in dollars and to invest surplus oil proceeds in US government debt securities in exchange for similar offers by the US However by mid-2000 news outlets carried articles about Saddam's efforts to sell oil on markets exclusively in euros. Several commentators writing contemporaneously with the buildup to the invasion linked Iraq's Nov 2000 re-denomination of oil from USD to euros and the possibility of more widespread adoption of the euro as an oil pricing standard to the risk that that would place on the post-Bretton Woods use of the USD as the international reserve currency and the impact that that would have on the US economy, and theorised that one of the fundamental purposes for war in Iraq would be to force Iraq to revert to pricing its oil in USD. In the aftermath of the invasion, other commentators concurred and reiterated earlier observations about similar threats posed by (and to) Venezuela, Syria and Iran. =Statements against oil as a rationale= In 2002, responding to a question about coveting oil fields, George Bush said \\"Those are the wrong impressions. I have a deep desire for peace. That's what I have a desire for. And freedom for the Iraqi people. See, I don't like a system where people are repressed through torture and murder in order to keep a dictator in place. That troubles me deeply. And so the Iraqi people must hear this loud and clear, that this country never has any intention to conquer anybody.\\" THE 2002 ELECTION; Excerpts From News Conference: Imagine 'Hussein With Nuclear Weapons' , The New York Times November 8, 2002 Tony Blair stated that the theory that the Iraq invasion had \\"some[thing] to do with oil\\" was a \\"conspiracy theory\\"; \\"Let me first deal with the conspiracy theory that this is somehow to do with oil...The very reason why we are taking the action that we are taking is nothing to do with oil or any of the other conspiracy theories put forward.\\" Then Australian Prime Minister John Howard has dismissed on multiple occasions the role of oil in the Iraq Invasion: \\"We didn't go there because of oil and we don't remain there because of oil.\\" In early 2003 John Howard stated, \\"No criticism is more outrageous than the claim that United States behaviour is driven by a wish to take control of Iraq's oil reserves.\\" 2008 Republican Presidential Candidate John McCain was forced to clarify his comments suggesting the Iraq war involved US reliance on foreign oil. \\"My friends, I will have an energy policy that we will be talking about, which will eliminate our dependence on oil from the Middle East that will prevent us from having ever to send our young men and women into conflict again in the Middle East,\\" McCain said. To clarify his comments, McCain explained that \\"the word 'again' was misconstrued, I want us to remove our dependency on foreign oil for national security reasons, and that's all I mean.\\" Scholar Jeff Colgan writes that \\"Even years after the 2003 Iraq War, there is still no consensus on the degree to which oil played a role in that war.\\" Combating terrorism In addition to claiming that the Saddam Hussein government had ties to Al-Qaeda, the Bush Administration and other supporters of the war have argued for continued involvement in Iraq as a means to combat terrorism. President Bush consistently referred to the Iraq war as the \\"central front in the war on terror.\\" In contrast with this rationale, a few intelligence experts claim that the Iraq war has actually increased terrorism, even though no acts of terrorism have occurred within the US. London's conservative International Institute for Strategic Studies concluded in 2004 that the occupation of Iraq had become \\"a potent global recruitment pretext\\" for jihadists and that the invasion \\"galvanized\\" Al-Qaeda and \\"perversely inspired insurgent violence\\" there. Counter-terrorism expert Rohan Gunaratna has called the invasion of Iraq as a \\"fatal mistake\\" that has greatly increased terrorism in the Middle East.Rohan Gunaratna, \\"The Post-Madrid Face of Al Qaeda,\\" Washington Quarterly 27:3 (Summer 2004) p. 98. The US National Intelligence Council concluded in a January 2005 report that the war in Iraq had become a breeding ground for a new generation of terrorists; David B. Low, the national intelligence officer for transnational threats, indicated that the report concluded that the war in Iraq provided terrorists with \\"a training ground, a recruitment ground, the opportunity for enhancing technical skills.... here is even, under the best scenario, over time, the likelihood that some of the jihadists who are not killed there will, in a sense, go home, wherever home is, and will therefore disperse to various other countries.\\" The Council's Chairman Robert L. Hutchings said, \\"At the moment, Iraq is a magnet for international terrorist activity.\\" And the 2006 National Intelligence Estimate, which outlined the considered judgment of all 16 US intelligence agencies, held that \\"The Iraq conflict has become the 'cause celebre' for jihadists, breeding a deep resentment of US involvement in the Muslim world and cultivating supporters for the global jihadist movement.\\" Al-Qaeda leaders have also publicly cited the Iraq war as a boon to their recruiting and operational efforts, providing both evidence to jihadists worldwide that America is at war with Islam, and the training ground for a new generation of jihadists to practice attacks on American forces. In October 2003, Osama bin Laden announced: \\"Be glad of the good news: America is mired in the swamps of the Tigris and Euphrates. Bush is, through Iraq and its oil, easy prey. Here is he now, thank God, in an embarrassing situation and here is America today being ruined before the eyes of the whole world.\\" Echoing this sentiment, Al- Qaeda commander Seif al-Adl gloated about the war in Iraq, indicating, \\"The Americans took the bait and fell into our trap.\\" A letter thought to be from Al-Qaeda leader Atiyah Abd al-Rahman found in Iraq among the rubble where al- Zarqawi was killed and released by the US military in October 2006, indicated that Al-Qaeda perceived the war as beneficial to its goals: \\"The most important thing is that the jihad continues with steadfastness ... indeed, prolonging the war is in our interest.\\" Other rationales =Bringing democracy to the Middle East= One of the rationales that the Bush Administration employed periodically during the run-up to the Iraq war is that deposing Saddam Hussein and installing a democratic government in Iraq would promote democracy in other Middle Eastern countries.Wright, Steven. The United States and Persian Gulf Security: The Foundations of the War on Terror, Ithaca Press, 2007 The United States also proclaims that monarchies Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the military ruled Pakistan are allies of America, despite the human rights abuses and subversion of democracy attributed to them respectively. As Vice President Dick Cheney argued in an August 2002 speech to the annual Veterans of Foreign Wars convention, \\"When the gravest of threats are eliminated, the freedom-loving peoples of the region will have a chance to promote the values that can bring lasting peace.\\" At a 2003 Veterans Day address, President Bush stated: =Establishing long term Middle East military presence= US General Jay Garner, who was in charge of planning and administering post-war reconstruction in Iraq, compared the US occupation of Iraq to the Philippine model in a 2004 interview in National Journal: \\"Look back on the Philippines around the turn of the 20th century: they were a coaling station for the navy, and that allowed us to keep a great presence in the Pacific. That's what Iraq is for the next few decades: our coaling station that gives us great presence in the Middle East\\", \\"One of the most important things we can do right now is start getting basing rights with (the Iraqi authorities)\\", \\"I hope they're there a long time.... And I think we'll have basing rights in the north and basing rights in the south ... we'd want to keep at least a brigade\\", Garner added. quoted in ; See also Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War Also, the House report accompanying the emergency spending legislation said the money was \\"of a magnitude normally associated with permanent bases\\".BBC News, March 30, 2006, Iraq bases spur questions over US plans =Divine inspiration= Nabil Shaath told the BBC that according to minutes of a conference with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, Bush said, \\"God inspired me to hit al Qaeda, and so I hit it. And I had the inspiration to hit Saddam, and so I hit him.\\" Haaretz provided a similar translation of the minutes. When an Arabist at the Washington Post translated the same transcript, Bush was said to have indicated that God inspired him to, \\"end the tyranny in Iraq,\\" instead.Washington Post: Interpretation of Bush's Comments Reignites Debate October 9, 2005 In a 2003 interview, Jacques Chirac, President of France at that time, affirmed that President George W. Bush asked him to send troops to Iraq to stop Gog and Magog, the \\"Bible's satanic agents of the Apocalypse.\\" According to Chirac, the American leader appealed to their \\"common faith\\" (Christianity) and told him: \\"Gog and Magog are at work in the Middle East‚Ä¶. The biblical prophecies are being fulfilled‚Ä¶. This confrontation is willed by God, who wants to use this conflict to erase his people's enemies before a New Age begins.\\"A French Revelation, or The Burning Bush at the Council for Secular Humanism: official website. Accessed August 8, 2009.Agog over Bush's comments on Gog and Magog , Charleston Gazette, July 22, 2009 =Purported Iraqi intelligence plots= David Harrison claims in the Telegraph to have found secret documents that purport to show Russian President Vladimir Putin offering the use of assassins to Saddam's Iraqi regime to kill Western targets on November 27, 2000. Alleged terrorist links On October 12, 2002, Newsmax wrote that CNSNews correspondent Jeff Johnson reported US Senator Spector wanted a probe of the Oklahoma City bombing link to Iraq after receiving 22 affidavits by Oklahoma residents identifying 8 Middle Eastern men, including a former Iraqi Republican Guard (Hussain Al-Hussaini) from former KFOR-TV reporter Jayna Davis. Jayna Davis had theorised on the purported links between the Oklahoma City bombing, Iraq, and Al-Qaeda. Abdul Rahman Yasin, a suspect detained shortly after the 1993 US World Trade Center Bombing attacks, fled upon release into Iraq. Shortly after release, the FBI had discovered evidence linking him to the creation of the bomb. After the invasion, Iraqi government official documents translated from Arabic to English described Saddam's regime provided monthly payments to Yasin while in residing in the United States. Yasin is on the FBI's most wanted terrorists list, and is still at large. John Lumpkin, Associated Press Writer, consolidates statements made by Vice President Cheney concerning the 1993 WTC bombing and Iraq. Cheney indicated Saddam's Iraqi government claimed to have FBI Fugitive Yasin, alleged participant in the mixing of the chemicals making the bomb used in the 1993 WTC attack, in an Iraqi prison. During negotiations in the weeks prior to the invasion of Iraq, Saddam refused to extradite him. Fox News claimed that evidence found in Iraq after the invasion was used to stop the attempted assassination of the Pakistani ambassador in New York with a shoulder fired rocket. US government officials have claimed that after the invasion, Yemen and Jordan stopped Iraqi terrorist attacks against Western targets in those nations. US intelligence also warned 10 other countries that small groups of Iraqi intelligence agents may be readying similar attacks. After the Beslan school hostage crisis, public school layouts and crisis plans were retrieved on a disk recovered during an Iraqi raid and had raised concerns in the United States. The information on the disks was \\"all publicly available on the Internet\\" and US officials \\"said it was unclear who downloaded the information and stressed there is no evidence of any specific threats involving the schools.\\" =Pressuring Saudi Arabia= The operations in Iraq came about as a result of the US attempting to put pressure on Saudi Arabia. Much of the funding for Al-Qaeda came from sources in Saudi Arabia through channels left over from the Afghan War. The US, wanting to staunch such financial support, pressured the Saudi leadership to cooperate with the West. The Saudis in power, fearing an Islamic backlash if they cooperated with the US which could push them from power, refused. In order to put pressure on Saudi Arabia to cooperate, the invasion of Iraq was conceived. Such an action would demonstrate the power of the US military, put US troops near to Saudi Arabia, and demonstrate that the US did not need Saudi allies to project itself in the Middle East.Friedman, George America's Secret War: Inside the Hidden Worldwide Struggle Between the United States and Its Enemies Doubleday, 2004 pg. ?  Criticisms of the rationale for the Iraq war  Despite these efforts to sway public opinion, the invasion of Iraq was seen by some including Kofi Annan, United Nations Secretary-General, Lord Goldsmith, British Attorney General, and Human Rights Watch as a violation of international law, breaking the UN Charter (see Legitimacy of the 2003 invasion of Iraq) especially since the US failed to secure U.N. support for an invasion of Iraq. In 41 countries the majority of the populace did not support an invasion of Iraq without U.N. sanction and half said an invasion should not occur under any circumstances. In the US, 73 percent of United States supported an invasion. To build international support the United States formed a \\"Coalition of the Willing\\" with the United Kingdom, Italy, Poland, Australia and several other countries despite a majority of citizens in these countries opposing the invasion. Massive protests of the war have occurred in the US and elsewhere.Largest Anti-War Rally . Guinness Book of World Records. At the time of the invasion UNMOVIC inspectors were ordered out by the United Nations. The inspectors requested more time because \\"disarmament, and at any rate verification, cannot be instant.\\" Following the invasion, no stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction were found, although about 500 abandoned chemical munitions, mostly degraded, remaining from Iraq's Iran‚ÄìIraq war, were collected from around the country. The Kelly Affair highlighted a possible attempt by the British government to cover-up fabrications in British intelligence, the exposure of which would have undermined the Prime Minister's original rationale for involvement in the war. The US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence found no substantial evidence for reputed links between Iraq and Al-Qaeda.United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Retrieved September 10, 2006. President George W. Bush has since admitted that \\"much of the intelligence turned out to be wrong\\". Although evidence of weapons of mass destruction was searched for by the Iraq Survey Group, their final report of September 2004 stated, \\"While a small number of old, abandoned chemical munitions have been discovered, ISG judges that Iraq unilaterally destroyed its undeclared chemical weapons stockpile in 1991. There are no credible indications that Baghdad resumed production of chemical munitions thereafter, a policy ISG attributes to Baghdad's desire to see sanctions lifted, or rendered ineffectual, or its fear of force against it should weapons of mass destruction be discovered.\\" In the March 2005 Addendum to the Report, the Special Advisor furthermore went on to state that \\"ISG assesses that Iraq and Coalition Forces will continue to discover small numbers of degraded chemical weapons, which the former Regime mislaid or improperly destroyed prior to 1991. ISG believes the bulk of these weapons were likely abandoned, forgotten and lost during the Iran-Iraq war because tens of thousands of CW munitions were forward deployed along frequently and rapidly shifting battlefronts.\\" (For comparison, the US Department of Defense itself was famously unable in 1998 to report the whereabouts of \\"56 airplanes, 32 tanks and 36 Javelin command launch units\\".) ISG also believed that Saddam did not want to verifiably disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, as required by U.N. resolutions, for fear of looking weak to his enemies. Clare Short claims that in July 2002, UK government ministers were warned that Britain was committed to participating in a US invasion of Iraq, and a further allegation was that \\"the decision by Blair's government to participate in the US invasion of Iraq bypassed proper government procedures and ignored opposition to the war from Britain's intelligence quarters.\\". Tony Blair had agreed to back military action to oust Saddam Hussein with an assessment regarding weapons of mass destruction, at a summit at President George W. Bush's Texas ranch. Also present at the meeting were three other British officials ‚Äì Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw and Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) head Sir Richard Dearlove. Jacques Chirac, Gerhard Schroeder and Vladimir Putin made public statements in opposition to the invasion of Iraq. In Europe the peace movement was very strong, especially in Germany, where three quarters of the population were opposed to the war. Ten NATO member countries did not join the coalition with the US, and their leaders made public statements in opposition to the invasion of Iraq. These leaders included Gerhard Schroeder of Germany, Jacques Chirac of France, Guy Verhofstadt of Belgium, and Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan of Turkey. Public perceptions of the US changed dramatically as a consequence of the invasion. China and Russia also expressed their opposition to the invasion of Iraq.\\"Opposition to Iraq war widens \\". BBC News. 23 January 2003. Other possible US objectives, denied by the US government but acknowledged by retired US General Jay Garner, included the establishment of permanent US military bases in Iraq as a way of projecting power (creating a credible threat of US military intervention) to the oil-rich Persian Gulf region and the Middle East generally. In February 2004, Jay Garner, who was in charge of planning and administering post-war reconstruction in Iraq, explained that the US occupation of Iraq was comparable to the Philippine model: \\"Look back on the Philippines around the turn of the 20th century: they were a coaling station for the navy, and that allowed us to keep a great presence in the Pacific. That's what Iraq is for the next few decades: our coaling station that gives us great presence in the Middle East\\"; (see also Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War). Garner was replaced by Paul Bremer after reports came out of his position in SY Coleman, a division of defense contractor L-3 Communications specializing in missile-defense systems. It was believed his role in the company was in contention with his role in Iraq. The House Appropriations Committee said the report accompanying the emergency spending legislation was \\"of a magnitude normally associated with permanent bases.\\" However, the United States House of Representatives voted in 2006 to not fund any permanent bases in Iraq.

Immigrated to Indonesia with his family when he was a child, he was a former member of the PCC, traded copra in mid 1950s, moved into palm oil industry soon after, started a paper factory in the 1970s, and then entered financial services in the 1980s. At the time of his death, Sinar Mas has interests in paper, real estate, financial services, agribusiness, and telecom with holdings primarily in Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, and China, while Widjaja was listed by Forbes as the third richest person in Indonesia with a net worth of approximately US$8.6 Billion. Early life Widjaja was born Oei Ek Tjhong in Quanzhou, Fujian, Republic of China. He was the son of a Sulawesi (Celebes)-based trader. In around 1930, he and his mother moved to Indonesia (then was Dutch East Indies) to join his father who had already settled in Makassar, and he started helping his father to run a small shop. He was educated in a local Chinese school, but left at the age of fifteen to work as a hawker. As a teenager, he sold biscuits and candy from his bicycle. Career In his early career, Widjaja did various business, including trading cooking oil and agricultural products, coffee shop, pig rearing, bakery, and grave construction. During Japanese occupation, price controls devastated his cooking oil business. When Indonesia's war for independence against the Dutch crushed his commodity- trading business in 1949, he sold family jewelry to repay creditors and traded in his car for a bicycle. In 1950s, when Indonesian military sent troops to Makassar to fight Andi Aziz and later Abdul Kahar Muzakkar, Widjaja sold food and other supplies to the troops, forging ties between him and the military. He used the military ship to trade copra‚Äîthe raw material to make coconut oil‚Äîfrom Manado to Makassar. And thus, his copra business started, later reaching Jakarta and Surabaya. However, the Permesta rebellion happened in Sulawesi and Widjaja decided to move to Surabaya. In 1962, CV Sinar Mas was first registered in Surabaya, and soon it opened a branch office in Jakarta. This company exported natural products and imported textiles. In 1968, Widjaja opened a cooking oil factory PT Bitung Manado Oil in Manado, followed by PT Kunci Mas in Surabaya. The Manado-based factory later produced cooking oil under the brand Bimoli, which catered to up to 50 percent of the demand in the Indonesian cooking oil market. In 1990, Widjaja lost this brand to Salim Group after their joint ventures in cooking oil business split. In 1972, together with Taiwanese investors, Widjaja acquired caustic soda producer Tjiwi Kimia, which he transformed into the Sinar Mas Group's first pulp and paper manufacturer. In the same year, he started Duta Pertiwi, a property developer and real estate business. In the 1970s, he already acquired logging concessions. In 1980, Sinar Mas changed all its cooking oil refinery machines to be able to produce palm oil. In the same year, Widjaja already possessed extensive oil palm fields in Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, and Papua. In 1982, he acquired a 10.000 hectare field in North Sumatra. Also in 1982, Widjaja acquired Bank Internasional Indonesia (BII) and founded PT Internas Artha Leasing Company. BII became the second largest private bank in Indonesia, but due to the 1997 Asian financial crisis, it failed in April 1998 with a debt of US$4.6 billion (the largest foreign debt owed by an Indonesian corporation at that time) and was nationalized in April 1999. Widjaja moved back into banking by acquiring PT Bank Shinta Indonesia in 2005 and later renamed it as PT Bank Sinarmas. In 1990, Widjaja received an honorary doctorate in economics by Pittsburg State University in Pittsburg, Kansas, United States, citing him as the \\"ultimate entrepreneur\\". By the mid-1990s, Widjaja's best-known asset was a controlling stake in Asia Pulp & Paper (APP), a Singapore-based company listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the 10th- largest paper company in the world. After the 1997 Asian financial crisis and a dip in the international wood pulp price in 2000, it was revealed that the company had a global US$13.9 billion debt. In March 2001, two months after being threatened with delisting from the NYSE, APP stopped paying its debt, considered to be the largest debt default in the world's emerging markets.

February 7, 2008 21:52 EST As of 2003, Widjaja lived primarily in Singapore and had turned over day-to-day control of his businesses to his extensive family. Personal life and family Unlike many other Chinese-Indonesian tycoons, Widjaja was known to flaunt his wealth. He rode in fancy cars and wore a belt buckle encrusted with diamonds spelling out his name, \\"EKA\\". Widjaja had several wives and at least 40 children. His first wife was Trinidewi (or Trini Dewi) Lasuki, who died in 2017. Eka reportedly treated the children of his first wife as his heirs while providing financial support to his other children to help start businesses. Most of Eka's children by Trinidewi‚Äîsix males and two females‚Äîare involved in the family businesses. The eldest daughter, Sukmawati Widjaja (Oei Siu Hoa), serves as Sinar Mas vice chairperson since 1988. Sukmawati was previously married to her cousin, Rudy Maeloa, who was Eka's right hand who died in 1988. Eka's eldest son, Teguh Ganda Widjaja (Oei Tjie Goan), heads the pulp and paper division of the group as the chairman of Asia Pulp & Paper. Teguh's brothers are or were in charge of other divisions; Eka's third son, Indra Widjaja (Oei Pheng Lian or Oei Beng Nien), of financial services; the fourth son, Muktar Widjaja (Oei Siong Lian), of property; and the youngest sixth son, Franky Oesman Widjaja (Oei Jong Nian), of agribusiness (he is the chairman of Golden Agri-Resources). Indra Widjaja's son, Fuganto Widjaja, is heading coal mining and trading company Golden Energy and Resources, Sinar Mas' Singapore-based subsidiary, and is considered as the group's new face, proclaimed to shift its focus to energy and infrastructure, telecoms, healthcare, and education. Some of Eka's other wives and their children have been given their own business groups to manage. His seven children by one wife‚ÄîMellie Pirieh, who died in 2009‚Äîrun the Duta Dharma Bhakti group of 26 companies. A son from another marriage, Oei Hong Leong, is ranked by Forbes in 2018 as the 22nd richest person in Singapore, with a net worth of US$1.5 billion. Death Widjaja died on January 26, 2019 at his home in Menteng, Jakarta. He was buried on February 2, 2019 in the family cemetery in Karawang, West Java.

The Patriotes were led by Wolfred Nelson. Gore was sent to quell the uprising in the Richelieu River valley in conjunction with a force led by Lieutenant-Colonel George Wetherall. Gore was the first to arrive at a Patriote-held site. Nelson had organized the defence with most of the well-armed rebels within a stone house that overlooked the road. Gore, accompanied by only one cannon, attempted to take the stone house three times, with the cannon providing ineffective fire. Another attempt to flank the house to the left failed when Gore's soldiers encountered the less well-armed militia. Running out of ammunition, the British retreated. This marked the only Patriote victory in 1837, as this battle was followed by two defeats at Saint-Charles and Saint-Eustache. Background Within twenty years of the establishment of Lower Canada in 1791, new tracts of land were set aside for settlement by peoples other than French Canadians. The French remained predominantly on the seigneuries located by rivers and the new areas were settled largely by English-speaking British immigrants. The new English-speaking immigrants reaped greater benefits than the existing French communities under the British government. Those French Canadians who were elected to the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada were mainly of the elite educated at Catholic colleges, because social movement was restricted by the British who monopolized commerce and government postings. The French Canadian habitants faced diminishing lands to give to their children and competed with the English for the new lands on English terms, with British bureaucracy placing immigrant claims ahead of those of the habitants. Furthermore, outbreaks in dysentery, typhus and cholera swept through the colony in the mid-1830s, brought by arriving immigrants. Additionally, farms in the Beauce, Chaudi√®re and Richelieu regions (and to a lesser extant, the area around Montreal) were devastated by wheat fly, grasshopper and caterpillar infestations, reducing the food available. Efforts by the French within the Legislative Assembly, led by Louis-Joseph Papineau, the elected leader of the Parti Patriote, to control government spending, were thwarted by the English-dominated Legislative Council of Lower Canada. Further discontent was stimulated when two journalist supporters of Papineau were arrested and jailed after disparaging the Legislative Council in their newspapers. The ensuing riot on May 21, 1832, was quashed when the garrison was called out, ending with three dead. Prolonged aggravation of the economic situation in the province led to growing discontent. Papineau submitted the Ninety-Two Resolutions to the British government with respect to the governance of the province in 1834. A response was sent in 1837 known as the Ten Resolutions which rejected all of Papineau's resolutions. The response of the Patriotes was antagonistic. Large public rallies were held at Saint-Marc- sur-Richelieu, Saint-Hyacinthe, Chambly, Sainte-Scholastique and Montreal. Further rallies held around Montreal drew increased crowds throughout the summer months of 1837. On October 23 a large six-county rally was held at Saint-Charles, where several leaders called for revolt and issued a series of resolutions demanding changes from the government. Violence began with a clash in the streets of Montreal on November 6 between Patriotes and the loyalist Doric Club. The supporters of Papineau formed para-military groups and visible support was seen in Montreal and villages to the east of the city. Sir John Colborne, commander of the military in the Canadian colonies, called out the militia and sent out warrants for arrest of suspected rebels on November 16. Papineau and other Patriote leaders fled Montreal to Saint-Denis in the Richelieu valley. Prelude Map showing the Lake Champlain-River Richelieu watershed = Patriotes = The Patriotes were organized into civil and military wings. The military wing was commanded by Thomas Storrow Brown, a failed merchant from Montreal. The civil wing was organized into six sections, each representing a district and each of which could be armed as a battalion in the event of war. The Patriotes had two headquarters, one in Saint-Denis and the other in Saint-Charles. The Patriotes in Saint-Denis were commanded by Wolfred Nelson. At his disposal were roughly 800 men, of which roughly half were armed with guns. The vast majority of the men were young, though there were some professionals and veterans within the group. To prevent desertion, Nelson threatened to cut the throat of any who ran. On the road from Sorel, Nelson placed overturned wagons and lattices of heavy brushwood. The church and town lay along the riverbank, preventing encirclement. To the other side of the town were woods that thinned as they got closer to Saint-Denis. The largest building in Saint-Denis was an old stone two-storey coach house that was owned by Madame St. Germain, who had moved out. The coach house, with walls thick, commanded the road and Nelson had loopholes cut in the walls. Nelson placed approximately 200 of his men within the house, most equipped with firearms. Around the coach house was situated a cluster of buildings. Nelson set up a second strongpoint at his stone distillery where he placed more of his forces that were equipped with firearms. Those without firearms, most equipped with scythes, pitchforks and clubs, were placed in earthworks behind the church, though some of these did desert before the battle. North of the town the road ran through flat, plowed land, with the Richelieu River running close to the edge of the fields. Beyond the fields were woods in which Nelson placed skirmishers and outposts and had the bridges within broken. The Patriotes had been warned of the British approach during the night, and Nelson sent messengers into the countryside to call upon the inhabitants to defend St-Denis. from the river bank, Papineau and Edmund Bailey O'Callaghan were waiting at Nelson's home. Shortly after the battle began, the two departed for St-Charles. Though his reasons for departure are unknown, some hold that Papineau believed they would fail and fled. His departure created mixed feelings among the Patriotes at all levels of the organization. = Government = The government of Lower Canada was headed by the Earl of Gosford, a civilian governor general. The military was headed by Sir John Colborne, a veteran of the Peninsular War. At Colborne's disposal in Lower Canada were several British infantry regiments. At Quebec City, were the Royal Regiment, 15th, 79th, 83rd Regiments of Foot and elements of the 66th Regiment of Foot. At Montreal, the 32nd Regiment of Foot was posted and at √éle aux Noix and Sorel, further elements of the 66th Regiment were garrisoned. On Saint Helen's Island in the Saint Lawrence River, elements of the Royal Artillery were posted. As events grew more unstable in the territory, Colborne ordered the Royal Regiment to Montreal. Following the riot in Montreal between Thomas Storrow Brown's Soci√©t√© des Fils de la Libert√© and the loyalist Doric Club, Colborne ordered the 24th Regiment of Foot to deploy to Montreal from their garrisons at Toronto and Kingston, Upper Canada. Colborne planned his attack on the Patriote headquarters from two directions. He dispatched Colonel Charles Gore with 300 infantry composed of two companies of the 24th Regiment, one cannon with a detachment of Royal Artillery and members of the Royal Montreal Cavalry, a militia unit. The other force would be commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel George Wetherall of the Royal Regiment, leading three companies of the Royal Regiment, one company of the 66th Regiment and twenty Royal Montreal Cavalry and a Royal Artillery detachment and two guns. Gore was to attack the rebels from the north via Sorel, while Wetherall would attack from the south via Fort Chambly. Battle =March south= On November 22, Gore arrived at Sorel at 18:00. He ordered one company of the 32nd Regiment, four companies of the 24th regiment, an artillery detachment with one 24-pounder gun and a troop of Montreal cavalry to depart. At 22:00, the force of 300 departed Sorel in the freezing rain. Saint-Denis was south of Sorel and the roads were surrounded by woods. The weather changed to rain mixed with snow, turning the roads into mud knee-deep with frozen potholes. At 23:00, a caleche departed Sorel containing an officer of the 32nd regiment carrying orders for Lieutenant-Colonel Gore, which ordered him to await Wetherall's advance. However, roughly down the road, the caleche took a wrong turn and the officer ended up a prisoner of the Patriotes. Taken to Saint-Denis, the officer was later killed trying to escape during the battle. As Gore approached Saint-Denis, skirmishers fired upon the column from the woods before retreating towards town. The British approach was heralded by church bells along the river. Upon arrival at Saint-Denis, Gore had the gun unlimbered and fired one roundshot at the coach house, doing no damage. A strong east wind had taken hold and it had begun snowing. Gore then arranged his forces and moved forward until halting at a coulee. From there he surveyed the town. =Assault= Gore ordered one company to cross the fields, accompanied by the gun, and set up a position at a barn on the right that would keep the gun in range of the coach house while providing some shelter. The company drove the barn's defenders off after a bayonet charge. As the gun was made ready, the position came under fire from the coach house and three gunners were wounded before the cannon could fire its first round. The cannon's first shot went through the second-storey window, killing three Patriotes. The second, third and fourth shots rebounded harmlessly off the walls. The fire coming from the coach house forced the artillerymen to move the cannon to safer position. Gore decided to assault the building after watching the cannon fire rebound off the stone walls of the coach house. He ordered Captain Markham of the 32nd Regiment to lead three companies of roughly 200 men to assault the house. Markham tried three times and by 12:00 had cleared the buildings which surrounded the approach to the coach house. By 13:00, the British troops were in the house across the street from the coach house. However, they came under crossfire from the stone distillery and the coach house. Markham was injured three times, twice in the neck, once in the leg. Markham ordered a withdrawal, himself being carried on a stretcher and by 14:00 the British had withdrawn to the coulee. Around 13:00 Nelson sent George-√âtienne Cartier across the river to collect reinforcements. All the while, the cannon had continued to fire ineffectively though little to no return fire was coming from the second floor of the coach house. Gore made another attempt to take the town, sending his troops on an encircling mission to the left. As the British began making their way through the outbuildings, they encountered the earthworks that were filled with roughly 500 men. The advance lost momentum. At this point Cartier returned with reinforcements numbering roughly 100 and drove at the British right flank. This coincided with a sortie from the coach house and the earthworks. The British retreated once again to the coulee. This time, the Patriotes began to move towards the British position. At 15:00, there remained only 6 rounds for the cannon of the 66 the artillery had brought with them. Gore ordered retreat and at 16:00, the British departed leaving wagons and some wounded behind. However as they reached a bridge, the gun became frozen in the mud and both the horses and the men were unable to free it. Gore was forced to spike the gun and retreat back to Saint-Ours. Aftermath At 00:00 on November 24, Gore stopped at Saint- Ours. The return to Sorel began at dawn and en route to Sorel, they encountered their reinforcements of one infantry company and two guns. Gore ordered all of them to return to Sorel, which they reached at 11:00. The British had suffered six dead, ten wounded and six missing. The Patriotes had suffered twelve dead and seven wounded. Gore returned to Montreal where he received new orders from Colborne and additional troops. In early December, Gore returned to Sorel with his new troops aboard the steamship John Bull and embarked the troops that he had there. Gore attempted to sail down to Saint- Denis, but the river was blocked with ice, and Gore was forced to march. Eight companies of infantry and four guns accompanied Gore on the march. At the site where he had left his cannon (which was still there, frozen in the mud) he was met by a group of villagers bearing a white flag. They claimed that there were no longer Patriotes in the town. Scouts returned to Gore reporting that new barricades and earthworks had been erected, but were incomplete and no defenders were found. Nelson had attempted to fortify Saint-Denis, but after the Patriote rout at the Battle of Saint-Charles, he lost hope and fled to the United States. The British column entered the town and began to search houses. The property of every rebel was to be destroyed. The coach house was blown up with gunpowder and set afire, as was Nelson's house and distillery. In the end, over 50 buildings were burned over two days. On December 4, Gore took five companies and two guns and moved on to Saint-Charles and then on to Saint-Hyacinthe, searching for Papineau. He found that Papineau had fled ahead of the British advance. The following day, Gore returned to Saint-Denis via Saint-Charles, leaving garrisons in both towns. On December 6, Gore departed for Montreal, arriving the following day. The Patriotes suffered a second major defeat at Saint-Eustache which ended the uprising in December 1837. The government troops summarily executed some Patriotes captured at the battles; others that were captured were imprisoned awaiting their fate. Government troops burned several houses and set one entire village on fire following the battles. Some Patriotes which had managed to escape the defeats fled to the United States where they re-mustered under new leadership. They returned better armed the following year and the rebellion erupted again in November 1838. Government troops returned to defeat the Patriotes in a series of battles, and again burned entire areas, along with pillaging and raping. Of the prisoners captured in the rebellion, 25 were hanged and 58 were deported to penal colonies in Australia.

The school was founded in 1929, and is a small, college-preparatory school with of land with 13 year-round and 9 seasonal building structures. The school has a teacher-to-student ratio between 1:6 and 1:10 for most classes, ranking among the top 20 American boarding schools in that category. It has a diverse student body, boasting an international enrollment of over 10%. The school is located on the shore of Lake Michigan just outside Glen Arbor, with the Crystal River running through the property. The Lanphier Observatory, with a Schmidt-Cassegrain reflector telescope, is also located on the grounds. History Leelanau School for Boys was founded in 1929 by William M. \\"Skipper\\" Beals and his wife Cora, n√©e Mautz, faculty members of Principia College, in response to the popularity of their summer camps for Christian Scientist boys. Originally, the school, like the camps, was intended for boys from Christian Science homes.Leelanau for Boys, Winter Session, brochure for first school season 1929-30, p. 1. But while the camps maintain close ties to Christian Science to the present day, the school dropped its official religious denominational focus early on. The Christian Science camps were separated from the school completely in 1987 and continue under separate management. The school weathered the Great Depression and its popularity necessitated the opening of Pinebrook School for Girls in 1940. The two schools grew rapidly after World War II and were eventually combined. Beginning in the early 1930s, Arthur S. ‚ÄúMajor‚Äù Huey became an apprentice to Skipper Beals.See, among other sources, letter from William Beals to Arthur Huey on June 9, 1935 on new letterhead citing Huey as \\"Assistant Director\\"; Huey Family Archive. In partnership with his wife Helen, n√©e Mautz (Cora Beals‚Äô sister), Huey purchased the school after Skipper‚Äôs death in 1942. Privately owned until 1963, the school became a non-profit corporation with a board of directors upon the Hueys‚Äô creation of The Leelanau Schools and Library Foundation, Inc., to which they gave the camps and the school with its present grounds.Articles of incorporation; public record, Huey Family Archive. In 1967 Cora Beals donated the land that became \\"faculty row\\". The non-profit status eased fundraising efforts. The school grounds were exempted from eminent domain associated with the formation of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, which surrounds the campus. At its peak in 1970, the school had 167 enrolled students. School enrollment stabilized at close to 100 students as the 1970s drew to a close. Athletics Traditionally nicknamed Indians, Leelanau students chose to abandon the now-controversial moniker and adopted the name Thunderbirds in 2003 after consultation with members of Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians. It competes as a Class D (smallest of four classes) school in the Michigan High School Athletic Association. In past years, the school fielded teams in cross country, football (until 1975), soccer, volleyball, basketball, alpine skiing, baseball, softball, tennis, golf and track and field, but in recent years has only fielded tennis, golf and volleyball squads. Leelanau was a charter member of the Northwest Conference and garnered most of the Northwest's track titles during its tenure, including every single one in the 1950s, but was forced to leave that organization for the Cherryland Conference when its enrollment dropped in the mid-1970s. Traditional Cherryland rivals include Lake Leelanau St. Mary and Northport. A newer rivalry has begun with Traverse City Christian School since that school's founding in 1995. Leelanau pioneered alpine skiing as a Michigan high school varsity sport during the 1950s and was instrumental in its adoption as an official MHSAA championship sport, but was forced to abandon the sport when the nearby Sugar Loaf Resort closed in 2000. Leelanau was the MHSAA boys' skiing state runner-up (open classification) in 1992, beaten at the state finals only by Traverse City (now Traverse City Central), a school over 30 times larger. Leelanau is by far the smallest school in Michigan ever to place so high in an MHSAA open (unrestricted by enrollment) state championship.

Following the opening Patriote victory of the Lower Canada Rebellion at the Battle of Saint-Denis, British troops under the command of Lieutenant Colonel George Wetherall advanced from the south on the Patriote stronghold of Saint-Charles in the Richelieu valley. On 25 November 1837 they engaged the Patriote forces under the command of Thomas Storrow Brown. After a two-hour battle, the Government of Lower Canada was victorious. Background Within twenty years of the establishment of Lower Canada in 1791, new tracts of land were set aside for settlement by peoples other than French Canadians. The French remained predominantly on the seigneuries located by rivers and the new areas were settled largely by English-speaking British immigrants. The new English-speaking immigrants reaped greater benefits than the existing French communities under the British government. Those French Canadians who were elected to the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada were mainly of the elite educated at Catholic colleges as social movement was restricted by the British who monopolized commerce and government postings. The French Canadian habitants faced diminishing lands to give to their children and competed with the English for the new lands on English terms, with British bureaucracy placing immigrant claims ahead of those of the habitants. Furthermore, outbreaks in dysentery, typhus and cholera swept through the colony in the mid-1830s, brought by arriving immigrants. Additionally, farms in the Beauce, Chaudi√®re and Richelieu regions (and to a lesser extant, the area around Montreal) were devastated by wheat fly, grasshopper and caterpillar infestations, reducing the food available. Efforts by the French within the Legislative Assembly, led by Louis-Joseph Papineau, the elected leader of the Parti Patriote, to control government spending, were thwarted by the English- dominated Legislative Council of Lower Canada. Further discontent was stimulated when two journalist supporters of Papineau were arrested and jailed after disparaging the Legislative Council in their newspapers. The ensuing riot on 21 May 1832 was quashed when the garrison was called out, ending with three dead. With the parliamentary route blocked, Papineau and his allies argued for armed rebellion at an open-air meeting at Saint-Charles and published a declaration of independence. The supporters of Papineau formed para-military groups and visible support was seen in Montreal and villages to the east of the city. Sir John Colborne, commander of the military in the Canadian colonies, called out the militia and sent out warrants for arrest for suspected rebels on 16 November 1837. Papineau and other Patriote leaders fled Montreal to Saint-Denis in the Richelieu valley. Prelude Map showing the Lake Champlain-River Richelieu watershed = Patriotes = The Patriotes were organized into civil and military wings. The military wing was commanded by Thomas Storrow Brown, a failed merchant from Montreal. The civil wing was organized into six sections, each representing a district and each of which could be armed as a battalion in the event of war. The Patriotes had two headquarters, one in Saint-Denis and the other in Saint-Charles. The key to the defence of Saint-Charles was a brick manor house owned by the seigneur Pierre Dominique Debartzch, which was seized on 19 November. Debartzch and his family had been taken prisoner by the Patriotes who had seized the seigneury and sent the family on to Quebec City. The Patriotes, commanded by Brown at Saint-Charles, turned the house into a barracks and a guardhouse holding prisoners of the Patriotes. Around the house, the Patriotes constructed earthen breastworks made up of logs and branches covered in frozen mud and turned the area into a fortified camp. The rampart wall stretched from the river on the western flank of Saint-Charles in towards the main road, with the manor house on its eastern flank. Neither the manor house or the breastwork supported each other. Brown smashed bridges and felled trees along the road south. Saint-Charles became the centre of Patriote resistance, with hundreds flocking to the site. Brown however, only had about 50 rifles to hand out to the volunteers. Brown's total force was roughly 200‚Äì250 men within the camp or on picket duty. = Government = The government of Lower Canada was headed by the Earl of Gosford, a civilian governor general. The military was headed by Sir John Colborne, a veteran of the Peninsular War. At Colborne's disposal in Lower Canada were several British infantry regiments. At Quebec City, were the Royal Regiment, 15th, 79th, 83rd Regiments of Foot and elements of the 66th Regiment of Foot. At Montreal, the 32nd Regiment of Foot was posted and at √éle aux Noix and Sorel, further elements of the 66th Regiment were garrisoned. On Saint Helen's Island in the Saint Lawrence River, elements of the Royal Artillery were posted. As events grew more unstable in the territory, Colborne ordered the Royal Regiment to Montreal. Following the riot in Montreal between Thomas Storrow Brown's Soci√©t√© des Fils de la Libert√© and the loyalist Doric Club, Colborne ordered the 24th Regiment of Foot to deploy to Montreal from their garrisons at Toronto and Kingston, Upper Canada. Colborne planned his attack on the Patriote headquarters from two directions. He dispatched Colonel Charles Gore with 300 infantry composed of two companies of the 24th Regiment, one cannon with a detachment of Royal Artillery and members of the Royal Montreal Cavalry, a militia unit. The other force would be commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel George Wetherall of the Royal Regiment leading three companies of the Royal Regiment, one company of the 66th Regiment and twenty Royal Montreal Cavalry under Captain El√©azar David and a Royal Artillery detachment led by Captain John Glasgow and two guns. Gore was to attack the rebels from the north via Sorel, while Wetherall would attack from the south via Fort Chambly. Gore was the first to engage the rebels, and was defeated at the Battle of Saint-Denis on 23 November. Battle =The march north= At dusk on 22 November, a force under Lieutenant Colonel George Wetherall crossed the Richelieu River, beginning their march north. On 16 November, warrants for the arrest of the leaders of the Patriotes were issued by Sir John Colborne and at 07:00 on 18 November, a force led by Lt. Col. Wetherall departed Fort Chambly moving north towards Saint-Charles. Wetherall's force moved towards Chambly and as the column arrived, it was met by a group of roughly forty men which scattered upon taking sight of the British. Wetherall then paused at Chambly, to await further instructions from Colborne. From 18 to 22 November, Wetherall waited at Chambly for orders and a break in the weather. At dusk on 22 November, Wetherall's force crossed the Richelieu River to its western bank and began its march north. On 23 November, Wetherall halted his force at 03:00, only moving again at daybreak as far as Saint-Hilaire before stopping again at 12:00. The force paused at Saint- Hilaire, awaiting news of the northern force. At 00:00 on 24 November, news arrived of Gore's defeat. During this time at Saint-Hilaire, Colborne had sent messengers to Wetherall ordering him to withdraw, but both messengers were intercepted by the Patriotes. After receiving the news of the defeat, Wetherall sent a messenger back to Fort Chambly ordering his reserve of one grenadier company of the Royal Regiment to join him. To speed their travel, the company floated down the Richelieu River on scows. Wetherall remained at Saint-Hilaire until 25 November after his reinforcements arrived. Then, at 09:00, the column began marching north again. Wetherall's total force at this time was 406 regular infantry, 20 militia cavalry and 2 cannon. On 24 November, Brown at Saint-Charles received offers from Wolfred Nelson, the victorious Patriote commander at the Battle of Saint-Denis and from √âlisee Mailhot and Cyrille C√¥t√©, commanders of the large Patriote force at Saint- Mathias-sur-Richelieu. Nelson offered Brown 300 men and two cannon. Mailhot and C√¥t√© offered reinforcements. Brown turned down both offers, believing himself capable of defying the British with the forces he had. = Arrival at Saint-Charles = As Lieutenant Colonel Wetherall marched his forces north towards Saint-Charles, he encounters smashed bridges and small arms fire from Patriotes. As Wetherall marched north, he encountered smashed bridges and Patriotes firing upon him from both sides of the Richelieu River as the road neared the shoreline. At 13:00, the column came under fire for the first time from roadside houses and barns. These skirmishers, under the command of Bonaventure Viger, were deployed on both sides of the streams along the road, as well as the woods and buildings along the road. Meanwhile, Brown had constructed rail fences roughly south of Debartzch manor house. The Patriote picket fire wounded one Royal Regiment soldier, leading Wetherall to order the burning of the houses and barns along the road. As Wetherall continued north, the pickets retreated back to the fortified camp at Saint-Charles. Upon reaching Saint-Charles Wetherall deployed his troops with his two cannon out front. Brown, on the other hand, had not developed a competent command structure and was unaware of the arrival of Wetherall's force. The lack of a competent Patriote command structure forced Brown to oversee everything and at the time of Wetherall's arrival was reported to have been \\"attending the baking of bread\\" and \\"arranging food to be taken to the camp.\\" Brown only became aware of Wetherall's arrival when one of the cannon fired a ball that struck the steeple of the church in Saint-Charles. Wetherall changed the disposition of his forces when he reached Brown's barricades. He placed his cannon slightly east of the road. A small unit was left to the west of the guns, and the rest was moved east of the gun position. Brown ordered a group of his men under the command of Henri-Alphonse Gauvin to a position behind a wood fence south of the fortified camp that had a ditch below it. From there, the group was able to fire upon Wetherall's advance force. At this point, Wetherall offered terms to Brown, where he would not harm anyone if he was allowed to just pass through. Brown replied that he would allow Wetherall to pass only if the infantry laid down their arms. However, the response took too long to return and Wetherall ordered his forces to begin their assault. =Assault= Lieutenant Colonel Wetherall's forces engaged Patriotes at Saint-Charles. As Gauvin's Patriotes fired on Wetherall's advance force, Captain John Glasgow's guns fired grapeshot and canister shot in reply. Brown was unhorsed by the cannon fire, and once back in the saddle, fled for Saint- Denis. Wetherall's infantry were ordered to move forward to the wooden fence. The Patriotes defensive fire forced the British infantry to lie down for protection. The Patriotes then retreated back to the breastworks. Wetherall's infantry moved forward to secure the abandoned Patriote position at the fence. As Wetherall's units east of the road exchanged fire with the Patriotes, the small unit west of the road moved to seize a hill that dominated both the breastworks and the manor house. Within fifteen minutes of the opening shots, the hill had been taken and the guns re-situated there, able to fire directly into the Patriote positions below. A party of Patriotes under Rodolphe Desrivi√®res had been ordered to the rear to stop the civilians from fleeing. Desrivi√®res had circled around the British right flank and began firing on the infantry at the fence from the woods. The British infantry attempted to storm Desrivi√®res' position but were forced back to the fence. During this action, Wetherall's horse was shot from underneath him. Two other officers had their horses shot from beneath them. After two hours, Wetherall ordered his three central companies to fix bayonets and attack the fortified camp directly. As they charged the breastworks, they made short work of the abatis that the Patriotes had constructed, being only high. The three companies of the Royal Regiment broke through Patriote defences at the breastworks and entered the camp. By the end of the fighting, at least 56 Patriotes lay dead and more wounded and captured while the British suffered 3 dead and 18 wounded. Aftermath Following the battle, Wetherall had all the buildings of the fortified camp burned with the exception of the Debartzch manor house. 25 Patriotes were captured and imprisoned in the church at Saint-Charles. Brown, upon reaching Saint-Denis, was relieved of his command by the victor at the Battle of Saint-Denis, Wolfred Nelson. Wetherall remained at Saint-Charles until 27 November. His force then began the march south, dispersing an attack at the Chambly ferry on 28 November. On 30 November, Wetherall arrived at Montreal with 30 Patriote prisoners. Colonel Gore would return to Saint-Denis in early December to find the town abandoned by the Patriotes. Following the defeat at Saint-Charles, the 1,000-strong Patriote force at Saint-Mathias melted away. Nelson attempted to fortify Saint-Denis, but seeing failing support, departed with his lieutenants for the United States. The Patriotes suffered a second major defeat at Saint-Eustache which ended the uprising in December 1837. The government troops summarily executed some Patriotes captured at the battles, others that were captured were imprisoned awaiting their fate. Government troops burned several houses and set one entire village on fire following the battles. Some Patriotes which had managed to escape the defeats fled to the United States where they re-mustered under new leadership. They would return with better arms the following year and in November 1838, the rebellion would erupt again. Government troops would return and defeat the Patriotes in a series of battles. Government troops would again burn entire areas, along with pillaging and raping. Of the prisoners captured in the rebellion, 25 were hanged and 58 were deported to penal colonies in Australia.

He was the son of Solomon ibn Labi de la Caballeria of Zaragoza and assumed the name of \\"Micer Pedro\\" upon converting to Christianity. From his early youth he devoted himself to the study of Hebrew, Arabic and Latin languages, and gradually acquired a profound knowledge of civil and Canon law. He won the favor of Queen Maria, who appointed him commissioner of the Cortes which convened at Monz√≥n and Alca√±iz (1436‚Äì37); and all the liberties and privileges which the Caballeria family had enjoyed for a long time were confirmed to him and his descendants. Caballeria was twice married: first (before his conversion) to the former wife of Luis de Sant√°ngel, who obstinately resisted baptism, and then to Violente, a daughter of the wealthy Alfonso Ruiz of Daroca, who, like Caballeria, was a convert to Christianity. In 1450, Micer Pedro began his Zelus Christi Contra Jud√¶os et Sarracenos, a book full of malevolence against his former coreligionists. This work, upon which he was engaged for fourteen years, was published at Bologna in 1592 by Martin Alfonso Vivaldo, who added numerous annotations showing his hostility to the Jewish race. Soon after the completion of this work, in which he falsely accused the Jews of every imaginable vice, branding them as a cursed seed and a hypocritical, pestilential, and abandoned race, Pedro was murdered (1464), the deed having been committed, it is believed, at the instigation of Marranos. All the sons of Pedro occupied high positions in Aragon; Alfonso being vice-chancellor, Luis confidential adviser of King John, and Jaime counselor and confidential adviser of Don Ferdinand, accompanying the latter on his first visit to Naples, and traveling by his side in princely splendor. Nevertheless, Jaime in 1504, became a victim of the Inquisition, and was sentenced at Zaragoza. Another member of the family, Martin de la Caballeria, was invested with the command of the fleet at Majorca.

Its inhabitants are called Caden√©tiens. Geography Cadenet is a village located on the southern slopes of the Luberon Massif, overlooking the valley of the Durance. It is 57 km southeast of Avignon, 59 km north of Marseille and 616 km as the crow flies from Paris. =Access= It is accessed from Lourmarin to the north by county (d√©partemental) main road 943. Secondary county road 973 crosses the south of the village on an east‚Äìwest axis and allows it to connect to Lauris to the west, and runs east to Villelaure and Pertuis. County roads 43, 59, 118 and 139 also pass through the town. A railway runs through the town on an east‚Äìwest axis across the plains at the south end of the village. This is the line of the Cheval-Blanc in Pertuis. =Relief and Geology= The village is situated on a hill overlooking the valley of the Durance, on the southern Luberon Massif, in mountainous terrain formed during the Early Cretaceous period. Several other hills lie to the east, including Castellar. The alluvial plains of the Durance lie to the south. The town lies on the perimeter of the Luberon Geological Nature Reserve because of the proximity to exceptional fossil sites. History =Jewish community= Like all places situated along the river Durance, Cadenet had a Jewish community in the Middle Ages. A document of the year 1283 states that this community, together with those of Aix-en-Provence, Saint-Maximin, Lambesc, Pertuis, Istres, Trets, and Lanson, was permitted to have a synagogue and a cemetery on paying an annual tax of two pounds of pepper to the archbishop of Aix. In 1385 a remarkable lawsuit arose in Arles, relating to an alleged marriage. The plaintiff was Maestro Duran of Cadenet. In order to be revenged on Meirona, daughter of En Salves Cassin of Arles, who had refused him, Duran declared that he had married her in the presence of two witnesses, Vidal Abraham of Bourrin and Bonfilh or Bonfils Cr√©gud. These witnesses were later convicted of perjury. The case was taken in turn before the rabbinical colleges of Arles, N√Æmes, Montpellier, and Perpignan, and in the last instance, upon the demand of Don Salemias Nasi of Valence, was submitted to R. Isaac ben Sheshet, who pronounced severe judgment against Duran and his fellow-conspirators, and bitterly reproached the community of Arles that it had not done its utmost to prevent such a scandal from becoming public. A Jew, Mosson of Cadenet by name, lived at Carpentras in 1404; and two others, Salvet of Cadenet and Vidalon of Cadenet, were sheriffs of that community in 1460.

Biography Ernest von Koerber was born in Trento, Tyrol, Austrian Empire, in a German speaking family, the son of a Gendarmerie officer. Koerber attended the elite Theresianum boarding school in Vienna and, having obtained his Matura degree, went on to study law at the University of Vienna. He became extremely involved in Austrian culture and politics. The study of the Rechtsstaat (\\"legal state\\") doctrine, or constitutionality and civil rights was popular during Koerber's teen years and Koerber and his constitutionally-minded peers such as Sieghart, Steinbach, Baernreither, and Redlich learned and immersed themselves in this principle. Political career Koerber‚Äôs knowledge of government was apparent when in 1874 he launched his career in the civil service, entering the Austrian Ministry of Commerce. In 1895 he was appointed general manager of the Imperial Royal Austrian State Railways and obtained the honorific title of a Geheimrat the following year. By 1897 Koerber was a member of the Imperial Council parliament of Cisleithania (i.e. the 'Austrian' portion of Austria- Hungary) and Commerce Minister. At this time, after the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, there were separate internal governments for the Austrian lands and the Kingdom of Hungary. Two years later in 1899, Koerber rose to the position of Austrian Minister of the Interior. In 1900, Emperor Franz Joseph asked Koerber to create a cabinet and serve as Prime Minister. This was by far the most influential position of Koerber‚Äôs career. Koerber served in this capacity until the end of 1904. = First Koerber cabinet = From the beginning of his term in office, Minister-President Koerber encountered many difficulties. Within the multinational Dual Monarchy, he had full authority only over the Cisleithania crown lands. Furthermore, the Imperial Council parliament was politically weak. In order to make major liberal reforms Koerber depended largely on Article 14, a provision in the December Constitution which allowed the Emperor to issue an ‚Äúemergency regulation‚Äù for any necessary purposes. The meetings of the Imperial Council quickly transformed into forums for Koerber to bargain with party leaders.Taylor , A. J. P. The Habsburg Monarchy. Hamish Hamilton, London 1966 Minister-President Koerber in office, 1901 Koerber‚Äôs tenure in office was also marked by rising national tensions within Austria-Hungary. The Dual Monarchy dissipated any sense of allegiance to a single crown. The various ethnic groups resented one another and it became apparent that most government actions would leave at least one offended group. In military matters, Koerber opposed providing the Hungarian portion of the Austro-Hungarian Army (the Royal Hungarian Honv√©d) with its own artillery units. While the emperor advocated such a policy, Koerber sided with crown prince Archduke Franz Ferdinand against it, stating that the principle of parity would require the Imperial-Royal Landwehr to also have artillery, which Austria could not afford.Rothenburg, G. The Army of Francis Joseph. West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 1976. p 133. Even education was a controversial aspect within the monarchy. The Italians in the Habsburg lands of Tyrol and the Littoral could no longer get a university education within the borders of Austria after it lost Venetia in 1866. Koerber sought to fix this problem and presented a draft law establishing an Italian university. However widespread disapproval from Germans culminated in riots during the aborted inauguration of the first course, to be opened in Innsbruck in November 1904 This forced the government to abandon this project.Held, Joseph; Winters, Stanley B., Intellectual and Social Developments in the Habsburg Empire. From Maria Theresa to World War I. Columbia University Press, NYC 1975 Koerber also attempted to institute a ‚ÄúNational University‚Äù with German as the language of teaching but the Italians and Slavs protested this plan. Koerber pursued reform for the infrastructure of the country, particularly railways and canals. These expansive reforms known as the Koerber-Plan were made in efforts to appease the Imperial Council and create a sense of regionalism with non-controversial government reforms. Despite Koerber's efforts, these changes did not provide the reaction he expected and attention once again shifted towards the nationality question.Cornwall, Mark. The Last Years of Austria-Hungary; a Multi-National Experiment in Early Twentieth-Century Europe. University of Exeter Press 2002. p. 42 Additionally, Koerber aimed to promote the industrial and communications sectors. He abolished censorship of the press. Koerber believed this would benefit the changing and expansive monarchy. Koerber also exhibited his liberal ideology by reducing the harsh persecution of Social Democrats, allowing them to organize openly in Austria. This was a tremendous stride in individual rights. Coupled with these strategies was Koerber's economic savvy. Koerber got the Imperial Council to enact his 1902 economic development program without resorting to Article 14.Okey, Robin. The Habsburg Monarchy. Palgrave Macmillan 2001, p. 348. But once again, it was to no avail. Many historians believe that Koerber‚Äôs emphasis on economic matters over national issues made his administration highly unpopular. Ethnic hostilities ensued despite his attempts at reform. The lack of transition within the state diminished Koerber's dreams and he eventually resigned from office on 31 December 1904, officially on health grounds. Koerber was succeeded by Paul Gautsch von Frankenthurn, Minister of Education.  Second Koerber cabinet  Koerber returned to the spotlight during World War I. From 7 February 1915 to 28 October 1916, he served as Austro-Hungarian Finance Minister (one of three k.u.k common ministries which served both countries). In the ongoing discussions on the goals of the war, Koerber strictly opposed Foreign Minister Stephan Buri√°n's ideas to annex Russian Congress Poland (Vistula Land), stating that it could further weaken the cohesion and political balance of the Dual Monarchy. After the Austrian minister-president Count Karl von St√ºrgkh was assassinated by Friedrich Adler on 21 October 1916, aged Emperor Franz Joseph quickly recalled Koerber to return as his successor. Many had hoped that Koerber would modify the tyrannical system that had developed during wartime.Kann, Robert. A History of the Habsburg Empire 1526-1918. University of California Press, London 1974 However, after Franz Joseph's death on November 21, Koerber came into conflict with the new emperor, Charles I, and did not make such changes. In fact, the constant disputes made it difficult for Koerber to get anything accomplished. Koerber still held out hope that Austria and Hungary were able to unite, both politically and socially. Charles I, however, continued to take measures that would hinder this progress. Koerber, an aged man by this point, decided he could no longer take these differences. His resignation was caused by several issues, the most important of which was his belief that the planned convocation of the Austrian parliament was premature, but Charles I wanted to present himself as a constitutional monarch as soon as possible. Furthermore, he objected to what he considered to be too extensive concessions to Hungary in the new compromise, whereas the emperor did not want to risk jeopardizing the relationship with Hungary.Kann, Robert. A History of the Habsburg Empire 1526-1918. University of California Press, London 1974, p. 489 A few weeks later, on December 13, Koerber officially retired from office and was succeeded by Heinrich Clam-Martinic. He died shortly after the end of the war, on 5 March 1919, in Baden, a spa town near Vienna. Support for Zionism Koerber was a friend and supporter of Theodor Herzl. He was impressed by his Zionist project and assured Herzl that he would stand behind him in his endeavors to win a charter for Jewish settlement in Palestine.Germany, Turkey and Zionism, 1897-1918, Isaiah Friedman  References   Further reading  * Roman, Eric.

A dispute exists over the legitimacy of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The debate centers around the question whether the invasion was an unprovoked assault on an independent country that may have breached international law, or if the United Nations Security Council authorized the invasion (whether the conditions set in place after the Gulf War allowed the resumption if Iraq did not uphold to the Security Council resolutions). Those arguing for its legitimacy often point to Congressional Joint Resolution 114 and UN Security Council resolutions, such as Resolution 1441 and Resolution 678.\\"International Law and the War in Iraq,\\" John Yoo.

The American Journal of International Law, Vol. 97, No. 3 (Jul., 2003), pp. 553-563 , Those arguing against its legitimacy also cite some of the same sources, stating they do not actually permit war but instead lay out conditions that must be met before war can be declared. Furthermore, the Security Council may only authorise the use of force against an \\"aggressor\\" in the interests of preserving peace, whereas the 2003 invasion of Iraq was not provoked by any aggressive military action. There is a heated debate regarding whether the invasion was launched with the explicit authorization of the United Nations Security Council. The Government of the United States asserts that the invasion was explicitly authorized by Security Council Resolution 678 and thus complies with international law. There is no debate that Security Council Resolution 678 authorizes UN Member States \\"to use all necessary means to uphold and implement Resolution 660 and all subsequent relevant resolutions and to restore international peace and security in the area\\", only debate about what that resolution actually means. The only legal jurisdiction to find \\"aggression\\" or to find the invasion illegal rests with the Security Council under United Nations Charter Articles 39-42. The Security Council met in 2003 for two days, reviewed the legal claims involved, and elected to be \\"seized of the matter\\".Patrick McLaren, Settling the Score with Saddam: Resolution 1441 and Parallel Justifications for the Use of Force against Iraq (2003) 13 Duke Journal of Comparative and International Law 233 (Lexis)Bill Campbell and Chris Moraitis, 'Memorandum of Advice to the Commonwealth Government on the Use of Force against Iraq' (2003) 4 Melbourne Journal of International Law 178. The Security Council has not reviewed these issues since 2003. The public debate, however, continues. Former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan expressed his opinion that the invasion of Iraq was \\"not in conformity with the UN charter [...] from the charter point of view, [the invasion] was illegal.\\" (See Legality of the Iraq War)  Saddam's record  While in power, Saddam Hussein invaded Iran in 1980 and began the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, which lasted until 1988. Iraq's invasion was backed by the United States who funneled over $5 billion to support Saddam's party and sold Iraq hundreds of millions of dollars worth of military equipment. During the war, Hussein used chemical weapons on at least 10 occasions, including attacks against civilians. In 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait and began the Persian Gulf War. After the ceasefire agreement was signed between Saddam and the UN in 1991, which suspended the hostilities of the Gulf War, Iraq repeatedly violated 16 different UNSC resolutions from 1990 to 2002. The Iraq Survey Group interviewed regime officials who stated Hussein kept weapon scientists employed and planned to revive Iraq's WMD program after the inspections were lifted, including nuclear weapons. Under UN Resolution 1441, he was given a \\"final opportunity\\" to comply, and he again violated the resolution by submitting a false report to UNMOVIC inspectors and continually preventing them from inspecting Iraq's WMD sites. During the Gulf War, Iraq took foreign civilians hostage on an unprecedented scale. Hussein attempted to use terrorism against the United States during the Gulf War and against former President George H.W. Bush in Kuwait in 1993 for leading the Gulf War against him. He had a long history of supporting terrorists in Palestine by giving money to families of suicide bombers and gave refuge to other terrorist groups against neighboring states in the region. In 1988 the Al-Anfal Campaign took place in Iraqi Kurdistan, and was carried out by the cousin of Saddam Hussein, Ali Hassan al-Majid. A document signed by Ali Hassan al-Majid is quoted as stating, \\"all persons captured in those villages shall be detained and interrogated by the security services and those between the ages of 15 and 70 shall be executed after any useful information has been obtained from them\\". This target group covered any male of fighting age. In 1991 after the Iraqi forces were expelled from Kuwait, the regime of Saddam Hussein cracked down on uprisings in the Kurdish north and Shia south. It is stated between this time over 40,000 Kurds and 60,000 or more Shi'ites were executed. In 2000, two human rights groups, International Federation of Human Rights Leagues and the Coalition for Justice in Iraq, released a joint report documenting the indoctrination of children into a fighting force. These children as young as five were recruited into the Ashbal Saddam or Saddam's Cubs. The children would be separated from their parents and undergo military training. Parents objecting to this recruitment would be executed and children jailed if they failed to comply. These jails were later noted by Scott Ritter in an interview with Time magazine. Vice President Cheney stated in 2006 that the U.S. would still have invaded Iraq even if intelligence had shown that there were no weapons of mass destruction. He said Hussein was still dangerous because of his history of using WMD, and taking him out of power \\"was the right thing to do\\". According to Donald Rumsfeld, Saddam Hussein was giving $25,000 to the families of suicide bombers who were aggressive toward Israel.  United Nations  Tomahawk cruise missile (TLAM) is fired from an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer during the fourth wave of attacks on Iraq in support of Operation Desert Fox As part of the 1991 Gulf War ceasefire agreement, the Iraqi government agreed to Security Council Resolution 687, which called for weapons inspectors to search locations in Iraq for chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, as well as weapons that exceed an effective distance of 150 kilometres. After the passing of resolution 687, thirteen additional resolutions (699, 707, 715, 949, 1051, 1060, 1115, 1134, 1137, 1154, 1194, 1205, 1284) were passed by the Security Council reaffirming the continuation of inspections, or citing Iraq's failure to comply fully with them. On September 9, 1998 the Security Council passed resolution 1194 which unanimously condemns Iraq's suspension of cooperation with UNSCOM, one month later on October 31 Iraq officially declares it will cease all forms of interaction with UNSCOM. The period between October 31, 1998 and the initiation of Operation Desert Fox (December 16, 1998), contained talks by the Iraqi government with the United Nations Security Council. During these talks Iraq attempted to attach conditions to the work of UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy Agency, which was against previous resolutions calling for unconditional access. The situation was defused after Iraq's Ambassador to the U.N., Nizar Hamdoon, submitted a third letter stating the position of the Iraqi government on October 31 was \\"void\\". After weapons inspections resumed, UNSCOM requested arms documents related to weapon usage and destruction during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. The Iraqi government rejected this request because it was handwritten and did not fall within the scope of the UN mandate. The UN inspectors insisted in order to know if Iraq destroyed all of its weapons, it had to know \\"the total holdings of Iraq's chemical weapons.\\" Further incidents erupted as Iraqi officials demanded \\"lists of things and materials\\" being searched for during surprise inspections. On December 16, 1998, U.S. President Bill Clinton initiated Operation Desert Fox based on Iraq's failure to fully comply with the inspectors. Clinton noted the announcement made by the Iraqi government on October 31, stating they would no longer cooperate with UNSCOM. Also noted was the numerous efforts to hinder UNSCOM officials, including prevention of photographing evidence and photocopying documents, as well as prevention of interviewing Iraqi personnel. Excerpt from Donald Rumsfeld memo dated Nov 27 2001 Inspection teams were withdrawn before the Operation Desert Fox bombing campaign and did not return for four years. The United Nations no-fly zone enforced by the United States, United Kingdom and France‚Äîalso legality disputed‚Äîbecame a location of constant exchange of fire since Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan instructed Iraqi military to attack all planes in the no-fly zone. A memo written by US Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld dated Nov 27, 2001 considers a US invasion of Iraq. One section of the memo questions \\"How start?\\", listing multiple possible justifications for a US-Iraq War, one scenario being \\"Dispute over WMD inspections‚ÄîStart thinking now about inspection demands\\" In late 2002, after international pressure and more UN Resolutions, Iraq allowed inspection teams back into the country. In 2003, UNMOVIC was inspecting Iraq but were ordered out. There is no credible evidence of WMD production (see Duelfer Report) and no WMDs have been found to date after 1991 (See below and WMD in Iraq). George W. Bush has since admitted that \\"much of the intelligence turned out to be wrong\\". The United States offered intelligence from the Central Intelligence Agency and British MI5 to the United Nations Security Council suggesting that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. The U.S. claimed that justification rested upon Iraq's violation of several U.N. Resolutions, most recently UN Security Council Resolution 1441. U.S. president George W. Bush claimed Iraq's WMDs posed a significant threat to the United States and its allies. An inspection team UNMOVIC, before completing its UN-mandate or completing its report was ordered out by the UN because the US-led invasion appeared imminent. = Weapons of mass destruction = Colin Powell holding a model vial of anthrax while giving a presentation to the United Nations Security Council. In the past, Iraq had been supplied with chemical weapons and the technology to develop them by Germany, France, United States and the United Kingdom. Saddam used these weapons against Iranian forces in the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, and against Kurdish civilians in the Iraqi town of Halabja. In 1990 during the Gulf War Saddam had the opportunity to use these weapons, but chose not to. One of the noted reasons is the Iraqi forces' lack of up to date equipment to protect themselves from the effects, as well as the speed with which the US forces traversed the open desert. From 1991‚Äì1998 UNSCOM inspected Iraq and worked to locate and destroy WMD stockpiles. The team was replaced in 1999 with the United Nations Monitoring Verification and Inspection Commission, UNMOVIC. In 2002, Scott Ritter, a former UNSCOM weapons inspector, heavily criticized the Bush administration and the news media for relying on the testimony of alleged Iraqi nuclear scientist and defector Khidir Hamza as a rationale for invading Iraq. No militarily significant WMDs have been found in Iraq since the invasion, although several degraded chemical munitions dating to before 1991 have been. On June 21, 2006 a report was released through the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, stating that since 2003, approximately 500 degraded chemical munitions have been discovered dating from before 1991 in Iraq, and \\"likely more will be recovered.\\" The weapons are filled \\"most likely\\" with Sarin and Mustard Gas. However, the U.S. Department of Defense states that these weapons were not in usable condition, and that \\"these are not the WMDs this country and the rest of the world believed Iraq had, and not the WMDs for which this country went to war.\\" In January 2006, The New York Times reported that \\"A high-level intelligence assessment by the Bush administration concluded in early 2002 that the sale of uranium from Niger to Iraq was 'unlikely.'\\" The Iraqi government denied the existence of any such facilities or capabilities and called the reports lies and fabrications, which was backed by the post-war prima facie case that no WMDs were evident or found. President George Bush, surrounded by leaders of the House and Senate, announces the Joint Resolution to Authorize the Use of United States Armed Forces Against Iraq, October 2, 2002. Former CIA officials have stated that the White House knew before the invasion that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction, but had decided to attack Iraq and continue to use the WMD story as a false pretext for launching the war. The leaked Downing Street Memo, an internal summary of a meeting between British defense and intelligence officials, states that Bush Administration had decided to attack Iraq and to \\"fix intelligence\\" to support the WMD pretext to justify it. A transcript of a secret conversation between President Bush and PM Blair leaked by a government whistleblower reveals that the US and UK were prepared to invade Iraq even if no WMD were found. (see also the Downing Street Memorandum) British officials in the memo also discuss a proposal by President Bush to provoke Iraq, including using fake UN planes, to manufacture a pretext for the invasion he had already decided on. Best evidence of that false intelligence has been Niger uranium story because on March 14, 2003 (before the invasion) it became public knowledge that president Tandja Mamadou's signatory had been forged. In 2004 the Butler Commission Report concluded that, \\"on the basis of the intelligence assessments at the time,\\" statements by the British Government \\"on Iraqi attempts to buy uranium from Africa\\" were \\"well-founded.\\" Opponents however consider the Butler Review a whitewash which lacked cross-party support (the panel was appointed by, and reported directly to, the Prime Minister). The Iraq Intelligence Commission rejected claims that the Bush administration attempted to influence the intelligence community's pre-war assessments of Iraq's weapons programs, but it did not investigate whether the administration misled the public about the intelligence. Paul R. Pillar, a 28-year veteran of the CIA, wrote in Foreign Affairs that \\"the method of investigation used by [these] panels‚Äîessentially, asking analysts whether their arms had been twisted‚Äîwould have caught only the crudest attempts at politicization: Pillar holds that intelligence was \\"misused to justify decisions already made\\". Regime documents captured inside Iraq by coalition forces are reported to reveal Saddam's frustration with weapon inspections. Meeting transcripts record him saying to senior aides: \\"We don't have anything hidden!\\" He questions whether inspectors would \\"roam Iraq for 50 years\\". \\"When is this going to end?\\" he remarks. He tells his deputies in another: \\"Don't think for a minute that we still have WMD. We have nothing.\\" One-time adviser to Saddam Hussein, General Georges Sada maintains the Iraqi leadership ordered the removal of WMD from Iraq to Syria before the 2003 invasion, in spite of the findings by the Iraq Survey Group. Sada was exiled from Iraq in 1991, precluding him from having any first-hand knowledge of any such action, and he has provided no evidence to substantiate his claims. The final report on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, issued by Charles Duelfer, concluded in April 2005 that the hunt for weapons of mass destruction had \\"gone as far as feasible\\" and found nothing. However, Duelfer reported though that the search for WMD material turned up nothing that his team was \\"unable to rule out unofficial movement of limited WMD-related materials\\"  Countries supporting and opposing the invasion  State positions on the Iraq War Support for the invasion and occupation of Iraq included 49 nations, a group that was frequently referred to as the \\"coalition of the willing\\". These nations provided combat troops, support troops, and logistical support for the invasion. The nations contributing combat forces during the initial invasion were, roughly: Total 297,384 ‚Äì 99% US & UK The United States (250,000 84%), the United Kingdom (45,000 15%), Australia (2,000 0.6%), Denmark (200 0.06%), and Poland (184 0.06%), these totals do not include the 50,000+ Iraqi Kurdish soldiers that assisted the coalition. Ten other countries offered small numbers of non-combat forces, mostly either medical teams and specialists in decontamination. In several of these countries a majority of the public was opposed to the war. For example, in Spain polls reported at one time a 90% opposition to the war. In most other countries less than 10% of the populace supported an invasion of Iraq without a specific go-ahead from the UN. According to a mid-January 2003 telephone poll, approximately one-third of the U.S. population supported a unilateral invasion by the US and its allies, while two-thirds supported war if directly authorized by the U.N. Global protests expressed opposition to the invasion. In many Middle Eastern and Islamic countries there were mass protests, as well as in Europe. On the government level, the war was criticized by Canada, Belgium, Chile, Russia, France, the People's Republic of China, Germany, Switzerland, the Vatican, India, Iraq, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Brazil, Mexico, the Arab League, the African Union and many others. Though many nations opposed the war, no foreign government openly supported Saddam Hussein, and none volunteered any assistance to the Iraqi side. Leading traditional allies of the U.S. who had supported Security Council Resolution 1441, France, Germany and Russia, emerged as a united front opposed to the U.S.-led invasion, urging that the UN weapons inspectors be given time to complete their work. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud said the U.S. military could not use Saudi Arabia's soil in any way to attack Iraq. After ten years of U.S. presence in Saudi Arabia, cited among reasons by Saudi-born Osama bin Laden for his al-Qaeda attacks on America on September 11, 2001, most of U.S. forces were withdrawn in 2003. According to the New York Times, the invasion secretly received support from Saudi Arabia.  Legality of the invasion  The legality of the invasion and occupation of Iraq has been widely debated. The then United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in September 2004 that: \\"From our point of view and the UN Charter point of view, it [the war] was illegal.\\" The Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court reported in February 2006 that he had received 240 communications in connection with the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 which alleged that various war crimes had been committed. The political leaders of the US and UK at the time argued that the war was legal, and that existing UN Security Council resolutions related to the first Persian Gulf War and the subsequent ceasefire (660, 678), and to later inspections of Iraqi weapons programs (1441), had already authorized the invasion. Critics of the invasion have challenged both of these assertions, arguing that an additional Security Council resolution, which the US and UK failed to obtain, would have been necessary to specifically authorize the invasion. The Iraq Inquiry in the UK later found that the legal basis for the law was questionable. The UN Security Council, as outlined in Article 39 of the UN Charter, theoretically has the ability to rule on the legality of the war, but the US and the UK have veto power in the Security Council, so action is highly improbable even if the issue were to be raised. Despite this, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) may ask that the International Court of Justice (ICJ)‚Äî\\"the principal judicial organ of the United Nations\\" (Article 92)‚Äîgive either an 'advisory opinion' or 'judgement' on the legality of the war. Indeed, the UNGA asked the ICJ to give an 'advisory opinion' on \\"the legal consequences arising from the construction of the wall being built by Israel\\", by its resolution A/RES/ES-10/14,UNGA Emergency Special Sessions. UN.org. as recently as 12 December 2003; despite opposition from permanent members of the Security Council. It achieved this by sitting in tenth 'emergency special session', under the framework of the 'Uniting for Peace' resolution. The ICJ had previously found against the US for its actions in Nicaragua, a finding the US refused to comply with.  Opposition view of the invasion  Those who opposed the war in Iraq did not regard Iraq's violation of UN resolutions to be a valid case for the war, since no single nation has the authority, under the UN Charter, to judge Iraq's compliance to UN resolutions and to enforce them. Furthermore, critics argued that the US was applying double standards of justice, noting that other nations such as Israel are also in breach of UN resolutions and have nuclear weapons. Giorgio Agamben, the Italian philosopher, has offered a critique of the logic of preemptive war. Although Iraq was known to have pursued an active nuclear weapons development program previously, as well as to have tried to procure materials and equipment for their manufacture, these weapons and material have yet to be discovered. President Bush's reference to Iraqi attempts to purchase uranium in Africa in his 2003 State of the Union address are by now commonly considered as having been based on forged documents (see Yellowcake forgery). Robert Fisk, Middle East correspondent for ;The Independent, comments in his book The Great War for Civilisation that history is repeating itself. Fisk, in the Dutch TV news program Nova: \\"It is not just similar, it is 'fingerprint' the same\\". In 1917, the UK invaded Iraq, claiming to come \\"not as conquerors but as liberators\\". After an insurrection in 1920, \\"the first town that was bombed was Fallujah and the next town that was laid siege to was Najaf\\". Then, the British army intelligence services claimed that terrorists were crossing the border from Syria. Prime minister Lloyd George stood up in the house of commons and declared that \\"if British troops leave Iraq there will be civil war\\". The British were going to set up a democracy in Iraq. In a referendum, however, a king was 'elected'. \\"They decided they would no longer use troops on the ground, it was too dangerous, they would use the Royal Air force to bomb villages from the air. And eventually, [...] we left and our leaders were overthrown and the Ba'ath party, which was a revolutionary socialist party at the time‚ÄîSaddam Hussein‚Äîtook over. And I'm afraid that the Iraq we are creating now is an Iraq of anarchy and chaos. And as long as we stay there, the chaos will get worse.\\"  Christian opposition to war  Pope John Paul II spoke out against the war several times, and said that a war against Iraq would be a \\"disaster\\" and a \\"crime against peace.\\" During the buildup to the war, one hundred Christian scholars of ethical theory issued a statement condemning the war as morally unjustifiable. Their brief statement, which was published in the Sept. 23 edition of the [Chronicle of Higher Education], read as follows: \\"As Christian Ethicists, we share a common moral presumption against a preemptive war on Iraq by the United States.\\" The group included scholars from a wide array of universities, including traditionally left- leaning Ivy League schools as well as more conservative institutions such as Lipscomb University, in Nashville, Lubbock Christian University, in Lubbock, Tex. (both affiliated with the Churches of Christ), and the Baptist Theological Seminary at Richmond. Other scholars of the just war theory asserted that war with Iraq could be justified on the grounds of defense of a \\"helpless other.\\" This position is based on the position that war could be justified on the grounds of liberating a helpless people being victimized by a tyrannical ruler.Minami, Wayde. \\"World Left with Brutal Decision on Possible Invasion of Iraq.\\" Air Force Times 63:54 November 18, 2002.

Agee was one of two Chicago-area high school basketball players whose lives were chronicled in the 1994 Kartemquin Films documentary, Hoop Dreams. Biography =Early life= Agee is the second child and first son of Arthur \\"Bo\\" Agee Sr. and Sheila Agee. During his younger years he lived in the north side Chicago area near where the other star of Hoop Dreams, William Gates, lived. By the time the movie began filming, the Agees had moved to the West Garfield Park neighborhood, which remained Agee's home until his graduation. Upon graduation from grammar school in 1987, he was discovered by part-time, unofficial talent scout Earl Smith. Smith convinced the Agees to send Arthur to St. Joseph's High School, a private, predominantly white suburban school. =High school= In the fall of 1987, Agee began his freshman year at St. Joseph High School. St. Joseph's is the same school that Arthur's childhood hero, Isiah Thomas, attended. Since the school was an hour and a half from his home, Arthur awoke around 5:30 AM daily and took public transportation to reach his destination. Early in his high school career, when his parents were unable to pay the school's tuition payments, Agee left St. Joseph's and attended John Marshall High School, an inner-city school. In his senior year, he helped the Marshall Commandos win the 1991 Public League Championship and finish third for the State Championship. Agee's high school was defeated by Manual High School that was led by future NBA player Howard Nathan. =College and thereafter= After graduating from Marshall, Agee starred at Mineral Area College and went on to play for two years at Arkansas State on a scholarship. He is a member of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity. Although Agee played at a Division I school, he never achieved his dream of playing in the National Basketball Association. In 1996, Agee turned down a contract with the CBA's Connecticut Pride, so that he could take a role in the film Passing Glory. In 2004, he launched a 'Hoop Dreams' clothing line with the slogan \\"Control Your Destiny\\". On December 15, 2004, his father, Arthur \\"Bo\\" Agee Sr., was killed while attempting to run from at least one robber. A Chicago man was subsequently charged by Berwyn police, but ultimately acquitted of killing Arthur Agee Sr. On November 19, 2017, Agee was arrested and held on $30,000 bail after being charged with aggravated battery for punching a woman in west suburban Forest Park. The charges were later dropped without prosecution.

He served as the Nebraska Secretary of State and as a member of the United States House of Representatives during the 1800s. Early life Born on a farm near Olney, Illinois, Laws was the son of James Laws and Lucinda (Calhoun) Laws. In 1845, he moved to Iowa County, Wisconsin, with his parents. He attended Haskell University and Milton College which he financed by working in the lumber business during the summers. After graduation, he taught school until 1861 in Richland Center, Wisconsin. During the American Civil War, Laws enlisted in the 5th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment. His left leg was amputated below the knee as a result of being wounded in the Battle of Williamsburg on May 5, 1862. He was discharged in July 1862 and settled in Richland County, Wisconsin. Career Laws was elected as the Richland County Clerk in 1862 and reelected twice. While serving as county clerk, he also published the Republican newspaper, \\"Richland County Observer\\". After selling his share of the newspaper in 1864, he manufactured lumber, wagon materials and bedsteads. He was a member of the Richland Center, Wisconsin city council in 1868 and 1869, and the city's mayor in 1869.

His terms as president saw Cuba's participation in World War I. Youth Born in Jag√ºey Grande, Matanzas, Cuba, Garc√≠a Menocal was thirteen when he was sent to boarding schools in the United States, first at the Chappaqua Mountain Institute in New York, and later at the Maryland Agricultural College. In 1884, he then went to Cornell University where he graduated in 1888 from the School of Engineering. While at Cornell University, he was a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Delta Chi Chapter).Fogel (25 Nov 2005) p. 27 and passim As a young man he was involved in Cuba's fight for independence from Spain. When Cuba did receive independence following the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Garc√≠a Menocal became a leading conservative politician. Time in office Mario Garc√≠a Menocal was elected President in 1912 and became known for his strong support of business and corporations. He was reelected in 1916, though the election was challenged by the liberals. In perhaps his most notable action, Garc√≠a Menocal authorized Cuba's declaration of war against the German Empire on April 7, 1917, entering World War I a day after the United States. This was believed by many to be an attempt to get the United States to give more support to his government. In December, war was also declared against Austria-Hungary. While in office, Garc√≠a Menocal hosted the 1920 Delta Kappa Epsilon National Convention,Fogel (25 Nov 2005) p. 66 the first international fraternity conference outside the US, which took place in Cuba. Private trains were hired from New England to Florida where the invited men and their families could travel in comfort and style, and upon arrival in Cuba, each man was gifted a gold-trimmed box of cigars. Garc√≠a Menocal's hospitality is still remembered in the fraternity to this day. He was responsible for creating the Cuban Peso, until his presidency Cuba used both the Spanish Real and US Dollar. Later life After his presidency, Garc√≠a Menocal continued to be involved in politics, running for President again in 1924. He attempted a revolution in 1931 and went into exile in the United States when it failed. After less than five years he returned to Cuba and ran for President a final time in 1936. He died in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba.

In the text Dialect Accent Features for Establishing Speaker Identity, Manisha Kulshreshtha and Ramkumar Mathur write, \\"A few sounds, borrowed from the other languages like Persian and Arabic, are written with a dot (bindu or nuktƒÅ). Many people who speak Hindi as a second language, especially those who come from rural backgrounds and do not speak conventional Hindi (also called Khariboli), or speak in one of its dialects, pronounce these sounds as their nearest equivalents.\\" For example, these rural speakers will assimilate the sound …£ (Devanagari: ‡§ó‡§º; Urdu: ) as …° (Devanagari: ‡§ó; Urdu: ).

Encoding in Unicode The nuqta is important for accurate transliteration of scripts and representation of speech sounds. Indic scripts with a nuqta include Devanagari, Grantha, Kannada, Gujarati, Bengali, and Gurmukhi. Currently, the Telugu script lacks a nuqta. This results in inaccurate transliterations into Telugu. The encoding of the nuqta would enable the proper transliteration of Perso-Arabic consonants into Telugu.Rajan, V., Sharma, S., & Kolichala, S. (2019). \\"Proposal to Encode Telugu Sign Nukta\\".

The experiments have not been independently replicated.Wiseman, Richard. (2014). Night School: Wake Up to the Power of Sleep. Macmillan. p. 202.

In a review of the research published in American Psychologisthttps://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/efc7/fd643d1269f30b36f6aa4a2c80316e078c91.pdf, Professor Irwin Child, former head of the Department of Psychology at Yale University, concluded that 'the tendency toward hits rather than misses cannot reasonably be ascribed to chance'. But this favorable commentary has been criticized by a number of reviews and respondents, who argued that Krippner's work like most parapsychology severely lacked in rigor and instituting proper controls against bias. In 1985, psychologist C. E. M. Hansel criticized the picture target experiments that were conducted by Krippner and Ullman. According to Hansel, there were weaknesses in the design of the experiments in the way in which the agent became aware of their target picture. Only the agent should have known the target and no other person until the judging of targets had been completed, however, an experimenter was with the agent when the target envelope was opened. Hansel also wrote there had been poor controls in the experiment as the main experimenter could communicate with the subject.Hansel, C. E. M. (1985). The Search for a Demonstration of ESP. In Paul Kurtz. A Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology. Prometheus Books. pp. 97‚Äì127. In 2002, Krippner denied Hansel's accusations claiming the agent did not communicate with the experimenter.Ramakrishna Rao, K, Gowri Rammohan, V. (2002). New Frontiers of Human Science: A Festschrift for K. Ramakrishna Rao. McFarland. p. 135. An attempt to replicate the experiments that used picture targets was carried out by Edward Belvedere and David Foulkes. The finding was that neither the subject nor the judges matched the targets with dreams above chance level.Belvedere, E., Foulkes, D. (1971). Telepathy and Dreams: A Failure to Replicate. Perceptual and Motor Skills 33: 783‚Äì789. Results from other experiments by Belvedere and Foulkes were also negative.Hansel, C. E. M. (1989). The Search for Psychic Power: ESP and Parapsychology Revisited. Prometheus Books. pp. 141‚Äì152. In 2003, Simon Sherwood and Chris Roe wrote a review that claimed support for dream telepathy at Maimonides.Sherwood, S. J; Roe, C. A. (2003). A Review of Dream ESP Studies Conducted Since the Maimonides Dream ESP Programme. Journal of Consciousness Studies, 10: 85‚Äì109. However, James Alcock noted that their review was based on \\"extreme messiness\\" of data. Alcock concluded the dream telepathy experiments at Maimonides have failed to provide evidence for telepathy and \\"lack of replication is rampant.\\"Alcock, James. (2003). Give the Null Hypothesis a Chance: Reasons to Remain Doubtful about the Existence of Psi. Journal of Consciousness Studies 10: 29‚Äì50. \\"In their article, Sherwood and Roe examine attempts to replicate the well-known Maimonides dream studies that began in the 1960s. They provide a good review of these studies of dream telepathy and clairvoyance, but if one thing emerges for me from their review, it is the extreme messiness of the data adduced. Lack of replication is rampant. While one would normally expect that continuing scientific scrutiny of a phenomenon should lead to stronger effect sizes as one learns more about the subject matter and refines the methodology, this is apparently not the case with this research.\\" =Psychics= Krippner has drawn criticism for endorsing the feats of a Russian psychic Nina Kulagina. Science writer Martin Gardner found it surprising that Krippner took interest in Kulagina despite knowing that she was a \\"charlatan\\" who was caught on two occasions using tricks to move objects.Gardner, Martin. (1983). Science: Good, Bad and Bogus. Oxford University Press. p. 244. Krippner took issue with this statement believing it to be an attack on himself and wrote there was \\"no suggestion of trickery.\\"Krippner, Stanley. (1980). Human Possibilities: Mind Exploration in the U. S. S. R. and Eastern Europe. Anchor Press/Doubleday. p. 33 However, psychologists Jerome Kravitz and Walter Hillabrant have noted that she was \\"caught cheating more than once by Soviet Establishment scientists.\\"Kravitz, Jerome; Hillabrant, Walter.

Revolutionary activities 1912 assassination attempt on Lord Hardinge On 23 December 1912, Biswas, disguised as a woman, threw a bomb at Lord Charles Hardinge, who was riding with his wife on an elephant during a procession at Chandni Chawak, Delhi. Hardinge escaped with flesh wounds, but the servant behind him holding his parasol was killed. The authors of the deed remained obscure for many months despite the state's intense investigation, and lucrative reward. Biswas was arrested on 26 February 1914 in Poragachha, Nadia while he went to perform the last rites for his father. The trial, which came to be called the Delhi-Lahore Conspiracy Case, began on 23 May 1914 in Delhi, and Basanta was found guilty on 5 October and sentenced to life imprisonment. Three other men were condemned to death at the same trial: Amir Charid, Abadh Behari, and Balmokand. An appeal was formulated at Lahore High Court. The Crown won its appeal and Biswas was sentenced to be hanged. Basanta Kumar Biswas was hanged on 11 May 1915 at Ambala Central Jail in Punjab aged twenty and became one of the youngest people to be executed during the Indian revolutionary struggles during the 20th century. Legacy There is a statue of Basanta Biswas established by Rasbihari Basu in a park of Tokyo, Japan. Another statue is situated in front of Rabindra Bhawan, Krishnanagar, Nadia. A school in civil lines, Delhi was named \\"Shaheed Basant Kumar Biswas Sarvodaya Vidhyalaya\\" in his memory. Although it was later renamed to Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidhyalaya. On the request of Sankariswar Dutta of Gobrapota Subhendu Memorial Seva Pratisthan the Loka Sabha Speaker Meera Kumar has installed a photo of Basanta Kumar at the Museum of the Indian Parliament.

He was later an NFL assistant coach and head coach of the New Orleans Saints, and is in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He played college football for the UCLA Bruins football team and is a member of the College Football Hall of Fame. Early life Born in Guadalajara, Mexico, Fears was the son of an American mining engineer, Charles William Fears, who had married a Mexican woman, Carmen Valdes. The family moved to Los Angeles when Tom was age six. There, he began to display his ample work ethic by unloading flowers for 25 cents an hour, and later serving as an usher at football games for double that amount. Fears first played football at Los Angeles' Manual Arts High School, where he met Toby Freedman of Beverly Hills High School. They became longtime friends. Upon graduation, he enrolled at Santa Clara University. He spent one year at the school before being drafted in World War II and spent the next three years in military service. After his father became a Japanese prisoner of war, Fears sought to become a fighter pilot to fight Japan. He became a pilot, but was instead shipped to Colorado Springs to play football for a service team. Upon his release, he had been drafted by the Rams in 1945, but remained in school and transferred to UCLA, winning All-American honors each of his two seasons at the school. His senior campaign nearly ended in abrupt fashion in 1947, when he and some Bruin teammates were investigated for posing in local advertisements for a Los Angeles clothing store. When it was determined that Fears and the other players worked for the store, and were not identified as athletes, the matter was dropped. This job had been one of many provided by school boosters, and included a brief bit as a pilot in the Humphrey Bogart film Action in the North Atlantic. The largesse by such people led Fears to joke that his $6,000 first-year contract and $500 bonus from the Rams meant that he was taking a pay cut. Playing career =Los Angeles Rams= Selected as a defensive back by the Los Angeles Rams in the eleventh round (103rd overall) of the 1945 NFL Draft, he is distinguished as being the first Mexican-born player to be drafted into the National Football League. Fears quickly made his mark as a wide receiver in 1948, while also displaying his versatility by playing on defense and at split end. During his first three seasons at the professional level, he led all NFL receivers in catches, and broke the league's single-season record with 77 catches in 1949. The record would be short-lived as he increased that mark to 84 during the 1950 NFL season, including a then-record 18 catches in one game against the Green Bay Packers on November 12. He also helped the team advance to the NFL title game with a trio of touchdown receptions in the divisional playoff against the Chicago Bears, winning All-Pro accolades for the second consecutive year. During the ensuing offseason, Fears became embroiled in a contract dispute with the team for the second straight year. The year before, he hinted at leaving the team to work for General Motors Corporation, then announced on March 13, 1951 that he was retiring to work for a local liquor distributor. Neither threat materialized, and despite offers from four Canadian Football League teams, Fears signed for $13,000. That season, Fears played in only seven games, but helped lead the Rams to their third straight championship game appearance. After two disappointments, the franchise captured its first NFL title since moving to the West Coast, with Fears an integral part of the title game victory when he caught the winning score. His 73-yard touchdown reception midway through the fourth quarter broke a 17-17 deadlock with the Cleveland Browns. After bouncing back in 1952 with 48 receptions for 600 yards and six scores, the beginning of the end of his career began after he fractured two vertebrae in an October 18, 1953 game against the Detroit Lions. Limited to just 23 receptions that year, he would average 40 catches the next two years, but after a preseason injury in 1956, he hauled in only five passes and retired on November 6. For the remainder of that campaign, he served as an assistant coach, finishing his playing days with 400 catches for 5,397 yards and 38 touchdowns. Coaching career =Packers, Rams and Falcons= Fears was out of the game for the next two years, but returned briefly as an assistant in the first year of Vince Lombardi's reign with the Packers. Business conflicts back in California caused him to leave the position at midseason, but Fears resumed his coaching career the following year with the Rams under former teammate Bob Waterfield. After two seasons in that role, Fears returned to Green Bay for a four-year stint as an assistant, where he was part of championship teams in 1962 and 1965. Fears applied for the head coaching job with the St. Louis Cardinals (football) after the 1965 NFL season, but after not being chosen, he joined fellow Packer assistant Norb Hecker, who had been named head coach of the expansion Atlanta Falcons. In the first game of the 1966 regular season, Fears caused controversy when he accused Rams coach George Allen of attempting to garner inside information on the team from a player that had been cut, charges that were never proven. =New Orleans Saints= After that 2-12 first season in Atlanta, Fears became a head coach for the first time when he was hired by the expansion New Orleans Saints on January 27, 1967. He was the first Latino head coach in the NFL. Despite the promise of the team scoring on the first-ever kickoff return in franchise history, Fears's nearly four years at the helm of what became a perennial losing franchise were an exercise in frustration. In 1970, Fears was recognized for his professional playing career when he was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. That March, rumors of Fears replacing the departed Don Shula with the Baltimore Colts surfaced, but Don McCafferty was hired by the Maryland team in early April. Issues between Fears and Saints owner John W. Mecom Jr., primarily Fears seeking the additional role of general manager, fueled such speculation. On April 20, the matter ended when he was given control over all player personnel matters. Fears's tenure in his new dual roles, however, would be short, when the team ended the first half of the 1970 NFL season with a 1-5-1 mark, resulting in his dismissal on November 3 after compiling an overall mark of 13-34-2. His last game as coach of the Saints was a 30-17 loss to the team he played for, the Rams, the same team which defeated the Saints in their first game in 1967. =Eagles, WFL and USFL= He resurfaced in 1971, serving as offensive coordinator of the Philadelphia Eagles, but when head coach Ed Khayat (Fears' defensive line coach in New Orleans) was fired at the end of the 1972 NFL season, Fears was out of work again. After spending 1973 off the gridiron, Fears was named head coach of the fledgling World Football League's Southern California Sun on January 14, 1974. The fragile financial condition of the entire league resulted in Fears leading the team for less than two years before the WFL folded in October 1975. Fears's disappointment was soothed somewhat when he was named to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1976, the same year he was named president of the All-Sports Council of Southern California, which helped amateur sports in the area. One year later, he returned to coaching as an assistant at San Bernardino Junior College. During this period, he was also working as a technical adviser for movies with a football connection, and in 1979, began a football scouting service. The two roles came together in controversial fashion when Fears began working on the production of \\"North Dallas Forty\\", a film that took a look at the sordid side of the professional game. Fears had three clients: the Packers, Houston Oilers and Pittsburgh Steelers, but after the movie was released, Fears saw all three teams drop his services. Claiming that the NFL had blacklisted him, Fears spoke with league commissioner Pete Rozelle (who had worked for the Rams during Fears's playing days), but never again found work in the league. Remaining on the fringes of the sport, Fears in 1980 worked as a coach for the Chapman College club football team, then became a part-owner of the Orange Empire Outlaws of the California Football League the following year. In 1982, he was hired as player personnel director of the new United States Football League's Los Angeles Express. Bolstered by huge spending from team owner William Daniels, the team reached the conference championship game, but saw financial troubles doom not only the team, but the league as well. Fears's final position in football came in 1990, when he was named head coach of the Milan franchise in the fledgling International League of American Football. Four years later, he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, spending the final six years of his life battling the disease. Fears was the first Mexico-born NFL player inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

Biography John Fuqua was born in Detroit, Michigan, on September 12, 1947. A 1965 graduate of Detroit's Eastern High School, Fuqua played college football at Morgan State University and was drafted in the eleventh round of the 1969 NFL Draft by the New York Giants. The next season, Fuqua was traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers. It was while with the Steelers that Fuqua would become part of NFL history as the intended target for Terry Bradshaw's pass that resulted in the Immaculate Reception. Oakland Raiders safety Jack Tatum hit Fuqua just as the ball arrived. It has never been established whether the ball hit Fuqua or Tatum. This was critical, since under the rules of the time, once a pass touched an offensive player he was the only one eligible to catch the pass. If the ball had hit Fuqua without touching Tatum, the rules called for the play to be blown dead once Franco Harris touched the ball. Fuqua reportedly insists to this day that he knows whom the ball hit first, but will never tell.Two Words Say It all: \\"Immaculate Reception\\" Fuqua nicknamed himself \\"The French Count\\". He is remembered for being one of the flashiest dressers in the NFL, and would occasionally appear in public wearing platform shoes having see-through heels that contained water and a live tropical fish selected from his aquarium to match the color of the day's outfit.12/24/73 Sports Illustrated, People Section. He won two Super Bowl titles during his Steelers tenure, which were also the first two championships in the team's history. Over the course of his career, Fuqua played in 100 games, rushing for 3,031 yards and scoring 24 touchdowns. His best season was in 1970, his first with the Steelers, when he rushed for 691 yards and seven touchdowns. In this season, he set a then Steelers single-game rushing record of 218 yards against the Philadelphia Eagles. This was later surpassed in 2006 by Willie Parker when he gained 223 yards against the Cleveland Browns. Teammate Franco Harris had his fanclub \\"Franco's Italian Army\\", and Fuqua had \\"Frenchy's Foreign Legion\\". In celebration of the 35th Anniversary of the Immaculate Reception, Fuqua created a candy bar called \\"The Immaculate Confection\\".https://web.archive.org/web/20110816183722/http://frenchyfuqua.com/  References  Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:African- American players of American football Category:American football running backs Category:Sportspeople from Detroit Category:Players of American football from Michigan Category:Pittsburgh Steelers players Category:New York Giants players Category:Morgan State Bears football players Category:Super Bowl champions ","title":"John Fuqua"},{"id":"3891877","text":"Gladstone is an unincorporated urban community in the Municipality of WestLake ‚Äì Gladstone within the Canadian province of Manitoba that held town status prior to January 1, 2015.

The parkway is a critical east-west connection throughout Westchester, having full interchanges with every major north-south highway in southern Westchester with the exception of Interstate 95 (New England Thruway). Among its junctions, it has access to the New York State Thruway mainline. The western terminus is at the Saw Mill Parkway in Yonkers. The eastern terminus is at the Hutchinson River Parkway in New Rochelle. As evident from stubs and oversized overpasses, it appears that there were plans to expand the Parkway west from exit 2 to Downtown Yonkers and east from exit 9 to I-95. World War II had slowed this idea until it was shelved. The CCP is the only parkway in New York state that has express and local lanes. The parkway is designated New York State Route 907K (NY 907K), an unsigned reference route. Route description The Cross County Parkway looking east from the Murray Avenue bridge in Yonkers, near exit 4S The Cross County Parkway begins at an interchange with the Saw Mill River Parkway in Yonkers. Exits 1 and 2 are part of this interchange, with exit 1 being a westbound only exit to Rumsey Road, and exit 2 being a westbound exit/eastbound entrance from the Saw Mill northbound. The entrance/exit at the Saw Mill southbound has no number. The eastbound entrance at exit 1 (Rumsey Road) is via the Saw Mill southbound. After crossing an abandoned railroad grade, the parkway enters exit 3, a small interchange with Yonkers Avenue. The six-lane roadway crosses through southeast Yonkers, making a gradual bend from the northeast to the southeast before spitting into express and local lanes. The parkway then enters an interchange with the New York State Thruway (I-87) and NY 100, exits 4S (for I-87 south) and 4N (for I-87 north/NY-100 north). All exits/entrances are accessed here by the local lanes, except for the eastbound exit and westbound entrance at exit 4N, which are via the express lanes. The eastbound entrance at exit 4N connects to both the express and local lanes. Shortly after, the Cross County enters exit 5, which connects to Kimball Avenue and Midland Avenue and is only accessed by the local lanes. There is no eastbound entrance. Eastbound entrance to the Cross County at exit 4N in Yonkers. Cars can bear left for the express lanes for exits 8 and up, or bear right for the local lanes for exits 5, 6, and 7.Continuing east through Yonkers, the Cross County Parkway enters an interchange with the Bronx River Parkway and Sprain Brook Parkway, exit 6. In the center of this interchange, consisting of several flyover ramps, is the Fleetwood Metro-North Railroad station on the Harlem Line. Immediately after exit 6, the Cross County crosses into Mount Vernon where it meets exit 7, a northbound entrance and exit via the local lanes at Broad Street, which connects to Gramatan Avenue. After exit 7, the parkway winds southeast into the Chester Heights section of Mount Vernon, where it enters exit 8 for NY 22 (North Columbus Avenue). Just east of exit 8, the Cross County has an eastbound exit and westbound entrance at exit 9, which connects the parkway to/from the southbound lanes of the Hutchinson River Parkway at exit 13\\\\. Immediately after exit 9, the Cross County Parkway turns ninety degrees to the north, going back to a six lane parkway after briefly expanding to host exit 9. The Cross County parallels a park in the Chester Heights section of Mount Vernon. Entering the southwest corner of New Rochelle, the parkway enters exit 10, a small interchange with New Rochelle Road with only an eastbound exit and westbound entrance. This is because the eastbound entrance and westbound exit are via the Hutch. After exit 10, the Cross County continues north as a five-lane parkway (three lanes westbound, two lanes eastbound), before crossing under a flyover ramp for the Hutchinson River Parkway southbound and merging into the parkway northbound. History The Cross County Parkway was originally built as an east-west link between the Saw Mill, Bronx River, and Hutchinson River Parkways. Construction began in 1929, and the highway was initially a -wide undivided roadway that could accommodate four lanes of automobile traffic (two in each direction). The parkway had a toll barrier in Fleetwood, which was removed in the early 1950s.Fleetwood Viaduct, Cross County Parkway - looking southeast; Mount Vernon, New York (Westchester County Historical Society) The reconstruction of the Cross County Parkway was begun in 1964; however, the project was not completed until 1984.Fleetwood NYC Station, Mount Vernon, New York; 1954 (NETR Online; Historic Aerials) The parkway is now a multi-lane highway with express and local lanes. In conjunction with the renovation of the Cross County Shopping Center, Exit 5 westbound and Exit 5 eastbound of the Cross County Parkway underwent major reconstruction during 2010 and 2011. The two exit ramps were widened and improved with new traffic lights and signage. In addition, traffic can now proceed from the eastbound parkway directly into the shopping center. Cross County Parkway was originally intended to connect to the Rye Playland Parkway.\\"Transportation 1985: A Regional Plan,\\" by the Tri- State Transportation Commission (1966) However this proposal was stalled by the Great Depression and Second World War, and finally cancelled in the 1970s.

As a result of the Great Famine in Ireland, many Irish families were forced to emigrate from the country. By 1854, between 1.5 and 2 million Irish had left their country. In the United States, most Irish became city- dwellers. With little money, many had to settle in the cities that the ships landed in. By 1850, the Irish made up a quarter of the population in Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, Buffalo, and Baltimore. Today, Boston has the largest percentage of Irish-Americans of any city in the United States, while New York City has the most Irish Americans in raw numbers.Irish American Fun Facts & Trivia During the Celtic Tiger years, when the Irish economy was booming, the city saw a buying spree of residences by native Irish as second homesThe Real Estate Bloggers or as investment property.An Irish Taste for Real Estate in Manhattan, by Patrick McHeehan, N.Y.

Background Irish Hunger Memorial in Downtown Manhattan Irish Americans (comprising those of Irish, Scot's-Irish and Ulster Scot's heritage) make up approximately 5.3% of New York City's population, composing the second largest non-Hispanic white ethnic group. Irish Americans first came to America in colonial years (pre-1776), with immigration rising in the 1820s due to poor living conditions in Ireland. But the largest wave of Irish immigration came after the Great Famine in 1845. The largest number of Irish immigrants came from some of Ireland's most populous counties, such as Cork, Galway, and Tipperary, surprisingly large numbers also originated in Counties Cavan, Meath, Dublin, and Laois, places not usually associated with the highest levels of emigration. In the \\"early days\\", the 19th century, the Irish formed a predominant part of the European immigrant population of New York City, a \\"city of immigrants\\", which added to the city's diversity to this day. After they came, Irish immigrants often crowded into subdivided homes, only meant for one family, and cellars, attics, and alleys all became home for some Irish immigrants. In fact, New York once had more Irishmen than Dublin itself. New York has long been a destination for Irish immigrants because they speak English, and there has long been a large Irish population there. Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, was originally developed as a resort for wealthy Manhattanites in 1879, but instead became a family-oriented Italian- and Irish-American community. Another large Irish-American community is located in Woodlawn Heights, Bronx, but Woodlawn Heights also has a mix of different ethnic groups. One large Irish community in Manhattan was Hell's Kitchen.Manhattanwork=primemanhattan.compublisher=Prime Manhattan Realtyaccessdate=May 4, 2009 Other sizable Irish-American communities include Belle Harbor and Breezy Point, both in Queens. Two big Irish communities are Marine Park and neighboring Gerritsen Beach. The Irish have also settled \\"to a far lesser extent [in] Maspeth, Woodside, and Sunnyside, Queens.\\" The Irish in New York developed a particular reputation for joining the New York City Police Department as well as the New York Fire Department.  Irish colleges and universities  *Fordham University Founded by Archbishop John Hughes an Irish immigrant, and built by Irish labor. Most of the Jesuits are Irish- Americans and Irish Americans make up a sizeable amount of the student body. *St. John's University Founded by Bishop John Laughlin an Irish immigrant aiming to educate Irish and other immigrants in a strong Catholic atmosphere. Almost every president of the University has been an Irish American, and many of the Vincentian priests that run the University are Irish as well as lay staff and professors. *Manhattan College A large amount of the student body, staff and professors are Irish American.

Born in New York, he graduated in 1918 from the Institute of Musical Art in New York where he studied with Franz Kneisel. In 1926 he was appointed concertmaster of the Cleveland Orchestra, but resigned in 1940 to pursue a solo career. After a successful New York d√©but in 1943, he became co-founder of the Musicians‚Äô Guild, a chamber music organization which he directed there until 1956. He toured extensively in Europe, appearing at the 1953 and 1954 Prades festivals, and in South America, the USSR, Israel and Japan; he also played as a soloist with every important orchestra in the USA. Joseph Fuchs performed a series of recitals with pianist Artur Balsam in 1956 for the Peabody Mason Concert series in Boston.Boston Globe, 24-Feb-1956, John Wm. Riley, \\"Fuchs and Balsam in Beethoven sonatas\\" A Ford Foundation grant in 1960 enabled him to commission Walter Piston‚Äôs Second Violin Concerto, the premi√®re of which he gave that year in Pittsburgh. Fuchs also gave the first performances of concertos by Lopatnikoff (1944‚Äì5), Ben Weber (1954) and Mario Peragallo (1955); of Martin≈Ø‚Äôs Madrigaly for violin and viola, dedicated to Fuchs and his sister Lillian (1947); of the revised version of Vaughan Williams‚Äôs Violin Sonata, with Artur Balsam (1969); and of the posthumous American premi√®re of Martin≈Ø‚Äôs Sonata for two violins and piano (1974). Fuchs became a violin professor at the Juilliard School of Music in 1946, and in 1971 he received the Artist Teacher‚Äôs Award from the American String Teachers‚Äô Association. Fuchs died in Manhattan in 1997. He played the ‚ÄúC√°diz Stradivarius‚Äù violin of 1722. His style of playing was vigorous and large- scaled, with a masterful technique and a rich, warm tone. A clear example of all this may be heard in his recording of Stravinsky's Duo Concertant (Decca, with Leo Smit). References Sources *J.

The first modern building on the campus, it was also one of the first endorsements of the modern style by a major university and was seen in the national and architectural presses as a turning point in the acceptance of the aesthetic in the United States. The Architects Collaborative (TAC), a modernist firm headed by Walter Gropius and seven younger architects, was a bold choice for the typically traditional university. Though it cannot be said that Gropius was the sole designer, those that held strongly to his ideals collaboratively designed Harkness Commons. Coming from the Bauhaus, Gropius had been a pioneering innovator of educational architecture and many of his hallmarks can be seen years later in Harkness Commons. The physical Gropius hallmarks ‚Äì large windows, flowing rooms, floating facades on raised pilotis ‚Äì are all present here. In justifying the placement of these innovations at Harvard, Gropius reveals his passion, and activism, for the acceptance of modernism on college campuses. Gropius makes clear statements for specific innovations, ‚Äú‚Ä¶Our contemporary architectural conception of an intensified outdoor-indoor relationship through wide window openings and large undivided window panes has ousted the small, cage-like, ‚ÄúGeorgian‚Äù window.‚Äù But he is also more far reaching and makes what is now a commonplace case for architectural diversity and investment in current styles: ‚ÄúIf the college is to be the cultural breeding ground for the coming generation, its attitude should be creative, not imitative‚Äù Gropius advocated pushing architecture forward as the society needs it. He concluded by saying that ‚ÄúThere is no finality in architecture ‚Äì only continuous change.‚Äù The building was completed in 1950, and was one of the first major projects in the Architects Collaborative office. The building is also graced with the works of avant-garde, Surrealist or Bauhaus artists Joan Mir√≥, Josef Albers, Jean Arp and Herbert Bayer, and also has a sculpture by Richard Lippold in the courtyard near it.Article on Harkness Graduate Center on the Harvard Law School website.

J. Arkell, was a British archaeologist and colonial administrator noted for his work in the Sudan and Egypt.  Early life and education  Anthony John Arkell was born on 29 July 1898 at Hinxhill Rectory, Hinxhill, Kent, England. He was the son of Reverend John Norris and Jessie Arkell (n√©e Bunting). He won a scholarship to Bradfield College, where he was head boy. He next won the Jordell Scholarship in Classics to The Queen's College, Oxford.  Career  Arkell joined the Royal Flying Corps in 1916 and served with the 39th Squadron, now the Royal Air Force in World War I. On 20 March 1918, while on a night patrol with his gunner-observer First Air Mechanic Albert Stagg, the pair shot down a Gotha G.V bomber in their Bristol F.2 Fighter 'Devil-in-the- Dark'. The bomber came down in a bean field off Roman Road, 200 yards from Albert Dock, East Ham, near the north bank of the Thames. The then-nineteen year old collected several souvenirs from the wreckage ‚Äì a piece blue camouflage canvas, charred wood, a cartridge case, and a plywood ammunition box. He later obtained a propeller. Arkell received the Military Cross and Stagg received the Military Medal for their actions. He joined the Sudan Political Service in 1920 and was appointed Assistant District Commissioner for Darfur in Sudan in 1921. In 1925 he moved to Dar Masalit, and was appointed District Commissioner at Kosti from 1926-9 and later at Sennar. During his time in Kosti, Arkell was instrumental in ending the slave trade between the Sudan and Ethiopia, arresting dealers and establishing villages for the freed slaves, who named themselves 'Beni Arkell', the \\"Sons of Arkell\\". It was for this humanitarian service that he was awarded the MBE in 1928, and the Order of the Nile (4th class) in 1931. He was acting governor of the province of Darfur from 1932 to 1937. While District Commissioner and Governor, he published articles in the Sudan Notes and Records on many topics, including archaeology, anthropology, geography, and science. While on leave he learnt excavation techniques on British sites under Sir Mortimer Wheeler. In 1938 he was appointed the first Commissioner for Archaeology and Anthropology for the Sudan. He was instrumental in the creation in the National Museum of Antiquities in Khartoum. He encouraged Sudanese students and others to take an interest in their own history and archaeology, appointing them to the Antiquities Service as regional inspectors. Systematic mapping and recording of sites and finds was also implemented; this work later aided in the UNESCO campaign to salvage monuments from the rising Lake Nasser. The work was interrupted by World War II during which he served as Chief Transport Officer in the Sudan from 1940‚Äì4. As soon as he returned to his post, the first official excavations carried out by the Antiquities Service began on a prehistoric site near the Khartoum civil hospital, and later at Shaheinab in 1949, revealing information about Sudanese prehistory for the first time. The excavations at Khartoum revealed the existence of a pottery-producing culture that utilised stone tools, described as 'Mesolithic' who lived in a period when the climate was much wetter. During the post-war years he edited the Sudan Notes and Records and became president of the Philosophical Society of the Sudan in 1947; he became a Life Member in 1949. Over the course of his career, Arkell was able to conduct several surveys, documenting among other things the existence of massive iron works in Meroe and the extensive predynastic culture of Egypt, notably the Badarians. He retired as Commissioner in 1949 and returned to England. Upon his retirement from the Sudan he accepted the post of lecturer in Egyptian archaeology at University College London and became Honorary Curator of the Petrie Collection. Here he undertook the challenging task of unpacking the 800 crates into which the collection had been hurriedly packed in the early days of the war. Over the next 14 years he unpacked and stored the collection, cataloging at least a third of it himself. During this time he gained a deeper understanding for the history of Egypt, particularly the Predynastic period and in collaboration with his student P. J. Ucko published Review of Predynastic Development in the Nile Valley in Current Anthropology in 1965. He was promoted to Reader in Egyptian Archaeology in 1953 and retired in 1963. He had earlier published A History of the Sudan from the Earliest Times to 1821 in 1951. He had become an Honorary Member of the German Archaeological Institute in 1953. In 1955 he presented a history of the Darfur Province for the award of the degree of Bachelor of Letters from the University of Oxford. He was a Committee member of the Egypt Exploration Society for many years, and member of the Council of the Society of Antiquaries from 1956‚Äì7. In 1960, after a short course at Cuddesdon College, he had been ordained into Holy Orders. He served as curate at Great Missenden, where he lived from 1960‚Äì63. On his retirement he became vicar of Cuddington with Diton in Buckinghamshire. He died on 26 February 1980 in Chelmsford, Essex. = Arkell and Afrocentrism = Arkell's work has received recent attention resulting from the debate over Afrocentrism. Some have criticised Arkell's conclusions, alleging that he divided Sudanic areas into vaguely defined populations including a superior \\"Brown\\" race (Arab or Semitic) and \\"Negro\\" races, and that he held that progress among the Negro aborigines was due to Egyptianisation, rather than to independent development. Others point, however, to Arkell's surveys as proof against what they consider to be racist assumptions about Africa, namely that any significant cultural or technological development is due to the outside influence of Caucasoid invaders or migrants.  Personal life  A. J. Arkell was married twice, first to Dorothy Davidson, with whom he had two children, and second to Joan Margaret Andrews. Arkell retired in 1963 and was ordained a minister. He had always wished to enter the church at the end of his life and so follow his father who, together with his mother, he spoke of with great respect. He died in Chelmsford on 26 February 1980, at the age of eighty-one.

Biography Louis Isaac Rabinowitz was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, descendant of a long lineage of Lithuanian Rabbis. His lineage to Rabbi Meir Katzenellenbogen, the Maharam of Padua and a descendant of the House of David, is detailed in The Unbroken Chain.Rosenstein, Neil. \\"The Unbroken Chain: Biographical Sketches and Genealogy of Illustrious Jewish Families from the 15th‚Äì20th Century,\\" Volumes 1 and 2, Revised Edition, CIS Publishers: New York, 1990. . His grandfather was Rabbi Eliezer Simcha Rabinowitz of Lomza, and his father Rabbi Jacob Rabinowitz immigrated from Eastern Europe to become the Rabbi of Edinburgh at the end of the nineteenth century. Jacob Rabinowitz later moved to London where he became the Rabbi of the Montagu Road Beth Hamedrash in Hackney. He was related to many distinguished Rabbis. His brother, Eliezer Simcha Rabinowitz, was the Rabbi in Kingsbury, London; Cape Town, South Africa, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Hull, and finally of Cheadle in Manchester, all in the UK. A brother-in-law, Rabbi Dr. Julius Newman was the Rabbi of the Notting Hill community in London, and another brother-in-law was the noted synagogue stained glass window designer, David Hillman, the son of Dayan Shmuel Hillman of Glasgow, and the brother-in-law of Rabbi Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog, the first Chief Rabbi of Israel. Hillman's windows are to be found in many of the major London synagogues, such as St. John's Wood, Marble Arch, the Central Synaogue, Hampstead Garden Suburb, the New Synagogue (Egerton Road) and the Hendon Synagogue, as well as at the Rananim Synagogue in Jerusalem. His sister, Dr. Fanny Rabinowitz, who immigrated to Israel from London in the early 1950s. was a well known Jerusalem doctor who was influential in founding the nursing school at the Hadassah Hospital. She was also a recipient of the Yakir Yerushalayim (\\"Worthy Jerusalemite\\")award, the only brother and sister combination to have been so honoured. In 1961, Rabinowitz immigrated to Israel. Rabinowitz died in 1984, at the age of seventy-eight. His funeral was attended by President Chaim Herzog, to whom he was related, and former Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban. He was interred on Har HaMenuchot. Rabbinic career Rabinowitz served as rabbi in several London synagogues, including those in Shepherd's Bush, South Hackney, and Cricklewood. During World War II he was appointed Senior Jewish chaplain of the British Army; he served with Allied forces in the Middle East and during the Normandy invasion. In 1945 Rabinowitz accepted a position as chief rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregation of Johannesburg and the Federation of Synagogues of Transvaal and the Orange Free State in South Africa. He became a professor of Hebrew at the University of Witwatersrand and headed the Johannesburg beth din. Rabbi Rabinowitz was an ardent follower of Zeev Jabotinsky and his brand of Revisionist Zionism. Rabinowitz gained fame by publicly discarding his British war decorations in 1947 in protest of British policies in the British Mandate of Palestine, which he viewed as a violation of the British Mandate for Palestine. It has been argued that this was the reason why his candidacy for the British Chief Rabbinate in the mid-1960s was later passed over in favour of Rabbi Immanuel Jakobovits. Always outspoken in his political opinions, he was a harsh critic of the South African National Party's apartheid policies following the South African general election of 1948. Political career In Israel, Rabinowitz became involved in Jerusalem municipal politics, serving as a city council representative and (1976‚Äì1978) and as Deputy Mayor of Jerusalem. He also became the Rabbi of the Herut-Etzel Synagogue in the Nahalot neighbourhood of Jerusalem, replacing Rabbi Aryeh Levin (the Rabbi of the Prisoners) following his death. While his positions on religion were considered to be quite liberal for an orthodox Rabbi, his political positions in Israel were right wing. He was a founder of the Movement for a Greater Land of Israel and opposed the Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula as part of the Camp David Peace agreements with Egypt. He fell out with his friend, Prime Minister Menachem Begin, over this issue. Awards and recognition He was named a Yakir Yerushalayim (\\"Worthy Jerusalemite\\") by the municipal government in 1980.

Saryupareen families, such as the Tiwari, Tripathi, Pandey, Mishra, Shukla, Dwivedi and Dikshit, were involved solely in the research and analysis of Vedas and other religious texts, performing yajnas and other religious practices. These families did not perform \\"pujas\\" for benefactors and did not take \\"dakshinas\\" (donations) against such prayers. Hence, they were considered to be solely devoted to the quest of learning about the Vedas and spreading knowledge rather than benefiting in any way through benefactors. Along with the other Pancha-Gauda Brahmin communities, the Saryupareen traditionally preserve the customs and traditions as prescribed by ancient Hindu canons. In the 19th (held at Prayag) and 20th (held at Lucknow) national convention of Kanyakubja Brahmins by Kanyakubja Mahati Sabha, in 1926 and 1927 respectively, it appealed for unity among Kanyakubja Brahmins whose different branches included Sanadhya, Pahadi, Bhumihar Brahmin, Jujhoutia, Saryupareen, Chhattisgarhi, and different Bengali Brahmins. The Saryupareen generally dwell in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh with a significant amount of them concentrated in the eastern region of Uttar Pradesh known as Purvanchal. There are also minority Saryupareen communities in Mauritius, where Bhojpuri is a commonly spoken language and the Caribbean.  Vanshavali (Branches)  \\"Kanyakubj Vanshavali\\" mentions five branches of Kanyakubja Brahmins as Saryupareen, Sanadhya, Bhumihar Brahmin, Jujhautiya and Prakrit Kanaujia: These five branches make up the Kanyakubja Brahmin class, a subset of the overall Brahmin caste.  Classification  = Main groups = These Brahmins are divided into three categories- Paitiha, also known as Pankti Paavan (meaning those who sat in a row); Jatiha, (also known as Jaati kula or Gangaparin), and Tutiha (also known as Truti kula). The Paitihas are classified into three main groups. The three main groups consist of the disciples of three gotras: Gargya, Gautama, and Shandilya; the Garga rishi and his disciples were the first to study the Yajurveda in their ashrams. They were followed by the Gautama rishi and the Shandilya rishi. These three groups are the most highly regarded amongst Saryupareen Brahmins. Jaitha are classified into Vashishta, Krishnatraya, Kashyapa and Bharadwaja gotras. Tutihas are classified into many groups, the main ones being Parashara, Vashishta, Upamanyu, Sankrithi, Agastya, and Kaushika. = Other gotras = The Krishanatraya, Ghritakausika, and Margeya gotras are called the mishrit (combined) gotra.

In Hebrew, a tish is called (). It may consist of speeches on Torah subjects, singing of melodies known as niggunim (singular niggun) and zemirot (\\"hymns\\"), with refreshments being served. Hasidim see it as a moment of great holiness. They are public events that are open to non-Hasidim as well. Within Hasidic Judaism, a tish refers to any joyous public celebration or gathering or meal by Hasidim at a \\"table\\" of their Rebbe. Such a gathering is staged around the blessing of Melchizedek-themed \\"setting of the table\\" and so is often referred to in Hebrew as Arichat HaShulchan (). Bread and wine are essential elements. A Shabbos tish could also be the Shabbat meal of any Jewish family. During a tish, the Rebbe sits at the head of the table and the Hasidim gather around the table. In large Hasidic movements, only the Rebbe and his immediate family, plus a few close disciples, partake of the actual meal, but small pieces of bread, fish, meat, poultry, farfel, beans, kugel, or fruit, as well as small cups of kosher wine or other beverages, are distributed to all present as shiyarim (). In such large courts, there are often bleachers, known as parentches () in Yiddish, for observers of the tish to stand on. In smaller courts there is usually more food available for observers to partake. Often, in both large and small tishen, the Rebbe will personally distribute shirayim food to individuals. Hasidim believe that the Rebbe will have a personal blessing for each person who partakes of the food he gives them. In some Hasidic movements, the Rebbe only eats his Shabbat meals at the tish, often waiting many hours until the Hasidim have finished their meals to begin his meal with the recitation of the Kiddush prayer. In other courts, the Rebbe begins his meal at home with his family, and then comes to join the Hasidim in the synagogue to end the meal. In yet other courts, the entire tish is conducted after the meal has been finished at home. In such a case only dessert, usually consisting of kugel and fruit, is served, as well as soft drinks, usually seltzer-water. Such tishes are known as a Peiros Tish () (\\"Fruit Tish\\"). Sometimes, a Hasidic gathering similar to a tish is conducted without the presence of a Rebbe. This is called a botteh () in Yiddish or a shevet achim () in Hebrew. It is often led by a Rabbi who is not a Rebbe, such as a Rosh Yeshivah, Mashgiach Ruchani, or a Rebbe's son. Often, a botteh will be indistinguishable from a tish, for the respect that many Hasidim have for their Rebbe's son is often very close to the reverence for the Rebbe himself, as he is the assumed heir to the throne. A tish takes place at the meals in honor of the Shabbat, Jewish holidays, yahrzeit (\\"annual memorial\\") for previous rebbes of that dynasty, as a seudas hoda'ah (meal of thanksgiving) to God for past salvations (such as escape from prisons or from the Holocaust), or some other seudas mitzvah. Some Hasidic movements hold a tish every Shabbat; others do so only on Jewish holidays. The time at which a tish can be held also differs. For example, Belzer Hasidim conduct their tish both late Friday night and on Saturday afternoon for Seudah Shlishit, while Gerrer Hasidim only have their tish on Saturday afternoon or early evening for Seudah Shlishit. A tish is usually also held on minor holidays such as Lag BaOmer, Hanukkah, Purim, Tu Bishvat, on the minor days (Chol Hamoed) of major festivals such as Sukkos and Pesach, and before and after the fast of Yom Kippur. Hasidim may also visit the tish of another Rebbe, and non-Hasidic Jews often visit a tish also. Non-Jews sometimes visit a tish as well, particularly dignitaries and politicians during a weekday tish such as on Chol HaMoed. The nature of the tish differs from group to group but during the tish, the Hasidim intently and silently watch the rebbe eating the meal and are extremely eager to receive shirayim (\\"leftovers\\"), cooked alongside the Rebbe's courses, believing it to be a great merit (zechus) to eat something from the leftovers of a tzadik's meal. Many Hasidim claim that miracles can take place in merit of partaking of the shirayim, such as miraculous healing or blessings of wealth or piety. Hasidic songs, or niggunim, are sung with great gusto. The songs may at times be either joyous or solemnly meditative. The rebbe may teach words of Torah, often mystical passages from the Midrash, Zohar, and the Kabbalah during the tish. He may also tell Hasidic stories, parables, and history. He may also give religious commentary on current events and politics. Women do not sit with the men (because some communities of Orthodox Jews, especially Hasidim, are very strict about the separation of the sexes) but they are often present to observe the tish from the ezras noshim (\\"women's section\\") in the main synagogue or hall where it is taking place. The women present do not sing aloud and they generally do not receive the shirayim, although sometimes they do. A tish can vary in size from a handful to thousands of people. Large tishen are usually held in special rooms in the main building of a Hasidic movement. Sometimes they are held in the main synagogue. Around the holidays, when thousands of Hasidim who live in other cities or countries come to pray and visit with their Rebbe joining the Hasidim who live near the Rebbe and things can get very crowded, they are sometimes held in a large temporary structure. Small tishen are often conducted in private homes, particularly when a Hasidic Rebbe is visiting another community. These events are usually open to the public. Farbrengen Among Lubavitcher Hasidim, a gathering known as a farbrengen () is celebrated, similar to a tish. A farbrengen may be conducted with or without the presence of a Rebbe, and even with the presence of only a few Hasidim. At a farbrengen, zemiros are generally not sung (with the exception of the zemiros of the Arizal for each Sabbath meal), but rather only niggunim.

He was an anti-Vietnam war and civil rights activist. In the summer of 1967, he attended the Shaker Village summer program, and was a bunkmate of Ben Chaney, brother of James Chaney, one of the three murdered civil rights workers who died on a voting registration drive in Mississippi in 1964. The events were portrayed in Alan Parker's 1988 film Mississippi Burning. Two months before graduation, French dropped out of George Washington High School, as a protest to the student murders at Kent State University on May 4, 1970.  Career  = 1970s = French auditioned in 1972 for an early version of Wicked Lester, featuring Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley. In December of that year, he joined the New Jersey-based glitter band Silverstar, which changed its name in 1973 to Twisted Sister. The band also included Michael Valentine (vocals), Billy Diamond (guitar), Kenneth Harrison Neill (bass) and Mell Star (drums). In 1975, French hired Rick Prince on vocals and Keith Angel on guitars. Soon after, French took over the vocals. In late 1975, Eddie Ojeda replaced Keith Angel on guitars, and Daniel Dee Snider joined the band in February 1976, to relieve French from his vocalist duties.

Adler's father was Nathan Marcus Adler, Chief Rabbi of the British Empire. He traveled extensively and built an enormous library, particularly of old Jewish documents. Adler was among the first to explore the documents stored in the Cairo Genizah, being in fact the first European to enter it. During his visits to Cairo in 1888 and 1895 Adler collected and brought over 25,000 Genizah manuscript fragments back to England. Adler was particularly interested in the history of Persian (Iranian) Jews. He traveled to Tehran and Bukhara in 1896 and 1897, where he purchased various Hebrew and Judeo-Persian manuscripts and later published descriptive lists of their contents. These publications provided Western scholars with critical insight into the cultural, literary, and intellectual endeavors pursued by the Jews of Iran. The manuscripts collected by Adler include both religious and secular works on various topics, including stories, folklore, calendars, biblical and Talmudic dictionaries, prayer books, liturgical hymns, discourses on Kabbalah (Jewish mysticism), and chronicles of religious persecution. In his 1921 summary, Catalogue of Hebrew Manuscripts in the Collection of E. N. Adler, Adler described over 4,500 manuscripts in his collection. Encyclopedia Iranica Overall, Adler collected some 30,000 printed books in Judaica. Unfortunately for him, a business associate's embezzlement forced him to sell most of his library to the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York City and Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati in 1923. Moreover, Adler agreed to bequeath his subsequent acquisitions to the Jewish Theological Seminary upon his death. During a visit to Egypt in 1924, Adler acquired a recently discovered jar that contained the private archive of an Egyptian mercenary, Horos son of Nechoutes (c. 145-88 BC), and he personally contributed to the edition of the documents which were published as The Adler Papyri. Adler published many books about his travels and on his extensive collections, including About Hebrew Manuscripts (1905), A Gazetteer of Hebrew Printing (1917); Jews in Many Lands (1905); Auto de Fe and Jew (1908); History of the Jews of London (1930); Jewish Travellers (1930, repr. 1966); and articles on the Samaritans and on the History of the Jews in Egypt and Persia. Adler was extremely active in English-Jewish communal affairs, especially in education, and was an ardent Zionist; he was an early member of the Hovevei Zion in England. Per his will, his personal archives are now at the library of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America.

It literally means \\"Fair snow\\". The Celtic version of the name \\"Finnerty\\" is \\"Fionnachta\\" or \\"O' Fionnachta\\"; \\"Fionnachta\\" is a composite of two Celtic words: Fionn and Sneachta; Fionn in Celtic means \\"fair\\" - as in shade of white, and Sneachta means \\"snow\\"; \\"Fionn- Sneachta\\" (i.e. \\"fair snow\\" literally - but meaning ‚Äúsnow-white\\") was a man or a woman with snow-white hair, or snow-white skin: or possibly both. It seems people of such appearance were greatly revered by the ancient Celts. Similarly for people with snow-white skin and red hair; and Queen Meave of Connacht - who the ancient Celts believed was a goddess (and not a human being) ‚Äì is thought to be one such person. There is a very similar Celtic word to \\"Fionnachta\\" (which can be seen in modern Irish Language dictionaries) spelled \\"Fionnachta√≠\\"; and the English meanings given are \\"discoverer\\" and \\"inventor\\". Whether or not there is any substantial relationship between the origins of these two words is not known. When Ireland came fully under English control (in the 1600s) all, or almost all, Celtic family names (and place names) were forced through a very \\"rough and ready, any old way will do\\" translation process which was highly distorting: often (and perhaps deliberately) to an extent which meant the end result was completely meaningless in all languages. In this hit-or-miss way, busy English scribes ‚Äì who would have had no knowledge of Celtic languages (or very little) ‚Äì quickly wrote down place names on maps, and drew up lists of tenants' names etc., based on what they heard and what was easiest for them to pronounce. Under these circumstances, √ì Fionnachta was transformed into Finnerty by one scribe, to O'Finaghty or Finaghty by another, and so on. Some of the other variations we know of include: O'Fenaghty, Fenaughty, Finaughity, Feenaghty, Fennaghty, Fennaughty, Finerty, Finnearty, O'Finnearty, Finnarty, Fennerty, Fenerty, Fenety, Fenarty, and Finnesty. Had the English scribes been more accurate then, \\"√ì Fionnachta\\" would probably have been translated to \\"Fairsnow\\", or \\"Snowfair\\". The earliest written recorded reference regarding a permanent Finnerty \\"birth place\\" appears in the \\"Annals of the Four Masters\\" (written between 1632 and 1636); and it very firmly links the √ì Fionnachta family with an ancient fortress where Donamon Castle which stands approximately 10 miles due west of Roscommon town (in the Province of Connacht). The site on which Donamon Castle now stands is believed to be one of the very oldest and longest inhabited sites in Ireland. (Since 1939 it has been home to the Irish branch of the Divine Word Missionaries community.) There are further references linking \\"Fionn Sneachta\\" kings to Ulster, Rathcrogan, and Tara. According to Annals of the Four Masters, the first \\"Fionn Sneachta\\" King of Ireland reigned from 1277 to 1257 BC.

Additionally, busts of Schiller, Shakespeare, and Goethe are to be found. The auditorium is built in the neo-rococo style and seats approximately 1200 people. Corporate archives and historical library collections are held at the music department of the Predigerkirche Z√ºrich. The Opera House also holds concerts by its Philharmonia orchestra, matinees, Lieder evenings and events for children. Opera Ball is organised every year in March, and is usually attended by prominent names.  Opera Studio  The Z√ºrich Opera House is also home of the International Opera Studio (in German: Internationales Opernstudio IOS) which is a educational program for young singers and pianists. The studio was created in 1961 and has renowned artists currently teaching such as Brigitte Fassbaender, Hedwig Fassbender, Andreas Homocki, Rosemary Joshua, Adrian Kelly, Fabio Luisi, Jetske Mijnssen, Ann Murray, Eytan Pessen or Edith Wiens. Youth protests of 1980 In response to the combination of high subsidies for the Opera and the lack of cultural programs for the youth in Z√ºrich, large protests were held in May 1980. The protests became known as the Opernhauskrawalle youth protests ‚Äì Z√ºri br√§nnt, meaning Zurich is burning, as documented in the 1981 Swiss documentary film of the same name.

Around the time that the Vandals and other Alans under Respendial crossed the Rhine in 405 or 406, Goar's band of Alans quickly joined the Romans, and subsequently played a role in the internal politics of Gaul.  Biography  = Joining the Romans = Goar is first mentioned as 'Goare' in the Frigeridus fragment, embedded in Gregory of Tours's work, describing the Vandal‚ÄìFrankish war that preceded the Crossing of the Rhine (the crossing was dated to 31 December 406 by Prosper of Aquitaine). According to Frigeridus, the Roman-allied Franks were inflicting heavy casualties on the Vandals over the course of probably several battles, killing 20,000 Vandal warriors and their king Godigisel, and were on the verge of exterminating the tribe. At that point ‚Äì according to MacDowall (2016) probably in the summer or autumn of 406 ‚Äì another Alan king, Respendial, came to the Vandals' rescue and defeated the Franks, \\"although Goar had gone over to the Romans.\\" It's unclear from Frigeridus' account whether Goar actually joined the Franks in fighting against the Vandals and Respendial's Alans; but in any case, other sources make clear that Goar's Alans were eventually settled in Gaul near Orl√©ans by the Romans, while the Vandals, Suevi, and Respendial's Alans continued into Spain. According to bishop Hydatius' chronicle, the Vandals were the first to arrive in Spain in September or October 409, while Gregory notes that Suebi and Alans (presumably those led by Respendial) followed them later.Gregory of Tours, History of the Franks. Book II. Chapter 9. It is not stated where these groups originated, although most historians identify these Alans with those settled by Gratian in Pannonia c. 380. = Usurpation of Jovinus = Goar next appears in 411, when he and Gundahar, king of the Burgundians, joined in setting up the Gallo-Roman senator Jovinus as Roman Emperor at Mainz (as described by Olympiodorus of Thebes). At the time, another usurping emperor, Constantine III, was being besieged at Arles by Honorius' general, the future emperor Constantius III. Constantine's supporters in northern Gaul defected to Jovinus, contributing to Constantine's defeat. Jovinus then threatened Constantius with \\"Burgundians, Alamanni, Franks, Alans, and all his army\\" (presumably including Goar). Jovinus' usurpation was put down two years later, however, when the Visigoths entered Gaul after their sack of Rome the previous year. The Visigothic king Athaulf, after a period of indecision, sided with the government of Honorius in Ravenna and defeated Jovinus at Valentia. The Alan and Burgundian response to this defeat is not recorded. = Siege of Bazas = After defeating Jovinus, the Visigoths came into renewed conflict with Honorius; this conflict culminated with the siege of Bazas in 414. According to Paulinus of Pella, who was among the besieged at the time, the Visigoths were supported by a group of Alans (whose king he describes, but does not name). Paulinus, who had previously established a friendship with the Alan king, persuaded him to break with the Goths and side with the Roman defenders of the city. The Alan leader did so, turning over his wife and son to the Romans as hostages. The Visigoths thereupon withdrew from Bazas and retreated to Spain, while the Alans were settled as Roman allies. Historians are divided as to whether Paulinus' unnamed Alan king should be identified with Goar, or with some other Alan leader‚Äîotherwise unknown‚Äîwho might have been accompanying the Visigoths since Italy or before. The former identification would imply that Goar had allied himself with Athaulf after the Goths' defeat of Jovinus; the latter hypothesis would imply that from this time on there was a second, distinct group of Alans in Gaul, in addition to those of Goar. = Bishop Germanus of Auxerre = In his Life of St. Germanus of Auxerre, Constantius of Lyon describes a confrontation between Germanus and a king of the Alans c. 446. This king had been ordered by Aetius to put down a revolt of Bagaudae in Armorica, but Germanus persuaded him to hold off his attack while he got confirmation of the orders from the emperor in Italy. Constantius gives the name of this king as \\"Eochar\\", but many historians see this as a scribal error for \\"Gochar\\" (since Goar's name appears in some sources in this form). Other historians object to this identification, since it would imply that Goar's career as leader of the Alans lasted over forty years. Also, the Chronica Gallica of 452 reports that another Alan leader, Sambida, was given land around Valentia in 440, several years before Germanus' confrontation with the Alans. If only one kingdom of Alans is assumed to have existed in Gaul, this would imply that Goar had already been succeeded by Sambida before 440, and that Sambida was then succeeded by Eochar. If, on the other hand, two kingdoms are assumed, Eochar could be identical to Goar, a successor of Goar, or a successor of Sambida. The Chronica Gallica describes another grant of land to Alans by Aetius two years later (442), in which the Romans occupying the land opposed the grant and had to be driven out by force. Neither the leader of these Alans, nor the location of the land, is mentioned in the Chronica; but many historians associate this event with Goar as well. In any case, Goar's Alans are universally identified with the Alans of Orl√©ans, who helped repel Attila's invasion in 451, and who were led at that time by Sangiban‚Äîputting the end of Goar's reign, if the identification with Eochar is accepted, somewhere between 446 and 450.

In the early 1970s he recorded a couple of singles with a band called SPX, with Alan Diaz, Charlie Mercado and Frank Lopez. He joined Twisted Sister in 1975. In 1989 he started the band Scarecrow. He also recorded a solo album named Axes To Axes in 2005 featuring Dee Snider, Ronnie James Dio and Rudy Sarzo among others. In a 2006 interview with rock & roll comic C.C. Banana, Eddie revealed if Twisted Sister ever retired that it would still be possible for the band to continue performing under their alternate name Bent Brother. Eddie, along with other popular rock guitarists in the mid-80's, performed in the Hear 'n Aid project, launched by Ronnie James Dio, which had a similar goal as both Band Aid and USA for Africa. In 2006 he is heard singing in Spanish on the Twisted Sister album \\"A Twisted Christmas\\" as well as playing drums on the album. Eddie toured with Steve Steinman on the \\"Vampires Rock\\" tour in late 2007.  Bullseye guitar  Eddie is best known for his custom black/red \\"bullseye\\" guitar. In an interview, he explained that the bullseye was part of the original design of the Twisted Sister logo. The first version of the guitar was manufactured by Charvel in the 1980s. Eddie's current version is by Wayne Guitars, a company founded by Charvel's former owner, Wayne Charvel. He also uses a red/white bullseye Kramer USA 1984 Reissue. There has been much debate on whether or not Zakk Wylde stole Eddie's bullseye design for his guitars. According to an interview, Eddie never talked to Zakk about it. Furthermore, Zakk claims that his bullseye graphic was actually a mistake by the paint shop; it was originally going to be a spiral reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock's film Vertigo.  Personal life  According to Dee Snider, Ojeda is Spanish/Puerto Rican. In the 1970s, Ojeda underwent throat surgery, which inspired the 1982 Twisted Sister hit \\"Under the Blade\\" and in 2019 he underwent surgery for a ruptured disk. In May 2019, in an interview with \\"22 Now\\", Ojeda said he would be relocating to Nashville.

It was among the first Australian books for children to draw on Australian Aboriginal mythology.\\"Patricia Wrightson obituary\\" Julia Eccleshare guardian.co.uk, Sunday 9 May 2010 The book was the winner of the 1974 Children's Book Council of Australia Children's Book of the Year Award for Older Readers, and Patricia Wrightson was awarded an Order of the British Empire in 1977, largely for this work. The story was adapted for television and screened as a mini-series in Australia in 1981.  Plot  The story is set in Australia, and involves an orphaned city boy named Simon Brent who comes to live on a 5000-acre sheep station called Wongadilla, in the Hunter Region, with his mother's second cousins, Edie and Charlie. In a remote valley on the property he discovers a variety of ancient Australian Aboriginal Dreamtime creatures. The arrival of heavy machinery intent on clearing the land brings to life the ominous stone Nargun. The Nargun is a creature drawn from tribal legends of the Gunai or Kurnai people of the area now known as the Mitchell River National Park in Victoria. Other creatures featured in the story include the mischievous green-scaled water-spirit Potkoorok, the Turongs (tree people) and the Nyols (cave people).

Most scholars believe the libretto was prepared by Charles Jennens, who also compiled the biblical texts for Handel's Messiah. It is composed entirely of selected passages from the Old Testament, mainly from Exodus and the Psalms. Israel in Egypt premiered at London's King's Theatre in the Haymarket on April 4, 1739 with √âlisabeth Duparc \\"La Francesina\\", William Savage, John Beard (tenor), Turner Robinson, Gustavus Waltz, and Thomas Reinhold. Handel started it soon after the opera season at King's Theatre was cancelled for lack of subscribers. The oratorio was not well received by the first audience though commended in the Daily Post; the second performance was shortened, the mainly choral work now augmented with Italian-style arias. The first version of the piece is in three parts rather than two, the first part more famous as \\"The ways of Zion do mourn\\", with altered text as \\"The sons of Israel do mourn\\" lamenting the death of Joseph. This section precedes the Exodus, which in the three-part version is Part II rather than Part I. Background The Kings Theatre, London, in the Haymarket, where Israel in Egypt was first performed Handel had long been resident in London and had enjoyed great success as a composer of Italian operas there. However, in 1733 a rival opera company to Handel's, The Opera of the Nobility, had split the audience for Italian opera in London. There was not enough support for two Italian opera companies and Handel began to find new audiences through presenting oratorio and other choral works in English. Handel's oratorio Saul, with a text by Charles Jennens, was presented at the King's Theatre in January 1739, and for the same season Handel composed Israel in Egypt, writing the music in one month between 1 October and 1 November 1738. Israel in Egypt is one of only two oratorios by Handel with a text compiled from verses from the Bible, the other being Messiah. The librettist of Israel in Egypt is uncertain, but most scholars believe Charles Jennens compiled both texts. Israel in Egypt and Messiah also share the unusual characteristic among Handel oratorios in that, unlike the others, they do not have casts of named characters singing dialogue and performing an unstaged drama, but contain many choruses set to biblical texts. In composing Israel in Egypt, in what was by then his common practice, Handel recycled music from his own previous compositions and also made extensive use of musical parody, the re-working of music by other composers.Winton Dean, \\"An Oratorio by Accident?\\" liner notes to the recording by John Eliot Gardiner, Decca 478 1374 For the opening part of Israel in Egypt Handel slightly re-wrote his 1737 Funeral Anthem for Queen Caroline, \\"The Ways of Zion do Mourn\\", and he adapted two of his keyboard fugues, a chorus from his Dixit Dominus and an aria from one of his Chandos Anthems. From Alessandro Stradella's wedding serenata Qual prodigio √© ch‚Äôio miri, Handel took the music for his \\"plague\\" choruses \\"He spake the word,‚Äù ‚ÄúHe gave them hailstones,‚Äù ‚ÄúBut as for his people/He led them,‚Äù and ‚ÄúAnd believed the Lord,‚Äù as well as the Part II chorus ‚ÄúThe people shall hear/All th‚Äôinhabitants of Canaan.‚Äù. From a Magnificat setting by Dionigi Erba, Handel took most or part of the music for ‚ÄúHe rebuked the Red Sea,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Lord is my Strength,‚Äù ‚ÄúHe is my God,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Lord is a Man of War,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe depths have covered them/Thy right Hand, o Lord,‚Äù ‚ÄúThou sentest forth thy wrath,‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd with the blast of thy nostrils,‚Äù ‚ÄúWho is like unto Thee,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThou in thy mercy.‚Äù Other composers Handel parodied in Israel in Egypt were Jean-Philippe Rameau, Johann Caspar Kerll, Francesco Antonio Urio, Nicolaus Adam Strungk and Friedrich Wilhelm Zachow. Much more than the previous works by Handel which were designed, like Israel in Egypt, to attract paying audiences to a commercial venture in a privately owned theatre, the piece lays overwhelming emphasis on the chorus. As an added attraction, the small baroque orchestra accompanying was also used for an organ concerto, the Cuckoo and the Nightingale, which served as an interlude. However, London audiences at that time were not used to such extensive choral pieces presented as commercial entertainment, and perhaps particularly the opening dirge, of about thirty minutes in length, for the death of Joseph, adapted from the funeral anthem for a recently deceased Queen, contributed to the failure of Israel in Egypt at its first performance. Handel quickly revised the work, omitting the opening \\"Lamentations\\" section and adding Italian-style arias of the kind contemporary audiences expected and enjoyed. In its two sectioned form, Israel in Egypt was very popular in the 19th century with choral societies. Today many performances of the work use Handel's original three part version. Synopsis =Part One= The Israelites Mourn, from a 1728 illustrated Bible The Israelites mourn the death of Joseph, Israelite and favoured adviser to Pharaoh, King of Egypt. The first part includes the Chorus 'The Sons of Israel Do Mourn' and 'How is the Mighty Fallen'. =Part Two= Martin, John ‚Äì The Seventh Plague ‚Äì 1823 An announcement is made that a new Pharaoh has come to the throne who does not look kindly on the Israelites. God chooses Moses to lead his people out of bondage. A series of plagues falls on Egypt: the rivers turn to blood; a plague of frogs affects the land; the Egyptian livestock get a sickness and die; blotches and blisters break out on the skin of cattle and people; flies and lice swarm everywhere; locusts appear and destroy all the crops; hailstorms blight the country; a palpable darkness descends; and, finally, the eldest born sons of all the Egyptians are struck down dead. The ruler of Egypt agrees to let the Israelites depart, but changes his mind and pursues them. The Red Sea miraculously parts to let the Israelites cross in safety, but when the pursuing Egyptians try to cross, the waters engulf them and they are drowned. =Part Three= thumbThe Crossing of The Red Sea by Nicolas Poussin The Israelites celebrate their deliverance.A series of joyful choruses are included in the third part, with the piece concluding with a soprano solo and chorus proclaiming that 'the Lord shall reign for ever and ever' and 'the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea'. Very early wax cylinder recording of excerpt For a long time, the earliest known recording of music known to still exist was an excerpt from this oratorio conducted by August Manns. The recording was of several thousand singers singing \\"Moses and the Children of Israel\\" in the Crystal Palace Handel Festival of June 29, 1888, recorded by Col. George Gouraud on Edison's yellow paraffin cylinder. The limitations of recording technology at that time, together with the number of voices, the distance of the recording device from the singers and the acoustics of the Crystal Palace, mean that the recorded sound was dim to begin with, and it has since then become badly degraded. What survives is barely audible but still identifiable by ear, and gives some insight into performance practices at the height of the Handel Festival phenomenon. {align=right  } References External links  full- text libretto hosted by Stanford * Three small excerpts in mp3 & ogg by Swiss choir and orchestra on period instruments Category:Oratorios by George Frideric Handel Category:1739 compositions Category:Oratorios based on the Bible ","title":"Israel in Egypt"},{"id":"3892183","text":"Louis d'Ailleboust de Coulonge (c. 1612, Ancy-le-Franc - 31 May 1660, Montreal) was the French governor of New France from 1648 to 1651 and acting governor from 1657 to 1658. He built what is today known as Duke of Kent House, Quebec.  Biography  He was born at Ancy-le-Franc into a noble family, the son of Antoine d'Ailleboust and Suzanne Hotman. His grandfather was Francois Hotman. He was trained as a military engineer. He went to Ville- Marie (now Montr√©al) in 1643 and played a leading role there; he was an acting governor of Montreal. After being named governor in 1648, he tried in vain to prevent the Iroquois from annihilating most of the Hurons, who had allied themselves with the French settlers. On 17 May 1657, at Saint-Nazaire, Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve and d‚ÄôAilleboust, as well as three Sulpicians (Gabriel Souart, Antoine d'Allet, and Dominique Galinier) under the leadership of Gabriel de Queylus, the first superior of Saint-Sulpice at Montreal, boarded the ship bound for Canada.

He also was born into being the lord of Lirec. As a prominent lawyer in France, in 1613 Lauzon was appointed a counsellor in the Parliament. He served in several government positions, including president of the Grand Conseil, intendant of Provence, then of Guyenne, and of Dauphin√©. Lauzon had been developing interests in the colony of New France. He was a founding member and became the director of the Compagnie des Cent-Associ√©s. Lauzon used his influence within the company to obtain land for himself and his sons in the colony. By 1640, the Lauzons had become the biggest landowners in the colony. Their properties included the Island of Montreal and √éle d'Orl√©ans. Lauzon was appointed as governor in 1651. He moved with his three sons ‚Äì including Fran√ßois, the eldest, who was a member of Parliament for Bordeaux ‚Äì to the colony. His wife had apparently earlier died in France. All three sons married into other founding families of the colony after having been set up with various lands and positions within the area. The establishment of Lauzon's family in the colony was probably intended to inspire confidence amongst the settlers and encourage agriculture in addition to the fur trade. He was the first governor to pursue this type of policy. In 1653, Lauzon negotiated a peace treaty with the Mohawk, an Iroquois nation based in what is now New York. It ended their attacks on French settlers and reduced the threat to the colony for some years. Afterward, he accorded to himself the monopoly on the fur trade; settlers sought to open the trade by petitioning King Louis XIV. The king responded by ordering the fur trade to be reopened to all colonists. Lauzon returned to France, where he continued his business and political career. He died in 1666 at the age of 83, in Paris. One of his descendants, Marie-Catherine-Antoinette de Lauson, married Roland- Michel Barrin de La Galissoni√®re (1747‚Äì1749), who also served as Governor of Canada.

Appearing as a serial in the Japanese manga magazine Crimson from the March 1998 issue to the May 2003 issue, the chapters of Planet Ladder were published by Sobisha/Shueisha in seven tank≈çbon volumes from December 1998 to May 2004. Based on the Japanese folktale The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter in which a girl is discovered to be the princess of the moon, the story focuses on a teenager named Kaguya, who is prophesied to save only one of the nine parallel worlds, and her quest to bring peace to a warring universe while finding her true identity. Planet Ladder was licensed for an English-language translation in North America by Tokyopop, and released from April 2002 to March 2005 after being serialized in Tokyopop's manga anthology Smile. Planet Ladder was part of Tokyopop's line-up of manga in its original right-to-left format; previously, the majority of manga licensed in the United States was \\"flopped\\" to read left-to-right for a Western audience. Planet Ladder was positively received by English-language readers, with two volumes placing in ICv2's list of best-selling graphic novels. The series received generally positive reviews from English-language critics. On April 2, 2007, it went out of print in North America. Plot The series focuses on Kaguya Haruyama, a teenager who has lived with a Japanese foster family since she was found as an abandoned, amnesiac four-year-old. One night, two men‚ÄîIdou, a monk, and Seeu, an emotionless prince‚Äîappear in her home and fight over her. Gold, Seeu's robot modeled after Kaguya's deceased brother Kagami, brings her to a world parallel to Earth on Seeu's orders. After exploring the world with Gold, she encounters Shiina Mol Bamvivrie who believes Kaguya is the \\"Girl of Ananai\\", destined to save only one of the nine parallel worlds from collision. Shiina explains that nine worlds exist: Ancient, the first civilized world that was mysteriously destroyed; Asu, Seeu's disintegrated world; Eden, present-day Earth; Telene, a small world allied with Geo; Fifth World, a politically neutral world; Geus, a peaceful world under the control of Geo; Geo, the most powerful of the worlds; Asuraitsu, Geo's rival; and the Ninth World, destroyed before the start of the series. Shiina and Waseda, a Tokyo University student trapped in the body of a giant rooster, join her and Gold in traveling across Telene. After learning that Seeu watched his people die from an incurable virus spread around Asu, Kaguya decides to change the fate of the worlds by confronting Kura, Geo's indulgent emperor who ordered her kidnapping. Instead, while en route to Geo, Gold brings her to Seeu's floating castle in Asu and Kura captures and recruits Shiina into his army. Kaguya later makes an interplanetary broadcast, announcing her refusal to save only one world. Instead, she plans to find a person to help her save most of the worlds and people. Kura begins to destroy other worlds to increase Geo's survival chances. Deciding to use Kaguya as a political figurehead, Kura sends Shiina to abduct her; once there, Kaguya refuses to help him. Angered, Kura divulges that the \\"Girl of Ananai\\" legend is a myth elaborated on and spread around by him and Kagami. After a brief battle with Shiina, Seeu arrives to rescue Kaguya and she realizes her love for him. Transforming into a dragon, Gold teleports everyone to Ancient; there Idou, Seeu, Kura, and Shiina are persuaded to combine their magical weapons with Gold to fix the rift in the universe, the cause of the eventual collision between the worlds. The series ends with an epilogue seven years later; Kaguya explains the fate of everyone and meets Seeu and their young son with a picnic basket. Production Planet Ladder is based on the Japanese folktale The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter. According to manga artist Yuri Narushima, she began the manga with \\"a dramatic feeling in mind\\" and wanted to \\"start off with a comic book for young girls (sh≈çjo manga).\\" Narushima planned to have the plot progress quickly so the reader remembers the events and can \\"'digest' the foreshadowed events\\". Planet Ladder was based on the Japanese folktale The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter, which focuses on a girl named Kaguya-Hime who is discovered to be the princess of the moon. Additionally, the protagonist takes her name from the folktale. After discovering that a North American version of Planet Ladder was being simultaneously released, Narushima designed the cover of volume 6 to be \\"export friendly\\", describing it as \\"like Japanese style, but slightly off\\". Additionally, she considered serializing Planet Ladder in another magazine, but decided against it since the series was close to ending. Release Written and illustrated by Yuri Narushima, Planet Ladder appeared as a serial in the Japanese manga magazine Crimson from the March 1998 issue to the May 2003 issue. Sobisha/Shueisha later published the chapters in seven tank≈çbon volumes from December 1998 to May 2004. Shueisha re-released Planet Ladder in four bunkoban volumes from July 18, to August 8, 2008. Tokyopop licensed Planet Ladder for an English-language release in North America and serialized it in its manga magazine Smile. The first volume was released on April 23, 2002; the final volume was published on March 8, 2005. Planet Ladder belonged to Tokyopop's line-up of manga in its original right-to-left format; previously, the majority of manga licensed in the United States was \\"flopped\\" to read left-to-right for a Western audience. As a result, it was displayed in a case with the eight other \\"unflopped\\" manga‚ÄîChobits, Dragon Knights, Marmalade Boy, GTO, Real Bout High School, The Skull Man, Mars and Cowboy Bebop‚Äîand heavily advertised in anime magazines and on fan sites. Planet Ladder went out of print on April 2, 2007 in North America. Only the last two volumes were given titles in the English-language release: The Fate of the Dark Planet for volume six and Ananai of the Puzzled Star for the seventh volume. =Volume list=  Reception  Planet Ladder was positively received by English-language readers. The fifth volume placed in the 44th spot on the list of the 50 best-selling graphic novels of February 2003, with an estimated 1,176 copies sold. The sixth volume reached the 71st place on the list of the 100 best-selling graphic novels of February 2004, with an estimated 984 copies sold. Critical reaction to Planet Ladder was generally positive. In Manga: The Complete Guide, Jason Thompson wrote that the manga reminded him of \\"prose science fiction\\", citing A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L'Engle (1962) and Nine Princes in Amber by Roger Zelazny (1970) as examples. His criticism of the series centered on Narushima's \\"inconsistent designs, crude faces, and too much greasy looking screentone\\". While stating that Planet Ladder is a \\"difficult title to warm to, since it feels like we're in the middle of the story, rather than the beginning\\", Mike Dungan of Mania Entertainment considered the effort \\"worthy\\", and wrote that it made Kaguya more sympathetic at the cost of the other characters. Dungan enjoyed the \\"pleasant though not especially unique\\" art, the \\"attractively designed and well-drawn\\" characters, the occasional humor, and the overall adaptation, especially the \\"natural sounding dialogue\\". However, he criticized Tokyopop's inconsistent handling of the sound effects. Sequential Tarts Sheena McNeil praised the plot as original and noted elements from fairytales and fantasy in the series. In follow-up reviews, she praised the manga as \\"turning out to be one of the best fantasy manga out there; it stands apart from the rest with its uniqueness\\" but expressed her surprise that Sheena's name changed to Shiina halfway through the series with no explanation.

Ensay is north of the major town of Bairnsdale and east of the state capital Melbourne. Other nearby towns include Omeo and Benambra. The town centre is located north of the confluence of the Little and Tambo river; with an altitude of approximately AMSL. The population of Ensay was 109 as at the 2016 census. History The remains of the Ensay shearing sheds, formerly part of Ensay Station, on the Little River Rd The Aboriginal name for the area around Ensay was Numblamunjie, which translates as ‚Äòblackfish place‚Äô. Archibald Macleod (see Bairnsdale, History) set up a station in this area in 1843. He named it after the now unpopulated island of Ensay in the Outer Hebrides of his homeland of Scotland, whose name originates from the Old Norse for Ewe Island. Scottish Parliament Place Names Reference The land around Ensay was originally taken up in 1839 by the noted explorer of the district Angus McMillan on behalf of his then employer Lachlan Macalister. This was abandoned shortly afterwards in 1841 with the settlement of large areas of land in the more central parts of Gippsland. The original Ensay Station covered an enormous , which took in most of the Ensay district up to Swifts Creek, where it abutted the Tongio Station. Some areas very near Ensay, such as Reedy Flat, were outside the Ensay Station boundaries and were not occupied by European settlers until the 1870s. Ensay Station was progressively split up into smaller farms over the years. Notably the area became a site for soldier settlers following World War I, as returned servicemen looking for employment were allocated areas of land to farm by the government. Agricultural use of the land around Ensay remains chiefly for the raising of cattle and sheep. Facilities (past and present) The classic architecture of The Little River Inn The population of Ensay has contracted over the last few decades. In the past Ensay supported a primary school, a number of sporting teams and other facilities, including two significant pubs, two churches, a community hall, a Scout group and a cemetery. The Ensay Post Office opened on 1 March 1864. Several of these facilities continue to this day in some form. The Ensay Primary School (originally simply the Ensay School) opened in 1889 and was rebuilt in 1912. In 1971 three other local primary schools closed (at Reedy Flat, Ensay North and Tambo Crossing) and amalgamated with Ensay Primary School to form the Ensay Group School. Ensay Primary School itself closed in 1994 when the number of students dropped to about six. Following this local children were bussed to Swifts Creek Primary School, with older students attending Swifts Creek Secondary College, now merged to form Swifts Creek P-12 School. The Little River Inn originated as a shanty selling grog in the early 1840s. The first licence was taken out in 1847 and it has been continuously licensed since, remaining a popular local establishment to this day. This makes it the oldest hotel in the Omeo district and possibly the oldest in East Gippsland. The early Little River Inn seemed to be particularly susceptible to fire, having been burnt down at least three (and perhaps four) times in its history. The current building dates from the 1920s following the fire of 1921. At this time the building was rebuilt on its present site, a spot known at the time as Calcutta Corner. This hotel is around one kilometre from the official town centre, a short way down a side road east of the Great Alpine Road. For many years the Ensay Post Office ran from a small attachment to the Little River Inn. After the post office moved to the general store, a small bookshop ran for several years from this attachment, later relocating to the former Primary School building, and then to Swifts Creek, before closing down in 2014. When the general store in Ensay closed about 2012, the post office relocated to again operate from the Little River Inn. The Ensay South Hotel, now sited on a small loop road off the Great Alpine Road about half a kilometre south of the town, was established in 1892 and closed in 1961. A bush nursing facility was established at Ensay in 1912, with a new building established in 1958. In 1978 this became known as the Ensay Community Health Centre and now includes a Rural Ambulance Depot. Ensay also has a Country Fire Authority (CFA) depot, originally established in 1940 as the Ensay Bush Fire Brigade. Ensay is the nearest town to the folk art sculpture Mr. Stringy, which is located about south alongside the Great Alpine Road. Sports Ensay New Year's Day Sports Carnival, 2006 In Australian rules football the Ensay Football Club competed for many decades in the Omeo District Football League (ODFL). The football team won premierships in 1934, 1936, 1940, 1946, 1947, 1950 and 1960. The affiliated Ensay Netball Club competed in the associated netball competition. The Ensay colours were blue and gold. Earlier Ensay football jumpers were a golden-yellow vee on a royal blue background. Late in their time Ensay changed their jumper to the early design of the West Coast Eagles AFL club. The netball club wore a yellow top with blue skirt. The clubs played their last matches in 1995 when they struggled to field teams at the start of the season, finally folding after a few rounds. The recreation reserve is still kept in good condition and hosts occasional special games, including the ODFL final series and Grand Final annually. Ensay Tennis Club competes in the Omeo District Tennis Association (ODTA). The tennis club maintained a strong presence for several years after the football and netball teams folded, but itself briefly ceased playing for the 2001/2002 and 2002/2003 seasons. Ensay revived for the 2003/2004 season and again takes part in the ODTA competition. Ensay also hosts the annual ANA Tournament on the Australia Day Weekend each year in late January, a long running and successful tennis tournament attracting entries from widely scattered areas. A New Year's Day Sports' Carnival is also held annually in Ensay, chiefly consisting of a number of equestrian and novelty events. This annual carnival has been a local fixture of the surrounding community since 1916. Various other equestrian events are also held at the Ensay Recreation Reserve, and the reserve also features a lawn bowling green. The New Year's Day Sports Carnival is no longer held.

Christianity was probably introduced to what is now Lowland Scotland by Roman soldiers stationed in the north of the province of Britannia. After the collapse of Roman authority in the fifth century, Christianity is presumed to have survived among the British enclaves in the south of what is now Scotland, but retreated as the pagan Anglo-Saxons advanced. Scotland was largely converted by Irish missions associated with figures such as St Columba, from the fifth to the seventh centuries. These missions founded monastic institutions and collegiate churches that served large areas. Scholars have identified a distinctive form of Celtic Christianity, in which abbots were more significant than bishops, attitudes to clerical celibacy were more relaxed and there were significant differences in practice with Roman Christianity, particularly the form of tonsure and the method of calculating Easter, although most of these issues had been resolved by the mid-seventh century. After the reconversion of Scandinavian Scotland in the tenth century, Christianity under papal authority was the dominant religion of the kingdom. In the Norman period, from the eleventh to the thirteenth centuries, the Scottish church underwent a series of reforms and transformations. With royal and lay patronage, a clearer parochial structure based around local churches was developed. Large numbers of new monastic foundations, which followed continental forms of reformed monasticism, began to predominate. The Scottish church also established its independence from England, developing a clear diocesan structure and becoming a \\"special daughter of the see of Rome\\", but continued to lack Scottish leadership in the form of Archbishops. In the late Middle Ages the problems of schism in the Catholic Church allowed the Scottish Crown to gain greater influence over senior appointments and two archbishoprics had been established by the end of the fifteenth century. Historians have discerned a decline in traditional monastic life in the late Middle Ages, but the mendicant orders of friars grew, particularly in the expanding burghs, emphasised preaching and ministering to the population. New saints and cults of devotion also proliferated. Despite problems over the number and quality of clergy after the Black Death in the fourteenth century, and evidence of heresy in the fifteenth century, the Church in Scotland remained stable before the Reformation in the sixteenth century. Early Middle Ages =Early Christianisation= An illuminated page from the Book of Kells, which may have been produced at Iona around 800 Before the Middle Ages, most of the population of what is now Scotland probably practised a form of Celtic polytheism.B. Cunliffe, The Ancient Celts (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997), , p. 184.P. Dunbavin, Picts and Ancient Britons: an Exploration of Pictish Origins (Third Millennium Publishing, 1998), , p. 41. Evidence of Christian symbols and the destruction of the shrines of other religions, suggest that Roman occupation brought Christianity to the north of Britannia (the name they gave to the province under their control in the southern part of the island). From there it may have spread to parts of what they called Caledonia (roughly corresponding to what is now Scotland).L. Alcock, Kings and Warriors, Craftsmen and Priests in Northern Britain AD 550‚Äì850 (Edinburgh: Society of Antiquaries of Scotland), , p. 63.Lucas Quensel von Kalben, \\"The British Church and the Emergence of the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom\\", in T. Dickinson and D. Griffiths, eds, Anglo-Saxon Studies in Archaeology and History, 10: Papers for the 47th Sachsensymposium, York, September 1996 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), , p. 93. After the collapse of Roman authority in the early fifth century, four major circles of influence emerged in Northern Britain. In the east were the Picts, whose kingdoms eventually stretched from the river Forth to Shetland. In the west were the Gaelic (Goidelic)-speaking people of D√°l Riata, who had close links with Ireland, from where they brought with them the name Scots. In the south were the British (Brythonic-speaking) descendants of the peoples of the Roman- influenced kingdoms of \\"The Old North\\", the most powerful and longest surviving of which was the Kingdom of Strathclyde. Finally, there were the English or \\"Angles\\", Germanic invaders who had overrun much of southern Britain and held the Kingdom of Bernicia (later the northern part of Northumbria), which reached into what are now the Borders of Scotland in the south-east.J. R. Maddicott and D. M. Palliser, eds, The Medieval State: essays presented to James Campbell (London: Continuum, 2000), , p. 48. While the Picts and Scots would have remained pagan, most scholars presume that Christianity would have survived after the departure of the Romans among the Brythonic enclaves, but retreated as the pagan Anglo-Saxons advanced.O. Davies, Celtic Spirituality (Mahwah, NJ: Paulist Press, 1999), , p. 21. The Christianisation of Scotland was carried out by Irish-Scots missionaries and to a lesser extent those from Rome and England. Richard Fletcher argued that motivations may have included the example of St. Patrick, the idea of Peregrinatio and a growing interest in evangelism.R. A. Fletcher, The Barbarian Conversion: From Paganism to Christianity (University of California Press, 1999), , pp. 231‚Äì3. In the sixth century missionaries from Ireland were operating on the British mainland. This movement is traditionally associated with the figures of St Ninian, St Kentigern and St Columba. Ninian is now regarded as a later construct and may have been the result of scribal confusion with the Irish saint Finnian.R. A. Fletcher, The Barbarian Conversion: from Paganism to Christianity (Berkeley CA: University of California Press, 1999), , pp. 79‚Äì80.Thomas Owen Clancy, \\"The real St Ninian\\", The Innes Review, 52 (2001). There was a church dedicated to him at Whithorn in the sixth century and from there St Kentigern seems to have created a new centre of worship at Govan or Inchinnan, from where Christian influence extended across the Strathclyde region.A. Macquarrie, Medieval Scotland: Kinship and Nation (Thrupp: Sutton, 2004), , p. 46.B. Webster, Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity (New York City, NY: St. Martin's Press, 1997), , pp. 50‚Äì1. St Columba was probably a disciple of Finnian. He left Ireland after being exiled, and founded the monastery at Iona off the west coast of Scotland in 563. From there missions were carried out to western Argyll and the islands around Mull. Later the influence of Iona would extend to the Hebrides. In the seventh century, St. Aidan went from Iona to found a church at Lindisfarne off the east coast of Northumbria. The influence of Lindisfarne would spread through the kingdom of Northumbria into what is now south-east Scotland. The result was a series of overlapping and informally organised churches.B. Webster, Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity (New York City, NY: St. Martin's Press, 1997), , p. 51. Iona emerged as the most important religious centre, partly as a result of the work of Adomnan, who was abbot there from 679 to 704. Although it is unclear whether the historic Columba did conduct missions outside of a small part of D√°l Riata, Adomnan's Life of St. Columba elevated him to become the apostle of North Britain in general.B.

The Class II Kirkyard stone c. 800 AD from Aberlemno The means and speed by which the Picts converted to Christianity is uncertain.B.

Smyth, Warlords and Holy Men: Scotland AD 80‚Äì1000 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1989), , pp. 82‚Äì3. Evidence for this includes the fact that St. Patrick, active in the fifth century, referred in a letter to \\"apostate Picts\\", indicating that they had previously been Christian, but had abandoned the faith. In addition the poem Y Gododdin, set in the early sixth century and probably written in what is now Scotland, does not remark on the Picts as pagans.G. Markus, \\"Conversion to Christianity\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 78‚Äì9. Conversion of the Pictish √©lite seems likely to have run over a considerable period, beginning in the fifth century and not complete until the seventh and conversion of the general population may have stretched into the eighth century. Among the key indicators of Christianisation are cemeteries containing long cists which are generally east-west in orientation.E. Proudfoot, \\"The Hallow Hill and the Origins of Christianity in Eastern Scotland\\", in B. E. Crawford, ed., Conversion and Christianity in the North Sea World: The Proceedings of a Day Conference held on 21 February 1998, St John's House Papers (St. Andrews, University of St. Andrews Press: 1998), , pp. 57 and 67‚Äì71. These cemeteries are suspected, or known to be Christian, because of their proximity to a church, or because of Christian inscriptions found in them.E. Proudfoot, \\"Archaeology and Early Christianity in Scotland\\", in E. H. Nicol, ed., A Pictish Panorama (Balgavies, Angus: Pinkfoot Press, 1995), , pp. 27‚Äì8. They are found for between the end of the Roman era in the early fifth century and the twelfth century. They are concentrated strongly in eastern Scotland south of the River Tay, in the modern East and Borders of Scotland.S. Foster, Picts, Gaels and Scots: Early Historic Scotland (London, 2004), , p. 77. Most scholars agree that the place-name element eccles-, from the Brythonic word for church, represents evidence of the British church of the Roman and immediate post-Roman period. Most of these in Scotland are located in the south of the country.G. W. S. Barrow, \\"The childhood of Scottish Christianity: a note on some place-name evidence\\", in Scottish Studies, 27 (1983), pp. 1‚Äì15. From the fifth and sixth centuries, inscribed stones indicate Christianity through their dedications and are spread across southern Scotland. The earliest is the so-called Latinus stone of Whithorn, dating to c. 450.J. E. Fraser, From Caledonia to Pictland: Scotland to 795 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2009), , p. 89. In the east and north, Class II Pictish stones began to show Christian symbolism from the early eighth century.B.

Early church buildings may originally have been wooden, like that excavated at Whithorn,J. R. Hume, Scotland's Best Churches (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), , p. 1. but of those for which evidence survives from this era are basic masonry- built churches, beginning on the west coast and islands and spreading south and east.I. Maxwell, A History of Scotland‚Äôs Masonry Construction in P. Wilson, ed., Building with Scottish Stone (Edinburgh: Arcamedia, 2005), , pp. 22‚Äì3. Early chapels tended to have square ended converging walls, similar to Irish chapels of this period.T. W. West, Discovering Scottish Architecture (Botley: Osprey, 1985), , p. 8. Medieval parish church architecture in Scotland was typically much less elaborate than in England, with many churches remaining simple oblongs, without transepts and aisles, and often without towers. In the Highlands they were often even simpler, many built of rubble masonry and sometimes indistinguishable from the outside from houses or farm buildings.I. D. Whyte and K. A. Whyte, The Changing Scottish Landscape, 1500‚Äì1800 (London: Taylor & Francis, 1991), , p. 117. =Celtic Christianity= The Celtic Church is a term that has been used by scholars to describe a specific form of Christianity with its origins in the conversion of Ireland, traditionally associated with St. Patrick. This form of Christianity later spread to northern Britain through Iona. It is also used as a general description for the Christian establishment of northern Britain prior to the twelfth century, when new religious institutions and ideologies of primarily French origin began to take root in Scotland. The Celtic form of Christianity has been contrasted with that derived from missions from Rome, which reached southern England in 587 under the leadership of St. Augustine of Canterbury. Subsequent missions from Canterbury then helped convert the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, reaching Northumbria in the early eighth century, where Iona had already begun to have a presence. As a result, Christianity in Northumbria became a mix of Celtic and Roman influences.B. Webster, Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity (New York City, NY: St. Martin's Press, 1997), , pp. 51‚Äì2. While Roman and Celtic Christianity were very similar in doctrine and both accepted ultimate papal authority, there were differences in practice.A. Macquarrie, Medieval Scotland: Kinship and Nation (Thrupp: Sutton, 2004), , pp. 52‚Äì3. The most contentious were the method of calculating Easter, and the form of head shaving for priests known as tonsure. Other differences were in the rites of ordination and baptism, and in the form of service of the liturgy. In addition scholars have identified significant characteristics of the organisation of Irish and Scottish Christianity as relaxed ideas of clerical celibacy, intense secularisation of ecclesiastical institutions, and the lack of a diocesan structure. This made abbots (or coarbs), rather than bishops, the most important element the church hierarchy.C. Corning, The Celtic and Roman Traditions: Conflict and Consensus in the Early Medieval Church (London: Macmillan, 2006), . The \\"Roman\\" tonsure: in the Irish tradition the hair above the forehead was shaved In the seventh century the Northumbrian church was increasingly influenced by the Roman form of Christianity. The careers of St. Wilfred (active from the 660s until his death in 709), abbot of the monastery at Ripon and Bishop of Northumbria, and Benedict Biscop (c. 628‚Äì690), founder of the monasteries of Jarrow and Wearmouth, intensified ties with Rome. Wilfred was the major spokesman for the Roman case at the Synod of Whitby in 664, which was called by king Oswiu of Northumbria to decide which form of observance would be used in his kingdom, and where he decided in favour of the Roman form of tonsure and of calculating Easter.B. Webster, Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity (New York City, NY: St. Martin's Press, 1997), , pp. 53‚Äì4. In this period the Kingdom of Northumbria was expanding into what is now Lowland Scotland. A bishopric established at Abercorn in the region of West Lothian, is presumed to have adopted Roman forms of Christianity after the Synod of Whitby. However, the Pictish victory at the Battle of Dunnichen in 685, ended the Northumbrian dominance of the region and the Bishop and his followers were ejected.J. N. G. Ritchie and A. Ritchie, Scotland, Archaeology and Early History (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd edn., 1991), , pp. 171‚Äì2. Nechtan mac Der- Ilei, king of the Picts from 706, seems to have attempted to establish links with the church in Northumbria. Before 714 he wrote to Ceolfrith, abbot of Wearmouth, asking for a formal refutation of the Irish position over the calculation of the date of Easter and for help in building a stone church \\"in the manner of the Romans\\". A. A. M. Duncan has suggested that there was a \\"Romanising group\\" among Nechtan's clergy, perhaps led by Bishop Curitan, who took the name Latin name Boniface. This is also suggested by the presence of a church at Rosemarkie in Ross and Cromarty, dedicated to St Peter, seen as the first Bishop of Rome, by the early eighth century, and subsequent similar dedications in Pictish territory.B. Webster, Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity (New York City, NY: St. Martin's Press, 1997), , p. 54. By the mid-eighth century, Iona and Ireland had accepted Roman practices.C. Evans, \\"The Celtic Church in Anglo-Saxon times\\", in J. D. Woods, D. A. E. Pelteret, The Anglo-Saxons, synthesis and achievement (Waterloo, Ontario: Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 1985), , pp. 77‚Äì89. Iona's place as the centre of Scottish Christianity was disrupted by the arrival of the Vikings, first as raiders, then as conquerors. Iona was sacked by Vikings 795 and 802. In 806 68 monks were killed and the next year the abbot withdrew to Kells in Ireland, taking the relics of St. Columba with him. There were periodic returns of abbots and relics, often ending in more massacres. Orkney, Shetland, Western Isles and the Hebrides eventually fell to the Pagan Norsemen, curtailing the influence of the church in the Highlands and Islands.W. E. Burns, A Brief History of Great Britain (Infobase Publishing, 2009), , pp. 44‚Äì5.R. Mitchison, A History of Scotland (London: Routledge, 3rd edn., 2002), , p. 9. The threat posed by the Vikings may have forced a union between the kingdoms of D√°l Riata and the Picts under Kenneth mac Alpin, traditionally dated to 843.B. Webster, Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity (New York City, NY: St. Martin's Press, 1997), , p. 15. In 849, according to the Annals of Ulster the abbot of Iona once again took Columba's relics to Ireland, but the earliest version of the Chronicles of the Kings of Scots says that in the same year they were removed by Kenneth mac Alpin, to a church he had built, probably at Dunkeld, perhaps indicating that the relics were divided. The abbot of the new monastery at Dunkeld emerged as the Bishop of the new combined Kingdom of Alba, which would subsequently come to be known as the Kingdom of Scotland. =Early monasticism= Abernethy round tower, c. 1100, demonstrates the influence of Irish architecture on Scottish monasteries\\"Abernethy round tower\\" Historic Scotland, retrieved 17 March 2012. While there were a series of reforms of monasticism in continental Europe and England, particularly those associated with Cluny in France from the tenth century, Scotland remained largely unaffected these until the late eleventh century. Physically Scottish monasteries differed significantly from those on the continent, and were often an isolated collection of wooden huts surrounded by a wall. The Irish architectural influence can be seen in surviving round towers at Brechin and Abernethy.A. A .M. Duncan, Scotland: The Making of the Kingdom (Edinburgh: Mercat Press, 1989), , pp. 104‚Äì05. Some early Scottish establishments had dynasties of abbots, who were often secular clergy with families, most famously at Dunkeld and Brechin; but these also existed across Scotland north of the Forth, as at Portmahomack, Mortlach, and Abernethy.A. Macquarrie, Medieval Scotland: Kinship and Nation (Thrupp: Sutton, 2004), , pp. 117‚Äì128. Perhaps in reaction to this secularisation, a reforming movement of monks called C√©li D√© (lit. \\"vassals of God\\"), anglicised as culdees, began in Ireland and spread to Scotland in the late eighth and early ninth centuries. Some C√©li D√© took vows of chastity and poverty and while some lived individually as hermits, others lived beside or within existing monasteries.B. Webster, Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity (New York City, NY: St. Martin's Press, 1997), , p. 58. In most cases, even after the introduction of new forms of reformed monasticism from the eleventh century, these C√©li D√© were not replaced and the tradition continued in parallel with the new foundations until the thirteenth century.A. Macquarrie, Medieval Scotland: Kinship and Nation (Thrupp: Sutton, 2004), , p. 121. Scottish monasticism played a major part in the Hiberno-Scottish mission, by which Scottish and Irish clergy undertook missions to the expanding Frankish Empire. They founded monasteries, often called Schottenkl√∂ster (meaning Gaelic monasteries in German), most of which became Benedictine establishments in what is now Germany. Scottish monks, such as St Cathr√≥e of Metz, became local saints in the region.David N. Dumville, \\"St Cathr√≥e of Metz and the Hagiography of Exoticism,\\" in John Carey, et al., eds, Irish Hagiography: Saints and Scholars (Dublin, 2001), pp. 172‚Äì6. High Middle Ages =Conversion of Scandinavian Scotland= Olav Tryggvasson, who is credited with the Christianisation of the Northern Isles While the official conversion of Scandinavian Scotland took place at the end of the tenth century, there is evidence that Christianity had already made inroads into the Viking controlled Highland and Islands. There are a large number of isles called Pabbay or Papa in the Western and Northern Isles, which may indicate a \\"hermit's\\" or \\"priest's isle\\" from this period. Changes in patterns of grave goods and Viking place names using -kirk also suggest that the Christianity had begun to spread before the official conversion. According to the Orkneyinga Saga, not written down until around 1230, the Northern Isles were Christianised by Olav Tryggvasson, king of Norway, in 995 when he stopped at South Walls on his way from Ireland to Norway. The King summoned the local jarl Sigurd the Stout and said \\"I order you and all your subjects to be baptised. If you refuse, I'll have you killed on the spot and I swear I will ravage every island with fire and steel\\".A. Macquarrie, Medieval Scotland: Kinship and Nation (Thrupp: Sutton, 2004), , pp. 67‚Äì8. The story may be apocryphal, but the islands became officially Christian, receiving their own bishop in the early eleventh century.D. E. R. Watt, (ed.), Fasti Ecclesia Scoticanae Medii Aevii ad annum 1638, Scottish Records Society (1969), p. 247. The bishopric appears to have been under the authority of the Archbishops of York and of Hamburg-Bremen at different points before the twelfth century and from then until 1472 it was subordinate to the Archbishop of Nidaros (today's Trondheim).\\"The Diocese of Orkney\\" Firth's Celtic Scotland, retrieved 9 September 2009. Elsewhere in Scandinavian Scotland the record is less clear. There was a Bishop of Iona until the late tenth century, followed by a gap of more than a century, possibly filled by the Bishops of Orkney, before the appointment of the first Bishop of Mann in 1079.Barbara E. Crawford, Scandinavian Scotland (Leicester: Leicester University Press, 1987), , pp. 82 and 220. One of the major effects of the conversion of the Vikings was to bring an end to plundering raids on Christian sites, which may have allowed them to recover some of their status as cultural and intellectual centres. It also probably curbed the excesses of Viking violence and led to a more settled society in northern Scotland.A. Macquarrie, Medieval Scotland: Kinship and Nation (Thrupp: Sutton, 2004), , pp. 69. =Reformed monasticism= Dundrennan Abbey, one of the many foundations of the twelfth century The introduction of continental forms of monasticism to Scotland is associated with Saxon princess Queen Margaret (c. 1045‚Äì93), the second wife of M√°el Coluim III (r. 1058‚Äì93), although her exact role is unclear. It is known that she was in communication with Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, and he provided a few monks for a new Benedictine abbey at Dunfermline (c. 1070). Subsequent foundations under Margaret's sons, Edgar (r. 1097‚Äì1107), Alexander (r. 1107‚Äì24) and particularly David I (r. 1124‚Äì53), tended to be of the reformed type that followed the lead set by Cluny Abbey in the Loire from the late tenth century. Most belonged to the new religious orders that originated in France in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. These stressed the original Benedictine virtues, but also contemplation and service of the Mass and were followed in various forms by reformed Benedictine, Augustinian and Cistercian houses. This period also saw the introduction of more sophisticated forms of church architecture that had become common on the Continent and in England, known collectively as Romanesque. These used rectangular ashlar blocks that allowed massive reinforced walls and round arches that could bear the weight of rounded barrel vault roofs and could incorporate refined architectural moulding and detailing.M .Perry, M. Chase, J. R. Jacob, M. C. Jacob, T. H. Von Laue, Western Civilization: Ideas, Politics, and Society (Cengage Learning, 2012), , p. 270.T. W. West, Discovering Scottish Architecture (Botley: Osprey, 1985), , p. 10. The Augustinians, dedicated to the Order of Saint Augustine and founded in northern Italy in the eleventh century, established their first priory in Scotland at Scone, with the sponsorship by Alexander I in 1115. By the early thirteenth century Augustinians had settled alongside, taken over or reformed C√©li D√© establishments at St Andrews, St Serf's Inch, Inchcolm, Inchmahome, Inchaffray, Restenneth and Iona, and had created numerous new establishments, such as Holyrood Abbey. The Cistercians, originating from the village of C√Æteaux, near Dijon in eastern France, achieved two important Scottish foundations, at Melrose (1136) and Dundrennan (1142), and the Tironensians, named after the location of the mother abbey Tiron Abbey near Chartres in France, achieved foundations at Selkirk, then Kelso, Arbroath, Lindores and Kilwinning.G. W. S. Barrow, Kingship and Unity: Scotland 1000‚Äì1306 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1989), , p. 81. Cluniacs founded an abbey at Paisley, the Premonstratensians, originating at Pr√©montr√© near Laon in Picardy, had foundations at Whithorn and the Valliscaulians, named after their first monastery at Val-des-Choux in Burgundy, at Pluscarden. The military orders entered Scotland under David I, with the Knights Templer founding Balantrodoch in Midlothian and the Knights Hospitallers being given Torphichen, West Lothian. =Cult of Saints= The Monymusk Reliquary, or Brecbennoch, said to house the bones of Columba Like every other Christian country, one of the main features of Medieval Scotland was the Cult of Saints. Saints of Irish origin who were particularly revered included various figures called St Faelan and St. Colman, and saints Findbar and Finan.G. W. S. Barrow, Kingship and Unity: Scotland 1000‚Äì1306 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1989), , p. 64. Columba remained a major figure into the fourteenth century and a new foundation was endowed by William I (r. 1165‚Äì1214) at Arbroath Abbey. His relics, contained in the Monymusk Reliquary, were handed over to the Abbot's care. Regional saints remained important to local identities. In Strathclyde the most important saint was St Kentigern, whose cult (under the pet name St. Mungo) became focused in Glasgow. In Lothian it was St Cuthbert, whose relics were carried across Northumbria after Lindisfarne was sacked by the Vikings before being installed in Durham Cathedral.A. Lawrence-Mathers, Manuscripts in Northumbria in the Eleventh and Twelfth Centuries (Woodbridge: Brewer, 2003), , p. 137. After his martyrdom around 1115, a cult emerged in Orkney, Shetland and northern Scotland around Magnus Erlendsson, Earl of Orkney.H. Antonsson, St. Magn√∫s of Orkney: A Scandinavian Martyr-Cult in Context (Leiden: Brill, 2007), . One of the most important cults in Scotland, that of St Andrew, was established on the east coast at Kilrymont by the Pictish kings as early as the eighth century.G. W. S. Barrow, Robert Bruce and the Community of the Realm of Scotland (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 4th edn., 2005), , p. 11. The shrine, which from the twelfth century was said to have contained the relics of the saint brought to Scotland by Saint Regulus, began to attract pilgrims from across Scotland, but also from England and further away. By the twelfth century the site at Kilrymont had become known simply as St. Andrews and it became increasingly associated with Scottish national identity and the royal family. Its bishop would supplant that of Dunkeld as the most important in the kingdom and would begin to be referred to as Bishop of Alba. The site was renewed as a focus for devotion with the patronage of Queen Margaret,M. Lynch, Scotland: A New History (Random House, 2011), , p. 76. who also became important after her canonisation in 1250 and after the ceremonial transfer of her remains to Dunfermline Abbey, as one of the most revered national saints. In the late Middle Ages the \\"international\\" cults, particularity those centred on the Virgin Mary and Christ, but also St Joseph, St. Anne, the Three Kings and the Apostles, would become more significant in Scotland.D. Ditchburn, \\"The McRoberts Thesis and patterns of sanctity in late Medieval Scotland\\", in S. Boardman and E. Williamson, eds, The Cult of Saints and the Virgin Mary in Medieval Scotland (Woodbridge: Boydell & Brewer, 2010), , pp. 178‚Äì94. =Organisation= Bishoprics in Medieval Scotland Before the twelfth century, in contrast to England, there were few parish churches in Scotland. Churches had collegiate bodies of clergy who served over a wide area, often tied together by devotion to a particular missionary saint. From this period local lay landholders, perhaps following the example of David I, began to adopt the continental practice of building churches on their property for the local population and endowing them with land and a priest. The foundation of these churches began in the south, spreading to the north-east and then the west, being almost universal by the first survey of the Scottish Church for papal taxation in 1274. The administration of these parishes was often given over to local monastic institutions in a process known as appropriation. By the time of the Reformation in the mid-sixteenth century 80 per cent of Scottish parishes were appropriated. Before the Norman period, Scotland had little clear diocesan structure. There were bishoprics based on various ancient churches, but some are very obscure in the records and there appear to be long vacancies.A. Macquarrie, Medieval Scotland: Kinship and Nation (Thrupp: Sutton, 2004), , pp. 109‚Äì117. From around 1070, in the reign of Malcolm III, there was a \\"Bishop of Alba\\" resident at St. Andrews, but it is not clear what authority he had over the other bishops. After the Norman Conquest of England, the Archbishops of both Canterbury and York each claimed superiority over the Scottish church. When David I secured the appointment of John, a Tironensian monk, as Bishop of Glasgow around 1113, Thurstan Archbishop of York demanded the new bishop's submission. A long running dispute followed, with John travelling to Rome to unsuccessfully appeal his case before pope Calixtus II. John continued to withhold his submission despite papal pressure to do so. A new bishopric of Carlisle was created in what is now northern England, claimed as part of the Glasgow diocese and as territory by David I. In 1126 a new bishop was appointed to the southern Diocese of Galloway based at Whithorn, who offered his submission to York, a practice which would continue until the fifteenth century. David sent John to Rome to lobby for the Bishop of St. Andrew's to be made an independent archbishop. At one point David and his bishops threatened to transfer their allegiance to the anti-pope Anacletus II. When Bishop John died in 1147 David was able to appoint another Tironensian monk, Herbert abbot of Kelso, as his successor and submission to York continued to be withheld. The church in Scotland attained independent status after the Papal Bull of Celestine III (Cum universi, 1192) by which all Scottish bishoprics except Galloway became formally independent of York and Canterbury. However, unlike Ireland which had been granted four Archbishoprics in the same century, Scotland received no Archbishop and the whole Ecclesia Scoticana, with individual Scottish bishoprics (except Whithorn/Galloway), became the \\"special daughter of the see of Rome\\".P. J. Bawcutt and J. H. Williams, A Companion to Medieval Scottish Poetry (Woodbridge: Brewer, 2006), , pp. 26‚Äì9. It was run by special councils made up of all the Scottish bishops, with the bishop of St Andrews emerging as the most important figure. Late Middle Ages =Church and politics= Bust of Henry Wardlaw (d. 1440), Bishop of St Andrews, tutor, royal adviser, educator and leading opponent of heresy Late Medieval religion had its political aspects. Robert I carried the brecbennoch (or Monymusk reliquary), said to contain the remains of St. Columba, into battle at Bannockburn.G. W. S. Barrow, Robert Bruce (Berkeley CA: University of California Press, 1965), p. 293. In the Papal Schism (1378‚Äì1417), the Scottish church and crown sided with the Avignon Popes, beginning with Clement VII, along with France and other countries, while nations including England and the Holy Roman Empire sided with the Roman popes beginning with Urban VI. In 1383, Clement VII appointed Scotland's first cardinal, Walter Wardlaw, Bishop of Glasgow. The withdrawal of France from support of Clement's successor Benedict XIII created problems for Scottish clergy attending French universities and necessitated the creation of Scotland's first university at St. Andrews from 1411‚Äì13.A. Macquarrie, Medieval Scotland: Kinship and Nation (Thrupp: Sutton, 2004), , pp. 197‚Äì9. Scotland was one of the last churches to abandon Benedict in favour of the compromise pope, Martin V, proposed by the Council of Constance (1414‚Äì28). In the subsequent debates over Conciliarism and the authority of the pope, between those who backed the church council as the ultimate authority in the Church, and those that backed the papacy, divisions in loyalty mirrored political divisions in the country and Church. King James I and his chancellor John Cameron, Archbishop of Glasgow, became conciliarists and William Croyser, Archdeacon of Teviotdale, the leading opponent of Cameron, became a papalist. After his accession, James II backed the Pope, while the Douglases, who had dominated politics in the years after James I's death, backed the conciliar movement. As elsewhere in Europe, the collapse of papal authority in the Papal Schism allowed the Scottish Crown to gain effective control of major ecclesiastical appointments within the kingdom. This de facto authority over appointments was formally recognised by the Papacy in 1487. This led to the placement of clients and relatives of the king in key positions, including James IV's illegitimate son Alexander, who was nominated as Archbishop of St. Andrews at the age of 11, intensifying royal influence and also opening the Church to accusations of venality and nepotism. James IV used his pilgrimages to Tain and Whithorn to help bring the respective regions of Ross and Galloway, which lay on the edges of the kingdom, under royal authority. Relationships between the Scottish Crown and the Papacy were generally good, with James IV receiving tokens of papal favour. In 1472 St Andrews became the first archbishopric in the Scottish church, to be followed by Glasgow in 1492. =Popular religion= Traditional Protestant historiography tended to stress the corruption and unpopularity of the late Medieval Scottish church, but more recent research has indicated the ways in which it met the spiritual needs of different social groups.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 76‚Äì87.D. M. Palliser, The Cambridge Urban History of Britain: 600‚Äì1540 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), , pp. 349‚Äì50. Historians have discerned a decline of monastic life in this period, with many religious houses keeping smaller numbers of monks, and those remaining often abandoning communal living for a more individual and secular lifestyle. The rate of new monastic endowments from the nobility also declined in the fifteenth century.Andrew D. M. Barrell, Medieval Scotland (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), , p. 246. In contrast, the burghs saw the flourishing of mendicant orders of friars in the later fifteenth century, who, unlike the older monastic orders, placed an emphasis on preaching and ministering to the population. The order of Observant Friars were organised as a Scottish province from 1467 and the older Franciscans and the Dominicans were recognised as separate provinces in the 1480s. The fifteenth-century Trinity Altarpiece by Flemish artist Hugo van der Goes. In most Scottish burghs, in contrast to English towns where churches and parishes tended to proliferate, there was usually only one parish church, but as the doctrine of Purgatory gained importance in the period, the number of chapelries, priests and masses for the dead within them, designed to speed the passage of souls to Heaven, grew rapidly.Andrew D. M. Barrell, Medieval Scotland (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), , p. 254. The number of altars dedicated to saints, who could intercede in this process, also grew dramatically, with St. Mary's in Dundee having perhaps 48 and St Giles' in Edinburgh over 50. The number of saints celebrated in Scotland also proliferated, with about 90 being added to the missal used in St Nicholas church in Aberdeen. New cults of devotion connected with Jesus and the Virgin Mary began to reach Scotland in the fifteenth century, including the Five Wounds, the Holy Blood and the Holy Name of Jesus. There were also new religious feasts, including celebrations of the Presentation, the Visitation and Mary of the Snows.C. Peters, Women in Early Modern Britain, 1450‚Äì1640 (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2004), , p. 147. In the early fourteenth century the Papacy managed to minimise the problem of clerical pluralism, by which clerics held two or more livings, which elsewhere resulted in parish churches being without priests, or serviced by poorly trained and paid vicars and clerks. However, the number of poor clerical livings and a general shortage of clergy in Scotland, particularly after the Black Death, meant that in the fifteenth century the problem intensified.Andrew D. M. Barrell, Medieval Scotland (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), , pp. 244‚Äì5. As a result, parish clergy were largely drawn from the lower and less educated ranks of the profession, leading to frequent complaints about their standards of education or ability. Although there is little clear evidence that standards were declining, this would be one of the major grievances of the Reformation. Heresy, in the form of Lollardry, began to reach Scotland from England and Bohemia in the early fifteenth century. Lollards were followers of John Wycliffe (c. 1330‚Äì84) and later Jan Hus (c. 1369‚Äì1415), who called for reform of the Church and rejected its doctrine on the Eucharist. Despite evidence of a number of burnings of heretics and limited popular support for its anti-sacramental elements, it probably remained a small movement.Andrew D. M. Barrell, Medieval Scotland (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), , p. 257. There were also further attempts to differentiate Scottish liturgical practice from that in England, with a printing press established under royal patent in 1507 to replace the English Sarum Use for services.

At this point it is continued as the corresponding transverse sinus. The superior sagittal sinus is usually divided into three parts: anterior (foramen cecum to bregma), middle (bregma to lambda), posterior (lambda to confluence).Salunke, P., Sodhi, H. B.

Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery, 115(10), 1998‚Äì2002. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.clineuro.2013.06.003 It is triangular in section, narrow in front, and gradually increases in size as it passes backward. Its inner surface presents the openings of the superior cerebral veins, which run, for the most part, obliquely forward, and open chiefly at the back part of the sinus, their orifices being concealed by fibrous folds; numerous fibrous bands (chordae Willisii) extend transversely across the inferior angle of the sinus; and, lastly, small openings communicate with irregularly shaped venous spaces (venous lacunae) in the dura mater near the sinus. There are usually three lacunae on either side of the sinus: a small frontal, a large parietal, and an occipital, intermediate in size between the other two. Most of the cerebral veins from the outer surface of the hemisphere open into these lacun√¶, and numerous arachnoid granulations (Pacchionian bodies) project into them from below. The superior sagittal sinus receives the superior cerebral veins, veins from the diplo√´ and dura mater, and, near the posterior extremity of the sagittal suture, veins from the pericranium, which pass through the parietal foramina. Function Cerebrospinal fluid drains through arachnoid granulations into the superior sagittal sinus and is returned to venous circulation.

Biography Pero went to St. Peter's Boys High School in Staten Island, but left because the faculty made him cut his hair. He then went to New Dorp High School and graduated in 1977. He was initially a jazz drummer, later gravitating to heavier music akin to Rush and Led Zeppelin. Pero worked as a taxi driver for a time, and joined Cities, a local New York City band. He joined Twisted Sister in April 1982, after seeing them play at a club and being told they were in need of a drummer. Upon his departure from Twisted Sister in July 1986, he re-joined Cities. He participated in the band's 1997 reunion and continued to perform with Twisted Sister until his death. He was also a member of the Ozzy Osbourne cover band, No More Tears, which was well known around Staten Island, New York. In 2007, Pero formed Circle Of Thorns with former Cities guitarist Steve Mironovich aka Steve Irons. In 2011, Pero played drums on a song titled \\"Elephant Man\\" on the Eric Carr CD Unfinished Business. On December 3, 2013, Pero was announced as the new drummer of the band Adrenaline Mob. On March 20, 2015, Adrenaline Mob's band members attempted but failed to wake Pero on their tour bus. The band was traveling from Baltimore to Poughkeepsie.

During his tenure as governor of Montreal, the Iroquois war had enhanced the importance of that position. He conducted himself so well during this period that he was awarded the prestigious cross of Saint-Louis in 1694 partly under the recommendation of Buade de Frontenac. He, additionally, played an important role in defining the strategy that New France followed during Queen Anne's War. He ranked as captain in the regiment of Navarre. He came to Canada in 1684, and was appointed Governor of Montreal at the request of the Sulpicians who were Seigneurs of the island. The situation of the colony at that time was most critical, owing to Frontenac's departure, the weakness of Governor de la Barre, and the woeful error of the French government in sending some Iroquois chiefs captured at Cataracoui (Kingston) to be galley slaves in France. In 1689 Calli√®res proposed to Louis XIV to invade New England by land and sea, and obtained the reappointment of Frontenac as governor. In 1690 he marched to the defense of Quebec, when it was besieged by William Phips. A valiant and experienced soldier, he aided Frontenac in saving New France from the Iroquois and in raising the prestige of the French flag. He was one of the first to receive the Cross of St. Louis (1694). Having succeeded Frontenac in 1698, he devoted all his skill and energy to the pacification of the indigenous nations. The treaty of Montreal (1701), agreed to by representatives of 39 nations, was the crowning result of all his efforts. This treaty is considered as Calli√®res' chief claim to fame. That same year he sent Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac to found Detroit. One of the most conspicuous figures in Canadian history, he left a reputation of disinterestedness, honour, and probity.  Family  De Calli√®re was born in Thorigny-sur-Vire, Lower Normandy. He was the son of Jacques de Calli√®res, governor of Cherbourg and the author of La Fortune des gens de qualit√© et des gentilshommes particuliers, enseignant l'art de vivre √† la cour suivant les maximes de la politique et de la morale (\\"The Fortune of people of quality and private gentlemen, teaching the art of living at court according to the maxims of politics and morality\\"), and Madeleine Potier de Courey. Fran√ßois de Calli√®res, the eldest son, was elected to the French Academy in 1689 and also served with distinction in Louis XIV‚Äôs diplomatic corps. In 1701, thanks to his ability to imitate the royal handwriting and to his mastery of the French language, succeeded Toussaint Rose as the secretary \\"who held the pen.\\" His duties, designed to save the monarch time and fatigue, consisted of writing in a hand and style similar to those of the king letters and memoirs to dignitaries and foreign heads of state and of signing them with the royal name. Such a position of trust gave Calli√®res great power which he frequently used to further the career of Louis-Hector in Canada.

New France  La Galissoni√®re had family connections to New France as his mother was a sister of Michel B√©gon, the intendant from 1712 to 1726. He also married Marie-Catherine-Antoinette de Lauzon, a relative of Jean de Lauzon, the Governor of New France from 1651 to 1657. La Galissoni√®re was a naval commander who reluctantly accepted the position of Governor due to military necessity. He appears to have been well liked but was limited by resources to accomplish much that would distinguish himself during his stay in New France. He did send C√©loron de Blainville to extend France's trading posts and Fran√ßois Picquet to convert the Indians in the Detroit area and the Ohio valley in order to out-flank the British American colonies. His strength was as an administrator and diplomat. In recognition of his service in New France, he was promoted to the rank of rear-admiral, despite never having been tested militarily. Eventually, he was charged with heading the D√©p√¥t de la Marine.  Menorca  In 1756, La Galissoni√®re supported the invasion of Menorca (historically called \\"Minorca\\" by the British) and was engaged in combat for three hours by Admiral John Byng. La Galissoni√®re was extremely cautious and was rewarded by a British withdrawal. Byng was court-martialed and executed. The modest naval victory over the British was lauded in France to the point that the king was said to be preparing a marshal's baton for La Galissoni√®re's return. However, the naval commander died from illness, aged 63, prior to their meeting.  Scientific interests  He was one of the first sailors of his time to take part in the scientific movement. He had connections with numerous well-known scientists such as Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau, Bernard de Jussieu, Pierre-Charles and Louis Guillaume Lemonnier. La Galissoni√®re organized three scientific missions to: *chart the coasts of Newfoundland, Acadia, and √éle Royale *chart the coasts of Spain, Portugal, and Madeira; *catalogue the stars of the southern hemisphere (by Abb√© Nicolas Louis de Lacaille).

Roger Ebert, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, praised the film for accurately presenting what 3D technology is capable of. He particularly singled out the size of the IMAX screens the film was projected on. He went on to write, \\"(The film) takes advantage of the squarish six-story screen to envelop us in the images; the edges of the frame don't have the same kind of distracting cutoff power they possess in the smaller rectangles of conventional theaters.\\" Contrarily, Paul Tatara of CNN.com was displeased with the film's over-reliance on 3D effects, continuing on to say, \\"Unfortunately, you can't escape the sensation that you might end up wearing the contents of your stomach while you watch it.\\" References External links   CYBERWORLD Category:2000 films Category:2000s 3D films Category:2000 comedy films Category:2000s short films Category:American films Category:American 3D films Category:American comedy films Category:American short films Category:English-language films Category:American anthology films Category:IMAX short films Category:Comedy short films Category:3D animated short films Category:Films scored by Paul Haslinger Category:Films scored by Hummie Mann ","title":"CyberWorld"},{"id":"3892326","text":"The Faculty of Medicine is one of the constituent faculties of McGill University.

McGill's Faculty of Medicine is one of the most prestigious and well-regarded medical schools in the world. Many world-renowned researchers, physicians, clinicians, and pioneers within their respective fields have graduated from or have been affiliated with the faculty. Its graduates have gone on to found the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the Johns Hopkins Hospital. There have been at least two Nobel Prize laureates who have completed their entire education at McGill University including MD at the McGill University Faculty of Medicine including Andrew Schally (Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1977) and David H. Hubel (Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1981). History McGill's medical building 1872-1906 The Montreal Medical Institution, was established in 1823 by four physicians, Andrew Fernando Holmes, John Stephenson, William Caldwell and William Robertson, all of whom had been trained at the University of Edinburgh Medical School, and were involved in the foundation of the Montreal General Hospital. In 1829 it was incorporated into McGill College as the new College's first faculty; it thus became the first Faculty of Medicine in Canada. A highly didactic approach to medical education called the \\"Edinburgh curriculum\\", which consisted of two six-month courses of basic science lectures and two years of \\"walking the wards\\" at The Montreal General Hospital, was instituted. From 1833 to 1877 the Faculty followed the pattern set by the University of Edinburgh and required graduating students to submit an 'inaugural dissertation' - a database of these is available.MD and MDCM graduates and their theses 1833-1877. http://internatlibs.mcgill.ca/McGill-medical-theses/mcgill-theses.html Sir William Dawson, the principal of McGill, was instrumental in garnering resources for the faculty and pioneering contributions from Thomas Roddick, Francis Shepherd, George Ross and Sir William Osler helped to transform the Victorian era medical school into a leader in modern medical education. Osler graduated from the MDCM program at McGill University Faculty of Medicine in 1872, and co-founded the present-day Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in 1893. McIntyre Medical Building in the heart of McGill's downtown campus Education McGill University Faculty of Medicine offers a four-year medical M.D., C.M. degree (MDCM). MDCM is an abbreviation of the Latin Medicinae Doctor et Chirurgiae Magister, which means \\"doctor of medicine and master of surgery.\\" The Faculty of Medicine also offers joint degree programs with other disciplines including business M.D.-M.B.A. and science/engineering M.D.-Ph.D.. There is also an accelerated program for selected graduates of the Quebec junior college (CEGEP) system (PRE-MED-ADM or MED-P) that combines one year of science curriculum with the four-year M.D., C.M. degrees. In keeping with its history of educational and instructional relationship, the Faculty of Medicine is closely affiliated with the McGill University Faculty of Dentistry. Students in the Faculty of Dentistry receive instruction together with their medical student colleagues for the first 18 months of their professional training. {{cite weburl=https://www.cda-adc.ca/jcda/vol-70/issue-8/525.pdf title= Canadian Dental Association - Dentistry at McGill ‚Äî The First 100 Years accessdate=August 1, 2019 Affiliations The faculty includes three schools, the School of Communication Sciences and Disorders, School of Nursing, and the School of Physical and Occupational Therapy.

The tropical semiring has various applications (see tropical analysis), and forms the basis of tropical geometry.  Definition  The ' (or ' or ') is the semiring (‚Ñù ‚à™ {+‚àû}, ‚äï, ‚äó), with the operations: : x \\\\oplus y = \\\\min\\\\\\\\{x, y \\\\\\\\}, : x \\\\otimes y = x + y. The operations ‚äï and ‚äó are referred to as tropical addition and tropical multiplication respectively. The unit for ‚äï is +‚àû, and the unit for ‚äó is 0. Similarly, the ' (or ' or ') is the semiring (‚Ñù ‚à™ {‚àí‚àû}, ‚äï, ‚äó), with operations: : x \\\\oplus y = \\\\max\\\\\\\\{x, y \\\\\\\\}, : x \\\\otimes y = x + y. The unit for ‚äï is ‚àí‚àû, and the unit for ‚äó is 0. These semirings are isomorphic, under negation x \\\\mapsto -x, and generally one of these is chosen and referred to simply as the tropical semiring. Conventions differ between authors and subfields: some use the min convention, some use the max convention. Tropical addition is idempotent, thus a tropical semiring is an example of an idempotent semiring. A tropical semiring is also referred to as a ', though this should not be confused with an associative algebra over a tropical semiring. Tropical exponentiation is defined in the usual way as iterated tropical products (see ).  Valued fields  The tropical semiring operations model how valuations behave under addition and multiplication in a valued field. A real-valued field K is a field equipped with a function : v \\\\colon K \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{\\\\infty\\\\\\\\} which satisfies the following properties for all a, b in K: : v(a) = \\\\infty if and only if a = 0, : v(ab) = v(a) + v(b) = v(a) \\\\otimes v(b), : v(a + b) \\\\geq \\\\min\\\\\\\\{v(a), v(b) \\\\\\\\} = v(a) \\\\oplus v(b), with equality if v(a) eq v(b). Therefore the valuation v is almost a semiring homomorphism from K to the tropical semiring, except that the homomorphism property can fail when two elements with the same valuation are added together. Some common valued fields: * Q or C with the trivial valuation, v(a) = 0 for all a ‚â† 0, * Q or its extensions with the p-adic valuation, v(pna/b) = n for a and b coprime to p, * the field of formal Laurent series K((t)) (integer powers), or the field of Puiseux series K, or the field of Hahn series, with valuation returning the smallest exponent of t appearing in the series.

The Easton Massacre was an incident in which sailors of the British Royal Navy shot and killed three residents of Easton, Portland, Dorset, during an attempt to press male members of the town into service. This was contrary to the normal restrictions under which press gangs operated; which were intended to limit forced recruiting to professional sailors. 1 April 1803 saw the first of several landings carried out by the frigate , commanded by George Wolfe to capture men and press them into the navy. One man was carried back to the Aigle but was found to be exempt and released. The next day, 2 April, a larger force landed and impressed two men. Holding them prisoner, the landing force continued to Easton Square where they were met by a large group of citizens who had received warning of the press gangs and had gathered to stop them. When Robert Bennett was taken and the crowd attempted a rescue, the captain fired on them. The marines under his command also opened fire, and after the shooting stopped three people had been killed. The dead were Alexander Andrews, Richard Flann and William Lano, and in addition there were two wounded, one of whom, Mary Way, later died of her wounds. Soon after, the press gang returned to their ship with no additional impressed men. Wolfe and three officers stood trial for murder but were acquitted and left Portland, aboard Aigle, on 10 April to continue their patrol in home waters.

In 1970, he won the NPA nod to replace Rathie as the party's mayoral nominee and again won the mayor's office.Ubyssey, 2006-11-03 As mayor, \\"Tom Terrific\\" (as he was both affectionately and derisively called) proved to be brash, confrontational, and controversial. During his term, the City held a referendum which authorized the then-controversial development of an underground shopping mall and office towers, now known as Pacific Centre, Vancouver's largest development. As the Lower Mainland's population topped one million, Campbell took an assertively pro-development stance, advocating a freeway that would cut through a large part of Downtown Eastside, the demolition of the historic Carnegie Centre, and the construction of a luxury hotel at the entrance of Stanley Park (the Bayshore Inn) and another at the north foot of Burrard in which it turned out the mayor had invested (it is now an apartment building and never became a hotel). Campbell was a vocal supporter of the Social Credit government of Premier W.A.C. Bennett. Campbell was re-elected in the 1968 and 1970 elections by large majorities. It is, however, Campbell's confrontations with the city's burgeoning youth counterculture for which he is best remembered. They included attempts to suppress and shut down the alternative newspaper, The Georgia Straight, whose editor Dan McLeod was repeatedly beaten by city police and the blocking of the final concert of the 1970 Festival Express rock and roll tour, which was held in Calgary to avoid risking a confrontation with the Vancouver mayor's stated intention to use police to stop the festival. There was even an incident in August, 1971, when Vancouver police charged on horseback into a group of about a thousand hippies having a \\"smoke-in\\" on the streets of Gastown. That came to be known as the Gastown Riots and led to the arrests of 79 people, of whom 38 were charged with various offences. A judicial inquiry later criticized the action, characterizing it as a police riot. Campbell chose not to run for re-election in November 1972 and returned to private life and legal practice. He died in 2012.http://blogs.vancouversun.com/2012/02/03/58108/ References External links * 1971 Report of Mr. Justice Dohm on the Gastown Riots, from the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association *CBC television clip of Doug Collins interviewing Tom Campbell about Vancouver's hippie problem.

Overall, the carbonyl group is oxidized, and the hydrogen peroxide is reduced. The Dakin oxidation, which is closely related to the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, is not to be confused with the Dakin-West reaction, though both are named after Henry Drysdale Dakin. Reaction mechanism The Dakin oxidation starts with nucleophilic addition of a hydroperoxide anion to the carbonyl carbon, forming a tetrahedral intermediate (2). The intermediate collapses, causing [1,2]-aryl migration, hydroxide elimination, and formation of a phenyl ester (3). The phenyl ester is subsequently hydrolyzed: nucleophilic addition of hydroxide from solution to the ester carbonyl carbon forms a second tetrahedral intermediate (4), which collapses, eliminating a phenoxide and forming a carboxylic acid (5). Finally, the phenoxide extracts the acidic hydrogen from the carboxylic acid, yielding the collected products (6). Base-catalyzed Dakin oxidation mechanism Factors affecting reaction kinetics The Dakin oxidation has two rate-limiting steps: nucleophilic addition of hydroperoxide to the carbonyl carbon and [1,2]-aryl migration. Therefore, the overall rate of oxidation is dependent on the nucleophilicity of hydroperoxide, the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon, and the speed of [1,2]-aryl migration. The alkyl substituents on the carbonyl carbon, the relative positions of the hydroxyl and carbonyl groups on the aryl ring, the presence of other functional groups on the ring, and the reaction mixture pH are four factors that affect these rate-limiting steps. =Alkyl substituents= In general, phenyl aldehydes are more reactive than phenyl ketones because the ketone carbonyl carbon is less electrophilic than the aldehyde carbonyl carbon. The difference can be mitigated by increasing the temperature of the reaction mixture. =Relative positions of hydroxyl and carbonyl groups= Hydrogen bond in ortho substrate O-hydroxy phenyl aldehydes and ketones oxidize faster than p-hydroxy phenyl aldehydes and ketones in weakly basic conditions. In o-hydroxy compounds, when the hydroxyl group is protonated, an intramolecular hydrogen bond can form between the hydroxyl hydrogen and the carbonyl oxygen, stabilizing a resonance structure with positive charge on the carbonyl carbon, thus increasing the carbonyl carbon‚Äôs electrophilicity (7). Lacking this stabilization, the carbonyl carbon of p-hydroxy compounds is less electrophilic. Therefore, o-hydroxy compounds are oxidized faster than p-hydroxy compounds when the hydroxyl group is protonated. Carboxylic acid product formation M-hydroxy compounds do not oxidize to m-benzenediols and carboxylates. Rather, they form phenyl carboxylic acids. Variations in the aryl rings' migratory aptitudes can explain this. Hydroxyl groups ortho or para to the carbonyl group concentrate electron density at the aryl carbon bonded to the carbonyl carbon (10c, 11d). Phenyl groups have low migratory aptitude, but higher electron density at the migrating carbon increases migratory aptitude, facilitating [1,2]-aryl migration and allowing the reaction to continue. M-hydroxy compounds do not concentrate electron density at the migrating carbon (12a, 12b, 12c, 12d); their aryl groups' migratory aptitude remains low. The benzylic hydrogen, which has the highest migratory aptitude, migrates instead (8), forming a phenyl carboxylic acid (9). Concentration of electron density at the migrating carbon with para (top) and ortho (bottom) hydroxyl group Lack of electron density concentration at the migrating carbon with meta hydroxyl group =Other functional groups on the aryl ring= Substitution of phenyl hydrogens with electron-donating groups ortho or para to the carbonyl group increases electron density at the migrating carbon, promotes [1,2]-aryl migration, and accelerates oxidation. Substitution with electron-donating groups meta to the carbonyl group does not change electron density at the migrating carbon; because unsubstituted phenyl group migratory aptitude is low, hydrogen migration dominates. Substitution with electron-withdrawing groups ortho or para to the carbonyl decreases electron density at the migrating carbon (13c), inhibits [1,2]-aryl migration, and favors hydrogen migration. Concentration of positive charge at migrating carbon with para nitro group =pH= The hydroperoxide anion is a more reactive nucleophile than neutral hydrogen peroxide. Consequently, oxidation accelerates as pH increases toward the pKa of hydrogen peroxide and hydroperoxide concentration climbs. At pH higher than 13.5, however, oxidation does not occur, possibly due to deprotonation of the second peroxidic oxygen. Deprotonation of the second peroxidic oxygen would prevent [1,2]-aryl migration because the lone oxide anion is too basic to be eliminated (2). Deprotonation of the hydroxyl group increases electron donation from the hydroxyl oxygen. When the hydroxyl group is ortho or para to the carbonyl group, deprotonation increases the electron density at the migrating carbon, promoting faster [1,2]-aryl migration. Therefore, [1,2]-aryl migration is facilitated by the pH range that favors deprotonated over protonated hydroxyl group. Variants =Acid-catalyzed Dakin oxidation= The Dakin oxidation can occur in mild acidic conditions as well, with a mechanism analogous to the base-catalyzed mechanism. In methanol, hydrogen peroxide, and catalytic sulfuric acid, the carbonyl oxygen is protonated (14), after which hydrogen peroxide adds as a nucleophile to the carbonyl carbon, forming a tetrahedral intermediate (15). Following an intramolecular proton transfer (16,17), the tetrahedral intermediate collapses, [1,2]-aryl migration occurs, and water is eliminated (18). Nucleophilic addition of methanol to the carbonyl carbon forms another tetrahedral intermediate (19). Following a second intramolecular proton transfer (20,21), the tetrahedral intermediate collapses, eliminating a phenol and forming an ester protonated at the carbonyl oxygen (22). Finally, deprotonation of the carbonyl oxygen yields the collected products and regenerates the acid catalyst (23). Acid-catalyzed Dakin oxidation mechanism =Boric acid-catalyzed Dakin oxidation= Adding boric acid to the acid- catalyzed reaction mixture increases the yield of phenol product over phenyl carboxylic acid product, even when using phenyl aldehyde or ketone reactants with electron-donating groups meta to the carbonyl group or electron- withdrawing groups ortho or para to the carbonyl group. Boric acid and hydrogen peroxide form a complex in solution that, once added to the carbonyl carbon, favors aryl migration over hydrogen migration, maximizing the yield of phenol and reducing the yield of phenyl carboxylic acid. =Methyltrioxorhenium-catalyzed Dakin oxidation= Using an ionic liquid solvent with catalytic methyltrioxorhenium (MTO) dramatically accelerates Dakin oxidation. MTO forms a complex with hydrogen peroxide that increases the rate of addition of hydrogen peroxide to the carbonyl carbon. MTO does not, however, change the relative yields of phenol and phenyl carboxylic acid products. =Urea-catalyzed Dakin oxidation= Mixing urea and hydrogen peroxide yields urea-hydrogen peroxide complex (UHC). Adding dry UHC to solventless phenyl aldehyde or ketone also accelerates Dakin oxidation. Like MTO, UHP increases the rate of nucleophilic addition of hydrogen peroxide. But unlike the MTO-catalyzed variant, the urea-catalyzed variant does not produce potentially toxic heavy metal waste; it has also been applied to the synthesis of amine oxides such as pyridine-N-oxide. Synthetic applications The Dakin oxidation is most commonly used to synthesize benzenediols and alkoxyphenols. Catechol, for example, is synthesized from o-hydroxy and o-alkoxy phenyl aldehydes and ketones, and is used as the starting material for synthesis of several compounds, including the catecholamines, catecholamine derivatives, and 4-tert-butylcatechol, a common antioxidant and polymerization inhibitor. Other synthetically useful products of the Dakin oxidation include guaiacol, a precursor of several flavorants; hydroquinone, a common photograph-developing agent; and 2-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole and 3-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole, two antioxidants commonly used to preserve packaged food. In addition, the Dakin oxidation is useful in the synthesis of indolequinones, naturally occurring compounds that exhibit high anti-biotic, anti-fungal, and anti-tumor activities.

Music Festival was an annual music festival held at The Gorge Amphitheatre in George, Washington. It took place on Memorial Day weekend, running for three to four days. It was canceled in 2019. About the festival 2008 Logo Sasquatch! typically featured a range of musical genres, with the emphasis being on indie rock bands and singer-songwriters, but also including alternative rock, hip hop, EDM, and comedy acts. As of 2012 the festival featured five stages: Sasquatch! Main Stage, Bigfoot Stage, Banana Shack (a tent that featured primarily comedy acts and electronic music- now known as El Chupacabra), Yeti Stage, and Uranus Stage (the smallest of stages, that generally changed names every year, but was not present from 2017 onward). Most attendees of the festival camped in designated campsite fields nearby, as the venue is relatively remote and there are no large urban areas nearby. Sasquatch! was voted as one of the \\"Top 10 Summer Music Festivals in the US\\" by ConcertBoom. History The Sasquatch! Music Festival was founded in 2002 by Pacific Northwest-based concert promoter Adam Zacks, then at House of Blues. Prior to the inception of the festival, Zacks booked and managed shows at the Roseland Theater in Portland, Oregon. After moving to Seattle to be closer to friends and family, Zacks began considering the creation of a music festival in the Pacific Northwest. In an interview with Seattle Weekly in September 2007, Zacks described the birth of Sasquatch!: > Sasquatch was an idea born on a hunch that there was untapped demand for a > certain kind of festival that catered to the eclectic tastes of music > enthusiasts. It started in 2002, which was shortly after a number of the > touring festivals (Lollapalooza, Lilith, Horde) had petered out and the > beginning of the wave of regional festivals that started with Coachella and > now is a dominant force on the music landscape, with Bonnaroo, Austin City > Limits, etc. In 2014, Adam Zacks decided to expand the festival to two weekends due to the high demand for tickets in 2013. On March 21, 2014, the Independence Day Weekend of Sasquatch was cancelled. Jeff Trisler, President of Live Nation, released the following statement upon the announcement: \\"The Sasquatch! community has spoken. They continue to support the traditional Memorial Day Weekend event with great enthusiasm,\\" Jeff Trisler, president of Live Nation Seattle, said in a statement. \\"Unfortunately, the second weekend was not embraced. We felt it was better to cancel the new event now and give everyone time to make alternative plans for the Fourth of July weekend. Going forward, Sasquatch! Music Festival will be at the Gorge Amphitheatre on the weekend the fans want: Memorial Day Weekend only.\\" On June 28, 2018, Zacks officially announced that Sasquatch!

Biography Sarmiento earned a biological anthropology Ph.D. in 1985 and from then until at least 2008 he worked as a research associate at the American Museum of Natural History. His main field of study is the skeletons of hominoids,Sarmiento, Esteban. Should We Consider the Translocation of Gorilla Populations? Gorilla Journal 13, December 1996 including both extinct C. J.

American Journal of Primatology, 40, 1‚Äì21. From 2002 to 2004 he was a Fulbright scholar teaching physiology at Eduardo Mondlane University in Mozambique. Presently, he heads The Human Evolution Foundation whose main goal is to understand humanity's place in nature, and fight to end to racial discrimination at Public Universities. Sarmiento is one of the few mainstream experts to give serious attention to cryptozoology, particularly reports of Bigfoot. Sarmiento does not suggest that the existence of Bigfoot has been established, but that its existence is possible and that claims and evidence deserve careful scrutiny. He has stated, \\"If the animal in the P&G; film [Bigfoot] is real, this animal is exceedingly human-like...[i]t would be our closest relative on earth.‚ÄùOrtega, Javier. 2009. \\"Esteban Sarmiento: Thoughts on Bigfoot\\". Retrieved 13 Feb 2010. He has appeared on several episodes of the History Channel series Monster Quest discussing Bigfoot and other \\"cryptids.\\" Legal Actions Against Discrimination Sarmiento filed a lawsuit against Queens College claiming that the college's refusal to grant him interviews in 1999 and 2000 for associate professor employment was motivated by racial discrimination and thus a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In 2005, a U.S. District Court ruled against Sarmiento. The court noted that while Sarmiento was qualified for the job, Queens College demonstrated that other candidates were more qualified and race was not a factor in their decisions. For example, among the job requirements was an emphasis on human anatomy and anthropology, while Sarmiento's emphasis had been on non-human primates. At the time Sarmiento had 10 years of teaching experience in anatomy in Universities throughout the world. The court also ruled that Sarmiento submitted inadequate syllabi and other candidates had superior teaching experience.Sarmiento v. Queens College, 386 F.Supp.2d 93 (2005) Later in 2005, an appeals court upheld the district court decision.ESTEBAN SARMIENTO, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, v. QUEENS COLLEGE CUNY, DEFENDANTS-APPELLANTS (2nd Cir. 2005) Sarmiento subsequently filed a similar lawsuit against Montclair State University. Again, he alleged racial discrimination as a factor in a 2001 hiring procedure. The court ruled that Montclair established that another applicant was better qualified for the position due to her specialty in medical anthropology and that race was not a factor in Montclair's hiring decision. Montclair interviewed 2 black women one with a Ph.D but hired the white woman. While the candidate Montclair ultimately hired did not have her Ph.D. at the time of interview, she was scheduled to earn her doctorate by the time employment would have begun, in line with Montclair's hiring procedure. Montclair, however in circular advertisement specifically required a Ph.D. degreeSarmiento v Montclair State University, On Appeal from the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.

Kargil is the second largest town in Ladakh after Leh.Osada et al (2000), p. 298. It is located 204 km to the east of Srinagar and 234 km west of Leh to the east. Kargil is the centre of the Suru River valley, historically known as Purig. Etymology The name Kargil is said to derive from the words Khar, meaning castle, and rKil meaning \\"centre\\". \\"Kargil denotes a place between many forts, a central place where people could stay\\". It appears to be a fitting description for a place that is equidistant from Srinagar, Leh and Skardu (the capitals of the Kashmir Valley, Ladakh and Baltistan respectively). Historically, the region around Kargil was called Purig. A major study of the history of Purig is included in the 1987 book Qadeem Ladakh by Kacho Sikander Khan, which includes genealogies of various dynasties that ruled the region. History Kargil is the main town in the historical region of Purig, which consists of the Suru river basin. It was not the historical capital of the region. Earlier, Purig consisted of a number of small but independent kingdoms, which included Pashkum, Chiktan, Fokar, Soth and the Suru Valley. These tiny principalities would often fight among themselves over petty issues. Gasho ‚ÄúThatha Khan‚Äù, an exiled prince in the 9th century AD, is perhaps the first ruler who brought together all the territories under a united administration. Another sultan of Purig extended his kingdom to include Zanskar, Sot, Barsoo, Sankoo pretty much the territory of the present Kargil district. He is referred to as ‚ÄúThe Purig Sultan‚Äù. His capital was based at Karpokhar in the Suru Valley. The other famous kings of Kargil were Boti Khan, Abdal Khan, Amrood Choo, Tsering Malik, Kunchok Sherab Stan and Thi Sultan. It is said that it was the period of Ali Sher Khan Anchan, the famous ruler of Skardu, in the late 16th and early 17th centuries which had a great influence on the area. This prince from Baltistan conquered most of the principalities of Purig and introduced Balti culture in the Kargil district. Subsequently, it was the Dogras who united Baltistan, Purig, Zanskar and present-day Leh district in the first half of the 19th century under a single administrative unit, which lasted until 1947 when a new line of control was demarcated between India and Pakistan separating Skardu and Kargil. Location of Kargil with respect to the Line of Control Indian soldiers after winning a battle during the Kargil War Before the Partition of India in 1947, Kargil was part of the wazarat (district) of Ladakh, a sparsely populated region with diverse linguistic, ethnic and religious groups, living in isolated valleys separated by some of the world's highest mountains. The Ladakh wazarat had three tehsils (sub-districts), named after the cities of their headquarters: Leh, Skardu and Kargil. The district headquarters shifted between the three locations each year. The First Kashmir War (1947‚Äì48) concluded with a ceasefire line that divided the Ladakh wazarat, putting roughly the Kargil and Leh tehsils on the Indian side, and the Skardu tehsil on the Pakistan side. The two Indian tehsils were soon promoted to districts and Ladakh was named a Division, on par with the Jammu and Kashmir Divisions in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistan renamed the Skardu tehsil Baltistan and divided it into further districts. At the end of Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, the two nations signed the Simla Agreement, converting the former ceasefire line with some adjustments into a Line of Control, and promising not to engage in armed conflict with respect to that boundary. Pg 4 In 1999 the area saw infiltration by Pakistani forces, leading to the Kargil War. Fighting occurred along a 160 km long stretch of ridges overlooking the only road linking Srinagar and Leh. The military outposts on the ridges above the highway were generally around 5,000 metres (16,000 ft) high, with a few as high as 5,485 metres (18,000 ft). After several months of fighting and diplomatic activity, the Pakistani forces were forced to withdraw to their side of the Line of Control by their Prime minister Nawaz Sharif after his visit to the USA. Geography Suru river near Kargil Kargil War Memorial Kargil has an average elevation of 2,676 metres (8,780 feet), and is situated along the banks of the Suru River (Indus). The town of Kargil is located from Srinagar,Profile of Kargil District Official website of Kargil District facing the Northern Areas across the LOC. Like other areas in the Himalayas, Kargil has a temperate climate. Summers are hot with cool nights, while winters are long and chilly with temperatures often dropping below ‚àí20 ¬∞C (‚àí4 ¬∞F). Demographics During the 2011 census, the population of Kargil town was recorded at 16,338. A majority of the population (11,496) is classified as Scheduled Tribes.

The nearest operational airport is Kushok Bakula Rimpochee Airport in Leh, located at a distance of 215 kilometres. =Rail= There is no rail-connectivity to Kargil yet. The Srinagar-Kargil-Leh railway line is proposed which will connect Srinagar and Leh via Kargil. The nearest major railway station to Kargil is Jammu Tawi railway station located at a distance of 472 kilometres. =Road= An Indian national highway (NH 1D) connecting Srinagar to Leh cuts through Kargil. Kargil-Skardu Road A famous all-weather road, the Kargil-Skardu road linked Kargil with Skardu, a city in Gilgit-Baltistan. Since the 1948 Kashmir War, the road has been closed. Whilst the Indian Government has been interested in opening the road as a humanitarian gesture, this has been refused by the Pakistani Government.

The station is owned by iHeartMedia and broadcasts at 106.5 MHz at 15.5 kilowatts ERP from a non-directional antenna located from the Helderberg Mountains antenna farm in New Scotland. Though billed as classic rock, WPYX plays a moderate amount of currents which puts it on a fringe alongside mainstream rock. Regardless of what format the station is filed under, WPYX is one of the longest-lasting stations in the Capital District since it began on September 15, 1980. WPYX broadcasts in the HD Radio format, with 1970s‚Äô classic rock on its HD2 channel from iHeart branded as, Gran Turino Radio. During the NFL season, WPYX also broadcasts New York Giants football games. History The 106.5 frequency signed on in September 1967 as WDKC, operating as an MOR music station. It was owned by Kopps-Monahan Communications, Inc., owners of Top 40 powerhouse WTRY 980 (today's WOFX). In 1971, the call letters were changed to WTRY-FM. It continued as an MOR station during the day, but simulcasted WTRY's Top 40 format at night; returning to full-time MOR programming in 1972. In early 1973, the WTRY stations were sold, and WTRY-FM became WHSH, which then went to its first full-time rock format as the format was changed to a Top 40‚ÄìOldies hybrid with live DJs. The station was now known as \\"Wish\\" as well as \\"The Albany Stereo Giant\\" and \\"Your Albany Wish\\". Ownership automated the station a year later in 1974, and changed the format to Oldies. During Labor Day weekend, 1975, the format was flipped again, this time to beautiful music, while keeping the \\"Wish\\" nickname. The WHSH callsign supposedly meant \\"Well Herbert Scott's Here\\", referring to Scott Broadcasting's ownership. By 1980 there was an obvious hole for a mainstream AOR station in the Albany market and the station flipped to its current format on September 15, 1980, changing the call sign to WPYX and officially became \\"PYX 106\\". WPYX would remain live and local until April 28, 2009 when they replaced most of their local DJs with out-of-market voice-trackers, which remains the case to this day. WPYX and WTRY went through several ownership changes which includes Scott Broadcasting of Pennsylvania, television personality Merv Griffin and Capstar Broadcasting (which was controlled by billionaire mogul Tom Hicks). In 1999, Capstar merged with another Hicks-owned company, Chancellor Media Corporation, to form AMFM Inc. In 2000, the stations were acquired by Clear Channel Communications (now known as iHeartMedia) when they merged with AMFM. HD Radio operations In 2005, WPYX upgraded to IBOC digital radio alongside the rest of Clear Channel's Albany stations. On August 17, 2006, WPYX began airing an HD2 channel with a deep tracks classic rock format, known as Vinyl Vineyard which was later replaced with a classic country format in August 2012. The classic country was eventually dropped in favor of an all year non-stop Christmas music channel.http://www.iheart.com/live/iheartchristmas-classics-6137 As of September 2018, WPYX's HD2 airs a Christmas Music format called, \\"iHeartChristmas Lites\\", which airs more recent versions of Christmas songs and Christmas songs that are very popular.

TuneCore principally offers musicians and other rights-holders the opportunity to distribute and sell or stream their music through online retailers such as iTunes, Deezer, Spotify, Amazon Music, Google Play, Tidal, and others. TuneCore also offers music publishing administration services, helping songwriters register their compositions and collect royalties internationally. The company currently operates out of its Brooklyn headquarters with offices in Austin, Burbank, Boston, Nashville, Atlanta, Australia, Germany, France and the United Kingdom. History and background TuneCore garnered media attention from ABC's World News Tonight, The Daily Mirror, and pitchforkmedia.com. TuneCore's first customer was Frank Black, lead singer of the Pixies. In 2008, TuneCore was utilized by Nine Inch Nails to deliver the music from their album, Ghosts I‚ÄìIV to the Amazon MP3 store. In December 2006, music instrument and equipment retailer Guitar Center bought a stake in TuneCore, giving the company access to the music retailer's customers. In the United States, TuneCore represents about 10 percent of the 20 million songs on iTunes, and it accounts for almost 4 percent of all digital sales. TuneCore reportedly fired Jeff Price, a co- founder and then-CEO, after the company faced a \\"cash-flow\\" crisis in 2012. Price has sued TuneCore for severance compensation and has alleged that the company may have been insolvent, an accusation that the company appears to dispute. Tunecore reported that their artists have earned a total of $83 million in Q1 of 2019, a 21 percent increase from Q1 2018. Last year, distribution income for artists reached $308 million, a 28 percent year-on- year increase. Joe Cuello, formerly an executive at MTV was TuneCore's Chief Creative Officer from 2014 through at least 2016. =Acquisition by Believe Digital= Tunecore was acquired by Denis Ladegaillerie's Believe Digital in April 2015. The acquisition opened up artists' access to Believe Digital's wider distribution network and label services. Both of the companies remained operationally separate, while jointly claiming to represent of 25 to 30 percent of the new music uploaded to iTunes each day. After the acquisition, TuneCore and Believe used their newly increased leverage in negotiations with digital services including Spotify and Tidal to improve their services for their artists. Also in 2015, TuneCore expanded its presence in the UK and Australia announcing dedicated websites including localized currency and content for each region. It also introduced its YouTube Sound Recording service to collect revenue for artists when their sound recordings are used anywhere on YouTube. In September 2015, Tunecore stepped up its live event offerings, throwing LA's independent music community its first ever Indie Artist Forum, which focused on educating and fostering collaboration amongst aspiring professional musicians while engaging on a dialog around the ins and outs of the current landscape of the independent music business. In the fourth quarter of 2015, TuneCore saw sustained growth, with independent artists earning over $142 million through TuneCore including $36.8 million from digital streams and downloads. During this time, TuneCore also expanded its presence in the United States, opening offices in Austin and Atlanta, and internationally, launching two new international sites in Australia and the UK featuring localized currencies and experiences. TuneCore also added Saavn, Nmusic and Zvooq‚Äîservices targeting emerging markets‚Äîas partners through which artists could distribute and monetize their music. TuneCore also enjoyed notable growth in new customers in the Latin American market and the African market. TuneCore's YouTube Sound Recording Collection Service was also a key driver for increasing 2015 yearly revenue. In May 2016, TuneCore acquired artist social media management startup JustGo and re-branded it as TuneCore Social. Later in the year, it expanded its presence and launched its services in France.

The station is owned by iHeartMedia and broadcasts at 102.3 FM at 4,100 watts ERP from a transmitter in Clifton Park, New York on a tower shared with WMHH and WTMM-FM. Programming WKKF currently programs a 'Premium Choice rhythmic CHR format, including hip-hop, R&B;, and dance music, however, the station has been through several iterations of CHR formats since 2000, including adult CHR and Mainstream CHR. Its primary competitors include Mainstream CHR WFLY and Urban/Rhythmic CHR WAJZ. Programming currently featured on WKKF is primarily under iHeartMedia's Premium Choice banner, and includes Elvis Duran and the Morning Show, and local jocks Terry O'Donnel, and D. Scott. Additionally, WKKF features American Top 40 hosted by Ryan Seacrest. History =Saratoga Springs history= The 102.3 frequency originally began in Saratoga Springs, New York in 1968 as WKAJ-FM, sister to WKAJ running an easy listening format. In 1979, WKAJ-FM changed its calls to WASM keeping the easy listening format though by the mid-1980s the station evolved to an Adult contemporary approach. In June 1987, WASM flipped to Top 40 WQQY (102 Double Q) and began to make a minor wave in the Albany ratings by giving WFLY and WGFM a run for its money in Saratoga County. Among the air talent at WQQY was Rob Dawes early in his career before moving back to the frequency. =Move to Ballston Spa= With the decline of Top 40 in the early 1990s, its limited 3000 watt signal, WQQY began to look to the south for a better alternative. Having a construction permit to move the station down to the Albany area, WQQY moved its transmitter 12 miles south to Clifton Park (licensed to nearby Ballston Spa), upgraded to 6000 watts, and relaunched in September 1991 as WZRQ, becoming Albany's affiliate of ABC's Z-Rock satellite hard rock format. WZRQ remained as an affiliate of Z-Rock until the network's end in late 1996. Needing a new format, then-owner Radio Enterprises (a joint venture of Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia) and local investors) decided to go after heritage rock station WPYX with a Classic Rock format as Classic Rock 102.3 FM with the WXCR calls. Though former WPYX morning team \\"Mason and Sheehan\\" were hired several months later, they were fired a year later, in 1998. =102.3 KISS FM= Kiss FM 102.3 logo former logo After Clear Channel acquired WPYX in 2000, their trademarked KISS FM CHR format was adopted on May 26, 2000 after a day of stunting, with the WKKF calls following soon after. WXCR personality Steve Scott was the only one to make the transition from classic rock to CHR as Jeff Mrozek adopted the afternoon drive spot at former sister station WQBK-FM earlier that year. Since its launch, WKKF has been a largely successful station going after heritage CHR WFLY with a more rhythmic, younger-leaning format. This approach has allowed it to hold its own against WFLY, a station which had not seen competition for a decade prior to WKKF's launch, and WAJZ, a Rhythmic (since 2005) who happens to be WFLY's sister station. Much of WKKF's early airstaff were transplants from other stations in the market: former Program Director/midday jock Rob Dawes previously held the same position at WFLY, former midday jock Ally Reid handled middays at WFLY as well as sister station WFLZ in Tampa, Florida, and former WFLY jock \\"Joey Kidd\\" (formerly in morning drive, also known as Joe Rosati on WDTW-FM in Detroit, Michigan). Mike Corts, former WFLY jock began board operating Mornings until Valentine in the Morning was syndicated. Corts was hired to host nights on Kiss and also hosted the popular and #1 rated Saturday night \\"Remix\\". Afternoon drive jock DJ Thomas, the last original staff member from WKKF's launch, former night jock Mick Lee now Program Director at WLIT, Chicago, as well as former evening jock Corey Kincaid, left WKKF in 2009. In addition, the syndicated Elvis Duran and the Morning Show (originating at WHTZ in New York City) was added in morning drive on the station that year. After the demise of sister alternative rock station WHRL in September 2010, WKKF added more pop rock and alternative artists to its playlist that it would not play as much before, including The Script, Lady Antebellum, and Paramore; in addition, the station added more 1990s and early 2000s gold to its playlist. After the start of 2012, the station has reverted to a Rhythmic Contemporary direction, although still reporting as a Mainstream Top 40 by Mediabase and Nielsen BDS. Regarding WKKF's direction shift, they continue to be a mainstream top 40 because of most markets having two Top 40 (CHR) stations. =KISS 102.3= By early 2013, the station has made a slight change in branding to Kiss 102.3 and reverted to a more mainstream CHR approach including more pop-rock artists. HD Radio operations In 2005, WKKF upgraded to IBOC digital radio alongside the rest of Clear Channel's Albany stations. On August 17, 2006, WKKF began airing an HD2 channel with a pop and new music-heavy CHR format known as the Hot Spot (later rebranded as the Verizon New Music Channel) which is heard on several other Kiss stations across the United States. *HD2 channel flipped formats in 2011 to a 1980s and 1990s hip hop and R&B; channel.http://hdradio.com/stations References External links KKF KKF Category:Contemporary hit radio stations in the United States Category:Radio stations established in 1968 Category:IHeartMedia radio stations ","title":"WKKF"},{"id":"3892517","text":"Z Matrix or bus impedance matrix is an important tool in power system analysis. Though, it is not frequently used in power flow study, unlike Ybus matrix, it is, however, an important tool in other power system studies like short circuit analysis or fault study. The Zbus matrix can be computed by matrix inversion of the Ybus matrix. Since the Ybus matrix is usually sparse, the explicit Zbus matrix would by dense so memory intensive to handle directly.  Context  Electric power transmission needs optimization. Only Computer simulation allows the complex handling required. The Zbus matrix is a big tool in that box. Formulation Z Matrix can be formed by either inverting the Ybus matrix or by using Z bus building algorithm. The latter method is harder to implement but more practical and faster (in terms of computer run time and number of floating-point operations per second) for a relatively large system. Formulation: Z_{bus} = {Y_{bus}}^{-1} Because the Zbus is the inverse of the Ybus, it is symmetrical like the Ybus. The diagonal elements of the Zbus are referred to as driving-point impedances of the buses and the off-diagonal elements are called transfer impedances.Grainger, John; Stevenson, William (2003). Power System Analysis. McGraw-Hill. pp 284 One reason the Ybus is so much more popular in calculation is the matrix becomes sparse for large systems; that is, many elements go to zero as the admittance between two far away buses is very small. In the Zbus, however, the impedance between two far away buses becomes very large, so there are no zero elements, making computation much harder. The operations to modify an existing Zbus are straightforward, and outlined in Table 1. To create a Zbus matrix from scratch, we start by listing the equation for one branch: [V_1] = [Z_a][I_1] Then we add additional branches according to Table 1 until each bus is expressed in the matrix: \\\\begin{bmatrix} V_1\\\\\\\\\\\\ V_2 \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} Z_a & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & Z_b \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} I_1\\\\\\\\\\\\ I_2 \\\\end{bmatrix}  References  External links Category:Electrical power control ","title":"Zbus"},{"id":"3892518","text":"S√£o Francisco de Paula is a city in the Serra Ga√∫cha of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.

Synopsis \\"The Golden Bird\\" collected by the Brothers Grimm and first published in 1812, narrated and recorded on December 14, 2008. Every year, a king's apple tree is robbed of one golden apple during the night. He sets his gardener's sons to watch, and though the first two fall asleep, the youngest stays awake and sees that the thief is a golden bird. He tries to shoot it, but only knocks a feather off. The feather is so valuable that the king decides he must have the bird. He sends his gardener's three sons, one after another, to capture the priceless golden bird. The sons each meet a talking fox, who gives them advice for their quest: to choose a bad inn over a brightly lit and merry one. The first two sons ignore the advice and, in the pleasant inn, abandon their quest. The third son obeys the fox, so the fox advises him to take the bird in its wooden cage from the castle in which it lives, instead of putting it into the golden cage next to it. But he disobeys, and the golden bird rouses the castle, resulting in his capture. He is sent after the golden horse as a condition for sparing his life. The fox advises him to use a leather saddle rather than a golden one, but he fails again. He is sent after the princess from the golden castle. The fox advises him not to let her say farewell to her parents, but he disobeys, and the princess's father orders him to remove a hill as the price of his life. The fox removes it, and then, as they set out, he advises the prince how to keep all the things he has won since then. It then asks the prince to shoot it and cut off its head. When the prince refuses, it warns him against buying gallows' flesh and sitting on the edge of rivers. He finds that his brothers, who have been carousing and living sinfully in the meantime, are to be hanged (on the gallows) and buys their liberty. They find out what he has done. When he sits on a river's edge, they push him in. They take the things and the princess and bring them to their father. However the bird, the horse, and the princess all grieve for the youngest son. The fox rescues the prince. When he returns to his father's castle dressed in a beggar's cloak, the bird, the horse, and the princess all recognize him as the man who won them, and become cheerful again. His brothers are put to death, and he marries the princess. Finally, the third son cuts off the fox's head and feet at the creature's request. The fox is revealed to be a man, the brother of the princess. Analysis =The animal helper= The prince rides on the fox's back. Illustration by George Cruikshank for Grimm's Goblins, by Edgar Taylor (1823). The helper of the hero differs between versions: usually a fox or a wolf in most versions, but very rarely there is another type of animal, like a lion,\\"Der Goldvogel\\".

He is being greeted by the ollamh r√≠gh, the royal poet, who is addressing him with the proclamation \\"Benach De Re Albanne\\" (= Beannachd D√© R√≠gh Alban, \\"God Bless the King of Scotland\\"); the poet goes on to recite Alexander's genealogy. Culture of Scotland in the High Middle Ages refers to the forms of cultural expression that come from Scotland in the High Medieval period which, for the purposes of this article, refers to the period between the death of Domnall II in 900, and the death of Alexander III in 1286. The unity of the period is suggested by the immense breaks which occur in Scottish history because of the Wars of Scottish Independence, the Stewart accession and transformations which occur in Scottish society in the fourteenth century and afterwards. The period differentiates itself because of the predominance of Gaelic culture, and, later in the medieval, Scoto-Norman French culture. Oral culture As a predominantly Gaelic society, most Scottish cultural practices throughout this period mirrored closely those of Ireland, or at least those of Ireland with some Pictish borrowings. After David I, the French-speaking kings introduced cultural practices popular in Anglo-Norman England, France and elsewhere. As in all pre-modern societies, storytelling was popular. In the words of D.D.R. Owen, a scholar who specialises in the literature of the era: {  } Almost all of these stories are lost, or come down only vaguely in Gaelic or Scots oral tradition. Genealogies One form of culture extremely well accounted for in this period is genealogy. There are dozens of Scottish genealogies surviving from this era, covering everyone from the Mormaers of Lennox and Moray, to the Scottish king himself. In the Poppleton Manuscript, there is a full genealogy of King William I going all the way back to Adam, via Gaidheal Glas. The latter genealogy is just a recording or partial translation of a Gaelic genealogy, where mac (\\"son\\") and meic (\\"sons\\", or \\"of the son\\") have been replaced with filius and filii; moreover, before his grandfather David I, virtually all William's ancestors have their names in the Middle Irish genitive form (with filii preceding). Furthermore, until at least the reign of Alexander III, Scotland's kings maintained an ollamh righe, a royal high poet who had a permanent place in all medieval Gaelic lordships, and whose purpose was to recite genealogies when needed, for occasions such as coronations. The Lord Lyon can be seen as a later development of this role. Literacy Book of Deer, Folio 5r contains the text of the Gospel of Matthew from 1:18 through 1:21. Note the Chi Rho monogram in the upper left corner. The margins contain Gaelic text. Before the reign of David I, the Scots possessed a flourishing literary elite who regularly produced texts in both Gaelic and Latin that were frequently transmitted to Ireland and elsewhere. After David I, the influx of English and French clerics introduced a break with this traditional culture everywhere they went. Even though, as Dauvit Broun shows, a Gaelic literary elite survived in the eastern Scottish lowlands, in places such as Loch Leven and Brechin into the thirteenth century, it was not the flourishing one that contemporary Ireland possessed, at least not in its written literary output. Latin scribes, even if they knew Gaelic, would normally avoid the Gaelic vernacular and, as elsewhere in Europe, would translate vernacular terms into Latin, so that historians are faced with a Gaelic society clothed in Latin terminology. Even names were translated into more common continental forms; for instance, Gille Brigte became Gilbert, √Åed became Hugh, etc. Literature There may be more medieval Scottish Gaelic literature than is often thought. Almost all medieval Gaelic literature has survived because it has been allowed to survive in Ireland, not in Scotland. The continentalisation of the Scottish monarchy and Anglicisation of the later medieval Scottish elite meant that Gaelic manuscripts would never be preserved in Scotland. Thomas Owen Clancy has recently all but proven that the Lebor Bretnach, the so-called \\"Irish Nennius,\\" was written in Scotland, and probably at the monastery in Abernethy. Yet this text survives only from manuscripts preserved in Ireland. In fact, almost all pre-fourteenth century literature than can be attributed to Scotland, survives only from Ireland, England or continental Europe. There survives a small body of medieval Scottish poetry. There seems to have been some patronage of Gaelic poetry by the later Pictish kings. In the thirteenth century, Muireadhach Albanach, Irish poet of the O'D√°laigh clan of poets wrote eulogies for the Mormaers of Lennox. He founded the MacMhuirich bardic family, a Scottish dynasty of poets. Muireadhach may have played a large role introducing the new \\"reformed\\" style of poetry which had been developing in Ireland in the twelfth century. Muireadhach's friend, Gille Brighde Albanach, was perhaps the most prolifically extant native Scottish poet. About 1218, Gille Brighde wrote a poem - Heading for Damietta - on his experiences of the Fifth Crusade. In the thirteenth century, French flourished as a literary language, and produced the Roman de Fergus, the earliest piece of non-Celtic vernacular literature to survive from Scotland. Moreover, many other stories in the Arthurian Cycle, written in French and preserved only outside Scotland, are thought by some scholars (D.D.R. Owen for instance) to have been written in Scotland. Latin too was a literary language. Famous examples would be the Inchcolm Antiphoner, a Lament for Alan, Lord of Galloway and the Carmen de morte Sumerledi (\\"Song on the Death of Somerled\\"), a poem which exults triumphantly the victory of the citizens of Glasgow over Somailre mac Gilla Brigte. Additionally, almost all historical writing from this period was also written in Latin. There is no extant literature in the English language in this era, although that language would experience a literary take-off in the century after this period. There is a little Norse literature from Scandinavian parts, such as the Northern Isles and the Western Isles. The famous Orkneyinga Saga however, although it pertains to the Earldom of Orkney, was written in Iceland. The Western Isles would be integrated into Scotland during this period, but the Northern Isles were ruled from Norway until the late 15th century. Music The harp (or clarsach) was an instrument associated with medieval Scottish culture. This one, now in the Museum of Scotland, is one of only three surviving medieval Gaelic harps. In the Middle Ages, Scotland was renowned for its musical skill. Gerald of Wales tells us that: {  } The medieval Scots indeed took harping very seriously. We know that, even half a century after Gerald was writing, King Alexander III kept a royal harpist. Of the three medieval harps that survive, two come from Scotland (Perthshire), and one from Ireland. Singers also had a royal function. For instance, when the king of Scotland past through the territory of Strathearn, it was the custom that he be greeted by seven female singers, who would sing to him. When Edward I approached the borders of Strathearn in the summer of 1296, he was met by these seven women, \\"who accompanied the King on the road between Gask and Ogilvie, singing to him, as was the custom in the time of the late Alexander kings of Scots\\".

Cowgill (; December 19, 1929 ‚Äì July 31, 2018) was an American anthropologist and archaeologist. He was a professor of anthropology at Arizona State University from 1990-2005, and research professor emeritus from 2005 until his death. He received his PhD from Harvard in 1963 with a dissertation on The Post-Classic Period in the Southern Maya Lowlands. Most of his career was devoted to research at the ancient Mexican city of Teotihuac√°n. He taught at Brandeis University between 1960 and 1990. Cowgill made important contributions in a number of areas, including the archaeology of Mesoamerica, the comparative study of early states and cities, and quantitative methods in archaeology. Early life George Cowgill and his twin brother, linguist Warren Cowgill (d. 1985), were born near Grangeville, Idaho in 1929. Along with his brother, George Cowgill graduated from Stanford University in 1952 with a degree in physics. Career Cowgill was selected as the 1992 Distinguished Lecturer in Archaeology by the American Anthropological Association. In 2004 he was awarded the Alfred Vincent Kidder Award of the American Anthropological Association for his contributions to the archaeology of the Americas. This is one of the most prestigious awards in the field of archaeology. Cowgill's major archaeological fieldwork and analysis was centered on Teotihuac√°n. With Ren√© Millon, Cowgill spent years systematically mapping the city of Teotihuac√°n in the Valley of Mexico near modern Mexico City. In the 1960s he compiled an extensive database of the artifacts collected in the survey. This was one of the first large-scale archaeological databases, and it continues to be used for research today. In the late 1980s, Cowgill co-directed excavations at the Feathered Serpent Pyramid at Teotihuac√°n with Saburo Sugiyama and Rub√©n Cabrera. Several of Cowgill's published articles on Teotihuac√°n are among the most important syntheses of archaeological information on this ancient city. George Cowgill was also a pioneering researcher in the use of computers, databases, and quantitative methods in archaeology. He published important methodological papers on seriation (a quantitative method for determining the chronology of sites and artifacts) and on artifact classification. He and his students produced innovative studies of the spatial organization of Teotihuac√°n as determined from his artifact database. They were able to measure the extent of the city and track its growth and decline through the centuries for the first time. Cowgill made a number of major contributions to the comparative study of ancient states and cities. His 1975 work on demography and population growth helped reorient archaeological studies of ancient population trends, and served to link the study of ancient demography to demographic trends in the modern world. He co-edited an influential 1988 book on the collapse of ancient states and empires. Cowgill also published important works on ancient cities around the world and their comparative analysis.

It has approximately 1000 students, and it is located in Libertad 555 street, Capital Federal, Buenos Aires, Argentina. As it is affiliated with the University, it has an admission process that lasts one year and consists of an admission course, which involves multiple exams in Mathematics, History, Language and Geography. Almost all of its faculty teaches in the UBA, and physical education used to be performed at the Universidad de Buenos Aires campus, in Ciudad Universitaria, until 2016. One of its characteristics is that there is no need to do the CBC (a public admission year to enter the university), because it offers its students the possibility of attending an extra 6th year in the career they have chosen. The school has a reputation for being strict and rigorous, not admitting students who have been held back, or have more than one subject that hasn't been passed. The school has also earned several education awards for its academic excellence.  History  The Instituto Libre de Segunda Ense√±anza in 1892.The Instituto libre de Segunda Ense√±anza was founded in 1892 by a group of men with experience in education who, before, during and after their activities in the school, occupied important scientific, political and social positions. Almost all of the men who composed the teaching staff of the institute came from the historical Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires school, to which they resigned collectively as a reaction to the dismissal of the director by part of the government. In a visit carried out by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Education to the Nacional de Buenos Aires school, a small group of students displayed attitudes that he considered irreverent. Angered, he compiled a report that requested, among other things, the release of the young Director, Adolfo Orma. Twenty-four hours later, the Executive authority decreed the dismissal of Dr. Orma, and temporarily naming the Inspector. The public protested at the execution of these events, and the papers censored the issue. The students revolted in parts of the city, and the teaching staff, was unanimous convened in the house of the professor Calixto Oyuela, and sent their collective resignation to the Chief inspector. Calixto Oyuela then proposed to create a new school, one \\"free of official influences, judgements, and national politic changes\\", and it was funded on 16 May 1892, under the name \\"Instituto Libre de Segunda Ense√±anza\\", on Florida 756, with Adolfo Orma as its director. The school was put under the academic protection of the Universidad de Buenos Aires, and received the political support and educational help of Bartolom√© Mitre and Vicente Fidel L√≥pez. Later, the school moved its facilities to Libertad 555  Facilities  The school's facilities are: five labs (Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Computer Science, and Arts), a library on the last floor that serves as a study area, and a variety of art and science workshops.

The 1980‚Äì81 season saw the club win the Division One title, and join the top division of the Woking and District league. The club was then renamed Covies to distinguish itself from the church youth group, which they had originally been formed from. They then joined Division three of the Surrey Intermediate League (Western) for the start of the 1982‚Äì83 campaign. The club progressed through the league gaining promotion to the top division at the end of the 1987‚Äì88 competition when they finished as Runners up in Division Two. After nine seasons in the Surrey County Intermediate League they joined the newly formed Division Three of the Hampshire League in 1991.

It is located at Avenue H between East 15th and East 16th Streets on the border of Midwood and Flatbush, Brooklyn. The station is served by the Q train at all times.  History  The station was opened around 1900 as Fiske Terrace, a two-track surface station serving the new planned community of Fiske Terrace in Midwood. The station house, through which the station is entered, is a landmarked wood frame structure built in 1905 as a real estate office of the T.B. Ackerson Company to sell homes in the new community. It was converted to railroad use in 1907, at the same time that the station was renamed \\"Avenue H.\\"Northbound station houseIn 2003, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced plans to demolish the station house, citing its wood construction as a fire hazard. The community intervened, emphasizing the building's historic importance, architectural significance, connecting to the adjacent community and the fact that several other wooden station houses on the subway system had been given landmark status earlier. On June 29, 2004, the station house was designated a landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. This allows renovations inside, but preserves the major structure and exterior. The contract to \\"restore the landmark station control house\\" as well as rehabilitation of the platforms and other stations structures was advertised for bids by the MTA for January 2007. This station underwent reconstruction from September 2009 to December 2011. Both platforms were rebuilt with new edges, windscreens, and canopies. An additional unstaffed station house on the extreme north end of the Coney Island-bound platform was added on what was once marshland. The new station house included an ADA-accessible ramp. The landmarked station house was also renovated, and several turnstiles were added to the station.http://forgotten- ny.com/2014/04/avenue-h-brighton-line/ Northbound accessibility for this station was proposed in February 2019 as part of the MTA's \\"Fast Forward\\" program. , an accessible ramp from the northbound station house to the northbound platform is expected to be completed in June 2021. Station layout Southbound station houseThe Avenue H station is laid out in a typical local stop setup.Avenue H (BMT Brighton Line) NYCSubway Retrieved June 25, 2009 There are four tracks and two side platforms. The center two tracks are the express tracks used by the B train on weekdays. North of the station, the roadbed ramps down to an open-cut. South of the station, the line is on a raised earthen embankment. This is the result of an increase of grade on the line in the early 1900s which then allowed it to pass over (rather than under, as before) the newly depressed grade of the Long Island Rail Road's Bay Ridge Branch and the nearby Manhattan Beach Junction station. The station platform lies over this crossing which exists between Avenues H and I. Due to the change in elevation, the north end of this station is slightly above ground level and as a result, road traffic on Avenue H dead-ends on both sides of the line. However, there is a pedestrian tunnel underneath the line that connects the sidewalk on both sides. The southbound (Coney Island-bound) local track is technically known as A1 while the northbound (Manhattan-bound) one is A2; the \\"A\\" designation is used for chaining purposes along the Brighton Line from the Manhattan Bridge to Coney Island. Although they cannot be accessed at Avenue H, the southbound and northbound express tracks are known as A3 and A4, respectively. =Exits= The passageway underneath the tracks at Avenue H Both of the station's entrances are at the north end of the station. Northbound station house The station's main entrance is the landmarked station house on the east side of the tracks, on the south side of Avenue H. There are turnstiles and a full-time booth in the station house. There is also a HEET adjacent to the station house, from which a stair leads to the northbound platform, and an underpass leads to a single staircase to the Coney Island-bound platform. Access to these stairs is also available via turnstiles in the underpass. There is an exit-only turnstile on either side of the underpass. Southbound station house The ADA-accessible ramp and a stair leads to the unstaffed brick station house on the west side of the tracks. The ramp wraps around the station house to adjust for the height difference between the station house and ground level. This station house contains a bank of regular and High Entry/Exit Turnstiles.

During the reign of the violent and capricious Zhang Zuo, Song Hun served as a general, even though he constantly feared Zhang Zuo, because his older brother Song Xiu (ÂÆã‰øÆ) had previously had a conflict with Zhang Zuo. In 355, when Zhang Guan rose against Zhang Zuo, Song started an uprising of his own against Zhang Zuo as well, and quickly arrived at the capital Guzang (ÂßëËáß, in modern Wuwei, Gansu). Zhang Guan's brother Zhang Ju (ÂºµÁêö) and son Zhang Song (ÂºµÂµ©) then started an uprising inside the city and opened the gates to welcome Song's forces in. Zhang Zuo's own troops turned on him and killed him. Song and Zhang Ju jointly declared Zhang Zuo's nephew, Zhang Xuanjing (whose older brother Zhang Yaoling was the legitimate ruler before Zhang Zuo seized the throne from him and killed him), the Duke of Xiping, a Jin-created title that his ancestors had carried for generations. When Zhang Guan subsequently arrived, Zhang Guan became regent, and Song was a key assistant. Zhang Guan overruled Song's decision and had Zhang Xuanjing claim a title that Jin had never conferred‚ÄîPrince of Liang. Zhang Guan's regency was a dictatorial one, and he suspected people of conspiring against him. He was particularly suspicious of Song, since Song was loyal to the state institutions, and Zhang Guan wanted to eventually take over as ruler himself. In 359, he therefore planned to kill Song Hun and his brother Song Cheng (ÂÆãÊæÑ). Song Hun heard this and started an uprising, declaring that Zhang Guan had committed treason and that he had authorization from Zhang Xuanjing's grandmother Princess Dowager Ma to kill him. Their forces battled inside the city, but Song Hun's forces prevailed, and Zhang Guan and Zhang Ju committed suicide. He slaughtered their clan. Song Hun was considered an able and tolerant regent‚Äîeven, for example, commissioning one of Zhang Guan's bodyguards, Xuan Lu (ÁéÑËáö), who had, during the battle, tried to kill him with a spear but failed and was captured, as a trusted officer. Under his decision, Zhang Xuanjing relinquished the title Prince of Liang and again claimed the Jin-created title Duke of Xiping. Song himself was created the Marquess of Jiuquan. In 361, Song Hun grew ill, and Zhang Xuanjing and Princess Dowager Ma visited him personally, asking whether his son Song Linzong (ÂÆãÊûóÂÆó) should succeed him if he died. Song Hun noted that Song Linzong was young and weak in personality, and that Song Cheng might be an appropriate choice‚Äîbut also warned that Song Cheng's reaction was slow and needed to be watched closely. Song Hun warned Song Cheng and his own sons that they needed to be humble and faithful to the state, and he told many officials the same. He soon died, and it was described that the commoners on the street were all mournful and weeping. Song Cheng became regent, but just several months later, the general Zhang Yong (ÂºµÈÇï), who was unhappy that Song Cheng became regent, overthrew Song Cheng and slaughtered the Song clan. Zhang Yong and Zhang Xuanjing's uncle Zhang Tianxi served as coregents, and soon Zhang Tianxi killed Zhang Yong (claiming, inter alia, to be avenging the Songs), but eventually overthrew Zhang Xuanjing himself in 363 and took the throne.

At that time, the only road connecting it was Angier Street. It was noted to have been heated by steam power, no lighting, and a private water supply from a well 10 feet in diameter and 40 feet deep. A watchman made hourly rounds to seven stations. The Post-depression era saw an expansion of the mill in the late 1930s and early 1940s. After World War II the demand for excelsior was radically reduced.http://riverreporter.com/issues/09-09-03/feature.html The introduction of foam rubber virtually eliminated the use of excelsior as stuffing material. Even so, the secondary packing material market continued for a short time. By the 1960s, the demand for excelsior was non-existent and the mill operated more as a storage facility than active production facility. By 1977, all the major mills in the Atlanta area had shut their doors.History by a Graveyard : The Fulton Bag and Cotton Mills Records, Robert C. McMath, Jr., http://www.library.gatech.edu/fulton_bag/history.html In 1977-1978, the mill was converted over to a pizzeria and barrio. With a Wurlitzer Organ as part of the setting, the Excelsior Mill featured everything from movies to bands to Shakespearian plays over its decade-long run; the pizza and barrio house survived until 1989.

After the owner sold the property for a mixed-use land development now called North + Line, locals and preservationists got historic protection for the original buildings, which will be included in the redevelopment as a restaurant. The Masquerade announced in late June 2016 that it would reopen in the Blandtown section of West Midtown at 1421 Fairmont Ave in late August, just a week after closing its historic mill location. However, this was thwarted by a lawsuit filed by a developer planning to build single- family homes across the street in the industrial area. In mid September, a deal was reached to temporarily house the club in Kenny's Alley, the bottom level of Underground Atlanta, starting in late October, though the first concert wasn't held there until late November, just two days before Thanksgiving.

The name of the band was in honor of the New Testament disciple Barnabas. Originating out of the Jesus movement of the 1970s, they are considered one of the pioneers of Christian hard rock and heavy metal, along with Agape, Daniel Band, Jerusalem, and Resurrection Band. Over their career as a band, Barnabas was based in Los Angeles, Schaumburg, Illinois, Des Moines, Iowa, and Edmond, Oklahoma. Barnabas recorded five studio albums and played a relatively small number of concerts. Throughout their career, the band suffered from attacks by prominent Christian lecturers, which ultimately contributed to their break-up in 1986. Band history Monte Cooley founded the band in southern California in 1977 as according to him he was unaware of Resurrection Band and therefore did not know of any Christian groups playing hard rock or heavy metal at the time.Homeplanet Cooley placed an ad in Guitar Center that he wanted to form a Christian heavy metal band, and soon bassist Gary Mann and drummer Lance Johnson joined the band.MusicMight Cooley originally wanted Darrell Mansfield as a vocalist, but Mansfield turned down the offer so Carolyn Joy was recruited instead. Lance Johnson and Carolyn Joy performed live with the band for a short time, and second guitarist David Storrs was also involved with the band during this period. However, all three left within the first year. The band briefly had a drummer known as Roy, but he was soon replaced by Kris Klingensmith (Kris k.) who took over on drums. Nancy Jo Mann (later Nancyjo or NJo) then joined the band on vocals after being discovered through an ad in a local paper. The band recorded their first album, Hear the Light, in 1980 in a Los Angeles studio. After this, the band briefly visited Highway Missionary Society in Rogue River, Oregon before moving to Jesus People USA in Chicago for an equally short stay. Next, they moved to nearby Schaumburg, Illinois. After completion of the first album, Monte decided to leave the band, and was replaced by Michael (Mick) Donner. Two guitarists Michael \\"Mick\\" Donner and Kris Brauninger, joined the band, and the whole outfit relocated to Des Moines, Iowa, the hometown of Nancy Jo. A second album, Find Your Heart a Home, was recorded in 1981. Following this, both Mick and Kris Brauninger left after the second album was recorded, and Brian Belew joined as a guitarist. With this lineup Barnabas joined Light Records and recorded 1983's Approaching Light Speed and 1984's Feel the Fire.Thompson, pg.153-154. The band then relocated to Edmond, Oklahoma. However, throughout their career the band faced constant criticism from church organizations and ministers such as Bob Larson, Jimmy Swaggart, and Bill Gothard, and this, combined with the pressures of maintaining the band, Barnabas decided to disband after playing at Toronto Greenfest in 1985. The band's contract obligations required them to release another album, Little Foxes, which was released in 1986, after which the group disbanded. In 1992, Kris Klingensmith and Royce Priem launched a project to release a compilation CD called The Gospel According to Barnabas, which was remixed by John and Dino Elefante of Mastedon. This was released in 1992, but CD-reissues of Barnabas's old albums would not come out until the late 1990s. The band's official website, \\"Homeplanet\\", was launched in February, 1997 and continues today as a repository of Barnabas history, discography, posters, and other historic items. It also features the popular phpBB message board, \\"the manifest\\". Most of the former band members have posted there in the past. Currently, Kris and Nancyjo are participating actively on the manifest. Klingensmith was instrumental in developing the Homeplanet website content, and also pushed through the reissue of all five Barnabas albums on CD, a process that began in 1998 and ended in 2004. Style and legacy Barnabas are considered an important part of the 1970s Jesus MovementCusic, pg.333. and played a pivotal role in establishing Christian rock, along with groups such as Agape, Daniel Band, DeGarmo and Key, Petra, Resurrection Band, Servant, and Sweet Comfort Band.Thompson, pg.71, 89. They are also cited as a pioneer of Christian metal and hard rock, filling the gap on a timeline after Resurrection Band and Jerusalem and before Daniel Band. On earlier albums, Barnabas adopted a mixture of hard rock, heavy blues, and metal, before adopting a full metal sound with a science-fiction and futuristic flair on their high-point album, Approaching Light Speed. The e-zine The Phantom Tollbooth referred to the band's style as punk rock.Chromey, 2003 They maintained a significant following before disappearing after their break up. =Nancy Jo Mann= Nancy Jo Mann's vocal style has been described as \\"powerhouse,\\" drawing influence from Wendy Kaiser and Janis Joplin. After the break up of Barnabas, Mann went put her energies into Women Exploited by Abortion, which she had established in 1982. Eight years before, in 1974, Mann underwent a botched saline abortion when she was twenty-two, which caused serious complications.Facing Life According to Randy Alcorn, Mann was the first to identify consistent psychological effects of abortion.Alcorn, section 27d.

Smart battery components A smart battery or a smart battery pack is a rechargeable battery pack with a built-in battery management system (BMS), usually designed for use in a portable computer such as a laptop. In addition to the usual positive and negative terminals, a smart battery has two or more terminals to connect to the BMS; typically the negative terminal is also used as BMS \\"ground\\". BMS interface examples are: SMBus, PMBus, EIA-232, EIA-485, and Local Interconnect Network. Internally, a smart battery can measure voltage and current, and deduce charge level and SoH (State of Health) parameters, indicating the state of the cells. Externally, a smart battery can communicate with a smart battery charger and a \\"smart energy user\\" via the bus interface. A smart battery can demand that the charging stop, request charging, or demand that the smart energy user stop using power from this battery. There are standard specifications for smart batteries: Smart Battery System, MIPI BIF and many ad-hoc specifications.  Charging  A smart battery charger is mainly a switch mode power supply (also known as high frequency charger) that has the ability to communicate with a smart battery pack's battery management system (BMS) in order to control and monitor the charging process. This communication may be by a standard bus such as CAN bus in automobiles or System Management Bus (SMBus) in computers. The charge process is controlled by the BMS and not by the charger, thus increasing security in the system. Not all chargers have this type of communication which is commonly used for lithium batteries. Besides the usual plus (positive) and minus (negative) terminals, a smart battery charger also has multiple terminals to connect to the smart battery pack's BMS. The Smart Battery System standard is commonly used to define this connection, which includes the data bus and the communications protocol between the charger and battery. There are other ad-hoc specifications also used. = Hardware = Smart battery controller integrated circuits are available. For example, Linear Technology manufactures the LTC4100 and the LTC4101 Smart Battery System-compatible products.

He was a first-round draft pick by the Los Angeles Rams in the 1970 NFL Draft and played there 11 years before going to the San Francisco 49ers in 1981. He played with the Niners four more years and won two Super Bowls with them: Super Bowl XVI and Super Bowl XIX. He wore the number 64 throughout his career. He played in a total of 13 postseason games. Reynolds currently splits his time between a house in Miami and another in the Caribbean. Reynolds earned his nickname in 1969 by cutting an abandoned 1953 Chevrolet Bel Air (some accounts claim it was a Porsche) in half with a hacksaw after his previously unbeaten University of Tennessee team returned from an embarrassing 38-0 road loss to Ole Miss. \\"I came back to school and I was very upset,\\" Reynolds said. \\"I had to do something to relieve my frustration.\\" He decided to turn the abandoned car into a trailer for his newly purchased Jeep. After working through the night on the project, chewing through 13 hacksaw blades, he returned the next day with some teammates to show off his handiwork. However, when they arrived, both halves of the car were gone. For the remainder of his career, the nickname stuck.

History The Ringwood Almanac says that the Ringwood Town Football Club was formed in 1879. The club is first mentioned in county records in 1886 when it used the title of Ringwood Hornets. The team was disbanded during the 1914‚Äì1918 war and was re-established in 1918 as Ringwood Comrades, consisting mainly of servicemen returning from the battlefields. In 1936, the club reverted to the name of Ringwood Town Football Club but was disbanded again during the Second World War. In 1946 the club was listed as Ringwood & Welworthy Football Club but soon reverted to the title of Ringwood Town and has played under that name ever since. The club played at Carvers Playing Fields during the 1950s and 1960s but an ambitious club committee, encouraged by Ringwood Town Council, laid the foundations for the club to move to the present Long Lane ground. Successive committees have continued to improve the facilities at the ground such that the club was able to join the Wessex League in 2004. Picture of Ringwood Town in action Ringwood Town have won the Bournemouth Senior Cup on four occasions and runner up on a further four. In 1980 the club recorded its most memorable achievement when Southern League opponents were defeated to win the Russell Cotes Cup. Since then the club was promoted to Hampshire League Division One only to be relegated the following season. The club has had success in the Bournemouth Leagues and in the Bournemouth F.A. Page Croft Cup. During 2003‚Äì04 season the first team reached the final of the Hampshire League Floodlit Cup whilst the reserve team won the Hampshire League Combination 2 Division.

The removal is achieved by dissolving air in the water or wastewater under pressure and then releasing the air at atmospheric pressure in a flotation tank basin. The released air forms tiny bubbles which adhere to the suspended matter causing the suspended matter to float to the surface of the water where it may then be removed by a skimming device. Dissolved air flotation is very widely used in treating the industrial wastewater effluents from oil refineries, petrochemical and chemical plants, natural gas processing plants, paper mills, general water treatment and similar industrial facilities. A very similar process known as induced gas flotation is also used for wastewater treatment. Froth flotation is commonly used in the processing of mineral ores. In the oil industry, dissolved gas flotation (DGF) units do not use air as the flotation medium due to the explosion risk. Nitrogen gas is used instead to create the bubbles. Process description A typical dissolved air flotation unit (DAF) DAF unit with a capacity of 20 m3/h, visible also: flocculant preparation station and pipe flocculator Modern DAF units using parallel plate technology are quite compact. Picture shows a 225 m3/h DAF. The feed water to the DAF float tank is often (but not always) dosed with a coagulant (such as ferric chloride or aluminum sulfate) to coagulate the colloidal particles and/or a flocculant to conglomerate the particles into bigger clusters. A portion of the clarified effluent water leaving the DAF tank is pumped into a small pressure vessel (called the air drum) into which compressed air is also introduced. This results in saturating the pressurized effluent water with air. The air- saturated water stream is recycled to the front of the float tank and flows through a pressure reduction valve just as it enters the front of the float tank, which results in the air being released in the form of tiny bubbles. Bubbles form at nucleation sites on the surface of the suspended particles, adhering to the particles. As more bubbles form, the lift from the bubbles eventually overcomes the force of gravity. This causes the suspended matter to float to the surface where it forms a froth layer which is then removed by a skimmer. The froth-free water exits the float tank as the clarified effluent from the DAF unit. Some DAF unit designs utilize parallel plate packing material (e.g. lamellas) to provide more separation surface and therefore to enhance the separation efficiency of the unit. DAF systems can be categorized as circular (more efficient) and rectangular (more residence time). The former type requires just 3 minutes. A particular circular DAF system is called \\"Zero speed\\", allowing quite water status then highest performances; a typical example is an Easyfloat 2K DAF system. The rectangular type requires 20 to 30 minutes. One of the bigger advantages of the circular type is its spiral scoop. Drinking water treatment Drinking water supplies that are particularly vulnerable to unicellular algal blooms, and supplies with low turbidity and high colour often employ DAF. After coagulation and flocculation processes, water flows to DAF tanks where air diffusers on the tank bottom create fine bubbles that attach to floc resulting in a floating mass of concentrated floc. The floating floc blanket is removed from the surface and clarified water is withdrawn from the bottom of the DAF tank.Edzwald, James K., ed. (2011). Water Quality and Treatment. 6th Edition.

The club won the Fox Memorial in his first year as coach. In 1979 he moved to the Brisbane club competition, coaching the Norths Devils. =1980s= In 1980 Lowe took the Norths club to the Brisbane Rugby League's grand final which they won. He coached Norths until the end of the 1982 season, his last game being against the Arthur Beetson-coached Redcliffe Dolphins at Dolphin Oval. In 1983, Graham Lowe was appointed coach of New Zealand. He would relinquish the Kiwis role in 1985 but returned to coach the Kiwis in 1985 and 1986. Under Lowe's coaching the Kiwis won two (including NZ's first win over Australia in twelve years at Lang Park in 1983) and lost 5 games, mostly losing to the powerful Wally Lewis-led Australians (NZ lost all three tests of the 1986 Trans-Tasman Tests). In 1986, he moved to Britain's Rugby Football League competition, where he was to coach English club Wigan. Wigan had been bereft of success for 27 years. However, under Lowe's coaching at club level, Wigan would re-emerge to be a power in the British game. It was while Lowe was coaching that Wigan were able to secure the signatures of Great Britain players Ellery Hanley and Andy Gregory. Graham Lowe was the coach in Wigan's 15-8 victory over Oldham in the 1986 Lancashire County Cup Final during the 1986‚Äì87 season at Knowsley Road, St. Helens, on Sunday 19 October 1986, coach in the 28-16 victory over Warrington in the 1987 Lancashire County Cup Final during the 1987‚Äì88 season at Knowsley Road, St. Helens, on Sunday 11 October 1987, and coach in the 22-17 victory over Salford in the 1988 Lancashire County Cup Final during the 1988‚Äì89 season at Knowsley Road, St. Helens on Sunday 23 October 1988.

He was successful in bringing the Sea Eagles back to the finals in 1990 and 1991. During 1991, Lowe was appointed coach of the Queensland Maroons State of Origin team, becoming the first and so far only non-Australian to coach in the rugby league showpiece. After being appointed Maroons coach Lowe suffered from health problems when a blood clot in his leg threatened to end not only his coaching career but his life. He recovered in time to lead Queensland to a 2‚Äì1 victory over NSW in the 1991 State of Origin series. He was re-appointed for the 1992 series but Qld went down to the Phil Gould- coached Blues two games to one. Graham Lowe also coached the Western Samoan side for the 1995 Rugby League World Cup. In 1996, Lowe coached the North Queensland Cowboys on a one-year contract before stepping aside for Tim Sheens.

Because the native Puerto Rican officers were Puerto Rican citizens and not citizens of the United States, they were required to undergo a physical examination to determine their fitness for commissions in the regular army and to take an oath of U.S. citizenship with their new officers' oaths.Historia Militar de Puerto Rico, by H√©ctor Andr√©s Negroni; pg. 370; In June 1908, Lt. Marxuach and all the others passed. He was assigned to the unit in charge of the Progressive Military Map of Puerto Rico from July 12, 1908 to December 4, 1908, during which time he was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant. =The first shot of the United States in World War I= Casing of the shell fired at the Odenwald The United States tried to remain neutral when World War I broke out in August 1914. However, Washington insisted on its neutral right to send ships without them being attacked by German submarines. American ships carried food and raw materials to Britain. By January 30, 1908, the Porto Rico Regiment of Infantry was stationed at Camp Las Casas in Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico. Different units were stationed at other forts throughout the island and Lt. Marxuach was stationed at El Morro Castle, (then an Army base named Fort Brooke) at San Juan Bay. On March 21, 1915, Lt. Marxuach was the officer of the day at El Morro Castle. The Odenwald, built in 1903 (not the German World War II warship of the same name), was an armed German supply ship which tried to force its way out of San Juan Bay and deliver supplies to the German submarines waiting in the Atlantic Ocean. Lt. Marxuach gave the order to open fire on the ship from the walls of the fort. Sergeant Encarnacion Correa then manned a machine gun located along the wall below \\"La Fortaleza\\", the governor's residence, and fired warning shots at the ship with little effect. Marxuach then fired a cannon of the Santa Rosa battery in the upper platform of El Morro, in what is considered to be the first shot of World War I fired by the regular armed forces of the United States against any ship flying the colors of the Central Powers, forcing the Odenwald to stop and to return to port, where its supplies were confiscated. The shots ordered by Lt. Marxuach were the first fired by the United States in World War I.house of Puerto Rico San Diego =International incident= USS Newport News, 1917 (previously The Odenwald) Marxuach's actions became an international incident when the German government accused the United States government of the holding the Odenwald illegally against its will without firing the customary warning shot as required by international law. The United States government responded that the official report of the United States War Department made by Lt. Col. Burnham, the commander of the fortress of El Morro Castle, made it clear that only warning shots were made and that none were aimed at the Odenwald. Eventually, the Odenwald was refitted and renamed SS Newport by the U.S. government and assigned to the U.S. Shipping Board, where it served until 1924, when it was retired.Newport News In 1917, the Germans resumed the practice of unrestricted submarine warfare, in part leading to America's entry into the war. Service in the Panama Canal Zone On April 6, 1917, the U.S. Congress declared war on Germany and on May 14, 1917, the Porto Rico Regiment was sent to Panama, where Marxuach served at the commanding post at Camp E.S. Otis in defense of the Panama Canal Zone as captain of the infantry.Puerto Rico National Guard, Retrieved September 8, 2007 While serving in Panama, he was promoted twice: on June 25, 1918, he was promoted to major, and on September 10 of the same year, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. The regiment returned to Puerto Rico in March 1919 and was renamed The 65th Infantry by the Reorganization Act of June 4, 1920.Between World Wars, Retrieved September 8, 2007 During his military career, Marxuach served at various posts in Puerto Rico. Later years Marxuach's M1902 Officer's Saber (Sword) and Scabbard at the National Historic Trust site at Castillo San Cristobal in San Juan. Marxuach retired on June 30, 1922, with the rank of lieutenant colonel. He continued to serve with the Organized Reserves of Puerto Rico until November 4, 1922. Upon his retirement, Marxuach worked as a civil engineer for the Department of Interior, in a project known as the Salto de Comerio. Marxuach also worked in the customs building in Old San Juan. Lt.

Wilcox was selected to play for seven Pro Bowls and was named All-NFL five times during his career. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame College career =Boise Junior College & Oregon= After graduating from Vale High School in eastern Oregon in 1960, Wilcox began his college football career at Boise Junior College (now Boise State University) and earned junior college All-America honors. After two years in Boise under head coach Lyle Smith, he transferred to the University of Oregon in Eugene in 1962 for his final two campaigns under head coach Len Casanova; His older brother Johnny Wilcox had played for the Ducks on the 1957 team that went to the Rose Bowl, and was selected in the 1960 NFL Draft by the Philadelphia Eagles (15th round). Wilcox was a guard on offense and an end on defense, and teammates at Oregon included Mel Renfro and quarterback Bob Berry. After his senior season in 1963, Wilcox played in the Hula Bowl, Coaches‚Äô All-America Bowl, and the College All-Star Game the following August. He became the first defensive lineman in Hula Bowl history to earn outstanding lineman honors. Both the Houston Oilers of the young American Football League and the San Francisco 49ers of the NFL sought to sign the Oregon star. The Oilers selected him in the sixth round (46th player overall) of the AFL draft, while the 49ers tapped him in the third round (29th overall) of the NFL draft, held two days later. Professional career =San Francisco 49ers= The , Wilcox opted to sign with the more established 49ers where he went on to star for 11 seasons. Converted to outside linebacker, Wilcox quickly established himself as one of the league‚Äôs finest. Nicknamed \\"The Intimidator,\\" he was ideally suited for the position, both mentally and physically. Known for his ability to disrupt plays, he was particularly tough on tight ends. He did not let anybody easily off the line of scrimmage whether to block or get into a pass route. Always prepared, Wilcox was a true student of the game and worked to be fundamentally correct. During the 1964‚Äì1974 span, the 49ers had a winning record in four seasons (1965, 1970, 1971, 1972), and made the playoffs in three consecutive seasons (1970, 1971, 1972) under head coach Dick Nolan.https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/sfo/ SF 49ers team records In 1970, San Francisco won the NFC West division title with a win-lost-tie record of In a divisional game of the 1970 NFL Playoffs, San Francisco defeated the Minnesota Vikings holding them to 124 net passing yards and 117 yards rushing.https://www.pro-football- reference.com/boxscores/197012270min.htm However, they lost the NFC championship game to the Dallas Cowboys.https://www.pro-football- reference.com/boxscores/197101030sfo.htm In 1971, the 49ers had a particularly good year on defense, allowing only 216 points (15.4 points/game), 6th least in the NFL, and won the NFC West with a record of 9-5. They won their divisional game of the 1971 NFL Playoffs over the Washington Redskins,https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/197112260sfo.htm allowing only 99 yards rushing and 93 net passing yards, but again lost the NFC championship game to Dallas.https://www.pro-football- reference.com/boxscores/197201020dal.htm In 1972, San Francisco won the NFC West for the third straight year with a record of 8-5-1, allowing on defense 249 points (17.8 points/game), 9th in the league. But they lost their divisional game of the 1972 NFL Playoffs to Dallas, thus eliminated by the Cowboys three consecutive years. In those three years, Wilcox at left side linebacker formed a strong tandem with middle linebacker Frank Nunley and right linebacker Skip Vanderbundt. He thrived on action and wanted it all directed his way. \\"What I do best,\\" Wilcox once stated, \\"is not let people block me. I just hate to be blocked.\\" Hall of Fame linebacker Joe Schmidt was impressed by his strength. \\"He gave us fits,\\" he remarked. \\"The lead block had to really come out hard to take him out because he was so strong.\\" Aided by his speed and long reach, he was also effective in pass coverage and managed to intercept 14 passes during his career. Following each season, San Francisco would rate their players based on their performance. The typical score for a linebacker was 750. Wilcox‚Äôs score in 1973 was 1,306. That season the veteran linebacker recorded 104 solo tackles, four forced fumbles, and tackled opposing ball carriers for a loss 13 times. Durable, Wilcox missed only one game during his career due to injury. Four times he was named All-NFL (1967, 1971, 1972, 1973) by the AP and two times All-NFC (1971, 1972). He was also selected to play in seven Pro Bowls. Personal Born in the eastern Oregon city of Ontario, Wilcox had six sisters and one brother. Wilcox played high school football at nearby Vale Union High School. He lives in Junction City, near Eugene, where his sons Justin and Josh also played football for the Oregon Ducks.

Ogden Hoffman, 1862, Reports of Land Cases Determined in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Numa Hubert, San Francisco. Victor Linares sold his rancho to James Scott and John Wilson who also bought the adjacent Rancho Pecho y Islay in the Irish Hills to the south of their Los Osos rancho and combined them in a new 32,431 acre grant, Rancho Ca√±ada de los Osos y Pecho y Islay from Governor Pio Pico in 1845. It was used mostly for grazing sheep until 1892, when Alden B. Spooner, Jr., leased the land he later purchased around Islay Creek. He brought in dairy cattle, hogs and other agriculture. His two sons founded the Pecho Ranch & Stock Co., and built a ranch house, a complex of barns, a creamery, stables, sheds, and a waterwheel for power. On the south bluff of Spooner's Cove they utilized a warehouse with a long chute that led down to a wharf and a loading boom to service coastal steamers. The land just to the north was owned by Alexander S. Hazard, who also raised crops and maintained a dairy. Hoping to cash in on California's growing need for timber, he planted hundreds of eucalyptus trees, turning Hazard Canyon into a prospective lumber farm. Unfortunately, eucalyptus proved unsatisfactory for commercial use. In the early 1940s, a flood scoured Hazard Canyon, and in 1947 a grass fire burned up the coast from Diablo Canyon, destroying much of what had been the Hazard dairy buildings. However, Hazard's legacy, the stands of eucalyptus trees, remains. Rancher Oliver C. Field bought the land in the early 1940s, but sold it to Irene McAllister about ten years later. In 1965 the property was purchased by the State of California for a state park, and it was decided to keep the name McAllister had given it: \\"Monta√±a de Oro\\".Sierra Club On April 24, 1965, Rancho Monta√±a de Oro was dedicated as a California State Park after it was purchased out of the Rancho Monta√±a de Oro, Inc. bankruptcy proceeding under the Park acquisition program that then Governor Edmund G. \\"Pat\\" Brown had launched and managed to fund. The Rancho Monta√±a de Oro property was held by Rancho Monta√±a de Oro, Inc., which was owned by Irene M. Starkey. California Beaches and Parks Director Charles De Turk convinced Morris J. Lavine, the attorney who was involved in the bankruptcy proceedings, to hold the property until the Parks Department could purchase it. Rancho Monta√±a de Oro, until recently, has had the longest uninterrupted, preserved and undeveloped coastal area of any publicly owned land in California.

The name \\"Schifanoia\\" is thought to originate from \\"schivar la noia\\" meaning literally to \\"escape from boredom\\" which describes accurately the original intention of the palazzo and the other villas in close proximity where the Este court relaxed. The highlights of its decorations are the allegorical frescoes with details in tempera by or after Francesco del Cossa and Cosm√® Tura, executed ca 1469-70, a unique survival of their time. Palazzo Schifanoia in 1838 Allegory of June: Triumph of Mercury, fresco by Cosimo Tura (1476-84). This palace forms part of a catalogue of pleasure palaces for the Este family, including the following: *Delizia di Belriguardo a Voghiera *Delizia del Verginese a Portomaggiore *Castello di Mesola a Mesola *Villa della Mensa a Sabbioncello San Vittore *Delizia di Benvignante ad Argenta, Italy The Palace of Belfiore which once held the Studiolo of the Palazzo Belfiore, no longer exists. History The palace had its origins in a single-storey structure without wings built for Alberto V d'Este (1385), a small retreat intended solely for suppers and diversions (delizie), as a sort of banqueting house, with an urban front and a garden front. As the equivalent of a Roman villa suburbana, the Palazzo Schifanoia long predated the first such pleasure villa built in Renaissance Rome, the Belvedere built for Nicholas V. In 1452 Borso d'Este received the title of Duke for the imperial fiefs of Modena and Reggio Emilia that he held from Emperor Frederick III. The occasion for the cycle of frescoes was the expected investiture of Borso d'Este as Duke of Ferrara in 1471 by Pope Paul II. The subtext of the festivities embodied in the fresco cycle is the right ordering of mankind and nature under the good government of the Duke, the guarantor of peace and prosperity in the Este dominions. Under the commissions of Borso d'Este, the architect Pietro Benvenuto degli Ordini was called upon to develop a ducal apartment on an upper level, providing the building with a salone suitable for presentations of ambassadors and delegations, a counterpart of the governing structure of Ferrara housed in the former Palazzo della Ragione, destroyed in World War II. The palace was often used by Marfisa d'Este, a great patron of the arts. There, in the Salone dei Mesi (\\"Hall of the Months\\"), Cosimo Tura's purely pagan cycle of the months presents the cycle of the year as an allegorical pageant with the appropriate Olympian gods presiding on their fanciful cars drawn by the beasts proper to each deity, with appropriate personifications of the constellations of the zodiac. The frescoes were realized circa 1469-70 by artisans of the d'Este household, the larger figures based on cartoons by Cosm√© Tura, and the vignettes of the labors of the year and the activities of the Ferrarese court under the benevolent eye of Borso d'Este, flanked by astrological figures to designs by Francesco del Cossa and Ercole de' Roberti. The learned and elaborate scheme of the allegorical presentations must have come from the immediate circle of Borso d'Este, perhaps from the court astrologer, Pellegrino Prisciani, with some details drawn from Boccaccio's Genealogia deorum. In the Sala delle Virt√π (\\"Hall of Virtues\\") nearby, the sculptor Domenico di Paris painted the stucco reliefs in a frieze of putti and symbols of the Cardinal and Theological Virtues, under a painted compartmented ceiling. The fa√ßade was originally decorated with a cornice of feigned battlements, its surface smoothly stuccoed and decorated with geometric designs of highly colorful imitation marbles, which have been lost, lending a somewhat dour public face to Palazzo Schifanoia that was not what Borso d'Este intended. The rich white marble entrance door survives, though its tinted colors have weathered away and art historians disagree whether it is to be attributed to the painter-designer Francesco del Cossa or to Biagio Rossetti. Above the arched door, flanked by pilasters, the Este arms are displayed and the unicorn, a symbol of ducal benevolence and the source of patronage. In 1493 the terracotta cornice was added to designs by Biagio Rossetti, who was also commissioned by Ercole I d'Este to extend the palace. From the Salone dei Mesi the visitor once passed directly into the gardens reached by a monumental stair from the summer loggia, structures that were demolished in the 18th century. After the Este left Ferrara in 1598, the palazzo was inherited through successive heirs, eventually by the Tassoni family, its frescoes whitewashed over. Eventually, during administration of the duchy as part of the Papal States, with a Habsburg garrison, it became a tobacco warehouse and manufactory. When Palazzo Schifanoia came into the possession of the comune of Ferrara in the aftermath of World War I, only seven of the months in the Salone remained legible. Palazzo Schifanoia forms part of the heritage of Ferrara conserved under the umbrella of the Musei Civici d'Arte Antica di Ferrara. The 14th and 15th century rooms contain collections of antiquities, a numismatic collection and medals cast by Pisanello and other Quattrocento artists to commemorate members of the Este family.

The population was 3,324 at the 2010 census. Clearview is located on both sides of State Route 9, where it intersects 180th Street SE (once known as Vine Street) in Snohomish County, Washington, United States. It is located between Snohomish and Woodinville and the top of the Clearview Hill.  History  Clearview was established on timberland that once belonged to Isaac Cathcart and had been logged by the Snohomish Logging Company. Clarence Dayton Hillman obtained the logged property and platted it in 1913 as Cathcart Division #1. There were no roads in the area, so Mr. Hillman eagerly offered right-of-way when the Snohomish Fruit Growers Association sought a shorter route to Seattle. After much controversy, this road was completed in 1925. Now known as Highway 9, the road was initially called the Woodinville Cut-off. By the time the road opened, the Hillman Company had constructed a real estate building, cannery, caf√© and combination gas station-store along it. As an inducement for settlement, new residents were hired to clear land and build houses or gas stations on various company tracts. To convey the impression of self-sufficiency on small plots, the company established a rabbitry, pigeon and squab farm and poultry model- farm with resident \\"experts.\\" Other inducements were free berry vines, fruit trees and plants. Land was donated for a church and a community hall. The settlement was first called West Cathcart and then Cathcart Heights. The 1930 Census lists 624 residents in Cathcart. On Armistice Day 1931 a celebration was held in recognition of the new name of Clearview. This name, possibly proposed by merchants Albert and Lea DesMarais, fittingly described the fine views residents had of the Olympic and Cascade Mountains. When the national Depression began, the businesses were Albert DesMarais Butcher Shop, Store and Gas Station, D'Aigle's Grocery, Phillips Store and Gas Station, Bluebird Caf√©, Pigeon Lodge Dance Hall and several gas stations. Other businesses that evolved were firewood (six partners), cordwood (five partners) and Christmas tree contracting (2 individuals). Eventually, a church was built on the Hillman donation and another on land given by George Robinson. The community was in constant change as residents came and went. Times were economically desperate for many families. The gas stations changed owners frequently, but the other businesses were stable. Development began in other parts of the plat and adjacent areas. Gilbert's Corner, Pigeon Lodge, Berry Brook Farms, Woodshire, Sherwood, Roosevelt Plains and City Farms all appeared. Growth continued in spurts and many businesses came and went. Two major buildings, the Midway and the Begis Trading Center, were built. Three concrete block buildings also arose and housed various businesses. The business center gradually began to expand north along the highway. Three small shopping centers are to be joined by other proposed shopping/business areas. In between them are smaller commercial facilities. Toward the northern terminus is the Willis Tucker County Park. Aside from the CDP, which was established at the 2010 census, the boundaries of this unincorporated community are not well- defined. Services such as education, mail and water are provided by various districts. Fire District #7 serves and the main station is at Clearview.  Geography  Clearview is located at (47.829186, -122.145149). According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 4.639 square miles (12.01 km), all of it land.

A former test , New South Wales representative and long-serving Penrith Panthers player in the New South Wales Rugby League premiership, he later became coach of the club after his retirement. On 25 June 2016, Simmons was inducted into the Penrith Panthers hall of fame alongside Grahame Moran, Greg Alexander and Craig Gower. Playing career After trialling with both St. George and Souths, Simmons was eventually given a contract in 1980 with Penrith. Simmons played much of his first year at lock but was moved to hooker late in the 1981 season. Simmons was first selected to represent New South Wales as a hooker for games II and III of the 1984 State of Origin series, replacing Rex Wright who had been chosen for game I. After missing the 1985 series when selectors chose Balmain's Benny Elias instead, Simmons regained his place for the Blues in the successful 1986 series against Queensland, including a Man of the Match in game I. Simmons secured a place as the first Penrith player to represent Australia when made his Test d√©but in the first test against New Zealand at Carlaw Park in Auckland, and played in ten international games over the next year. Simmons' final test appearance came in Australia at Lang Park against New Zealand, losing 6‚Äì13. At the end of the 1986 NSWRL season, Simmons was selected for the undefeated 1986 Kangaroo tour and played in all six tests on the tour against Papua New Guinea, Great Britain and France. Simmons and Greg Alexander became the first Penrith players to be selected for a Kangaroo Tour. Simmons was selected for all games of the 1987 State of Origin series, including the fourth game held at the Veterans Memorial Stadium in Long Beach, California (United States). His last appearance in a New South Wales jersey was in game I of the 1988 series at the Sydney Football Stadium, with NSW losing 18‚Äì26. The Blues would not win another game until Game 1 of the 1990 series. In 1983, Simmons was appointed captain of the team, a position he retained until 1990 when he captained the Panthers in the 1990 Grand Final loss to the Canberra Raiders. Despite struggling with injuries, he memorably scored two tries in the 1991 Grand Final against the same opponents. The Panthers won their first premiership, and Simmons retired with his second try late in the game (and Alexander's brilliant sideline conversion) sealing the win for the Phil Gould coached Panthers. In the post-game celebrations, Simmons said he wanted to have a beer with every Penrith supporter. He also stated that despite being overjoyed at finally winning a premiership, nothing could erase the bad memory of losing the 1990 decider to the Raiders. Following the grand final victory he travelled with the Panthers to England for the 1991 World Club Challenge which was lost to Wigan. In October 2004, Simmons was named at hooker in the Panthers' Team of Legends. Coaching career Simmons began coaching in 1992 for St Marys reserve grade side. Late that year he moved to England to coach Hull F.C. for two seasons. Simmons went on to become Panthers coach in the closing stages of the 1994 NSWRL season after Phil Gould was dismissed, and served for seven seasons until he was himself sacked from the position after the 2001 NRL season, when the Panthers won the wooden spoon. The Panthers made the finals twice under Simmons' tenure, in the 1997 Super League finals and National Rugby League season 2000 finals. Simmons served as the Wests Tigers assistant coach under his former coach Tim Sheens from 2003 to 2010, during which time they took out the 2005 NRL Premiership. He has also worked as Tim Sheens' assistant coach for the Australian national team. Simmons was named to take over the coaching position at St Helens in 2011. He coached the St. Helens in the 2011 Super League Grand Final defeat by the Leeds Rhinos at Old Trafford. He parted company with St Helens in March 2012. Simmons was sacked after a five-game losing streak. Commenting on the decision, he said, \\"If I had a neck, I'd probably hang myself.\\" In November 2012, Simmons was named assistant coach at NRL side Wests Tigers.
