Description Nymph The adults reach of length. This leafhopper shows a distinctive mosaic-like pattern on the forewings and an orange band between the eyes. Orientus ishidae is associated with willow (Salix species), hornbeam (Carpinus betulus) and with many woody plants and deciduous trees. It may cause serious leaf damages to several tree species and is implicated as a vector of the phytoplasmic flavescence dor√©e (FD) disease in vineyards. Adults can be found from June to October. The nymphs are strongly coloured, the patterning is variable. They often adopt a tail-up posture in response to danger, as seen on the left. Distribution This species is endemic to the East Palearctic realm and it is present in the Nearctic realm and the Oriental realm. It has been introduced in United Kingdom (first reported in Peckham, 2011), Germany, Italy, Switzerland and in several other European countries.

His notable clients included Princess Diana and Shirley Bassey. He once joked that if there were a Nobel Prize for creations in taffeta, he would have won it. Early life Arbeid was born in London, the son of East Enders Jack and Ida Arbeid. Jack Arbeid was a diamond cutter who had inherited a jewellery business and most of the family's friends were in the 'rag trade' ‚Äì wholesaling and retailing clothes. During the war, like many children in vulnerable areas, Murray Arbeid was evacuated to Cornwall to escape the Blitz. Returning to London with a Cornish accent, he attended Cosway Street School in Marylebone before studying at Regent Street Polytechnic (now University of Westminster), and then moving on to the London Institute of Fashion to learn pattern cutting. Career beginnings His first job was with a garment house in Wigmore Street, close to Oxford Street, where he earned 28 shillings and sixpence a week. In 1952, he was apprenticed to Michael Sherard, a member of the elite Incorporated Society of London Fashion Designers and known for his occasion and evening wear. Joining the firm a year before the coronation of Queen Elizabeth meant Arbeid was thrown into a busy environment as Britain's high society ladies refurbished their wardrobes. At Michael Sherard, Arbeid was taught by Mme Raymond, who had once been an apprentice of Madeleine Vionnet, and later the skilled dressmaker Alice Edwards ‚Äì both of whom had impeccable Paris contacts as well as expertise. Edwards, in particular, helped Arbeid to develop his customer manner. Establishment of fashion house Arbeid set up his own label when he was still in his mid 20s, renting space in George Street, close to Oxford Street. As his business prospered in the 1970s, he moved to Bond Street, sharing space with his partner the hat maker Frederick Fox. Later, Arbeid moved again ‚Äì this time to the area round Sloane Square. Finally he would settle in Ebury Street, Belgravia. His lavish ready- to-wear evening gowns ‚Äì he didn't do wedding dresses or daywear ‚Äì sold particularly well in the United States, with further markets in Japan, Germany and France. In the United States, his clients included Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor. Twice a year, he would cross the Atlantic with a trunk show to promote his collections to stores across the US. In the UK, he had a substantial wholesale business, supplying gowns to major department stores such as Harrods and Harvey Nichols and small exclusive stores outside the capital. His typical client was older, moneyed and with a full calendar of engagements. =Royal clients= One of Arbeid's most prestigious clients was Princess Diana, who needed evening wear that had standout appeal and favoured British designers. Notable gowns include a star-embroidered blue strapless gown worn for dinner with the President of Greece in 1986, a black and red flamenco-style gown worn first to a film premiere, and a cream lace gown worn for a British Embassy dinner in Washington D.C. with George and Barbara Bush during the 1986 official visit. These dresses ‚Äì described by fellow royal gown designer Bruce Oldfield as \\"gorgeous loss leaders\\" ‚Äì boosted Arbeid's reputation and won him many other clients, particularly in the US. Other famous wearers of Arbeid gowns included Queen Noor of Jordan, Shirley Bassey and Est√©e Lauder. Later life After Norman Hartnell's death in 1979, Arbeid produced a guest collection for the fashion house. He retired from his business in 1992. He and his partner Frederick Fox lived in Suffolk, making rare visits to London for fashion events, such as the London College of Fashion graduation show. Arbeid was diagnosed with cancer in 2000 and given six months to live, proving the prognosis wrong by over a decade.

Built in the 17th century, the building was modernised in the late 19th century. There may have been a public house at the site in the 16th century. The building is made of cob on a stone base, with stone chimneystacks including one of granite. The roof is a combination of reed thatching, corrugated iron and slate. Built in a T-shape plan, the main area holds three rooms, a kitchen, a main room and a bar. There is a staircase at the rear of the centre room. It appears that the original building was an open hall house. The additional blocks were built in the late 19th and early 20th century, and include cellars and toilet facilities. The interior was largely modernised in the 19th century, but no further modernisation has occurred and some of the 17th century woodwork remains. The deed dates for the Drewe Arms to 1890, when the public house was known as the \\"New Inn\\". The name was changed to the Druid Arms, and then to the Drewe Arms in the 1920s. The building was designated Grade II* listed status on 22 February 1967. It is on the Campaign for Real Ale's National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors. In 1919 the Drewe Arms was taken over by Mabel Mudge, who ran the public house for 75 years before retirement, giving her the record of the longest-serving landlady in the UK. The pub shut in February 2013, owing to the high costs of maintaining the place with a small profit margin, but reopened the same year with new owners.

Mentioned as a dwelling in the 1086 Domesday Book, the building was largely constructed in the 18th century of cob and stone, with a 19th-century brick addition. Queen Elizabeth II visited the inn on 27 March 1998, her first official visit to a pub. History There have been people living at the site of Bridge Inn since at least 1086, as the dwelling was mentioned in the Doomsday Book. Parts of the present building date from the late 16th century, although the majority was built in the 18th century. It is built of cob with stone, although a later 19th-century addition is built of brick. The roof is slate throughout. Inside there are three public rooms, one of which used to contain a brewery on-site. The interior includes many of the original 19th-century fixtures and fittings. It was designated Grade II listed status on 11 November 1952. The interior has been registered on the Campaign for Real Ale's National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors. Inside, lager is only served in bottles, regular drinkers leave post-it notes on their favourite barrels of beer to be called when opened, and the pub will serve drinks by the third of a pint to allow for a wider variety of tasting. The Bridge Inn has been a public house since at least 1797, when it included two dwellings, a quay and a salt refinery. The inn attracted wrestling competitions during the 19th century, and by 1900 there were cattle sales at the site. In 1998, Queen Elizabeth II visited the Bridge Inn, the first time she had officially visited a pub. There she was presented with a crate of commemorative ale, which she remarked that her husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, would enjoy. As of 2014, the inn has remained in the hands of the same family for more than a century.

She was built in Northern Ireland in 1942 as the Empire ship Empire Strength, was operated by Blue Star Line from 1942 to 1961, was bought by Greek shipowners in 1965 and wrecked in 1968. The ship had four names in her career, having been renamed Saxon Star in 1946, Redbrook in 1961 and E Evangelia in 1965. Building Harland and Wolff's Belfast yard built the ship for the UK Ministry of War Transport (MoWT). She was launched on 28 May as Empire Strength and completed in December. She was a motor ship, with a six-cylinder four-stroke single-acting marine Diesel engine developing 490 NHP. The engine was built by Harland and Wolff but was a Burmeister & Wain design from Denmark. Her navigation equipment included wireless direction finding and an echo sounding device. The MoWT appointed Blue Star Line to manage her. Second World War service Empire Strength left Harland and Wolff in Belfast on 22 December 1942 and reached Liverpool the next day. On 13 January 1943 she began her maiden voyage from Liverpool to Sydney via the Panama Canal. It included three convoys: ON 161 from Liverpool to New York, NG 342 from there to Guant√°namo Bay and GZ 22 from there to Crist√≥bal. After passing through the Panama Canal between 18 and 20 February the ship crossed the Pacific Ocean independently, reaching Sydney on 20 March. Records for the rest of the year are incomplete, but the ship seems to have continued to run between Australia and Britain via Panama. She ended 1943 sailing from Australia to Britain as usual via Panama, Guant√°namo Bay and New York. She left Melbourne on 12 December and reached Cardiff on 21 February. Empire Strength spent the rest of 1944 shipping frozen meat from Buenos Aires to Britain and the Mediterranean. Her voyages in and near European and Mediterranean waters were mostly in convoys, but her movements in or near South American waters were mostly independent and unescorted. For the first trip she was in Buenos Aires 17‚Äì25 April, called at Freetown, Sierra Leone 9‚Äì11 May and then spent a fortnight on convoys in the Mediterranean calling at Gibraltar, Algiers, Malta, Augusta and Taranto, and returning via Casablanca to Buenos Aires, where she was in port 3‚Äì22 August. She then took her second cargo of Argentinian frozen meat from via Freetown to England, arriving at the end of September. For her third cargo she was in Buenos Aires from 16 November to 4 December and took it via Gibraltar to Haifa, where she was in port 4‚Äì8 January 1945. In 1945 Empire Strength returned to Australia, sailing from Haifa via the Suez Canal, Port Sudan and Aden and reaching Fremantle on 13 February. She called at Port Pirie, Adelaide and Port Lincoln before crossing the Tasman Sea to New Zealand, where she called at Wellington and New Plymouth. On 22 March she left New Plymouth for England, going via the Panama Canal, Charleston, New York and Convoy HX 354 to Liverpool and reaching London on 19 May. On 11 August she left London for New York, where she arrived on 24 August. She was still in port when Japan surrendered on 2 September. Six days later she left for the Philippines via the Panama Canal, reaching Manila on 21 October. On 16 November she left for New Zealand, where she was in Auckland 2‚Äì6 December and New Plymouth 8‚Äì21 December. Saxon Star In 1946 the MoWT sold Empire Strength to the Blue Star-controlled company Frederick Leyland & Co Ltd, which renamed her Saxon Star. In 1950 Blue Star transferred Saxon Star from Frederick Leyland to another company in the group, Lamport and Holt Line. In 1954 she was transferred to another Blue Star-controlled company, Booth Steamship Co. In 1959 she was transferred to the direct ownership of Blue Star Line itself. In August 1961 Blue Star sold her for ¬£117,000 to DL Street Ltd of Cardiff. =Namesakes= The ship was the second of three Blue Star vessels to have been called Saxon Star. The first was a steamship built in 1899 for the Federal Steam Navigation Co Ltd as and bought by the Vestey Brothers in 1915. They renamed her first Brodlea in 1915, and then Saxonstar in 1920, altering this to Saxon Star in 1929. The third Saxon Star was a 1976-built motor ship that Blue Star wet-chartered from the German company Hamburg S√ºd from 1983 to 1986. With Hamburg S√ºd she had four different names, and while with Blue Star she was named Saxon Star. Redbrook and E Evangelia E Evangelia wreck at Costine»ôti DL Street renamed the ship Redbrook. In 1965 Street sold her to Hegif Compania Naviera SA of Greece, who renamed her E Evangelia. On 15 October 1968 E Evangelia was sailing in ballast from Rijeka in Yugoslavia to Constan»õa in Romania when she ran aground in the Black Sea off Costine»ôti about south of Constan»õa. She was declared a total loss, and there is a suggestion that the shipwreck could have been an insurance fraud. The ship remains a wreck at Costine»ôti. Her back is broken, two large areas of plates are missing from her starboard side, and the entire ship's superstructure has collapsed. Costine»ôti is a small seaside resort, for which the wreck is a local attraction.

The action was widely celebrated by both France and Great Britain and was the first between the two naval forces during the American Revolutionary War before a formal declaration of war was even announced.Syrett (1998), p.36 Background On 13 June 1778, Admiral Augustus Keppel, with twenty-one ships of the line and three frigates, was dispatched by the Admiralty to keep watch over the French fleet at Brest; Keppel was to prevent a junction of the Brest and Toulon fleets, more by persuasion if he could since both nations were not at war. The French 26-gun frigate, was on a reconnaissance along with the 26-gun frigate , the corvette , and the cutter Coureur, when on 17 June she encountered a large British squadron that included at a point south of The Lizard.Dupuy p. 210 Admiral Keppel, commanding the British fleet, ordered that the French ships be pursued and returned to his flagship by any means since he did not want the French ships to see the British strength. Action Licorne did so, after being overhauled by two British ships , mounting 28 guns, and , of 64 guns. Licorne subsequently tried to escape during the night after having meditated on affairs, but surrendered after a brief combat with America, a vessel double her size. Beginning of the action Meanwhile, Arethusa and the cutter caught up to Belle Poule, accompanied by the French cutter Le Courier. The captain of Belle Poule refused the order to sail back to the British fleet. The British fired a warning shot across his ship's bow, to which he responded with a full broadside.Syrett (1998), p.38 Thus a furious, two-hour battle between the two ships with Arethusa. Belle Poule was eager to escape and soon began to inflict serious damage upon Arethusa, which ended up with her topmasts hanging over the side and canvas torn. Soon after Arethusa lay shattered and then lost her main mast.Jean Cornuault, Un panorama de la marine de Louis XV √† Charles X (Paris, 2008), pp. 87-91. Soon the wind fell and with it the shot-torn loftier sails of Belle Poule. However, they held enough wind to drift her out of the reach of Arethusas fire. Both ships were close under the French cliffs and Belle Poule struggled into a tiny cove in the rocks. Nothing remained for Arethusa but to cut away her wreckage, hoist what sail she could, and drag herself back under jury-masts to the British fleet.John Adolphus, History of England from the Accession to the Decease of King George the Third, vol. 3 (London, 1841), p. 5 Meanwhile, Coureur was overtaken by the British cutter , and after some resistance finally cooperated with being taken to Keppel's flagship. Hirondelle escaped the engagement entirely. Aftermath Belle Poule coeffure Arethusa suffered 44 casualties from her 198-man crew, but the masts and rigging had been so severely damaged that the ship had to be towed by newly arrived British ships. As other ships from Keppel's fleet approached, Belle Poule withdrew toward the French coast having lost 30 killed and 72 wounded, among them her captain, Lieutenant Jean Isaac Chadeau de la Clocheterie. This battle was the first between British and French naval forces during the Anglo-French War and took place around three weeks before the formal declaration of war by France. Admiral Keppel himself was surprised by the reaction of the French captains as he only intended to speak with them, and then release their ships. The battle was widely celebrated in France as a victory; ladies of the high society invented the hairstyle \\"Belle Poule\\", with a ship on the top of the head. With the capture of Licorne and Hirondelle it was also viewed as a victory in Britain and became the subject of a traditional Sea shanty, The Saucy Arethusa. (Roud # 12675). Arethusa is also the subject of a song on the Decemberists' album Her Majesty the Decemberists.

Over the years, he has been closely associated with former Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Newt Gingrich. During the 2016 presidential campaign, he appeared on numerous television stations owned-and-operated by Fox Broadcasting Company as a commentator and analyst. Towery was the first nationally recognized pundit to predict Donald Trump could become a serious contender for the U.S. presidency \\\\-- a prediction he stuck with throughout the Republican primary contest and beyond. His polling company also was one of very few to call the 2016 presidential race for Trump over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. On Election Day, conservative talk show host Sean Hannity read a memo on the air in which Towery predicted Trump would beat the odds and win. Similarly, in the 2008 presidential general election, as pollster for Politico, Towery's polling correctly showed Democratic nominee Barack Obama winning critical swing states over his Republican opponent, John McCain. More recently, Towery attracted attention when, on January 27, 2020, he predicted the likelihood of a coronavirus pandemic, and on February 13, 2020, he advised readers he had liquidated his entire stock portfolio for that reason. The market began to crash just over a week later, on February 21, 2020. Early life Matt Towery was born on June 15, 1959, in Atlanta, Georgia, to businessman Maurice J. \\"Buddy\\" Towery and the former Joan Gillaland. His keen interest in politics was sparked at an early age. Towery's fourth grade class was assigned to write a letter to someone in the public eye. Towery sent his to the governor of Georgia, unaware he was corresponding with one of the most controversial political figures in the South during the turbulent Civil Rights era. \\"I didn't understand all the segregation stuff then. I didn't even know what the word meant. I just wrote to the governor.\\" Several days later, he received a telephone call at home. \\"In the fourth grade, you don't usually get phone calls from an adult -- and it was Lester Maddox!\\" Towery said in a 1990 interview. \\"I liked your letter,\\" Maddox told the boy. \\"Come down and visit me at the capitol.\\" Towery did just that -- and the governor named him an honorary lieutenant colonel. From that moment on, while other young people his age were enjoying newfound freedoms in the post-revolutionary 1960s, Towery busily schooled himself in the art of politics.  Education  Towery initially aspired to a career in journalism, but his father urged him to become a lawyer. Ultimately, he found a way to do both. He was an honors student at the University of Georgia before earning a master's degree in international relations at England's University of Cambridge. He went on to graduate Cum Laude at Stetson University College of Law in Florida, which inducted him into its Hall of Fame in 2016. Growing up, he attended Pace Academy, one of Atlanta's foremost college preparatory schools. In 1978, at age 19, he distinguished himself with a championship at the National Bicentennial Youth Debates, held in Williamsburg, Virginia. Career Towery served in the Georgia House of Representatives and was the Republican nominee for Lt. Governor of Georgia in 1990 at age 30. He served as a strategist in numerous national and statewide political campaigns including as Chairman of then-Speaker Newt Gingrich's political organization in the 1990s. In 1998 the Georgia General Assembly named the heavily traveled Paces Ferry Road bridge over I-285 (Atlanta beltway) in Cobb County, Georgia as the Matthew A. Towery Bridge. The measure was unusual because it honored a Republican (Towery) but was co-sponsored in bi-partisan fashion by both Democrats (powerful House Speaker Tom Murphy, Majority Leader Larry Walker, Chairman Jimmy Benefield) and Republicans (Minority Leader Robert Irvin, rep's Mark Burkhalter and Randy Sauder who sponsored the bill). Democrat Governor Zell Miller signed the measure into law on April 6, 1998. Towery has served as the CEO of numerous companies, including, when sold, the largest sheet fed commercial printing company in the Southeast. Towery has authored numerous books including Powerchicks: How Women Will Dominate America. He has appeared on many major news networks and on programs to include The O'Reilly Factor and Hardball with Chris Matthews and with hosts including Sean Hannity to Bill Maher. In 2011 he served as a weekly guest commentator for CNN. Since 1998, he has been a political analyst for the NBC, ABC, and currently the Fox affiliate in Atlanta. As CEO of InsiderAdvantage, he has served as a pollster to many national news organizations including Politico and Newsmax Media. InsiderAdvantage also publishes numerous politically oriented magazines including, in Georgia, James magazine and the Washington D.C.-based Southern Political Report, one of the nation's oldest continuously published political publications. His nationally syndicated column is based out of the Florida Times-Union in Jacksonville, Florida and is syndicated by Creators Syndicate out of Los Angeles. In a column dated Dec. 19, 2014, Towery was the first nationally recognized pundit to predict Donald Trump could become a serious contender for the U.S. presidency -- a position he reiterated in a follow-up column over a year later on Feb. 11, 2016. Towery is an A/V Preeminent rated attorney by Martindale Hubbell and his varied legal career in his early years included the successful defense of 17-year-old facing the death penalty in Georgia. In later years he has served as counsel on mergers and acquisitions, crisis management for major corporations, and governmental relations. He currently is Of Counsel with Hall, Booth, Smith in their Atlanta office. Towery's next book will focus on the role that polling, news events, and punditry play in the financial markets. Towery currently heads up his family owned LLLP which keeps him actively involved in both the financial and real estate markets. He participated in the 2012 Legislative Leadership Conference on October 2012. Towery serves with emeritus status on numerous boards including private and public universities. Personal life With his wife Dolle, Towery resides in Atlanta, Georgia and Snell Isle in St. Petersburg, Florida. He has two adult children.

It includes several references to the Argentine Rock of the 1990s. The show ended on May 13, 2015. Plot Diego Lamas and Miranda Betini were two rockers who met in Villa Gesell in 1992. Miranda was the daughter of Roby, a famous radio host, but concealed that information from Diego. They had a brief romance, and arranged to reunite in their native Buenos Aires, next to the Obelisco, the next month. Sandra, Miranda's best friend, started a romance with Roby, so she rejected them both. Diego had a car accident and could not meet Miranda at the agreed time, so she broke with him and with the whole rock and roll lifestyle. The ellipsis jumps to the modern day, Miranda is married to Segundo, and Diego is about to marry Susana. Roby dies, and Diego briefly sees Miranda at his funeral, which was broadcast on TV, and is reunited with her. Miranda and Sandra met Vera as well, another daughter of Roby, who was born out of wedlock. As widow and daughters of Roby, Sandra, Miranda and Vera share each a fourth part of the shares of the radio, alongside Roby's assistant, Pipo. Vera convinces the others to give a radio program to Diego and his friend Rama. Diego rejects Susana in their wedding and slowly starts a romance with Miranda. Both of their mothers (Titi and Gabriela, respectively) became friends and try to influence them to pursuit it. Segundo is a closeted gay, who develops a crush on his petisero Tony. Miranda and Segundo break up in good terms, and she also helps him to discover that his true mother is Mar√≠a Esther, a former maid of the Arostegui raped by Emilio. Sandra eventually amends her relation with Miranda, and gets pregnant from Rama. Rama, however, stays with Vera. With the exception of Miranda and Segundo, who had their own successful jobs, the Arostegui lost all their money and their mansion, and must move to a small apartment. The last episode featured the gay wedding of Segundo and Tony. Production The filming started in May 2014. =Cast= Viudas e hijos del Rock and Roll is the first work of Paola Barrientos as a lead actress in television. She had a long career in theater plays, and her character in Graduados got a lot of praise. Still, she clarified that both characters are different: her character in Graduados was formal, and her character in \\"Viudas...\\" is a rebel rocker. She accepted to work in the telenovela because she had a good relation with the other actors of the cast. Griselda Siciliani worked for Telefe for the first time. Although she worked several years at the competitor channel El Trece, her husband Adri√°n Suar produces telenovelas at that channel, and is scheduled to appear in cameos in Guapas, Siciliani clarified that they had no conflictive views over that. Her work is limited to 18 episodes, as she had worked a full year in Farsantes and prefers to stay more time with her daughter. =Music= The telenovela uses several references to the 1990s Argentine Rock, and uses the music both for character building and the plots. The telenovela is also set in a fictional radio. The first episodes featured as well other things from the 1990s, such as the \\"rolinga\\" urban tribe, the boom of radio stations airing rock, the popularity of Villa Gesell among the young people, and the creation of mixtapes in cassettes. The starting point of the telenovela is the death of Roby, a character played by Lalo Mir, which is described as an icon of Argentine rock. Reception The first episode was aired on August 18, with 24,3 rating points. It had the highest rating of the prime time on that day, over Showmatch. The public praised the similarities with the telenovela Graduados, aired in 2012, both in the initial plot and the focus on nostalgia. \\"Graduados 2\\" became a trending topic in Twitter that night. Later on, Viudas... did not achieve the expected ratings, and had a lower success than the re-run of the Turkish Binbir Gece (translated as \\"Las mil y una noches\\"). The new time slots and the 80 guest stars did not help it to recover the initial ratings. It ended after 10 months, without living up to expectations. =Awards= Viudas... received seven nominations for the 45th Mart√≠n Fierro Awards: best daily fiction, lead actor of daily fiction (Dami√°n de Santo and Juan Minujin), lead actress of daily fiction (Paola Barrientos), best new actor (Dario Barassi), best writers and best music theme. Sebasti√°n Ortega and Pablo Culell were surprised by the absence of Ver√≥nica Llin√°s and Luis Mach√≠n, and did not attend the ceremony.

From 1872, its headquarters were in Halle an der Saale.  History  The company was founded by Bethel Henry Strousberg. In the following years it built a network of railway lines in the former Prussian provinces of Brandenburg and Saxony. The first 38 km section from Guben to Cottbus was opened on 1 September 1871. It was extended by 79 km on 1 December 1871 to the west via Calau, Finsterwalde and Dobrilugk to Falkenberg/Elster. The following year saw the completion of additional main lines with a total length of 270 km. It was possible to run to the west from Falkenberg via Torgau to Eilenburg (46 km) from 1 May 1872 and a further 51 km via Delitzsch to Halle an der Saale from 30 June 1872. A new route was opened in an easterly direction from Cottbus to Forst (Lausitz) on 1 March 1872 and it was extended by 60 km over the Neisse to Sorau (now ≈ªary in present-day Poland) from 30 June 1872. A 24 km-long line was opened to connect with the trading centre of Leipzig on 1 November 1874 from Eilenburg via was Taucha in the Kingdom of Saxony. The HSGE network eventually comprised a network that was about 300 kilometres long. However, it was not possible to divert substantial traffic from the competing routes that had been built earlier, so its income fell short of expectations.

It is home to the patroness of Pagsanjan, Our Lady of Guadalupe, whose image was a gift from Mexico.  History  A former visita of Lumban, the parish church of Pagsanjan was founded on November 12, 1687, by Franciscan missionary Father Agustin de la Magdalena as its first pastor (parish priest). The first church was originally made of light materials like bamboo, nipa and wood in 1688 by natives of Pagsanjan under forced labor. A larger and more solid church constructed from adobe with a red-tiled roof was built in 1690 with the help of Chinese Miguel Guan Co and chief alguacil alferez Alonzo Garcia to replace the original church. Further renovations were conducted from 1847 to 1852 under Father Joaquin de Coria, who engineered the stone belfry and Romanesque dome. In 1872, the church added a transept under the direction of Father Serafin Linares and Father Cipriano Bac. The church was heavily damaged by American and Filipino military bombers on March 15, 1945 during World War II. A replica of the church was constructed over its ruins, without the original dome, with the help of Manila Pagsanjenos under the leadership of Engr. German Yia and Dr. Rosendo Llamas. Serious restoration efforts after the war took place in 1965 under Lipa Archbishop Alejandro Olalia. On April 6, 1969, Bishop Pedro Bantigue blessed the rebuilt church and consecrated the main altar. Due to the devotion of the people of Pagsanjan and nearby towns, the Diocese of San Pablo declared Pagsanjan Church as the Diocesan Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe in 2012. Under the term of Monsignor Castillo from 2013 to the present, further renovations were carried out, including the church patio and construction of the choir loft and church gate.  Features  The facade of Pagsanjan church is a three-level early Renaissance styled facade with a semicircular arched main entrance, choir loft window and a three-story bell tower. A side chapel near the altar houses an image of San Juan Diego, a replica of the tilma of the Our Lady of Guadalupe and a stone relic from Tepeyac Hill, Mexico City in 1531, the site of the apparition of the Virgin of Guadalupe. The chapel is also a mini-museum containing liturgical vestments of Pagsanje√±o priests.  Images of Our Lady of Guadalupe  Within the church of Pagsanjan, two images of the town patroness, Our Lady of Guadalupe, can be found. The original image of Our Lady of Guadalupe was donated by Father Agustin when the parish was first established. The image was given to him as a gift from rich and pious Mexican families; it was installed at the main altar on December 12, 1688. However, the original image was destroyed during the American and Filipino military bombings of 1945. In 1958, Mexican Catholics contributed a life-sized image of Our Lady of Guadalupe sculpted by Ramon Barretto of Toluca, which can be seen in the church today. The image of Our Lady of Guadalupe placed on the main altar was sculpted by Maximo Vicente of Manila.

Ho also cofounded the Hang Chong Investment Co Ltd. and Dah Chong Hong Ltd., and was the first chairman of New World Development Company. Ho was a renowned philanthropist. In 1970 he founded the S.H. Ho Foundation to support charitable causes. Many buildings and institutions in Hong Kong and China bear his name, including the S.H. Ho College of the Chinese University of Hong Kong and the Ho Sin Hang Campus of Hong Kong Baptist University. Owing to childhood poverty, Ho received little formal education, and education became the main focus of his charitable endeavours. He was one of the four founders of the Ho Leung Ho Lee Foundation. Early life Ho Sin Hang was born in 1900 in Panyu, Guangdong, southern China. Due to poverty he only received a few years of education and began working at the age of 14. He worked in a salt warehouse for two years before taking up a position as an apprentice in a goldsmith's shop. Career Ho completed his apprenticeship and was promoted to assistant manager at age 22. Two years later he resigned from his position to set up a trading business in Guangzhou. In 1933, Ho co-founded Hang Seng Ngan Ho with three partners, Lam Bing Yim (ÊûóÁÇ≥ÁÇé), Sheng Tsun Lin (ÁõõÊò•Èúñ) and Leung Chik Wai (Ê¢ÅÊ§çÂÅâ). Hang Seng began as a small currency changing booth on Wing Lok Street in Sheung Wan. Lam, the main shareholder, managed the firm's business in Shanghai and Ho managed its Guangzhou branch. After the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Shanghai and Guangzhou were occupied by the Japanese, but Hang Seng initially made substantial profits by facilitating the foreign exchange needs of the Republic of China. In December 1941, Hong Kong also fell to the Japanese and Hang Seng was forced to close. Ho moved to Macau, which, as a Portuguese colony, remained neutral throughout the war, and continued the business as Wing Wah Ngan Ho.

His first wife Anna ( ‚Äì 25 February 1905) was a German-born educator; his second wife Caroline (c. 1861 ‚Äì 7 January 1941) was a philanthropist and abortionist. History Adolphe Marval was born in France and may have taught at Ecclesall College, Sheffield before he came to South Australia in 1864 to teach at St. Peter's College. He also conducted private classes and taught at other private schools, notably J. L. Young's Adelaide Educational Institution. He was hon. secretary of the French Relief Fund committee in 1871. In May 1884 he signed the Oath of Allegiance to become a naturalised British subject. He was appointed Justice of the Peace, resigned 1887. He married Anna Thilo, daughter of Professor Wilhelm Thilo of Berlin, on 25 June 1872. She had been awarded a diploma (Gepr≈©fte Lehrerin f≈©r Preu√üen) from the Ladies' University of Berlin, and came to South Australia as a governess for the children of Sir James Fergusson. Following a return to Europe in 1873, the Marvals returned to Adelaide, where he worked as tutor and she as head of a school for young ladies, operating from Ramsay House, once the home of Dr. Gosse on the Rundle Place (now Gawler Place) corner of North Terrace. She took boarders and day pupils, and taught singing, dancing and deportment, as well as French. Anna Montgomerie Martin was one of her teachers. In December 1874 they took over the staff and students of Miss Senner's school, Palm House, Hackney. By 1878 he was a ratepayer of Brighton and in 1882 Mme. Marval's academy was operating at their home \\"De la Haye\\" on Brighton Road. In that year he became a member of Brighton Council. He was appointed chairman of the Brighton Board of Health and elected mayor of Brighton in 1884. He was a director of the Brighton Tramway Company (or Glenelg, Brighton and Marino Tramway Company). In 1880 Mme. Marval began teaching music, gratis, to blind students. By 1887 her school had moved to her home \\"De la Haye\\", 65 The Parade, Norwood. Mme. Marval later taught at the Deaf Dumb and Blind Institution. She died of diabetes at home on 25 February 1905. He was an art connoisseur and turned commission agent and fine art dealer with a private gallery at 121 Pirie Street, and owned a valuable collection of engravings by Pietro Tosto, paintings by Murillo and Vandyke, and an etching by Hogarth. He was deputised by the Art Gallery of South Australia to purchase works from the estate of Melbourne collector Mme. De Hazard in 1887. He returned to Paris for the Exhibition of 1889 to procure works for his gallery, and again in 1900. A. E. Marval married again. His second wife, Caroline Emma Mutton Marval, n√©e McPhillamy (c. 1861 ‚Äì 7 January 1941), a palmist, was a generous contributor to the Belgian Relief Fund, and manufactured confectionery for Australian soldiers during World War I, a work which was initially deprecated by many, and which she continued to make after the war in aid of various charities. Mme. Marval was a nurse, often treating patients at her home, \\"Cumberland House\\", 4 George Street, Norwood. She had been involved in the 1914 death from septicaemia of Ellen Phyland, but no charges were laid due to lack of evidence. Mme. Marval was convicted of manslaughter by Mr. Justice Cleland following the 1941 death of Edith Millburn, aged 20, from blood loss following \\"an illegal operation\\". At sentencing Mr Justice Cleland stated that he did not believe Mme Marval was guilty, that she had in fact tried to save Edith Milburn after she had been operated on by another person, however Mme Marval refused to name the other person and Mr Justice Cleland was therefore left with no choice but to find her guilty. Mme Marval refused food and drink and died at the Royal Adelaide Hospital. Family Their daughter Adele Thilo Marval (3 October 1874 ‚Äì ) was a talented violinist. Their second son Sydney Waldegrave Carver Marval (born c. 1889) was killed in action 1919.

He is commonly seen as a political geographer. Work He was initially prominent in the revival of geographic studies of voting. Drawing on the methods of the spatial-quantitative research, he demonstrated the significance of where people live and their connections over space for how they vote. This in turn led to an interest in a newly emerging field of behavioral geography. Most of his later work has been focused on urban studies, inspired by various forms of political economy, particularly from welfare geography. One of his contributions was work on resident organizations, establishing their raison d'√™tre and situating them historically. This was followed by an increasing emphasis on the implications of Marxism for studying the politics of urbanization. He has been interested in the role of growth coalitions in the politics of local development and how the American politics contrasts with that of the countries of Western Europe. He has also worked on the history of geographic thought and the political geography of South Africa.

The theatre was opened in 1983 by the Welsh comedian Sir Harry Secombe, who lived in Sutton for over 30 years, and was named after him. The theatre went into administration and closed in August 2016. A petition to save Sutton's theatres was run in late 2016, gaining 1,350 signatures. Theatre building The front fa√ßade with former signage Part of the foyer of the theatre in January 2015 The theatre was created in 1983 out of a red-brick former Christian Science church on a large plot on Cheam Road at its junction with Gibson Road. The plot once formed part of an estate, and the original church building dates from 1937. The Theatre Trust describes the current building as commanding \\"a presence in the landscape\\". The auditorium can accommodate 396 patrons, or 343 when the orchestra pit is being used, and it is tiered facing the end-on stage. The stage is a flat floor proscenium arch, and there is adequate wing space. Backstage there are four dressing rooms (with capacities ranging from ten to twenty cast members each). Under the previous managements, there was a multi-purpose room at the back of the theatre. Since taking over the theatres in June 2015, the new Sutton Theatres Trust has created a new 120-seat venue (180 standing capacity) in the room complete with its own sound and lighting rig as well as a self-contained bar.

(The Charles Cryer Theatre is in a former hall in Carshalton, which was converted to theatre in 1991.) Financial difficulties in 2002 had put the theatre in jeopardy, but its future was believed secure the following year when it was taken over by the London Borough of Sutton and run directly by the council. 2014 to 2015 closure risk, rescue and renaissance In 2014, because of local council budget cuts, the venue was, along with its sister theatre, the Charles Cryer Theatre in Carshalton, identified by the Theatre Trust as one of 33 theatres in the country for inclusion on its \\"At Risk\\" register. The risk of closure spurred celebrity intervention in favour of the two theatres: writer, actor, comedian and BBC presenter Tim Vine, called on Sutton Council to reconsider its proposals. On 10 November 2014 the local council announced that four organisations submitting outline bids to take over the two theatres had been invited to submit full business cases by 12 December. The council worked with the Theatres Trust and Sutton Centre for Voluntary Services to help bidders through the bidding process. On 15 January 2015 the bid by the new \\"Sutton Theatres Trust\\" (STT) was given approval by the council's environment and neighbourhood committee to take over the theatres, thus saving them from closure. Speaking about the future running of the theatres, a spokesperson for STT said: In June 2015 the theatres were official handed over to the STT. Cllr Jill Whitehead said:Sutton Guardian August 2016 closure In August 2016, the Sutton Theatre Trust went into administration and the theatre (along with its sister theatre in the borough) closed.

History Onohama Shipyards was established by Edward Charles Kirby, a British expatriate merchant during late Bakumatsu period and early Meiji period Japan. Kirby came to Japan in 1865, as soon as the country ended its national isolation policy and was opened to foreign trade, and established a chandlery, Kirby & Co in the foreign settlement at Yokohama. He later opened a branch in Kobe. In 1869, together with two British partners, Robert Huggin and John Taylor, he established the Kobe Iron Works on the Ikuta River about a mile from the foreign settlement, which had an iron foundry, blacksmiths, and a deepwater dock. In 1878, Kirby bought out his partners and established the Onohama Shipyards, bringing his brother Alfred from Karachi as engineering director. The company engaged in repair work, marine salvage, and built small vessels. In 1882, the company launched Japan‚Äôs first commercial iron-ribbed steamship, the , which operated on Lake Biwa. The success of this venture led to a contract from the Imperial Japanese Navy to construct the second of the s, the . However, due to problems with financing, and delays in completion of Yamato caused when suppliers in the UK went on strike, Kirby faced foreclosure on a 50,000 Mexican dollar loan from the Hong Kong & Shanghai Bank, and committed suicide in 1883. After Kirby‚Äôs death, the company survived under Japanese government receivership, coming under the control of the Kure Naval Arsenal in 1890. Louis-√âmile Bertin, the French naval engineer and senior foreign advisor to the Meiji government and director of the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal recommended that the shipyard concentrate on the production of torpedo boats.

In the 1940s, his generic subject matter was overlooked by the social realists, even though his images of common people and public places was reminiscent of the Ashcan School. In the 1950s, the completely non- representational forms of abstract expressionism had no place for Benjamin‚Äôs figural aspects, however abstract they may have been.

Other sources date his birth to May 13, 1823.Scharf, John Thomas. History of Baltimore City and County, from the Earliest Period to the Present Day: Including Biographical Sketches of their Representative Men. Philadelphia: Louis H. Everts, 1881. Raine's ancestors were from England and Westphalia. Frederick Raine, Consul-General at Berlin Raine started his newspaper career as an apprentice. At 14 Raine began working with his uncle Frederick Wundermann in his Munster print shop. Raine also worked as an assistant editor for his uncle's newspaper Westf√§lische Zeitung (Westphalian Newspaper). In the autumn of 1840, Raine joined his father and brother Wilhelm in Baltimore, Maryland, where they had moved four years earlier. Raine's father was a publisher and owned a print shop in Baltimore. When Raine arrived he first started working for his father's Whig campaign paper Der Demokratische Whig (Democratic Whig). In 1841, at nineteen, Raine founded the German-language newspaper Der Deutsche Correspondent in Baltimore.Miller, Edmund E. The Hundred Year History of the German Correspondent, Baltimore, Maryland. [Baltimore, Md.]: [Baltimore Correspondent], 1941. Raine depended on his father's print shop and brother's assistance during the first years of the paper's existence. Historians refer to Raine as a Democrat. Though Raine supported states' rights preceding the Civil War, he supported the preservation of the Union over secession and the continuation of slavery. Raine increasingly became involved in civic and governmental affairs. As Governor Oden Bowie awarded Raine the ceremonial title of colonel, by which Raine was often referred to for the remainder of his life. In 1885 President Grover Cleveland appointed Col. Raine consul-general in Berlin. Raine return to Baltimore from Berlin in 1889 and remained a prominent German-American figure in the region, appearing at public events in Baltimore and Philadelphia. Raine suffered from a mild stroke on February 24, 1893 and died two days later on February 26. On November 6, 1897, the Frederick Raine Medal was established.

They were built parallel to the level curves forming steps in the talwegs. On the northern slopes of the Djebel Tachrirt the walls were constructed above the ground level, allowing the snow to accumulate and to melt slowly in order to distribute the available water resulting from the snow melting period. Most of these traditional water management works are now in ruins.Le syst√®me des ¬´ jessour ¬ª, p. 4Jean Baradez, Fossatum Aft√Øc≈ì.

It is located on the southern slopes of the range and includes a 7 km-long line of walls. Inside the walls are four residential complexes, and the largest mosque built in Algeria after that of Mansourah, similar to the Grand Mosque of Kairouan, with a tall minaret (20 m). The remains of the emir's palace, known as Dal al-Bahr, include three separate residences separated by gardens and pavilions. Excavations of the area have brought to light numerous terracotta items, jewels, coins and ceramics, including a number of decorative fountains using the lion as a motif. In 1980 the Beni Hammad Fort was inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.Al Qal'a of Beni Hammad UNESCO Site In 945, as Abu Yazid besieged Sousse, Caliph al-Qa'im Bi-Amrillah died and was succeeded by his son al-Mansur. Under al-Mansur's leadership, the Fatimid forces recovered their position, first breaking the siege of Sousse and then driving Ab≈´ Yazƒ´d's forces out of Kairouan back into the Aur√®s Mountains. In 947, the Fatimids finally defeated them in the Kiyana Mountains of this massif near what later became the Beni Hammad Fort.

Built in the 18th century as a pair of cottages before becoming a public house, the Square and Compass got its name in 1830 from a landlord who had been a stonemason. The building includes a museum of fossils and other local artefacts and the pub is one of only nine nationally that has been included in every edition of CAMRA's Good Beer Guide. In 2015, the landlord built a sculpture of tree trunks, dubbed Woodhenge. He was told to take it down by the local council, but after an online petition he was allowed to keep it standing for two years. History The Square and Compass pub sign The public house was originally built in the 18th century as a pair of cottages. In 1776 it became 'The Sloop', an alehouse with connections to smuggling. In approximately 1830 the landlord, Charles Bower, changed the name to the Square and Compass, as he had been a stonemason. It was bought by Charlie Newman in 1907, great-grandfather of the current proprietor of the same name. At the time it included oil lamps, no running water or flushing toilets and no bar counter. The lights are now powered by electricity and there is running water, but there is still no bar counter - drinks are served through two serving hatches. The pub is named after Square and Compasses, the tools used by carpenters and stonemasons. It is known as Sqump to its regulars, the Square and Compass was popular amongst the Telecommunications Research Establishment scientists in Purbeck, who knew the inn as Sine and Cosine. The public house includes a small museum which displays fossils and local artefacts. The artefacts were collected by the current landlord and his father, with the majority of fossils collected locally. In 2014, the Square and Compass won the Good Pub Guide's award for Unspoilt Pub of the Year. It is one of just nine pubs, known as the 'Perfect Nine', to have featured in all 37 editions of CAMRA's Good Beer Guide. Building Two story wing shown on the left of image The Square and Compass was built in the 18th century of rubble stone walls, stone chimney stacks and a stone stale roof. It is a single story building with an attic, which has been converted to include dormer windows. The nearby outbuildings which are of a similar construction have been converted to include garage doors. The building is built on a T-shape plan; there is a two-story wing to the left of the building which extends to the front and rear, which has plastered walls. The structure became a Grade II listed building on 13 December 1984. Inside the pub are two simple rooms with flagstones, a woodburner and basic furniture. There is no bar, instead drinks are served through two serving hatches. In the garden outside the benches and tables are made of stone. It is on the Campaign for Real Ale's National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors. Woodhenge Woodhenge, sculpture by landlord, Charlie Newman The landlord of the Square and Compass, Charlie Newman, built a tree trunk sculpture known as Woodhenge, in the field near the public house. The trunks were originally planned to be used for firewood, before Newman built the structure, which was complete in time for the summer solstice in 2015. Built from two trees, one high, Newman described the Woodhenge as \\"a bit of fun\\". The structure is wide and high, weighing about . Newman was initially instructed to dismantle the sculpture by Purbeck District Council after a complaint from the public, as the field is within the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and did not meet planning regulations. After an online petition, the council decided that the structure could remain for two years.

Cozzarelli was born in Siena, and was a student and collaborator of Matteo di Giovanni, with whom it is sometimes possible to confuse him due to their similar styles, and has led to some difficulty in painting attributions. Compared to Matteo, Cozzarelli's style is less fine, but more adept in chiaroscuro and color scheme. Cozzarelli primarily painted religious-themed works for church commissions, and became more popular as a miniaturist and painter, which includes the parchment preserved in the state in Siena, and the thumbnails stored in Siena Cathedral (1480s). This is considered his most fertile period in which Cozzarelli produced the Baptism of Christ and the Madonna and Saints (1486) in the church of San Bernardino in Sinalunga. He also painted Madonna Enthroned with St Jerome and the Blessed Colombini (1482). In the following years he worked for the Duomo di Pitigliano, the parish church of Ancaiano (1491) and the church of San Michele Arcangelo in Paganico, including Madonna and Child Enthroned with Saints. In the Pinacoteca Nazionale (Siena) are exhibited various works of the painter, including San Antonio, and Santa Caterina surrounded by Doctors and Pharmacists.

He was one of the Pennsylvania impressionists, but is better known for his paintings of the mills and working people of the Delaware River region than for landscapes. His work is held in numerous public collections. Early years Robert Carpenter Spencer was born on 1 December 1879 in Harvard, Nebraska, son of Solomon Hogue Spencer, a Swedenborgian clergyman and a distant descendant of the English noble Spencer family. His mother was Frances Strickler Spencer, daughter of a buggy manufacturer. His father left the church to teach for a few years while his two children were infants. He returned to the ministry in 1884. He co- founded, published and edited The New Christianity, a Swedenborgian journal. The family moved often. They lived in Illinois, Missouri, Pennsylvania, New York, Virginia and then Yonkers, New York, where Robert Spencer graduated from high school in 1899. Spencer had planned to study medicine, but instead in 1899 began to study art at the National Academy of Design in New York City. He met and befriended the painter Charles Rosen while at the academy. From 1903 to 1905 he studied under William Merritt Chase at his New York School of Art, and probably studied under Robert Henri. He spent about a year working for a civil engineering company as a draftsman and surveyor. His father died in 1906. Career thumb In 1906 Spencer moved to the Bucks County area, where Charles Rosen had settled three years earlier. For the next few years he lived in various small towns on the Delaware River. These included Frenchtown, New Jersey and Point Pleasant, Pennsylvania. During this period he studied with Daniel Garber, who strongly influenced his style. For a few years Spencer and an artist friend Charles Frederic Ramsey lived in poverty in an extremely dilapidated old house called the Huffnagle Mansion. They paid a nominal rent of $2 per month. The house had peeling plaster and little in the way of heating. The lavatory was an outhouse. Spencer was very productive during this period, and won awards at the National Academy of Art and Design and the Art Club of Philadelphia. Spencer studied with the established landscape painter William Lathrop. In 1913 he met Margaret Alexina Harrison Fulton (born 1882), a fellow student of Lathrop who was an architect as well as a painter. Margaret was from a wealthy Philadelphia family. She was the niece of the painters Alexander and Birge Harrison. They married in 1914. They moved first into an apartment and then into a new house. Spencer became an Associate of the National Academy of Design in 1914. In 1916 Spencer, Rae Sloan Bredin, Charles Rosen, Morgan Colt, Daniel Garber and William Langson Lathrop formed The New Hope Group to arrange for exhibitions of their work. In the 1920s Spencer began painting landscapes of the Delaware River valley. He experienced a series of nervous breakdowns in the years that followed. His marriage became unhappy. In the summer of 1925 he visited Spain, France and Italy. He returned to Europe on 1927 and spent several months in Paris. He started painting imaginary scenes with European settings. On July 11, 1931, Spencer committed suicide with a handgun in his studio. He left two daughters. Work thumb Spencer is known for his paintings of figures against a backdrop of factories and apartment houses, in an impressionist style with short, tight brushstrokes. The paintings he made in 1909‚Äì10 of the Pennsylvania mills and the women mill workers are considered his best. He said, \\"A landscape without a building or a figure is a very lonely picture to me.\\" Well known works include The Silk Mill (1912), Grey Mills (1913), The Closing Hour (1913) and Repairing the Bridge (1913). The Metropolitan Museum of Art bought Repairing the Bridge in 1914. His painting On the Canal, New Hope was acquired in 1916 by the Detroit Museum of Art. It depicts the back of run-down houses on the canal, with the lower portions whitewashed and bathed in light, with women doing housework. A contemporary critic wrote, \\"Interpreted thro' the temperament of Robert Spencer a squalid motive which most of us would pass daily and regard as hopelessly commonplace is presented in a way to stir our emotions and without losing anything of its truth...\\" Pierre Bonnard said in 1926 \\"Mr. Spencer . . . is in the full vigor of his talent, which is great. His art does not resemble European art, a rare fact in America.\\" According to the art collector Duncan Phillips he was\\"a rebel always against the standardized and stereotyped in art... [there was] no other painter, not John Sloan, or Edward Hopper, more pungently American in expression.\\" Spencer exhibited widely in the United States and abroad. Institutions that hold his work include the Art Institute of Chicago, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the James A. Michener Art Museum, the Brooklyn Museum, the Smithsonian Institution, the Berkshire Museum, the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the National Academy of Design, The Reading Public Museum, the Detroit Institute of Fine Arts, the National Arts Club, the Delaware Art Museum, the Widener University Art Museum and The Phillips Collection in Washington D.C.

From 1963 to 1973, he took an extraordinary professorship at the University of Leuven. From 1957 to 1960 and from 1963 to 1965, he was an assistant professor at Lille Catholic University, where he taught courses in structural economics and history of economic thought. de Groote holds an MA in economics from Cambridge University and a law, economics and political science degree from his alma mater at the University of Leuven.http://cadtm.org/The-Life-and-Times-of-Jacques-de = Financier career = Jacques de Groote began his career as a financier in January 1957. In the first few months of 1960, he, as secretary, contributed to preparations for the de-colonisation of the Belgian Congo. From April 1960 to May 1963, he was an assistant to the Belgian representative at the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Washington. In May 1963, he joined the National Bank in Belgium, where he was active in international affairs. In July 1965, he was offered the position of financial advisor to the Belgian delegation at the OECD in Paris, where he headed a number of working groups involved in reviewing the first draft of multilateral agreements guaranteeing private investments. Between March 1966 and May 1969, he was economic advisor to the government of the president of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where he was also a financial advisor to the country‚Äôs National Bank.http://cadtm.org/The-Life-and-Times-of-Jacques-de In 1973, de Groote became Executive Director of the IMF and World Bank. During this time, he actively supported certain African representations, working to have the IMF and the World Bank enter into closer economic cooperation with them. In addition to his work in the Congo, de Groote held the position of Director at the Research Department of the Belgian National Bank from April 1971 to November 1973. Within the IMF, where has was active until 1994, de Groote represented a group of countries that included Czechoslovakia, or, as the case may be, the Czech Republic.

He admitted as much in a testimony he submitted on 12 June 2013 during the MUS trial before the Swiss Federal Criminal Court at Bellinzona. It was a crucial piece of evidence leading to the conviction and prison sentences for the five Czech managers while de Groote himself narrowly escaped prison. He was however found guilty of fraud, no doubt a first for a former Executive Director of the IMF. de Groote left Appian Group in 2002.http://cadtm.org/Une-figure-emblematique- du-FMI-et#nb5-1 de Groote has received many awards and honours.

It projects northwesterly about into the South China Sea. It was named after its location within barangay Poro and is the site of Poro Point Freeport Zone, a special economic zone established since 1993. Geography The lighthouse at Poro Point Poro Point forms the western boundary of San Fernando Bay where the city's downtown core and international seaport are located. To the south, it overlooks Lingayen Gulf which spreads all the way into the northern coast of Pangasinan up to Santiago Island in Bolinao. The headland is about wide rising gently to the northwest to an elevation of . White cliffs are prominent features along its western coastline. The southern side of the peninsula contains the 65.5-hectare Greek- inspired Thunderbird Resort with white-sand beaches, a nine-hole golf course and an artificial lake completed in 2008. The entire peninsula covers an area of composed of coralline limestone possibly dating back to the Pleistocene age. It is a habitat of several migrating bird species such as kingfisher, grey heron, starling and pied triller. The point is located about from the San Fernando Airport and some north-northwest of Manila. It is part of barangay Poro but administered by the Bases Conversion and Development Authority as a tourism and industrial estate. History Poro Point has been the site of a navigational aid since 1885. The first Poro Point Lighthouse built during the Spanish colonial period is a cylindrical steel tower that was prefabricated in France and was completed on 28 November 1885. It measures approximately in height and was one of the seventeen luces locales (local lights) built by the Spanish in the Philippines. On 28 July 1903, after the U.S. gained control of the Philippines from Spain, 200 meters of land surrounding the lighthouse was converted into a US reservation through Executive Order No. 06 signed by Civil Governor William H. Taft. By November 1903 through an executive order by U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, the site became Camp Wallace and eventually, the Wallace Air Station. In 1979, a concrete tower was built to replace the Spanish lighthouse. This structure that now towers over the area is tall. With the transfer of the U.S. facility to the Philippine government in September 1991, it became the headquarters of the Naval Forces Northern Luzon (NAVFORNOL) of the Philippine Navy called Poro Point Naval Station. It was later renamed to Naval Station Ernesto Ogbinar after the former Navy chief. The former Wallace Air Station has also been converted into a freeport and investment zone.

He did not, however, achieve the political success of his father and failed to hold the Consulship, reaching only the position of Praetor in 104 BC. During his Praetorship he first successfully put down a minor slave revolt in Campania (the Vettian Revolt) before being sent to take command in Sicily during the Second Servile War.Diodorus Siculus, Library of History, Book 36 He was later relieved of his command and prosecuted for embezzlement upon his recall to Rome. Being convicted, he was banished from the city and lived the remainder of his life in exile. He is the father of the more famous Lucius Licinius Lucullus, who defeated Mithridates and Tigranes in the Third Mithridatic War. Family The Licinii Luculli were a branch of the ancient and aristocratic Plebeian gens Licinia. The first recorded Lucullus is an L. Licinius Lucullus who held the junior magistracy of Curule Aedile in 202 BC,Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita, Book 30 and his descendants were to play a relatively obscure part in history until Lucullus' father became the first member of the family to be elected to the Consulship in 151 BC, thereby officially ennobling his family. While Consul the elder Lucullus was sent to continue the war against the Celtiberians in Hispania,Appian, Roman History, Book 6 however, his predecessor made peace and ended the war before his arrival, thereby depriving him of the opportunity for obtaining booty, through which he had hoped to make his family fortune. He therefore proceeded to make war on the neighbouring Vaccaei tribe, without any pretext or authorisation from the Senate, and with the sole aim of plundering their towns and lands for his own enrichment. Upon his return to Rome the elder Lucullus had succeeded in making himself and his family wealthy, and therefore influential, and was never prosecuted for his illegal conduct. His son, also Lucius Licinius Lucullus, was born around 144 BCArthur Keaveny, Lucullus: A Life, 1992 and, sometime around 119 BC, married Caecilia Metella, the daughter of Lucius Caecilius Metellus Calvus. She was also the sister of Metellus Numidicus (Consul 109 BC) and Metellus Dalmaticus (Consul 119 BC), two of the leading optimates of their day.Plutarch, Life of Lucullus This political marriage brought the Luculli the support and influence of the powerful Caecilii Metelli family which would help their own rise to prominence. From this marriage Lucullus had two sons, Lucius and Marcus, born around 118/117 BC and 116 BC. However, despite being politically beneficial the match was an unhappy one, with Metella engaging in numerous scandalous affairs which led to an eventual divorce. Plutarch refers to her as having \\"the bad name of a dissolute woman\\".Plutarch, Lucullus, 1 The Vettian Slave Revolt Lucullus was elected as one of the Praetors for 104 BC, probably Praetor Peregrinus, the magistrate responsible for hearing appeals and judicial cases outside the city of Rome in Italy. During his Praetorship a young Roman knight (Eques), Titus Minucius Vettius, led a slave revolt around the city of Capua in Campania. Vettius had fallen in love with a beautiful young slave girl and, promising to pay her owner the huge sum of seven Attic talents, had he been permitted to take her. However, when the time within which it had been agreed that payment would be made expired, Vettius was unable to fulfil his promise. A further extension of his credit was agreed but, when this again ran out, Vettius panicked. Kidnapping and murdering all his creditors, as well as the girl's owner, he then armed his slaves and declared himself the 'King of Campania,' proclaiming that all slaves who deserted their masters to join him would be free. Soon an army of seven-hundred escaped slaves were terrorising the Campanian countryside, killing all those who refused to join them.Diodorus Siculus, Library of History, Book 36, ch.2 When news reached Rome of the revolt, the Senate appointed Lucullus, then Praetor, 'to apprehend the fugitives.' Diodorus records that upon his arrival at Capua, Lucullus had four thousand infantry and four hundred cavalry under his command and that Vettius had a force of about three thousand five hundred. Upon learning of Lucullus' approach, Vettius and his men had taken up positions on a nearby hill which they had hastily fortified, and waited. Lucullus' first assault against the rebels was repulsed, given their advantage of the higher ground. So Lucullus tried a different strategy. Making contact with Apollonius, Vettius' general, Lucullus promised him that he would receive no punishment for his part in the rebellion if he were to now to co-operate with Rome and turn all he could against Vettius. Apollonius, fearing for his life, accepted the offer and, with the rebels now fighting amongst themselves, Lucullus was able to easily defeat them and put an end to the revolt. Vettius himself, seeing that all was lost, committed suicide before he was captured. All the rebels who were taken prisoner were executed, save Apollonius who, true to his word, Lucullus pardoned and set free. The Second Sicilian Slave Revolt In 104 BC, while Lucullus was suppressing the revolt of Vettius, a second more serious slave rebellion had broke out on Sicily. =Outbreak of the Revolt= In that year the Consul Gaius Marius had decreed that any Italian citizen being held in slavery was to be released immediately and that henceforth it was to be illegal for an Italian to be a slave. This was in response to the Italian Allies refusing to supply levies to fight the invading Germanic Cimbri unless such a decree was issued and the practice of selling Italian citizens into slavery for non-payment of debts outlawed.Encyclop√¶dia BritannicaDiodorus Siculus, Library of History, Book 36, Ch.3 As a consequence of this, the Governor of Sicily, Publius Licinius Nerva, set up a tribunal and began the process of interviewing slaves claiming to be Italians and determining whether in fact they were telling the truth or not. By presenting themselves at the tribunal in this way, in a few days, eight hundred Italians had obtained their freedom. However, the wealthy Sicilian landowners, most of whom depended on a large slave workforce to farm their extensive estates, soon became agitated and demanded that the Governor desist from his work immediately. Giving into pressure, Nerva closed the tribunals. Slaves waiting to present themselves were outraged at being denied their freedom and soon slaves began to rise up against their masters, landowners were murdered in their villas and the escaped slaves began to gather, rapidly growing in numbers until rebel slave armies were roaming the Sicilian countryside looting and pillaging as they went. Nerva, after defeating one band of rebels, found others springing up wherever he turned and, with only a small militia at his disposal, quickly lost control of the situation. An Italian slave named Salvius then emerged, calling himself \\"King of Sicily\\" and the rebels began to unite behind him. In Rome, the crisis meant that the city could no longer depend on the essential Sicilian grain supply, and so swift action was needed. Having just successfully put down one slave rebellion, the Senate turned again to Lucullus to take over from his hapless relative, Nerva. At the head of a new Roman and Allied army numbering around seventeen thousand according to Diodorus, Lucullus landed in Sicily in 103 BC.Diodorus Siculus, Library of History, Book 36, Ch.8 =The Battle of Scirthaea= Salvius, now calling himself Tryphon, planned to respond to Lucullus' arrival by withdrawing into his fortress of Triocala and there hold out against the Roman siege. However, his general Athenion prevailed upon him not to hide behind the walls of Triocala and instead face the Romans in open battle. Marching to meet Lucullus, the rebels encamped at Scirthaea, twelve miles distant from the Roman camp and, the next day, the two sides prepared for battle. According to Diodorus, Tryphon's host numbered around 40,000 against Lucullus' 14,000. After much skirmishing, the main battle began as the two armies closed the gap separating them from their enemies and came together. At first it seemed as if the rebels would drive the Romans back, with Athenion and his cavalry inflicting heavy losses upon Lucullus. However, just as it seemed that the slaves might be victorious, Athenion was wounded and cut down from his horse. He was forced to feign death in order to save himself. The rebels, believing their brave general to be dead, lost heart and fled. Tryphon, seeing his army vanishing before him, turned and joined them in flight back to his refuge in Triocala. Later that night, under cover of darkness, the wounded Athenion also escaped. With thousands of slaves cut down in the rout, Diodorus estimates that, as night fell, around 20,000 rebels lay dead, half of Tryphon's army destroyed and Lucullus victorious. =The Siege of Triocala= From his defeat at Scirthaea, Tryphon, along with the remnants of his army, shut himself behind the gates of Triocala and prepared to resist the inevitable siege. Lucullus, however, was slow to follow up his victory at Scirthaea and it was not until nine days after the battle that he finally arrived outside the walls of the rebel stronghold and placed it under siege. Several times Lucullus attempted to take the city by assault, however all his assaults were repulsed with heavy losses for the Romans. This emboldened the defenders, so Lucullus settled for a long siege to starve the enemy out. By the end of 103 BC Lucullus remained outside the walls of Triocala, frustratingly unable to take the city and end the rebellion. In Rome, seeing his failure to take Triocala as evidence of some indolence or incompetence, the Senate did not prorogue his command in Sicily and instead appointed Gaius Servilius to take his place when his term expired in 102 BC. Enraged at what he saw as a betrayal by the Senate, Lucullus, when he heard that his replacement had crossed the straits and landed in Sicily, ordered his army to burn their camp and destroy all their supplies and siege equipment before withdrawing from Triocala and disbanding completely.Diodorus Siculus, Library of History, Book 36, Ch.9 By ordering his army to disband, he intended, by ensuring the failure of his successor, he would prove his own innocence from any alleged incompetence. His successor, Servilius, with no army or fortifications, did indeed fail in his attempt to defeat the rebels and was unable to effectively contain the revolt for his entire year. Servilius was also defeated by Athenion, who had first murdered then succeeded his former master. Servilius was replaced in 101 BC by Manius Aquillius, the junior consul of that year, who also brought several cohorts from the army of Gaius Marius in Gaul. Aquillius succeeded in defeated the rebel slaves, captured their strongholds and finally putting an end to the revolt in 100 BC.Florus, Epitome, Book II, 7 Prosecution and Banishment Naturally, upon return to Rome in 102 BC, after disbanding his army and destroying all of his own fortifications, he was immediately brought up on charges and exiled. He was further charged with abuse of his command in Sicily and accused of seeking to prolong the war merely as a pretext to plunder the province for his own profit just as his father had done during his command in Spain. The destruction of his camp and equipment, as well as the disbanding of his army, also supported the charge that he had abused his position and the public resources entrusted to him. To avenge the disgrace done by Lucullus to the Servilii through his treatment of Gaius Servilius, it was a Servilius, known as Servilius the Augur, who prosecuted him for embezzlement. Lucullus turned to his powerful brother-in-law, Metellus Numidicus, for support against his accusers, but Numidicus refused to speak for him.De Viris Illustribus, Book 62, 4Cicero, In Verrem, Book 4, 66 This may have been because the Servilii, too, had family connections with the Metelli‚ÄîServilius Vatia being married to the daughter of Metellus Macedonicus, Numidicus's uncle‚Äîand so they were unable to favour either side in the trial. Lucullus was found guilty of peculation and banished from the city in 102 BC. He spent the remainder of his life in exile, possibly in Heraclea,Cicero, Pro Archia, 6 and died at an unknown date. When his two sons, Lucius and Marcus Lucullus reached their majority, they immediately sought revenge by impeaching their father's accuser, Servilius the Augur, whom they charged with misusing public funds. However, despite the best efforts of the brothers, the trial descended into chaos and Servilius was acquitted.

He was Archbishop of Esztergom between 1279 and 1298, and Bishop of V√°rad (now Oradea in Romania) from 1268 till 1279. He was an opponent of Ladislaus IV of Hungary whom he excommunicated for failing to force the Cumans to adopt the Christian way of life. After Ladislaus' death, Lodomer and his suffragans were dedicated supporters of Andrew III of Hungary, who aimed to restore strong royal power against the rebellious lords and oligarchs. Theories of origin Lodomer or Ladomer was presumably born in the 1230s, not long before the First Mongol invasion of Hungary. He had an unnamed sister, the mother of Thomas, also an Archbishop of Esztergom, who studied in the University of Padua, courtesy of Lodomer. His ancestry, parentage and kinship relations have long been disputed among historians. Based on alleged \\"old manuscripts\\", 18th-century historian Mikl√≥s Schmitth claimed Lodomer originated from the territory of the Kievan Rus', and was a relative of Rostislav Mikhailovich and the Rurikids. (Lodomer can be interpreted as a Latinized form of the Slavic name Vladimir.) It is presumable that, in fact, Schmitth deduced that conclusion only from the prelate's forename and its similarity to Ruthenian principality Lodomeria. Referring to a papal letter allegedly from the end of the 13th century, historian J√°nos T√∂r√∂k also argued in favour of the Ruthenian ancestry in 1853. He argued Lodomer's real name was John and called himself \\"Lodomericus\\" (\\"a man from Lodomeria\\") after arriving to Hungary. However contemporary scholar N√°ndor Knauz proved that papal letter was written 100 years later, at the end of the 14th century, and it referred to then archbishop John Kanizsai. Himself Knauz also dealt with the issue in his large-scale monography Monumenta ecclesiae Strigoniensis. He claimed Lodomer originated from the gens (clan) Monoszl√≥ and has put forward three arguments; Archbishop Lodomer called a certain Maurice of Mencshely and Gregory, son of Saul from Monoszl√≥ as his blood relatives (\\"consanguineorum nostrorum\\") in 1292, when he donated his land of Henye in Zala County to them. When Gregory bought S√°sdi (near to Monoszl√≥) in 1297, the cathedral chapter of Veszpr√©m referred to him as Lodomer's nephew (\\"nepos\\"). In 1317, Charles I of Hungary mentioned his loyal servant Egyed, son of Gregory, who died without male heir, as a member of the Monoszl√≥ clan. Thus Knauz identified Gregory, Lodomer's nephew with Gregory II Monoszl√≥, the father of Egyed. A 1296 charter also mentioned that Gregory related to B√°nd and Csaba, members of the gens Atyusz. Lodomer's biographer (2003), theologian Margit Beke supported Knauz's claim, arguing Lodomer issued his last surviving charter in late 1297 in Monoszl√≥, two months before his death. However genealogist J√°nos Kar√°csonyi refused Knauz's theory, as Gregory Monoszl√≥'s father was Thomas, as he already outlined the clan's family tree at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. For the first time, Kar√°csonyi's contemporary M√≥r Wertner identified Lodomer as a member of the V√°zsony kindred, as he considered B√°nd and Csaba belonged to that clan too. Later he revised his position and claimed the archbishop was the son of a certain Lawrence, a local landowner in Henye, mentioned by a royal charter in 1237. Historian Attila Zsoldos refused Wertner's argument, as the fact that Lodomer was granted landholding in Henye is not necessarily link to his hypothetical ancestry. Instead, Zsoldos clearly identified Maurice of Mencshely with Maurice V√°zsony, the bailiff of Archbishop Lodomer's episcopal court in Esztergom. Zsoldos assumed Lodomer was the brother of Gregory's father, Saul, himself also a son of certain Mika. After philological and canon law considerations regarding the phrase \\"consanguineus\\" used by the well-educated Lodomer in 1292, historian Tam√°s K√∂rmendi argued that Maurice and Gregory were the archbishop's patrilineal relatives ‚Äì thus Lodomer himself was indeed a member of the V√°zsony clan and the son of Mika. Historian P√©ter Kis considered that there were two Monoszl√≥ clans at the end of the era of √Årp√°ds: the first, which originated from today's Podravska Moslavina (; in Croatia) and provided influential barons; and the second one, a significantly poorer and minor clan, Lodomer allegedly belonged to this, which came from Monoszl√≥ in Veszpr√©m County, near to V√°zsony and Mencshely. Early career and studies Lodomer is first mentioned by contemporary records between 1257 and 1261, when he functioned as the cantor in the cathedral chapter of Veszpr√©m. Beside his duty to proclaim the Scripture readings used in the Liturgy of the Word, Lodomer was responsible for management of the cathedral school of Veszpr√©m and teaching the clerics and the poor scholars, in accordance with the Canon 18 of the Third Council of the Lateran (1179). Additionally, he led the local place of authentication in this capacity. For this reason, 19th-century scholar Vince Bunyitay considered Lodomer attended the clerical school in Veszpr√©m. This biographical data is largely an assumption, nevertheless Lodomer was already referred to as a magister at the end of the 1250s, reflecting the acquisition of some basics of canonical studies by then. After 1260, Lodomer disappears from the sources for the next three years. As Margit Beke argued he studied canon law and Roman law at the University of Bologna during that period. B√©la IV (from the Illuminated Chronicle) K√∂rmendi noted that Lodomer's letters (missilis), which reflect his deepened legal and philological knowledge, prove that he was one of the most educated Hungarian prelates of the 13th century, thus he certainly attended an Italian universitas, but the exact location and date are uncertain. Considering a standard three-year study leave among the canons, which was secured and encouraged by the Roman Curia, K√∂rmendi agreed that Lodomer studied abroad (most likely in Italy) between 1261 and 1264. Based on the researches of literary historian Rab√°n Ger√©zdi (1941), Hungarian historiography claimed that a certain Lodomer, son of comes Denis, who was a student of the University of Bologna on 26 October 1268 according to a register, is identical with the namesake prelate. However, at the latest, Lodomer was already styled as elected and confirmed Bishop of V√°rad on 9 November, according to a royal charter of B√©la IV of Hungary. Nevertheless, K√∂rmendi added if Lodomer is identical with that student, his relationship to the Atyusz kindred becomes more established, as there were two clan members named Denis during his time. Returning home, Lodomer served as vice-chancellor in the royal court of junior king Stephen from 1264 to 1266, replacing Benedict, who defected to the partisans of B√©la IV. Duke Stephen's relationship with his father B√©la IV deteriorated by the early 1260s. Lodomer remained loyal to Stephen in the emerging 1260s civil war between the king and the duke, but took on a role of a mediator and conciliator in order to prevent the escalation of their conflict. The motivation of Lodomer's loyalty to Duke Stephen remained hidden. Historian Jen≈ë Sz≈±cs outlined three social groups according to their motivations to join the ducal court. In this sense, Lodomer belonged to that youth with illustrious Transdanubian aristocratic origin, who remained without office due to the influence of older generations in the royal court of B√©la IV. Bishop of V√°rad Lodomer was elected Bishop of V√°rad (today Oradea, Romania) at the latest on 9 November 1268. By then his confirmation was made by Pope Clement IV (died weeks later). Lodomer's last known predecessor Zozimas was last appeared as bishop in contemporary documents on 17 October 1265, when King B√©la countersigned his last will and testament. Thus it is possible that Lodomer was already installed as his successor in 1266, after leaving the office of vice chancellery. The Diocese of V√°rad laid in the territory of Stephen's realm during his election. Lodomer was granted the land of Henye for his advice and mediation role by B√©la IV still in that year. When Stephen V ascended the Hungarian throne in May 1270, he granted tax exemption for those serfs and hospes who were subjects of the Diocese of V√°rad, in addition to free use of mines for the bishopric. The king also permitted that the lands of the extinct local noble families have been transferred to the diocese. Lodomer founded monasteries, clerical schools and provided priests to numerous villages; these all were part of a restoration attempt in the territory of the diocese, which suffered heavy damages during the Mongol invasion decades earlier. According to a charter, Lodomer summoned an assembly, where subjects of the Diocese of V√°rad took an oath of allegiance before the reliquary of St. Ladislaus. Lodomer was a member of the royal council during the short reign of Stephen V. Ladislaus IV as depicted in the Illuminated Chronicle. Initially, Lodomer supported his efforts, but later became his inexorable opponent. When Stephen V fell ill and died on 6 August 1272, it marked the beginning of the era of feudal anarchy, when two rival baronial groups struggled for power during the minority of Ladislaus IV under his mother, Elizabeth's regency. Initially, Lodomer was a staunch supporter of the young king, who represented the continuation of the desired strong royal power. Following his coronation sometime after September 1272, Ladislaus IV and his escort resided in V√°rad, when he donated the village of Sz≈ël≈ës in Kom√°rom County to Lodomer. The bishop distanced himself from the conflict between the baronial groups. Nevertheless, Lodomer and his strong ally, Peter Monoszl√≥, who held the dignity of Bishop of Transylvania since 1270, opposed the ambition of the Geregye kindred, which had aspirations to establish dominion independently from the royal power in Bihar County, where the vast majority of the Diocese of V√°rad located. Consequently, Lodomer apparently became a partisan of the rival Cs√°k‚ÄìMonoszl√≥ league. In May 1277, Lodomer participated in that general assembly of the prelates, barons, noblemen, and Cumans in R√°kos (near Pest), which declared the minor Ladislaus IV to be of age and authorized the 15-year-old monarch to restore internal peace with all possible means. In the next month, Ladislaus entrusted Lodomer to lead a six- member diplomatic mission to Vienna to enter into an alliance with Rudolf I of Germany against Ottokar II of Bohemia. They ratified their covenant on 12 July 1277. After the royal army captured the rebellious Nicholas Geregye's fortress at Adorj√°n (now Adrian in Romania), Ladislaus IV held a \\"general assembly\\" for seven counties along the River Tisza near Cenad (today Cenad, Romania) in early summer of 1278. Lodomer and other prelates were involved in the meeting, where the rebellious Geregyes were executed and the Gutkeled clan swore loyalty to the monarch. Lodomer and the clergy supported Ladislaus' efforts to restore royal power against the oligarchs, but the assembly at Csan√°d proved to be a short-lived consolidation. The influence of Lodomer in the Roman Curia has increased by the second half of the 1270s. Pope Innocent V appointed him to preside that church committee, which investigated and supervised the beatification process of the late princess Margaret, daughter of B√©la IV. The committee resumed its work in 1276 after a four-year forced break since the death of Philip T√ºrje, Archbishop of Esztergom (1272). The necessary investigations were taken up between 1271 and 1276, 74 miracles were ascribed to her intercession, most of them referring to curing illnesses, even someone coming back from the dead. Among those giving testimony were 27 people for whom miracles had been wrought. Margaret was beatified still in that year, but canonization process was not successful, it took place only centuries later. The episcopal see of Esztergom was virtually vacant since 1272. After the death of Stephen B√°ncsa, Archbishop of Kalocsa in 1278, Lodomer became the most illustrious prelate in the Hungarian clergy, thanks to his political and church relationships in Rome and his outstanding literacy. Two representants of the rival baronial groups, Nicholas K√°n and Peter K≈ëszegi fought for the position of archbishop of Esztergom. Pope Nicholas III summoned them to Rome in June 1278. Nicholas refused to confirm either nomination, instead, he decided to appoint the archbishop himself in accordance with the canon law. Meanwhile, Nicholas sent Philip, Bishop of Fermo, to Hungary to help Ladislaus restore royal power and to fill the position of Archbishop of Esztergom. The papal legate arrived in Hungary in early 1279. The clergy, including Lodomer became Philip's strongest ally, which also meant that they turned against Ladislaus in the long term. With the mediation of the papal legate, Pope Nicholas III appointed Lodomer as the new Archbishop of Esztergom on 13 June 1279. The Roman Curia sent his pallium on 7 May 1280, confirming the appointment. Archbishop of Esztergom =Ladislaus' opponent= Papal legate Philip of Fermo arrives Hungary as depicted in the Illuminated Chronicle The arrival of papal legate Philip deepened the turmoil in Hungary. Initially, with the legate's mediation, Ladislaus IV concluded a peace treaty with the K≈ëszegis. Bishop Philip soon realized, however, that most Cumans were still pagans in Hungary. Following that he convened a synod in Buda on 14 September 1279, where Archbishop Lodomer, his closest ally Archbishop John Hont-P√°zm√°ny and the other bishops attended. He extracted a ceremonious promise from the Cuman chieftains of giving up their pagan customs, and persuaded the young King Ladislaus to swear an oath to enforce the keeping of the Cuman chieftains' promise. An assembly held at T√©t√©ny passed laws which, in accordance with the legate's demand, prescribed that the Cumans should leave their tents and live \\"in houses attached to the ground\\". The Cumans did not obey the laws, however, and Ladislaus, himself a half-Cuman, failed to force them. In retaliation, Philip excommunicated him and placed Hungary under interdict in October. Ladislaus joined the Cumans and appealed to the Holy See, but Pope Nicholas III refused to absolve him. Under such circumstances, Lodomer's primacy was overshadowed by the papal legate, who had no regard for local political conditions, forcing the Hungarian prelates to decide between the Hungarian monarch and the Roman Curia. Following Ladislaus' step, when the Cumans seized and imprisoned Philip of Fermo in early January 1280 on his demand, Lodomer and the bishops, who expressed \\"the liberty of the Church\\", turned against the royal power, and became his relentless opponents. Soon, Ladislaus was also captured. In less than two months, both the legate and the king were set free following mediation negotiations by Lodomer, and Ladislaus took a new oath to enforce the Cuman laws. When Bishop Philip of Fermo left Hungary in the summer of 1281, Lodomer attempted to restore political consolidation, which existed for a short time in 1277‚Äì78, before the violent intervention of the Roman Curia. He offered the support of the Hungarian Church to Ladislaus and interceded to Pope Martin IV in order to invalidate some of the radical measures and decisions of papal legate Philip. Lodomer also recognized the king's right of patronage over Hungarian church properties and dignities. Lodomer's hope to retake the king to the Christian affiliation has become real, when a Cuman army invaded the southern parts of Hungary in autumn 1282, and Ladislaus vanquished the invaders's army in the Battle of Lake H√≥d. According to Pope Martin's letters with optimistic tone throughout in 1282 and 1283, Lodomer \\"carefully, wisely and relentlessly contributed\\" in the reconciliation efforts between the monarch and the Holy See. For instance, Ladislaus and Lodomer jointly convened a general congregatio near Szeged in October 1282. However Lodomer's efforts failed by the end of 1283, when Ladislaus was unable to defeat the K≈ëszegi family. As historian Jen≈ë Sz≈±cs noted, the young king adopted an \\"anachronistic autocratic\\" system, omitting the royal council, nobility and church. Ladislaus abandoned his wife, Isabella, and settled among the Cumans by the end of the year. The contemporary public mood is well characterized by that fact when the Second Mongol invasion occurred during the winter of 1285‚Äì86, many of his subjects accused Ladislaus of inciting the Mongols to invade Hungary. In fact, Ladislaus employed Mongol prisoners of war, known as ny√∂g√©rs, when he subjugated a rebellion in the Szepess√©g in September 1285. Lodomer persuaded Ladislaus to convene a general assembly in the early summer of 1286 in order to reconciliation between the king and the powerful K≈ëszegi family, who plundered villages and regions in Transdanubia in recent years. There Ladislaus provided one-year grace period to the K≈ëszegis and their familiares. In September 1286, the king managed a self-coup, expelling members of the K≈ëszegi‚ÄìBorsa baronial group from the royal council. Neglecting the K≈ëszegis' rival, the Aba clan, Ladislaus IV appointed his own loyal soldiers and lesser nobles to the high positions. As regards Lodomer, he finally finished the intent of reconciliation, when Ladislaus imprisoned his wife and granted all her revenues to his Cuman mistress, Aydua. At the command of Pope Honorius IV, Lodomer intended to declare a crusade against the Hungarian king and his Cuman subjects, but the pope's death in April 1287 prevented this goal. When Ladislaus left Buda to prepare a military campaign against the K≈ëszegi‚ÄìBorsa league, Lodomer liberated Queen Isabella from her captivity at Rabbits' Island in September 1287. After that the queen moved to Esztergom and established her own court there under the protection of Lodomer and his troops. Then the archbishop summoned the prelates, the barons, and the noblemen to an assembly in Buda in November 1287 and excommunicated Ladislaus. Lodomer here also entrusted Peter Monoszl√≥ to recover the arbitrarily confiscated queenly estates surrounding Beszterce (present-day Bistri»õa, Romania) from the town's magistrate. In response, the infuriated king stated that \\"beginning with the archbishop of Esztergom and his suffragans, I shall exterminate the whole lot right up to Rome with the aid of Tartar swords\\", according to Lodomer's highly dubious report. The barons captured Ladislaus in the Szepess√©g in January 1288. Although his partisans soon liberated him, he, similarly to the \\"legendary Proteus\\", as Lodomer described him in his letter, acquiesced in concluding an agreement with the archbishop in March 1288. Lodomer absolved Ladislaus on condition that the king would live in accordance with Christian morals. However, Ladislaus broke his promise in the next month, when imprisoned opponent lords in Buda. He also abducted his sister, Elizabeth, prioress of the Dominican Monastery of the Blessed Virgin on Rabbits' Island, and gave her in marriage to a Czech aristocrat, Zavis of Falkenstein. According to Archbishop Lodomer, Ladislaus even stated, \\"If I had 15 or more sisters in as many cloistered communities as you like, I would snatch them from there to marry them off licitly or illicitly; in order to procure through them a kin-group who will support me by all their power in the fulfillment of my will\\". Cuman assassins murder Ladislaus in K√∂r√∂sszeg (Cheresig, Romania) on 10 July 1290 On 8 May 1288, Lodomer described the above mentioned events in his letter to Pope Nicholas IV. He listed the king's violations, scandals and his complaints regarding the chaotic situation in the kingdom. Two of his 1288 documents were discovered by French historian Charles-Victor Langlois. He sent the two letters to J√°nos Kar√°csonyi in 1908, who translated and first published in 1910. Two other letters were found in the collection of Pietro della Vigna. All of them are primary sources for the political history of Hungary in the Age of Late √Årp√°ds, in addition their literary value. Historian Korn√©l Szov√°k argued the individual style, the usage of terminology, and literary motifs prove that Lodomer personally wrote the letters. Szov√°k analyzed that Lodomer (or his chancellor) used his legal and theological knowledge as an argumentative weapon against Ladislaus. For instance, when quoted Ladislaus IV, who allegedly replied to Lodomer with the sentence \\"For me, I am the law and I do not tolerate that the laws of such priests constrain me\\", in response to criticisms, is a reference to the Bible, which described the pagans' way of life with the same phrases, and Pope Innocent III's decretals, which determined \\"the liberty of the Church\\" from secular powers. According to the archbishop, Ladislaus copulated with his favorite concubine, Aydua, whom the archbishop described as a \\"poisonous viper\\", in public. Lodomer cited antique works (the tale of Proteus, poems of Horace, Ovid and Livy's Ab Urbe Condita Libri), in addition to such recent Christian texts, like Bernard of Clairvaux's De consideratione, regarding the theory of \\"two swords\\". Consequently, Lodomer's accounts about the events in the 1280s are quite questionable. The two archbishops, Lodomer and John Hont-P√°zm√°ny compromised with the most powerful oligarchs, who divided the royal positions among them, while Ladislaus spent the last years of his life wandering from place to place, having lost all of his influence and support. To counterbalance the royal court's recent ideological basis, the Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum and to emphasize the role of the Christian king, Lodomer commissioned an unidentified Augustinian friar to write the rhythmic story of Stephen I of Hungary, the founder of the Christian kingdom. Lodomer participated in the assembly of F√∂veny in June 1289, which ended without results. Following that the archbishop urged Pope Nicholas IV to proclaim a crusade against Ladislaus and the Cumans. With the consent of Lodomer, the K≈ëszegis offered the crown to the king's distant relative Andrew the Venetian, who arrived to Hungary in early 1290. However Andrew was captured and surrendered him to Duke Albert. In response, Ladislaus prepared a war to Transdanubia, however he, who had always been partial towards his Cuman subjects, was assassinated by three Cumans at the castle of K√∂r√∂sszeg (now Cheresig in Romania) on 10 July 1290. It is plausible that Lodomer was not involved in organizing the murder. =Andrew's ally= Following the assassination, Lodomer subsequently dispatched two Williamite monks to Vienna to inform Andrew of the king's death. With the monks' assistance, Andrew left his prison in disguise and hastened to Hungary. Upon his arrival, Archbishop Lodomer crowned Andrew III king in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r on 23 July 1290. The lords and prelates swore loyalty to Andrew only after he issued a charter promising the restoration of internal peace and respect for the privileges of the nobility and the clergymen. The document was formulated by Lodomer himself. Andrew convened a national assembly to √ìbuda in the first days of September 1290, where he promised to preserve the rights and privileges of the nobility. Although, the K≈ëszegis and Lodomer jointly invited Andrew III to the Hungarian throne, their motivation was different: the oligarchs wanted a new controllable and weak-handed ruler to lead the kingdom instead of the unpredictable Ladislaus, while Lodomer and his suffragans were aimed to strengthen the royal power to put an end to the political anarchy. Lodomer and John Hont-P√°zm√°ny welcomed the arriving Queen Fenenna in Upper Hungary; she became the first wife of Andrew III before the end of 1290. Andrew III depicted in the Chronica Hungarorum Under Lodomer, the prelates became the strongest supporters of Andrew's reign, which decade was described as the \\"era of the early estates of the realm in Hungary\\" by historian J√≥zsef Gerics. Andrew and Lodomer were looking for an alliance with the lower nobility against the most powerful oligarchs to prevent the disintegration of the unified state. They also kept it in mind that they wished to keep the power aspirations of the Holy See and the Holy Roman Empire outside. The 34 articles of the Diet of √ìbuda reflect all these efforts. Lodomer and his suffragans acted royal advisers beside Andrew, excluding the barons of the realm. Lodomer, who was considered the advocate of the Roman Curia's interventions during the reign of Ladislaus IV in the 1280s, confronted with the Holy See after Andrew's coronation. Lodomer and his colleagues became the strongest pillars of the royal power, to protect the national sovereignty of the kingdom even against the pope's aspirations. On 31 January 1291, Pope Nicholas IV sent a letter to Lodomer, in which he expressed disappointment that the archbishop abandoned his previous \\"good habit\\" of continuous correspondence to inform the Holy See about the domestic conditions in Hungary. The pope noted \\"you've become almost a different person, who, to be addicted to a preventable indolence, did not inform the Holy See neither about the king's death, nor the situation of the country, nor the huge turmoil and nor the pretenders to the throne\\". In 1291, Andrew III invaded Austria, forcing Albert to withdraw his garrisons from the towns and fortresses that he had captured years before. Following that Lodomer and John Hont-P√°zm√°ny negotiated with Albert's envoys Bernhard of Prambach, Bishop of Passau and Leopold, Bishop of Seckau about the conditions for peace. The Peace of Hainburg, which concluded the war, was signed on 26 August, and three days later Andrew and Albert of Austria confirmed it at their meeting in K√∂pcs√©ny (now Kopƒçany in Slovakia). In accordance with Lodomer's goal, the peace treaty prescribed the destruction of the fortresses that Albert of Austria had seized from the K≈ëszegis earlier. Lodomer and the three other prelates used the terminology of the Roman and canon laws in the arenga of the document. The text describes the model of the perfect Christian ruler in Lodomer's eyes: \\"[...] for the powerful monarchs of the countries, who are not restricted by law, the greatest glory is [...] if they voluntarily obey the laws, and they embrace the right-inspiring, blessed compulsion in accordance with the voice of the Holy Writ\\". The Peace of Hainburg resulted that K≈ëszegis rose up in open rebellion against Andrew in spring 1292, acknowledging Charles Martel, as King of Hungary, whose claim was also supported by the Holy See. In response, Lodomer excommunicated Ivan K≈ëszegi, expressing his opposition to the Roman Curia and its protege, the Angevins. Thirteen years earlier, he still subjected himself to Philip of Fermo and the pope's interests despite his better conviction, which caused the failure of the consolidation attempt. The royal troops subdued the rebellion by July, but the K≈ëszegis captured and imprisoned Andrew during his journey to Slavonia in August. Andrew was liberated within four months, after his supporters sent their relatives as hostages to the K≈ëszegis. Despite Lodomer's theoretical activity, Hungary was in a state of constant anarchy during Andrew's reign. The K≈ëszegis, the Cs√°ks, the Borsas and other powerful families autonomously governed their domains, rising up nearly every year in open rebellion against Andrew in the second half of the 1290s. Andrew III again declared war against the K≈ëszegi brothers in August 1296, and Archbishop Lodomer excommunicated them. The archbishop personally participated in the military campaign with his banderium, but Andrew and his occasional ally, Albert could not subdue them. In his last months, Lodomer resided in Monoszl√≥, then Budafelh√©v√≠z (today a borough in the 2nd district of Budapest). He held a synod on 14 December 1297. He sent his last letter on 28 December. According to Pauline historian Gergely Gy√∂ngy√∂si's Vitae fratrum Eremitarum Ordinis Sancti Pauli Primi Eremitae (1496), Lodomer died on 2 January 1298. John Hont- P√°zm√°ny became the leading figure of the royal council. The subsequent 1298 laws, which circumscribed the feudal institutions, reflected Lodomer's political will, but the delicate balance was broken between Andrew III and the prelates after his death, despite Archbishop John's efforts. With the election of the pro-Angevin Gregory Bicskei as Lodomer's successor, the consistency between the clergy also eliminated. =His ecclesiastical lordship= Lodomer held at least four provincial synods (1286, 1292, 1294 and 1297) during his 19-year episcopate. He permitted the burghers of Szepes Castle (today Spi≈° in Slovakia) in 1280 to secede from the affiliation of the St. Ladislaus parish and build a church for themselves, maintaining the suzerainty of the Archdiocese of Esztergom. Alongside Andrew III and other prelates, he was present at the consecration of the Franciscans' Virgin Mary Church in Pressburg (present-day Bratislava, Slovakia) on 26 March 1297, celebrated by vicar James. Pope Clement IV subordinated the Augustine monastery of Titel to Esztergom in 1294. Lodomer donated the Saint Vitus Basilica of Esztergom to the Williamite friars to defend themselves during the second Mongol invasion. Lodomer approved the regulation of the Order of Saint Paul the First Hermit around 1297. Reconstruction drawing of Visk Castle (today ruins in Vyshkovo, Ukraine) During Lodomer's episcopate, Ladislaus IV donated the land of √ñrm√©ny (a former borough of Esztergom) to the Order of Saint Augustine in 1281, where they established a monastery and conducted theological and artistic studies. The land donation was confirmed by Andrew III in his letter of coronation oath. In 1283, Ladislaus permitted that those nobles who died without legitimate heirs, could leave their fortune to the Esztergom Basilica. Additionally, the king granted the privilege of the exemption from mining income to the archdiocese and its chapter. In 1288, Ladislaus obliged the traders, who arrived from Regensburg and Vienna, to pay custom to the chapter of Esztergom, when passing through the city. However there were several reports, that the traders avoided Esztergom and took their goods directly into Buda. As a result, Lodomer excomunnicated some merchants in the next year. He had also conflicts with those butchers, who relocated their slaughterhouses from Esztergom in order to avoid paying the duty. There is no record that Lodomer ever bought a landholding during his episcopate, unlike his predecessors, but exchanged estates ten times, according to the contemporary records. Historian P√©ter Kis considers Lodomer's unusually more active role in the secular domestic politics caused significant additional expenditure to the archbishopric. After his coronation, Andrew III donated several landholdings to his ally, including Rozsny√≥b√°nya (present-day Ro≈æ≈àava in Slovakia) in 1291. He was also granted the village of Mocsa by Queen Fenenna in the same year. As a compensation for previous damages, he acquired the castle of Visk (today Vyshkovo, Ukraine) from the sons of James Cseszneki. In a similar procedure, Lodomer was granted the land of K√©m√©nd (today Kamen√≠n, Slovakia) from the gens Hont-P√°zm√°ny. The acquisition and sale of landholdings were consciously organized: Lodomer expanded his influence over the territories in Esztergom, Kom√°rom and Nyitra (Nitra) counties that surrounded his seat in Esztergom in order to defend the archbishopric's interests against the neighboring powerful lords during the era of anarchy. Adapting to the new situation, Lodomer was the first archbishop, who established an ecclesiastical familia, through which he could exercise his military and political influence. There are some data about the Nobles of the Church, the personnel of his court in Esztergom; his first identified bailiff was Pasca of Cseke (mentioned in 1280), who soon was replaced by Maurice V√°zsony, Lodomer's relative around 1284. A certain Andrew Ajka was referred to as the archiepiscopal court's palatine in 1291, while Michael of Mencshely was styled as \\"master of the bakers\\" (). A third member, Stephen, son of Fulkus was a castle warrior in Kom√°rom Castle, who joined Lodomer's court \\"with his estates and privileges\\" in 1284 in order to protect his wealth against the oligarchs. He was granted the \\"conditional noble\\" status. The lands of his servants and soldiers laid in Bars and Hont counties along the estates of the archdiocese to perform their defense function against the eastward attacks from the powerful Transdanubian oligarchs, primarily Matthew Cs√°k and the K≈ëszegi brothers, while the familial lands with looser structure in Kom√°rom and Pozsony counties existed with the aim to support potential westward royal campaigns against the provincial lords.

The DTM is typically retrofit onto pole top and pad mount transformers. A pole top (above ground) or pad mount (below ground) transformer commonly powers anywhere from 5-8 homes in the US and is the last voltage transition in stepping down voltage before it gets to the home or business. Standard positioning of DTM devices occurs at the transformer bushings, but sometimes they are attached directly onto the secondary electricity lines. DTM devices commonly consist of highly accurate non-piercing or piercing sensors, onboard communications modules to transmit information, and a power supply provision. The DTM device reports to a collection engine, and/or existing SCADA/MDM system where relevant transformer data is stored and presented to the user; analytics platforms are oftentimes employed to interpret the information being captured and reported by the DTM. Overview Given its unique location within the interior of the distribution grid, the DTM ‚Äì commonly referred to as an intra-grid sensor ‚Äì may present real-time and/or historical information about the transformer upon which it is hosted, in addition to creating a vital ongoing information access point within the grid architecture. A series of DTM devices deployed within a distribution grid provides multiple information points that can serve merely as bellwether measurement sources for the electric utility operator, or when deployed with increased density will provide the operator with a more robust view of intra-grid conditions and performance. DTM deployments may be surgical in nature (i.e., strategically and sparingly positioned within the grid), or comprehensively positioned to reveal critical data for extended grid areas such as line segments, specific circuit feeders, and/or entire substations. DTM placement and deployment density is driven by the targeted needs of the respective utility. Remote Over-The-Air (OTA) updates / upgrades are supported by certain DTM device offerings. This OTA capability, when supported, allows the operator to perform remote configuration and / or executable code (i.e., Firmware) updates of the DTM device(s) without the need for costly truck rolls or unit replacement. By supporting OTA Firmware updates / upgrades, providers can progressively broaden and deepen the suite of data points captured by the DTM device, making it reasonably future proof, thus escalating value and relevance to the utility operator throughout the lifespan of the DTM device(s). Applications DTM sensors transmit timely, accurate intra-grid readings for Voltage, Energy, Current and Temperature, thus empowering a long list of derived performance and power quality understandings for operations personnel. These fundamental data points provide direct relevance to electric utility operators. Additionally, these data points can be extrapolated to reveal enhanced grid performance and asset health information. Given the physical location of the DTM within the heart of the distribution grid, in addition to the DTM reporting frequency capability, the versatility of this intra-grid sensor is expansive. Utilities across the U.S. are beginning to turn to transformer technologies to improve distribution reliability and efficiency, as well as customer service and operating costs. Examples of applications derived from direct and/or indirect information presented by the DTM include: * Asset management and Condition monitoring (AMCM) * Preventive Grid Asset Maintenance recognition * Power Theft identification * Demand response assistance * Voltage optimization * Outage notification/Restoration enhancement * Distributed Energy Resource (DER) Monitoring (i.e., bi- directional energy monitoring, voltage impacts, current impacts, etc) * Transformer under-sizing/over-loading recognition (e.g., electric vehicle charging station impacts, hydroponic marijuana grow houses, etc.) * Transformer under-sizing (i.e., unnecessary added energy loss, accelerated premature failure, etc) * Abnormal transformer voltage characteristics * Transformer-related temperature monitoring * Transformer life expectancy estimation * Phase Imbalance recognition * Populate Artificial Intelligence Platforms (foresee/forecast emerging intra-grid problems that human recognition cannot identify) * Facilitate Strategic Battery Storage Location Efforts (i.e., leverage DER-induced Reverse Energy monitoring to locate present and future battery placements) * Identify Geographic Information System (GIS) Mapping errors Health Concerns Given the physical deployment position of the DTM (i.e., on the distribution transformer), there are no known health concerns related to this family of intra-grid sensors. DTM devices are created with user/installer safety in mind, and otherwise bear no known measurable environmental impact. Business case justification Utility spending on asset management and grid monitoring technology is to hit almost $50 billion by 2023, according to a new study from Navigant Research. Given the pioneering stage of the DTM technology, significant business case information is limited in availability for public review. Arguments against DTM deployment commonly assert that the secondary transformer value of $1000.00 to $2000.00 US (average) does not justify applying a retrofit DTM to monitor the transformer assets‚Äô performance. However, the DTM value is based upon a combination of features/benefits that include not only the transformer condition monitoring importance, but also a series of data visibility and reconciliation features from within the heart of the distribution grid that are otherwise unavailable to the electric operator (see Applications). In essence, while the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) or smart meter providers supply a series of data points to utilities, the DTM offers another dimension of real-time and historical data access for the grid operator, and is capable of detecting information that AMI assets cannot capture and/or report with the necessary frequency to the operator. Each utility must evaluate, among other things, their unique grid management needs, their levels of unidentifiable losses that can be remediated/mitigated by DTM deployment, their Demand Response savings potential through Volt/VAR and conservation voltage reduction (CVR) related practices supported by DTM devices, and their need for real-time and/or historic data from within the heart of the distribution grid when formulating their business case justification. Investment decisions relating to DTM deployments involve a collection of monetary benefits that include savings for the utility through decreased operations costs, reduced power outages, lessened power outage durations, reduced peak demand costs, and recoverable power theft losses; and indirect financial benefits associated with improved power delivery and quality to rate payers, reduced truck rolls which lessen service costs in addition to yielding decreased environmental impacts, improvement of the utility's Key Performance Indicators (e.g., SAIDI, SAIFI, CAIDI, etc.), and improved stakeholder/shareholder value through enhanced bottom line fiscal performance by the utility. Relevance to the smart grid: Distribution Transformer Monitor (DTM) devices provide a solution to the smart grid revolution. GTM Research (a division of Greentech Media) expects strong growth from the U.S. market for transformer monitoring hardware, increasing its current valuation of $112 million annually to $755 million by 2020. To date, smart grid providers have presented electric utility operators with significant management and control tools for substations, and have introduced Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI, or smart meters) to improve data access at the beginning and endpoints within the distribution grid. However, the expansive, and arguably most vulnerable segment of the grid remains the section between substations and endpoint meters‚Äîcomprising over 6 million line miles (US grid), and 40+ million distribution transformers (US grid) -- which is now collectively coined the \\"heart of the grid\\". Presently, the ‚Äúheart of the grid‚Äù area is somewhat devoid of a sufficient density of versatile, cost effective sensors thereby leaving operators with limited visibility into this critical area. To further evolve from a traditional reactionary management and problem resolution state within the ‚Äúheart of the grid‚Äù space, to a more proactive posture which is congruent with the purpose and value of a ‚Äòsmart grid‚Äô, the emergence of the DTM is timely. While efforts have been made to leverage substation and endpoint meter data, along with supporting algorithms to speculate and postulate occurrences and needs within the ‚Äúheart of the grid‚Äù, it is evident that grid operators require precision-accurate, timely information from within this expansive segment of the grid in order to proactively and efficiently manage its performance. The need for effectively combining all three critical points of measure (i.e., substations, endpoint meters, and DTM data from within the ‚Äúheart of the grid‚Äù) may be collectively required to advance a comprehensive smart grid experience. Why Distribution Transformer Monitors are fundamental for creating Grid Modernization -- Achieving valuable results that Advanced Meter Infrastructure cannot reliably address: 1\\\\. Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), and Automated Meter Reading (AMR) and/or Manual Meter reads accurately and reliably represent endpoint data only. If any power is tapped before the endpoint meter (i.e., pre-meter tapping), accurate detection of this power diversion is difficult or nearly impossible without use of a reconciliation point upstream -- preferably at the distribution transformer. By accurately capturing unique data at the distribution transformer, DTM devices provide necessary reconciliation points between the substation and endpoint meters, thus enabling utility operators to effectively detect power diversion occurring in front of the endpoint meter. Without a reliable reconciliation point at the distribution transformer, the utility operator's power theft detection system remains porous, inefficient and unreliable. 2\\\\. If AMI alone was a complete solution for diversion detection/identification, then AMI-installed utilities would seldom experience more than 1-3% loss from otherwise unavoidable technical losses. According to the United States Energy Information Administration (US EIA) most power distribution utilities report annual energy losses of nearly 5% or more. DTM devices and associated Data Analytics have the functionality to allow the utility operators to quickly identify intra-grid anomalies. AMI is a component in the diversion detection and solution process, but without a reliable reconciliation point at the distribution transformer the detection system remains porous and inefficient. Many utilities, even those with AMI, actually suffer from the necessary availability of timely, granular, accurate intra- grid information that is necessary for improved energy loss detection, and enhanced Grid Modernization. 3\\\\. Energy measurements at the distribution transformer allow for ongoing validation of the AMI meters to ensure accurate meter performance, and to reveal improper metering issues within the distribution grid. 4\\\\. If customer meters yield \\"reasonable consumption readings\\" whether through AMI, AMR, or Manual meter reads, they will likely go without being investigated. But, when a DTM is deployed upstream, it records power consumption disparity for the entire downstream segment that is serviced by each respective transformer. This allows operators to locate less-obvious, but still costly power diversion instances. 5\\\\. For prosecution purposes, the evidence presented by a DTM in addition to AMI, AMR or Manual Reads is superior to having only meter reading data, whenever diversion is discovered and remediation and/or prosecution is sought. 6\\\\. The DTM allows for enhanced desktop surveillance for power theft, thereby helping to keep utility personnel safe from the dangers of exploratory field efforts to locate potential power diversion occurrences. Using the DTM, operators can pinpoint losses from their desk, and dispatch the proper personnel (possibly even law enforcement) to address each particular situation. 7\\\\. With AMI or AMR deployed, utility meter-reader personnel are no longer visiting their customer's property; thus operators no longer have \\"eyes in the field\\" to spot nefarious behaviors. The DTM provides a cost-effective, non-invasive reliable source for much-needed visibility into the grid. 8\\\\. DTM's offer valuable outage detection alerts via last gasp reporting capability, thereby helping to pinpoint outage locations for utility operators, and accelerating power restoration for customers. 9\\\\. Transformer loading/overloading information is superior when captured by the DTM (vs. the projected or algorithmic loading estimations produced via accumulated AMI or AMR statistics). In addition the DTM accurately and reliably captures other metrics related to transformer health and intra-grid conditions; such as but not limited to: temperature data, percentage of rated load, duration of actual load, voltage and current information, etc‚Ä¶. 10\\\\. The DTM allows for the detection, quantification and location of additional costly intra-grid losses occurring between the transformer and the endpoint meters (e.g., certain technical losses, and non- technical losses), such as but not limited to the ability to identify poorly functioning and/or poorly calibrated endpoint meters. 11\\\\. The DTM enables operators to accurately quantify the amount of Distributed Energy Resource (DER) inspired Reverse Energy being passed into the grid at the distribution transformer level. This is critical as Reverse Energy can adversely impact intra-grid voltages, and unplanned loading/overloading which collectively or individually can result in grid safety and reliability risks. 12\\\\. The DTM uniquely enables the identification of unplanned grid-edge loading/overloading created by Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations, Cryptocurrency mining, Legalized Hydroponic marijuana grow operations, ongoing power theft, etc. The transformer-related loading/overloading impacts associated with such grid-edge activities (primarily occurring in the residential sectors) is commonly unknown by operators (i.e., operators typically do not know where, when, or how much unplanned loading/overloading is created by most grid-edge activities). This reality presents serious grid Reliability, Resilience, and Fire/Wildfire risks for all stakeholders. 13\\\\. Although AMI deployment has been advancing in many markets, Power Theft is typically increasing in spite of this smart meter deployment effort. Since AMI or AMR installations typically result in no utility personnel visiting customer locations following installation, power thieves know they can perform pre-meter taps, and likely steal power indefinitely without fear of utility detection. Increasing power theft cost (while AMI deployment continues) is further validation to the importance of DTM technology being leveraged by operators as a critical intra- grid reconciliation point, thereby helping to identify costly power theft occurrences. 14\\\\. Operators now have to contend with instances where endpoint meters are being stolen from locations or jurisdictions, and then are being installed at unauthorized locations by perpetrators. Endpoint meters may be swapped out in this manner on either a temporary basis or permanent basis. This unauthorized practice results in inaccurate meter data being reported to the utility, which may result in added losses, and it results in inaccurate loading/overloading views regarding the upstream Distribution Transformer(s). 15\\\\. Commonly, the Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping of utility assets is antiquated, due to perpetual changes occurring within the distribution grid. Because of the antiquated GIS data, AMI, AMR, or Manual Read endpoint meter association to upstream transformers is likely to be inaccurate. With just one endpoint meter being inaccurately assigned in the GIS mapping to the wrong upstream transformer, all endpoint meter information (AMI or otherwise) becomes unreliably accurate regarding the associated upstream transformer(s). Thus, operators cannot reliably predict or know the actual loading/overloading, voltage, and/or current conditions regarding the upstream transformer. This is another reason by accurate, reliable transformer information provided by the DTM is valuable to operators. 16\\\\. DTM devices provide Automated Alert messages to operators. This feature creates a \\"Hands- Free\\" Grid Watchdog environment where operators are not required to expend large amounts of money to consistently monitor intra-grid conditions. Rather, the DTM can be programmed/re-programmed on the fly, each device individually re-programmable, thus allowing operators to focus on multiple points of interest throughout the lifespan of the DTM devices. Automated Alerts are typically created when the DTM devices detect high/low readings that our occurring outside of the utility's pre-programmed tolerances, and/or rapid outage notifications as cited above. This feature automatically produces actionable information for operators, vs. trying to discern less reliable, less granular, less timely, and/or potentially antiquated endpoint meter data. Only with DTM can comprehensive intra-grid conditions be reliably and consistently detected, revealed, and reported to operators in a timely manner. 17\\\\. DTM device readings can ‚Äúfill in the blanks‚Äù whenever an AMI meter in a group of meters on the same transformer fails to report properly for any reason. Assuming there is no diversion, the DTM can provide the utility with the substantially accurate missing consumption information, helping to assure the customer can be billed more accurately vs. the typical estimation systems in use today. 18\\\\. DTM-coupled with AMI can verify/measure problems between the DT and Meter such as voltage drops that could leave the home running below rated voltages. An AMI meter will report the low voltage, but the DTM can verify that the voltage supplied at the DT is operating nominally or not. 19\\\\. The DTM can be installed without a required power outage being experienced by downstream customers. When compared to the concept of replacing an aged/failing/overloaded transformer with a new, or 'smart' transformer, the reality of a forced downstream power outage is imperative. But, by installing a DTM, operators can accurately understand the condition and the associated demand burdens being inflicted upon each DTM-monitored transformer. This will enable operators to reduce the quantity of transformers that may otherwise need replaced, or may prematurely fail. In essence, deploying DTM can create an \\"instant smart transformer\\" out of an existing standard transformer. And, this \\"instant smart transformer\\" can then act to proactively apprise operators of intra-grid conditions for a lesser cost than a new smart transformer installation will require, in addition to the fact that a DTM deployment does not require an outage for installation, but a new smart transformer would require a multi-hour power outage requirement. 20\\\\. DTM devices commonly have the ability to report key intra-grid information directly to the utility operator's existing SCADA, MDM, ADMS, ONS, etc. systems. This seamless transfer of unique intra-grid data is achieved via DNP3, FTP, CSV, and/or web services. Thus, the DTM can be seamlessly used to substantially improve the operator's intra-grid understandings, and the intra-grid data can be used to facilitate automated operations actions, based upon actual, reliable information that AMI (endpoint metering) cannot. 21\\\\. Using Over-The-Air (OTA) technology, DTM devices can be routinely upgraded as necessary, and/or as technology advancements unfold. This ability creates an ongoing 'future-proof' benefit whereby DTM capability can be expanded; thus alleviating the concern of the DTM devices becoming antiquated prior to their anticipated lifespan (e.g., commonly 10-15 years) 22\\\\. DTM devices typically have the flexibility to report intra-grid information via cellular or RF Mesh backhaul. Most cellular networks offer a more robust backhaul capability whereby maximum intra-grid information payload can be passed onto the operator. When using RF Mesh backhaul technology, less bandwidth is typically available than with cellular networks, thus reducing the data payload capability of the DTM devices. There are various cost/benefit decisions that are applicable to proper backhaul selection for each operator. 23\\\\. Given the unique, timely, granular, accurate intra-grid information that is presented by DTM, meaningful value is provided to the Planning, Operations, and Budgeting departments within most utility operators. The result is a more Reliable, more Resilient, more cost-effective, more Energy Efficient grid operation being facilitated by DTM.

When installed it appears to have light shining from a hole in the ceiling, concentrating the light in a downward direction as a broad floodlight or narrow spotlight. Different types of recessed lighting in a warehouse \\"Pot light\\" or \\"canister light\\" implies the hole is circular and the lighting fixture is cylindrical, like a pot or canister. There are three parts to a recessed lighting fixture: housing, trim and bulb. The trim is the visible portion of the light. It is the insert that is seen when looking up into the fixture, and also includes the thin lining around the edge of the light. The housing is the fixture itself that is installed inside the ceiling and contains the lamp holder. There are many different types of bulbs that can be inserted into recessed lighting fixtures, with the amount of heat generated by the bulb being a unique consideration.  History  The earliest recessed lights were developed in the 1940s by Ivan Kirlin of the Kirlin Company, Detroit, Michigan.  Advantages  Recessed lighting offers the advantages of being a hidden light source and energy efficiency. However, the tradeoff is that they are relatively permanent and may be unflattering.  Types of housing  In North America, UL 1598 recessed housings generally fall into one of four categories. #IC or ‚Äúinsulation contact‚Äù rated new construction housings are attached to the ceiling supports before the ceiling surface is installed. If the area above the ceiling is accessible these fixtures may also be installed from within the attic space. IC housings must be installed wherever insulation will be in direct contact with the housing. #Non-IC rated new construction housings are used in the same situations as the IC rated new construction housings, only they require that there be no contact with insulation and at least spacing from insulation. These housings are typically rated up to 150 watts. #IC rated remodel housings are used in existing ceilings where insulation will be present and in contact with the fixture. #Non-IC rated remodel housings are used for existing ceilings where, ideally, no insulation is present. However, these also require that there be no contact with insulation and at least spacing from insulation. Sloped-ceiling housings are available for both insulated and non-insulated ceilings that are vaulted. The main feature of the housing is designed to ensure that no flammable materials come into contact with the hot lighting fixture. Badly-housed downlights can be a fire hazard, though all newer ones contain a self- resetting thermal switch for safety. The housings come in various sizes based on the diameter of the circular opening where the lamp is installed. The most commonly used sizes are 4, 5 and 6 inches in diameter, with 4 inch IC New Construction units less readily available at present. Smaller housings (2 and 3 inch) are also available for specialized uses. The housing can also be \\"Air Tight\\", which means it will not allow air to escape into the ceiling or attic, thus reducing both heating and cooling costs. The City of Chicago has an additional requirement \\"Chicago Plenum\\" which requires the housing to be airtight in addition to requiring all wiring and to be sealed off and gasketed from the plenum air space. This housing rating must be used on all recessed luminaires installed in air plenums in the City of Chicago as well as nearby municipalities which have adopted the Chicago amendments to the NEC. The intent of this rating is to prevent potential sparks from escaping the luminaire into the air plenum and getting recirculated in the HVAC system. IEC 60598 has two classifications. #Luminaires for recessing into ceilings with thermal insulating matting covering the luminaire. #Luminaires for recessing into ceilings but not suitable for covering with thermal insulating material.  Trim styles  Recessed lighting styles have evolved with more manufacturers creating quality trims for a variety of applications. Recessed lighting trim usually comes in the standard baffle in black or white, which is the most popular. They are made to absorb extra light and create a crisp architectural appearance. There are cone trims which produce a low-brightness aperture. Multipliers are offered which are designed to control the omnidirectional light from \\"A\\" style incandescent light bulbs and compact fluorescents. Lens trim is designed to provide a diffused light and protect the lamp. Lensed trims are normally found in wet locations. The luminous trims combine the diffused quality of lensed trim but with an open downlight component. Adjustable trim allows for the adjustment of the light whether it is eyeball style, which protrudes from the trim or gimbal ring style, which adjusts inside the recess. These lights allow for full versatility. Lastly, there are the wall-washer trims, which are designed to eliminate the often seen \\"scalloped light effect\\".  Bulb types  There are two types of bulbs for recessed lighting: directional and diffuse. Directional lamps (R, BR, PAR, MR) contain reflectors that direct and control the light. Diffuse lamps (A, S, PS, G) control light distribution through their omnidirectional light.

In 2008, it was released on the Wii under the title Freddi Fish in Kelp Seed Mystery as well as Windows and Macintosh, and on Android with a shortened title Freddi Fish and the Missing Kelp Seeds. The Wii version's availability was limited by legal problems concerning its development. A simplified handheld LCD game partially based on Kelp Seeds was also released in 1999 that adapted one of its minigames, Jellyfish Jamboree and was titled Freddi Fish: Jellyfish Jamboree. Plot The adventure begins in the Atlantic Ocean when Freddi Fish visits Grandma Grouper with a gift of flowers. Grandma Grouper is sad and when asked why, she informs Freddi that her treasure chest full of kelp seeds has been stolen. As a result, her garden began to wilt and left them with no food. Courageously, Freddi promises to find Grandma Grouper's stolen treasure chest. This puts a smile on Grandma Grouper's face and she gives Freddi her last peanut butter and jellyfish sandwich to take on her journey. After going a short distance from Grandma Grouper's house, Freddi finds her friend Luther trying to swim loop-de-loops. She shows Luther how to do it and he tries again, hitting his head on some coral. A bottle is knocked loose and slowly lands on the ground. When Freddi and Luther investigate, they discover that a note has been lodged inside the bottle. After reading the note and finding a message telling them where the treasure is, Freddi and Luther begin their journey to find the missing kelp seeds. However at the same time, it's revealed that two sharks named Spongehead and Boss were the ones that stole the treasure as part of their plan to help the Squidfather grow kelp. The bottles that Freddi and Luther found were directions that Spongehead created so he could find his way back to the treasure after he hid it. Boss is furious over not remembering where the treasure is or the bottles that lead the way to it so he takes him to the Squidfather as punishment, Of course, the Squidfather is enraged at this revelation, but after the Squidfather spews out ink, Spongehead now finally remembers where the treasure is, so the sharks go to get the treasure. When the final clue reveals that the treasure is at the sunken ship, Freddi and Luther go there and retrieve the treasure, but the two are stopped by Spongehead and Boss who want the treasure. Freddi explains that the kelp treasure is for everyone to share, and the sharks plan on sharing. Freddi and Luther grab the treasure, spread it around to give to everyone, and plant it in Grandma Grouper's garden. The three all go inside her house, ending the game. Gameplay The game makes use of a simplified adventure system where a single click on a certain spot allows the player to pick up items, go to another location, talk to characters and find trivial but fun stuff in the screen. Clicking on an item in the right place allows Freddi to make use of it. Most puzzles require the player to make exchanges with characters and use items to get to inaccessible areas. The locations of the clues in bottles and the trails to follow for the treasure chest are randomised in every new game. There are also a few minigames, such as \\"Jellyfish Jamboree\\", where Freddi must fend off waves of jellyfish by throwing food at them before they get too close, with Luther keeping score. Such minigame forms the basis of the LCD handheld version. Reception \\"Freddi Fish and the Case of the Missing Kelp Seeds\\" received mixed reviews from various critics. GameRankings lists a 60% score for the Windows version based on 1 review, Metacritic has an average score of 70 out 100, Allgame gave a 4-star rating, GameZone rated 7 out of 10, Adventure Gamers gave a 3-star rating, and Unikgamer gave a 7 out 10 score. It also received over 20 awards. The Case of the Missing Kelp Seeds won Electronic Entertainments 1994 \\"Best Edutainment Title\\" award. The editors wrote that the game features \\"wonderful original characters, a strong storyline, appropriately challenging puzzles, and beautiful animation.\\" The Case of the Missing Kelp Seeds was a commercial success, with sales of 250,000 units by 1999. During the year 2001 alone, Freddi Fish sold 54,447 retail units in North America, according to PC Data.

The location for both was Gulfstream Park, a horse racing track in Hallandale, Florida, just north of Miami. Apart from the venue, the two events were not related. The first of the two festivals, which took place in May, was actually officially publicized on promotional materials and in radio ads as the \\"1968 Pop and Underground Festival,\\" and \\"The 1968 Pop Festival\\", and only later came to be referred to colloquially as the \\"Miami\\" Pop Festival, a practice which has led to widespread confusion between the two events.

A pullstring (pull string, pull-string), pullcord (pull cord, pull-cord), or pullchain (pull-chain, pull chain) is a string, cord, or chain wound on a spring-loaded spindle that engages a mechanism when it is pulled. It is most commonly used in toys and motorized equipment. More generally and commonly, a pullstring can be any type of string, cord, rope, or chain, attached to an object in some way used to pull or mechanically manipulate part of it. Toys Perhaps the simplest pullstring toy is the yo-yo (c. 460 BCE). The jumping jack (c. Ancient Egypt) is a more complicated animated puppet paper doll that uses a pullstring to move its arms and legs up and down. Trompos and some spinning tops use a string that is wound around the top and then pulled to make it spin. More recent toys include dolls, such as Chatty Cathy (1959), Charmin' Chatty (1963), Talking Tamu (1970), Look Around Crissy (1972), Sky Dancers (1994), and Sheriff Woody (from the Toy Story franchise), that have a pullstring built into them that activates a speaker when it is pulled, causing the doll to say a built-in phrase. The Blythe doll (1972) has a pullstring that changes the doll's eye color. Other non-doll toys like See 'n Say (1965). The earliest patent with a pullstring included in it is an 1886 \\"Toy Bowling-Alley\\".Toy Bowling-Alley, Thomas Kochka, filed 11 December 1886 (retrieved 31 January 2012 from Google Patents) Engines Many motorized lawn mowers, chainsaws, portable generators, and portable outboard motors use a pullstring or pullcord attached to a handle as a manual ignition device. Some vehicle engines are also started with pullchains, such as the early-1900s Puckridge, or pullcords, like the pre-release version of the Citro√´n 2CV car, and the DKW RT 125 scooter. Weapons Some grenades such as the German Models 24, 39, and 43 have pullcords. Some machine guns such as the M73 machine gun and M85 machine gun use a pullchain to charge and/or fire them. Other Some types of window blinds and curtains use a cord pull to open, close, raise, and lower them. Some types of ladders like the extension ladder and attic ladder can have a pullstring that pulls it down from the ceiling. A dock plate can use a pullchain to move it. Some gates have a pullstring on its latch. A pull switch uses a chain or string to actuate a switch, commonly used in lighting and ceiling fans. Modern flush toilets use a pullchain attached to a lever that lifts the plunger to release water into the toilet bowl. The photoplayer uses pullchains to generate sound effects for silent films. Pre-1990s North American diesel locomotive train horns used a lever or pull cord to actuate an air valve. Older steam whistles were almost always actuated with a pull cord. A train's emergency brake can be a cord or chain that will stop the train when pulled. Older transit buses and trams/trolleys have a pullcord that a passenger can pull to signal the driver that they are requesting a stop. The Jaguar XK120 sports car's doors have no external handles so it uses an interior pullcord instead. Some grandfather clocks have a pullchain to raise the weights in order to wind the clock's gears. A lifejacket has a pullcord used to inflate it. Variants A bow string is perhaps the simplest type of pullstring that pulls a bow's ends together. A ripcord is a type of pullstring used to release a parachute. A drawstring is a type of pullstring used in many aspects of the fashion industry and in bags as a closing device.

While studying in France from 1919‚Äì1924, he was one of the founders of the Chinese Youth Party. After returning to China, he taught French literature in several universities in the 1920s through the 1940s. During the Second Sino- Japanese War the Youth Party joined the China Democratic League, a \\"Third Force\\" independent of both the Chinese Communist Party and the Nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek. Youth and education in France Li Huang's father was a prosperous merchant in Chengdu, where Li joined the Young China Study Association, an informal group that brought young intellectuals together for informal but wide-ranging discussions. He went to France in 1919 to study sociology and literature. Li earned a Master's Degree. The Chinese community in France debated cultural and political strategies for the future of China, and Li joined in the debates. The Diligent Work-Frugal Study Movement, sponsored by Li Shizeng and his group of anarchists, arranged for Chinese students to work in French factories order to pay for their studies. Li did not formally join the group, but took part in some of their activities. Li had more contact with French families than most of the Work-Study students did, and he contributed his time to tutor them. Li recalled in his memoirs that many of the students were \\"provincial\\" and that he had to show them how to eat bread, drink wine, and wear western clothes instead of their Chinese padded jackets. In time, he became discouraged at their lack of motivation. Li and his friends Zuo Shunsheng and Zeng Qi became alarmed at the spread of Marxism among the students, such as Zhou Enlai, who became radicalized and joined the Communist Party. In December 1923, Li and other Chinese students founded the Youth Party in Paris. They proclaimed that their objective was \\"internally eliminating the national robbers [the Communists and warlords] and externally resisting the foreign powers.\\" The original name was the Chinese Nationalist Youth Corps (Guojiazhuyi qingniantuan), though the word \\"Youth\\" did not refer to the age of the founders, but was rather a reference to the \\"Young Turks\\" in Turkey upon whom the new party was modelled. Li's later account of the influence of the Comintern on Chinese students in Europe in his memoir Xuedunshi huiyilu (Memoirs from the Xuedun Study) has been widely accepted as lively and accurate, but the American historian Marilyn Avra Levine's research found that his account of Marxist developments contained errors of fact and interpretation. Third Force politics in China On their return to China, Li and other leaders organized the Chinese Youth Party in Shanghai. The CYP held its First Party Congress in 1926, but the new Nationalist Government of Chiang Kai-shek outlawed the party and arrested many members when they refused to support the GMD after the breakup of the United Front. Li fled to Sichuan, where the CYP had connections with the provincial government. Although leftists accused Li's CYP of being a \\"fascist\\" because of its strong anti- communism and nationalistic programs, Li and his colleagues insisted that their support of the Nationalist government was contingent on its support for democratic programs. Li and Zhang Junmai, a close follower of Liang Qichao, collaborated on a journal, Xin Lu (New Way), for which Zhang raised most of the money and Li wrote most of the content. The journal favored democracy, civil rights, national autonomy, unification, and raising the standard of living for workers and farmers. Zhang's writings focused on criticizing the Nationalist while Li's target was the Communists. The CYP also organized a training institute for young party workers in which Li played a major role. Li (far right) with China Democratic League Members and Zhou Enlai (center) Nanjing, 1946 Although Chiang Kai-shek's police harassed the leadership of the CYP and drove it underground, in 1937, the CYP joined the anti-Japanese United Front to support the national government. In the early years of the war, the Youth Party became the third largest party, after the Nationalists and the Communists. One informed observer, however, called the party organization \\"extremely weak\\" because most members were either personal friends of Zhang Junmai, many of whom had also been followers of Liang Qichao, or former students of Li or his friends. Li visited Shanxi province in brief hope that its military leader, Yan Xishan and his program of military and industrial development could be a base for CYP organizing, but returned wondering how this \\"barren land with its impoverished people\\" could \\"manage to build up a model province in the North?\\" Following the end of the war, Li continued to be a prominent member of the CYP, but did not have the high position he once held. The Party joined the China Democratic League, an alliance of smaller parties allied neither to the ruling Nationalists or the Communists. Li was a China delegate at the New York opening meeting of the United Nations in 1945, then in 1947 again withdrew his support of Chiang Kai-shek, and moved to Hong Kong. He remained there until moving to Taiwan in the 1960s, where he died in 1991.

Early life Jacob Van Lathem was the second son of the miniaturist Lieven van Lathem. He probably received his training from his father and from 1490 to 1493 he was employed by John II of Portugal. In 1493 he joined the Guild of Saint Luke in Antwerp and in 1494 he was appointed by Philip the Fair as \\"valet de chambre et peintre Monsignor\\". He was often involved in the decoration of churches and palaces, and thus worked equally well in Ghent, Brussels and Antwerp, but also in Spain, where he accompanied his clients on several trips. Travel He accompanied Philip the Fair on his trip to Spain from 1502 to 1503, also, from the documentation it appears that his brother Lieven van Lathem the Younger, the goldsmith, was part of the company. In 1506, he accompanied Philip again when traveling to Spain to be recognized as king consort of Castile. After the death of Philip on September 25, 1506 in Burgos, Jacob returned to the Netherlands. There he was in the service of Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, and he worked for the court of Margaret of Austria, Duchess of Savoy. From 1517-1520 he accompanied Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor on his trip to Spain. From 1522 to 1528 he went again with Charles V for the last time to Spain. Works Jacob van Laethem seems to have been involved in major projects of ceremonial decoration. In 1497 for instance, he was responsible for the decoration of the church Paleis op de Koudenberg on the occasion of the requiem masses sung in memory of John of Aragon, the Crown Prince of Aragon and Castile. Three years later in 1500, he worked as a decorator at the ceremonies at the death of Albert III, Duke of Saxony, was involved in the decoration of the Saint Bavo Cathedral in Ghent, then St. Janskerk, for the celebration of the baptism of Charles V on 7 March 1500, and executed a manuscript for Maximilian I. There have been preserved in the √âcaussinnes-Lalaing Castle four works that would have been donated by the Spanish court. The subjects of the works are: * Meeting of Philip the Fair and Ferdinand II of Aragon in Remesal * A bullfight in Benavente * A \\"juego de ca√±as\\" in Valladolid * The funeral of Philip the Fair in Burgos There are a number of his portraits also found in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, Windsor Castle and the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium.

Aristy has been elected senator for La Altagracia 7 times in a row: 1990, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010, 2016. Nevertheless, he has not been senator all those years: he resigned in the 1998-2002 period, he resigned in 1999, and he did not sworn in 2002 and 2006 leaving his senatorship to close friends; while he was chairman of the League of Dominican Municipalities (from 1999 to 2010). In 2010 he was threatened with impeachment and political disqualification if he left his senatorship to a friend again; he left his office in the League to a cousin of him and decided to sworn on 10 November 2010, nearly three months after August the 16th, the date marked by the constitution to do so. He has been described as one of the least laborious senators.

They began with the French translation by Antoine Galland (titled Les mille et une nuits, finished in 1717). Galland's translation was essentially based on a medieval Arabic manuscript of Syrian origins, supplemented by oral tales recorded by him in Paris from a Maronite Arab from Aleppo named Hanna Diyab. The first English translation appeared in 1706 and was made from Galland's version; being anonymous, it is known as the Grub Street edition. It exists in two known copies kept in the Bodleian Library and in the Princeton University Library. Since then several English reissues appeared simultaneously in 1708. As early as the end of the 18th century the English translation based on Galland was brought to Halifax, Montreal, Philadelphia, New York and Sydney. Galland-based English translations were superseded by that made by Edward William Lane in 1839‚Äì41. In the 1880s an unexpurgated and complete English translation, The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night, was made by Richard Francis Burton. The original scattered Arabic texts were collected in four corpuses: the so-called Calcutta I or the Shirwanee Edition (1814‚Äì18, 2 volumes), Bulaq or the Cairo Edition (1835, 2 volumes), Breslau Edition (1825‚Äì38, 8 volumes) and Calcutta II or the W.H. Macnaghten Edition (1839‚Äì42, 4 volumes). Some translations starting from Galland were censored due to lewd content. French translations =Galland= Galland based his translation on what is now known as the Galland Manuscript, a three-volume (or perhaps once four-volume) manuscript from the fourteenth or fifteenth century now kept in the National Library of France. Galland's translation altered the style, tone and content of the Arabic text. Designed to appeal, it omitted sophisticated or dark elements while enhancing exotic and magical elements and became the basis of most children's versions of One Thousand and One Nights. =Mardrus= In 1926‚Äì1932 a lavishly decorated 12-volume edition of J. C. Mardrus' translation, titled Le livre des mille nuits et une nuit, appeared. Soviet and Russian scholar Isaak Filshtinsky, however, considered Mardrus' translation inferior to others due to presence of chunks of text, which Mardrus conceived himself to satisfy the tastes of his time. According to Robert Irwin, \\"Mardrus took elements which were there in the original Arabic and worked them up, exaggerating and inventing, reshaping the Nights in such a manner that the stories appear at times to have been written by Oscar Wilde or St√©phane Mallarm√©\\". In response to criticism of his translation by academic Arabists, Mardrus promised to produce a tome of learned commentary and justificatory pieces which he, however, failed to do. English translations Unlike the Grub Street version, Jonathan Scott made the first literal translation of Galland. Titled The Arabian Nights Entertainments, it appeared in 1811. Then Henry Torrens translated the first fifty nights from Calcutta II, which were published in 1838. Having heard that Edward William Lane began his own translation, Torrens abandoned his work. Lane translated from the Bulaq corpus. He declared that \\"Galland has excessively perverted the work\\". According to Lane, Galland's \\"acquaintance with Arab manners and customs was insufficient to preserve him always from errors of the grossest description\\". Working with the Bulaq corpus, Lane occasionally cross-checked against Calcutta I and Breslau corpus. His translation, however, became incomplete. In 1923 a translation by Edward Powys Mathers based on the French translation by J. C. Mardrus appeared. Another translation attempt was made by John Payne (The Book of the Thousand Nights and One Night, 1882‚Äì84). He, however, printed just 500 copies for private circulation and ceded the work to Richard Francis Burton. Burton's translation (The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night, 1885‚Äì88) enjoyed a huge public success, but at the same time was criticized for its reportedly archaic language and excessive erotic details. According to Ulrich Marzolph, as of 2004, Burton's translation remains the most complete version of One Thousand and One Nights in English. It is also generally considered as one of the finest unexpurgated translations from Calcutta II. It stood as the only complete translation of the Macnaghten or Calcutta II edition (Egyptian recension) until the Malcolm C. and Ursula Lyons translation in 2008. German translations In 1825 a Galland-based translation was made by Maximilian Habicht. Later, however, Duncan Black MacDonald showed that the Tunisian provenance of a manuscript Habicht claimed to use during the translation was a forgery which Habicht committed himself. In 1839‚Äì1842 One Thousand and One Nights were translated into German by Gustav Weil. In 1895‚Äì1897 Max Henning published another German translation in 24 small volumes; the first seven volumes were based on the Bulaq edition, while volumes 18‚Äì24 were largely translated from Richard Francis Burton. In 1912‚Äì13 another translation was made by Felix Paul Greve. In 1921‚Äì1928 Enno Littmann produced a six-volume translation of the whole One Thousand and One Nights on the basis of Calcutta II into German, including the poetry. At the same time he translated one lewd portion into Latin, not German. Nonetheless, Isaak Filshtinsky considered Littmann's translation to be \\"the most complete and accomplished\\". Robert Irwin called it \\"the best German translation\\". Dutch translations There have been several Dutch translations made from the French editions of Galland and Mardrus.Richard van Leeuwen (1999). De wereld van Sjahrazaad. . In 1999 the final volume of \\"De vertellingen van duizend-en-√©√©n nacht\\" was published; the first an so far only Dutch translation from the Arabic texts by Dr. Richard van Leeuwen. For his translation Van Leeuwen used the Bulaq-edition (Cairo 1835), the Calcutta-edition (1842) and the edition by Mahdi (Leiden 1984).http://bulaaq.nl/literatuur/105-de-vertellingen-van-duizend-en-een- nacht. Accessed 16 May 2017. Italian translation In 1949 Arabist Francesco Gabrieli, who headed the team of anonymous translators, produced the four- volume Italian translation, based on Bulaq collated with Calcutta II. Russian translations The first Russian translation of One Thousand and One Nights was made by Alexey Filatyev in 1763‚Äì1774. It was based on Galland's translation and consisted of 12 volumes. Later Russian translations were also based on European translations. For instance, a three-volume translation by Yulia Doppelmayr (1889‚Äì1890) was based on Galland, the six-volume translation by Lyudmila Shelgunova (1894) was based on that by Edward William Lane and an anonymous translation (1902‚Äì1903) was based on Mardrus. The first Russian translation directly from the Arabic source (from Calcutta II) was made by Mikhail Salye and published in eight volumes by Academia in 1929‚Äì1939. Salye also translated into Russian seven tales not contained in Calcutta II (from the manuscript in the National Library of Russia). Spanish translations The stories about Sinbad the Sailor were translated into Spanish already in 1253. Older Spanish translations were made particularly by Pedro Pedraza (from Galland), Vicente Blasco Ib√°√±ez (from Mardrus), Eugenio Sanz del Valle, and Luis Aguirre Prado, Alfredo Dom√≠nguez (from Mardrus). More accurate translations were made by the Arabists Juan Vernet and Rafael Cansinos Ass√©ns. Chinese translations A selection of stories from One Thousand and One Nights, titled Yi Qian Ling Yi YeÔºà‰∏ÄÂçÉÈõ∂‰∏ÄÂ§úÔºâ appeared in 1900. In 1906 a four- volume translation was made by Xi RuoÔºàÂ•öËã•Ôºâ, published in Shanghai. In the 1930 new translations, primarily from Bulaq, appeared under the title Yi Qian Ling Yi Ye. In that period a five-volume translation by Na XunÔºàÁ∫≥ËÆ≠Ôºâ was made. In the 1950s Na Xun produced another, three-volume translation titled Yi Qian Ling Yi Ye. In 1982 a six-volume Beijing edition of Na Xun was published. It became the source of the 1980s two-volume translation titled Tian Fang Ye TanÔºàÂ§©ÊñπÂ§úË≠öÔºâ, which appeared in Taipei. Japanese translations One Thousand and One Nights appeared in Japanese in as early as 1875 ‚Äì the two-volume translation, made by , was titled and published by in Tokyo. In the preface Nagamine wrote that he used G. F. Townsend's The Arabian Nights's Entertainments, which was based on Jonathan Scott's English translation of Galland. Nagamine also used Edward William Lane's English translation as a supplement. The second Japanese translation by Inoue Tsutomu, titled Zensekai ichidai kisho (The Most Curious Book in the Whole World), appeared in 1883 and became more popular than Nagamine's. Subsequently other Japanese translations were made, but the first complete Japanese translation from Arabic was published in 1976‚Äì92 by Shinji Maejima and Ikeda Osamu, in nineteen volumes (titled Arabian Naito). Hebrew translations In the years 1947-1971 Arabist Yosef Yoel Rivlin produced a 32-volume Hebrew translation, based mainly on Bulaq. A selection of stories, translated by Hanna Amit-Kohavi, appeared in two volumes, in the years 2008 and 2011, under the title Leylot Arav. Bosnian translations In the year 1999 4-volume of Bosnian translation was published. Bulaq version was translated by Esad Durakovic during the siege of Sarajevo.

Built in the early 19th century, it spent a period as a hotel before converting to a public house. It was one of the last public houses in the country to not include a bar counter when one was fitted in 2018. The public house, and former hotel, are named after local land owning family, the Milbanks, who have recently taken over the license. History The building dates back to the early 19th century and it opened as the Milbank Hotel in 1860. In the early 1900s, it was refurbished a public house, but unusually for English pubs it did not include a bar counter. Instead, drinks would be fetched directly from the cellar by the staff. However, a bar was put in place in 2018 by the current landlord - at the time there were only eight remaining pubs without a bar in England. Due to this change, the Campaign for Real Ale have put the pub's \\"unspoilt\\" status under review. It had previously been on the Campaign for Real Ale's National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors. The building is made of stone, with a slate roof. There are three rooms on the ground floor, a domino room, a tap room and a dining room. The dining room was historically used for collections of rents from tenants of the land in the 19th century. Few different landlords have run the Millbank arms, between 1860 and 2018, only three different names have been on the license above the door. It had been run by the Turner family between 1939 and 2018, before being taken over by Sir Edward Milbank.

He was assassinated in 1991; the man convicted of his murder, and the murder of two assembly members, was sentenced to a total of 70 years in prison in 2008, after being extradited to Croatia from Australia. Early life Josip Tvrtko Reihl-Kir was born in Siraƒç, Croatia, Yugoslavia, the son of a Slavonian German (Danube Swabian) father and a Croatian mother, both Yugoslav Partisans during World War II in Yugoslavia. He worked as a teacher at the gymnasium in Osijek, and in 1981 became a police officer. From 31 July 1990 until his death, he was chief of the Osijek police station. Role in the Croatian War of Independence The border between Croatia and Serbia was the site of significant ethnic tension after war broke out in 1991. As the police chief in Osijek, Reihl-Kir managed to keep the peace in that area. When barricades were built by Nationalists, Reihl-Kir usually went unarmed to negotiate with them. He would approach barricades with his shirt pulled up above his waist to show that he had no weapons on him. Reihl-Kir offered to keep Croatian paramilitary forces outside of areas inhabited by ethnic Serbs, and in return, he asked Serb leaders to remove the barricades surrounding those locations. The Serbs always agreed as they trusted Reihl-Kir.Ejub ≈†titkovac, \\"Croatia: The First War\\", pp. 157-59, Burn This House: The Making and Unmaking of Yugoslavia (eds. Jasminka Udovicki, James Ridgeway; Duke University Press, 2000)Conflict in the Former Yugoslavia, ed. John B. Allcock, p. 20 (ABC-Clio Inc, 1998) To ensure that the agreement was kept, Croatian paramilitary forces were infiltrated by Reihl- Kir's agents. In April 1991, a group of three senior members of the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (known under its Croatian acronym HDZ), including Gojko ≈†u≈°ak, told Reihl-Kir to guide them to the outskirts of the Croatian Serb village of Borovo Selo. Although Reihl-Kir initially objected, he finally agreed to do so. To Reihl-Kir's shock, once at the village, the three men proceeded to fire three Armbrust rockets at the village. Although there were no injuries or deaths, the incident was shown on Serbian television as evidence of \\"unprovoked Croatian aggression against Serbs\\". After the incident, Reihl-Kir continued negotiations with Serb separatists to the annoyance of the ruling HDZ. On 1 May 1991, following an incident where Croatian policemen entered Borovo Selo, Reihl-Kir became involved when he contacted Vuka≈°in ≈†o≈°koƒáanin, the commander of the Serb forces in the village, who confirmed the incident and said the police had shot at members of the local population, wounding one. Reihl-Kir failed to secure the release of two officers who were captured following the incident. Reihl-Kir and Vinkovci police chief Josip D≈æaja concluded that a rescue party should be sent to Borovo Selo. Following this, the Battle of Borovo Selo took place, Reihl-Kir openly protested HDZ politicians' obstruction of his efforts to broker peace between the two sides. SAO Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia was proclaimed on 25 June 1991. Assassination After threats had been made to his life, Reihl-Kir asked the Minister of Internal Affairs Josip Boljkovac to transfer him \\"anywhere else\\". Boljkovac agreed to move Reihl-Kir to the capital, Zagreb. On 1 July 1991, Reihl-Kir was assassinated the day before he was due to be transferred. In Tenja, as he was heading to 'one last' negotiation, his car was fired on by an AK-47, 16 bullets hit Reihl-Kir, killing him instantly. Following the assassination, the suspected killer Antun Gudelj, a former policeman with dual Australian‚ÄìCroatian nationality, fled to Australia. Gudelj was a Croatian extremist who had been disarmed by Reihl-Kir shortly before. Reihl-Kir's widow, Jadranka, lobbied vigorously for justice for her husband. In 2007, Australia extradited Gudelj to Croatia for the murders of Reihl-Kir and two associates, Milan Kne≈æeviƒá and Goran Zobund≈æija, in Tenja in 1991. The first trial resulted in an acquittal, and a second trial verdict was overturned by the country's Supreme Court. At a third trial in 2008, Gudelj was sentenced to 20 years in prison for the murder of Reihl-Kir, and a further 50 years in prison for the murders of Reihl-Kir, Kne≈æeviƒá, Zobund≈æija and another charge., 24sata.hr; accessed 21 January 2016.

His niece is multiple Olympic gold medalist swimmer Katie Ledecky. Biography Ledecky was born in 1958 in New York City, the son of a Czechoslovakian immigrant who came to America eleven years prior to study English at Rutgers University. Growing up in Queens and Brooklyn, he became a New York Yankees fan. After moving in 1972 to Greenwich, Connecticut, Ledecky attended Greenwich High School, with extracurricular work on his school paper that would have earned Ledecky a journalism scholarship at Vanderbilt University if his father had not insisted on his son attending an Ivy League school. Ledecky thus pursued business administration at Harvard University, continuing his reporter work at The Harvard Crimson and college radio station WHRB. Ledecky earned his bachelor's degree in 1979 and completed a Master of Business Administration in 1983, which was followed by a series of venture capital-type jobs. After being dismissed from Steelcase in 1994, Ledecky decided to open his own company in the office supplies business. Backed by a number of Harvard alumni, U.S. Office Products was founded in 1994, and had its initial public offering one year later. By the time Ledecky left U.S. Office Products in 1998, his fortune was estimated at $200 million. =Sports ownership= In 1998, Ledecky nearly purchased a share of the Cincinnati Reds before getting his bid matched by Carl Lindner, and also bid on the Los Angeles Dodgers. Eventually he partnered with America Online executive Ted Leonsis to found Lincoln Holdings, who purchased the National Hockey League's Washington Capitals and a minor share of the National Basketball Association's Washington Wizards. Ledecky still got interested in higher shares of sports franchises, partnering with Steve Stotland in 2000 to bid on the Montreal Canadiens (he lost out to Colorado businessman George Gillett Jr.). In 2001, with Ledecky sold his 24-percent stake in Lincoln Holdings, originally worth $58 million, back to Leonsis for more than $70 million. Following an unsuccessful bid at the Oakland Athletics in 2002, Ledecky headed one of the groups intent on purchasing the Washington Nationals from Major League Baseball, eventually losing to Ted Lerner. On October 2014, Ledecky and former Harvard roommate Scott D. Malkin entered a deal to purchase the New York Islanders from Charles Wang. They became minority owners during a two-year transition period before getting majority shares by 2016.

Azar, et al. (previously v. Price, et al.; originally v. Burwell, et al., also known as the House Republicans' lawsuit against President Obama) was a lawsuit in which the United States House of Representatives sued departments and officials within the executive branch, asserting that President Barack Obama acted illegally in his implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The lawsuit was touted by House Speaker John Boehner, and asserted that President Obama exceeded his constitutional authority in delaying the implementation of the employer mandate of the Affordable Care Act and also addressed \\"Republican opposition to an estimated $175 billion in payments to insurance companies over the next 10 years as part of a cost-sharing program under the healthcare law.\\" U.S. District Judge Rosemary M. Collyer ruled that the cost-sharing program was unconstitutional for spending money that has not been specifically provided by an act of Congress, but concluded that Congress had in fact authorized that program to be created. The judge also found that Congress had provided authority to cover the spending for the tax credits to consumers who use them to help afford health coverage. The judge enjoined further cost- sharing payments, but stayed the order pending appeal, to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The case ended in a settlement before the Circuit Court. History The chief architects of the lawsuit were Florida International University law professor Elizabeth Price Foley and lawyer David B. Rivkin.Ian Tuttle, The Lawyers Behind the Lawsuit Against Obama, http://www.nationalreview.com/article/382021/lawyers-behind- lawsuit-against-obama-ian-tuttleElizabeth Price Foley and David B. Rivkin, \\"Can Obama's Legal End-Run Around Congress Be Stopped?\\", Politico (January 15, 2014). The lawsuit was authorized to challenge the actions by the President or other executive branch officials inconsistent with their duties under the Constitution, under Article II, section 3 of the Constitution, to \\"take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\\" Foley testified in February 2014 before the House Judiciary Committee, providing a detailed four-part \\"roadmap\\" outlining how she believed the House could obtain \\"institutional\\" standing to assert an institutional injury.Testimony of Elizabeth Price Foley, \\"Enforcing the President's Constitutional Duty to Faithfully Execute the Laws\\" (February 26, 2014). Her subsequent testimony, in July 2014, before the House Rules Committee, provided further detail about her legal theory on both standing and the merits of a challenge based on the President's asserted failure to faithfully execute the law.Written Statement of Elizabeth Price Foley, \\"Providing for authority to initiate litigation for actions by the President inconsistent with his duties under the Constitution of the United States\\" (July 16, 2014). On July 30, 2014, the House by a party-line vote of 225 to 201 approved a simple resolution to move forward with a lawsuit to force the President to impose penalties on companies who failed to provide health care coverage for their employees. All 225 votes in favor of filing the lawsuit were from Republicans, while 5 Republicans voted with 196 Democrats in opposition.Jeremy W. Peters, \\"House Votes to Sue Obama for Overstepping Powers\\", The New York Times (July 30, 2014). The vote authorized the initiation of \\"litigation for actions by the President or other executive branch officials inconsistent with their duties under the Constitution of the United States\\". On August 25, the House of Representatives retained the services of David Rivkin at a rate of $500 per hour with a cap of $350,000 for work on the lawsuit until January 2015. It was speculated that because the delay of the employer mandate will end by January 2015, the lawsuit, if filed, will likely become moot by then. It was speculated that the plaintiff would choose to file either in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (where Congress is physically located), or in a district that is politically hostile to Obama, on the theory that a lawsuit brought on behalf of the House could be brought where any House member lives. It was noted, however, that conservative judges tend to construe standing issues narrowly, and would therefore be more likely to dismiss the case. The case was ultimately filed in the District of Columbia. After the first two law firms hired to file the suit quit, the House GOP leadership was said to be exploring other options. On November 18, 2014, it was reported that Jonathan Turley, a law professor at the George Washington University Law School had been hired to prosecute the litigation.Lauren French, \\"GOP hires legal scholar to oversee Obama lawsuit\\", Politico.com (November 18, 2014).

Texas). Rulings =Motion to dismiss lawsuit= The Obama administration challenged the plaintiff's lawsuit on the issue of standing, and asked that the lawsuit be dismissed. On September 9, 2015, Judge Collyer ruled that the House of Representatives does not have standing to sue secretaries Burwell and Lew for improperly amending the healthcare law. Judge Collyer also ruled that the House of Representatives does have standing to pursue the claims that the secretaries violated the Constitution by spending funds Congress did not appropriate. The Obama Administration vowed to appeal the ruling, calling it \\"unprecedented\\", and describing the case as \\"just another partisan attack\\". =Ruling on the merits= On May 12, 2016, Judge Collyer granted summary judgment in favor of the House of Representatives on the merits of the case, saying that the cost-sharing program under the Affordable Care Act, as implemented since January 2014, has been spending money that Congress did not approve. Such spending was unconstitutional because no money can be taken out of the federal treasury if it has not been specifically provided by act of Congress. Judge Collyer criticized the government's arguments in favor of the cost-sharing reimbursements as \\"most curious and convoluted\\", adding its \\"mother was undoubtedly necessity\\". She did, however, conclude that Congress had in fact authorized that program to be created. The judge also found that Congress had provided authority to cover the spending for the tax credits to consumers who use them to help afford health coverage. Judge Collyer enjoined reimbursements under the ACA until a valid appropriation was in place, but stayed the injunction. Accordingly, the subsidies were allowed to continue, pending appeal, which was filed on July 16, 2016. =Stay of proceedings= On December 5, 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit stayed further proceedings in the case at the request of the House of Representatives. Motions to govern further proceedings in the case were due February 21, 2017. The case was subsequently stayed further with status updates every three months. On August 1, 2017, the appeals court granted a request from 17 states plus D.C. to intervene in the lawsuit and held the case in abeyance until October 30, 2017. = Settlement = On December 15, 2017, a settlement was agreed to which dismissed the appeal and dissolved the injunction of the lower court. In effect, it left in place the decision that the House had the standing to bring the suit, but would prevent it from being binding in future such cases, and eliminated the injunction that prohibited the cost-sharing reduction payments so that a future administration could theoretically resume the payments. The Trump administration had previously decided to voluntarily terminate the cost-sharing reduction payments in October. Reactions The action was noted to be \\"the first time either the House or Senate as an institution has brought a lawsuit against a president over enforcement of the law\\",Billy House and Matt Berman, \\"House Votes to Move Forward on Lawsuit Against Obama\\", National Journal (July 30, 2014).Alex Rogers, \\"House Grants Boehner Authority to Sue Obama\\" Time (July 30, 2014): \\"The House of Representatives passed a bill Wednesday granting House Speaker John Boehner the authority to sue President Barack Obama, marking the first time the legislative branch has endorsed such a lawsuit\\". and the vote described as \\"a historic foray in the fight over constitutional checks and balances\\".Michael A. Memoli, \\"GOP-led House votes to sue Obama in first-of-its-kind lawsuit\\", LA Times (July 30, 2014), stating: \\"The House vote to sue President Obama is the first such legal challenge by a chamber of Congress against a president and a historic foray in the fight over constitutional checks and balances\\". Political commentators speculated that the proposal of a lawsuit was designed to supplant efforts to impeach Barack Obama, based on Boehner's experience with the impeachment of Bill Clinton. The commentators also believed that on its merits the lawsuit had many shortcomings, and legal experts said that it was likely to fail. Observers noted that Republicans had previously pressed for legislation to delay both the employer and individual mandates the previous year, and that the day after voting to sue the President for what he saw as ignoring a law passed by Congress, Boehner called on the President to act on his own (despite inaction by Congress) to deal with the 2014 American immigration crisis. Obama responded to the plan to authorize a lawsuit against him, \\"Everyone sees this as a political stunt, but it‚Äôs worse than that because every vote they‚Äôre taking ... means a vote they‚Äôre not taking to help people.\\"Zachary A. Goldfarb, \\"Obama on GOP lawsuit: ‚ÄòEveryone sees this as a political stunt‚Äô\\", The Washington Post (July 30, 2014). Some prominent conservatives have ridiculed the lawsuit as being wasteful \\"political theater\\" and a \\"foolish move\\", while others criticized it for not going far enough, preferring to press for impeachment. Prior to the filing of the lawsuit, legal experts said that the lawsuit would likely fail for any of several different reasons, including lack of standing, presidential leeway to enforce laws, no easy legal remedy, and \\"impeachment\\" being a more applicable action.Why experts see little hope for GOP plan to sue Obama over law's delay; Los Angeles Times; David G. Savage; July 19, 2014 Similar lawsuits Florida orthodontist and Republican political activist Larry Kawa, and conservative legal advocacy group Judicial Watch, filed a similar lawsuit against President Obama in October 2013, claiming that he has \\"spent time and money to prepare for the Jan. 1, 2014\\" deadline for the employer mandate. Kawa claimed to have spent \\"100 hours preparing for the employer mandate\\", with an estimated \\"opportunity cost of $1.1 million\\". The orthodontist's lawsuit was dismissed in January 2014 for \\"lack of standing\\", but opening arguments for an appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit began on October 14, 2014. Kawa and Judicial Watch, like the backers of the House resolution, oppose the Affordable Care Act and have said they believe the law should be vigorously enforced to accelerate its failure. On July 29, 2014 Robert Muise filed a similar case for the American Freedom Law Center against President Obama. In May, 2015, the case was dismissed for lack of standing.

The extent of these lava flows was limited to the west and north by the rising Cascade Mountains and the Wenatchee Mountains. The lava flows extend east well beyond this image, but the Yakima Folds do not. The northernmost fold seen hereSome researchers include structures north of this image. (Frenchman Hills) ends at the Potholes Reservoir, another (Saddle Mountains) terminates just south of there, near the town of Othello (red circle). South of the Tri-Cities the rampart of the Horse Heaven Hills extends for a short distance past the Columbia River. The ends of these ridges mark the edge of a block of continental crust (part of the North American craton, indicated by the dashed orange line) that has resisted the tectonic compression that formed the ridges. The southernmost ridge of the Yakima Fold Belt is the Columbia Hills on the north side of the Columbia River. The pattern of folding continues with the Dalles-Umatilla Syncline just south of the Columbia River, and further into Oregon with the Blue Mountains anticline, which approximately parallels the Klamath-Blue Mountain Lineament that marks the southeastern edge of Siletzia (see geological map, below). The Yakima Fold Belt is also located on, and the orientation and spacing of some of the Folds influenced by, the Olympic-Wallowa Lineament (OWL), a broad zone of linear topographical features (dashed yellow line) extending from the Olympic Peninsula in northwestern Washington to the Wallowa Mountains in northeastern Oregon. Geology Yakima Fold Belt (thin purple lines with black diamonds) in context of major regional geological structures. Pale green is extent of the Columbia River Basalts. Thickest purple line is the OWL, thickest orange line corresponds to the craton edge in the shaded-relief map above. The Klamath-Blue Mountain Lineament (KBML, approximate location, extends to coast) is the southern edge of the marine basalts of Siletzia. BFZ, EDFZ, and MFZ are the Brothers, Eugene-Denio, and McLaughlin fault zones. It is the central portion of the Olympic-Wallowa Lineament, referred to as the Cle Elum-Wallula deformed zone (CLEW), constising of a series of generally east-trending narrow asymmetrical anticlinal ridges and broad synclinal valleys formed by folding of Miocene Columbia River basalt flows and sediments. In most parts of the belt the folds have a north vergence (Columbia Hills' south vergence is an exception) with the steep limb typically faulted by imbricate thrust faults. Fold lengths range from 1 km to 100 km with wavelengths from several kilometers to 20 km. A graben underlies nearly the entire Yakima Fold Belt and has been subsiding since Eocene time, and continues to sink at a slow rate. A 2011 report found aeromagnetic, gravity, and paleoseismic evidence that the Yakima Fold Belt is linked to active Puget Sound faults. Geodesy Geodetic studies of the Oregon Rotation show that Oregon is rotating about a point somewhat south of Lewiston, Idaho compressing the Yakima fold an average of 3 millimeters per year, and the Washington Pacific coast about 7 millimeters per year. Studies of the motion of the Yakima Fold Belt have been undertaken to evaluate seismic hazards at the Hanford Site.

Biography Perspective view looking southwest across Madison Street from Glenn's home in Mount Vernon Place, Charles Street, Baltimore, MD William Wilkins Glenn, the grandson of Judge John Glenn and son of Judge Elias Glenn, was born into an influential Baltimore family. Glenn incorporated parts of the family's business property into an estate in the mid-19th century. In 1888, years after Glenn's death, these properties became part of the suburban- Baltimore town Glen Burnie. Glenn was an active personality in the debate preceding the Civil War and active participant on behalf of the Confederacy during the war. Shortly before the start of the war, Glenn became part owner of Baltimore's Daily Exchange with the hope of spreading pro-southern public opinion throughout Maryland. The newspaper openly opposed President Abraham Lincoln's government.

They also employed unusual instrumentation for a band of their ilk; TQ playing trumpet, tenor sax and electric piano in addition to vocals. Hullabaloo released several LPs and EPs on various labels over the years, and changed from a quartet to a quintet and back again with varying lineups. Guitarist Kevin James joined the band in 1989 and was a mainstay, with TQ, until the band fizzled out in 1993. Recently, the band has released several archived live performances in digital format, and has announced a reunion show for WMBR's Pipeline show 25th Anniversary Festival. History = Early years: 1986‚Äì1989= Along with TQ and Sluggo, the original lineup included Lloyd Dyson III on bass and TQ's brother John Quinn on drums. Lloyd left the group within a few months to be replaced by Pete Foley. Both Lloyd and Pete appear on Hullabaloo's initial EP ‚Äì It's Not Enough to be Loud, You Have to Suck to. released by Gawdawful Records. Maximum Rock and Roll called it \\"Rowdy, dischordant, all hell-bent, psycho riotous musical mania.\\" Later in 1988, Hullabaloo collaborated with several other bands on Suffer This: A Compilation of Boston's Backwash, also on Gawdawful Records. Hullabaloo contributed three songs, including a cover of Judas Priest's Breakin' the Law. In 1989 Hullabaloo was signed to the Toxic Shock out of Tucson, Arizona, which featured albums by such far-flung bands as Hickoids and Skin Yard They released their full-length Album, Beat Until Stiff, and toured the United States, performing with labelmates Hickoids, Jesus Chrysler, and House of Large Sizes at various dates. Other notable shows included Cows in Minneapolis, The Hell Cows in Seattle and The Mudwimmin in San Francisco. The Seattle show brought Hullabaloo to the attention of the burgeoning Seattle music scene, where they met Daniel House of C/Z Records and Nirvana. Hullabaloo gained some notoriety during this time by occasionally playing naked, in public. Byron Coley mentions this in his review of Beat Until Stiff in SPIN Magazine. Also in 1989 the band participated in Boston's famed Rock 'n' Roll Rumble. They narrowly lost their night to ultimate runner-up Ultra Blue, though they were favorably reviewed for their performance. = Changing line-ups; 1990‚Äì1991 = At the end of 1989, Pete decided to leave the band. A search for a new bass player proved fruitless, so JQ volunteered to move to bass, Chris Rossow was added on drums, and Kevin James, formerly of Loving Six, joined as a second guitar. The lineup produced a more grunge sound, with the dual guitar attack. They also continued to explore odd meters and unusual song forms. Dead Serious was also released in Europe on the Musical Tragedies label, where it caused quite a stir due to the cover art, being censored in Germany. The label blocked out the genitalia, then offered to send a sticker to replace it, if sent pornography in the mail. Dead Serious and Beat Until Stiff were subsequently released together on a single CD. As the band prepared to tour in support of Dead Serious a dispute with drummer Chris Rossow occurred, causing him to leave the band. At this point John returned to drums and Sluggo took over bass duties. The tour, which started with dates in Canada, abruptly ended in Dayton, Ohio when the band ran out of money. Upon returning to Boston, this lineup recorded the LP Lubritorium for C/Z Records, after which Sluggo left the band for the west coast, where he founded the bands Ain't and The Grannies. Soon after John Quinn left as well. =Later years; 1992‚Äì1994= The band released the EP The United Colors of Hullabaloo on Musical Tragedies to coincide with a European tour, which began in November 1992. The lineup at this time consisted of TQ, Kevin James and newcomers Scott Ewen on bass and Matt Lyon on drums. In 1993 Sluggo gathered early, unreleased studio and live recordings together with the tracks from the It's Not Enough to be Loud... EP into a CD release entitled Regurgitator which was also released by Musical Tragedies. The European tour was a moderate success, grabbing the attention of Zuma Records. Zuma released Bruiser; Hullabaloo's final studio album in 1994. =Other recordings and recent activity= Over the years, the band released many songs on various compilations, notably Noise from Nowhere Vol. 2 on Toxic Shock which also included Hickoids, Sloppy Seconds, and House of Large Sizes, and Hard to Believe: Kiss Covers Compilation which featured Nirvana and The Melvins. All of Hullabaloo's recordings have been re-issued in digital format, by Wondertaker Records, and are available on all digital purveyors. On Dec. 4, 2012 the band released, in digital format, a recording of their first performance at CBGB 25 years to the day after it happened. They subsequently released a recording of the band performing on WBCN's Boston Emissions show in 1990. They are currently planning to release, digitally and on CD, live performances from WMBR's Pipeline show to coincide with a reunion show for Pipeline's 25th anniversary.

It is given as a product of prime ideals, together with associated exponents, which encode the ramification in the field extensions generated by the points of finite order in the group law of the elliptic curve. The primes involved in the conductor are precisely the primes of bad reduction of the curve: this is the N√©ron‚ÄìOgg‚ÄìShafarevich criterion. Ogg's formula expresses the conductor in terms of the discriminant and the number of components of the special fiber over a local field, which can be computed using Tate's algorithm. History The conductor of an elliptic curve over a local field was implicitly studied (but not named) by in the form of an integer invariant Œµ+Œ¥ which later turned out to be the exponent of the conductor. The conductor of an elliptic curve over the rationals was introduced and named by as a constant appearing in the functional equation of its L-series, analogous to the way the conductor of a global field appears in the functional equation of its zeta function. He showed that it could be written as a product over primes with exponents given by order(Œî) ‚àí Œº + 1, which by Ogg's formula is equal to Œµ+Œ¥. A similar definition works for any global field. Weil also suggested that the conductor was equal to the level of a modular form corresponding to the elliptic curve. extended the theory to conductors of abelian varieties. Definition Let E be an elliptic curve defined over a local field K and p the prime ideal of the ring of integers of K. We consider a minimal equation for E: a generalised Weierstrass equation whose coefficients are p-integral and with the valuation of the discriminant ŒΩp(Œî) as small as possible. If the discriminant is a p-unit then E has good reduction at p and the exponent of the conductor is zero. We can write the exponent f of the conductor as a sum Œµ + Œ¥ of two terms, corresponding to the tame and wild ramification. The tame ramification part Œµ is defined in terms of the reduction type: Œµ=0 for good reduction, Œµ=1 for multiplicative reduction and Œµ=2 for additive reduction. The wild ramification term Œ¥ is zero unless p divides 2 or 3, and in the latter cases it is defined in terms of the wild ramification of the extensions of K by the division points of E by Serre's formula :\\\\delta = \\\\dim_{Z/lZ} \\\\text {Hom}_{Z_l[G]}(P, M). Here M is the group of points on the elliptic curve of order l for a prime l, P is the Swan representation, and G the Galois group of a finite extension of K such that the points of M are defined over it (so that G acts on M) Ogg's formula The exponent of the conductor is related to other invariants of the elliptic curve by Ogg's formula: :f_\\\\mathbf{p} = u_\\\\mathbf{p} ( \\\\Delta ) + 1 - n \\\\ , where n is the number of components (without counting multiplicities) of the singular fibre of the N√©ron minimal model for E. (This is sometimes used as a definition of the conductor). Ogg's original proof used a lot of case by case checking, especially in characteristics 2 and 3. gave a uniform proof and generalized Ogg's formula to more general arithmetic surfaces. We can also describe Œµ in terms of the valuation of the j-invariant ŒΩp(j): it is 0 in the case of good reduction; otherwise it is 1 if ŒΩp(j) < 0 and 2 if ŒΩp(j) ‚â• 0. Global conductor Let E be an elliptic curve defined over a number field K. The global conductor is the ideal given by the product over primes of K : f(E) = \\\\prod_\\\\mathbf{p} \\\\mathbf{p}^{f_\\\\mathbf{p}} \\\\ . This is a finite product as the primes of bad reduction are contained in the set of primes divisors of the discriminant of any model for E with global integral coefficients.

Francisco was born in Valencia. There has been some confusion between Francisco and his father Rodrigo de Osona. Father and son worked closely together in their workshop in Valencia, therefore works are often attributed to both, although some assumptions are made that Francisco was more open to what was newer styles and forms in Italy. However, while the activity of Rodrigo ended with his death in 1518, Francisco died before him much younger in 1514. The second table of the Epiphany, preserved in London, is signed by \\"The teacher's son Rodrigo\\", in which, on the contrary, there seems to have more traditional trend seen in the works of the father.

Seward and his family owned a home in Auburn, New York which is now a museum; it was built in 1816 by Seward's father-in-law, Judge Elijah Miller. Seward married the Judge's daughter, Frances, in 1824 on the condition that they would live with Miller in his Auburn home. Seward made many changes to the home, adding an addition in the late 1840s and another one in 1866. When he died, Seward left the home to his son, William Seward, Jr.; it passed on to his grandson, William Henry Seward III, in 1920. At his death in 1951, it became a museum that opened to the public in 1955. Four generations of the family's artifacts are contained within the museum, located at 33 South Street in Auburn.

His position in the organization grew once he became a deputy and started speaking in defense of the Carlist cause in the Cortes.E.g. when intervening about the Carlist political leader, Marques de Cerralbo, assaulted in Valencia, see Escudero 2012, p. 213 With the number of Carlist deputies ranging from 5 to 10, Barrio, along Ces√°reo Sanz Escart√≠n, gradually became the most experienced MP and in the late 1890she declared in Cortes: nosotros no somos absolutistas, somos los menos absolutistas, rechazamos el absolutismo que condenamos con energ√≠a, reprobamos todos los absolutismos conocidos, somos partidarios de la libertad Cristiana, quoted after Escudero 2012, p. 214 assumed the post of the Carlist Cortes minority speaker (though the parliamentarian leadership was reserved for the senator, marqu√©s de Cerralbo); by the same time he emerged as the regional Leonese leader and the representative of Le√≥n in the nationwide structures.in 1896 Barrio was heading junta regional, see Escudero 2012, p. 285, and in 1899 was representing Le√≥n in a number of Carlist initiatives, like the Junta to commemorate conversi√≥n de Recaredo, see Escudero 2012, p. 293 He also became one of the movement's pundits, regularly publishing in the semi-official Carlist daily, El Correo Espa√±ol.Escudero 2012, p. 332 In case the Jefe Delegado, marqu√©s de Cerralbo, was out of the country, it was usually Mat√≠as Barrio replacing him.Agust√≠n Fern√°ndez Escudero, El XVII marqu√©s de Cerralbo (1845-1922).

Barrio wrote in El Correo Espa√±ol that Carlists should afford a sacrifice of going to the polls, see Escudero 2012, p. 415 Except Navarre, where thanks to Barrio's conciliatory strategy towards Integristas the Traditionalists gained almost a monopoly in political representation,following the Third Carlist War the Traditionalists were winning at best 3 of the 7 Navarrese mandates available; in 1903 they won 5, and in 1907 and 1910 they grabbed 6 out of 7 mandates, the remaining one ceded to the allied Conservatives; their domination was broken in 1918, when they slipped to 3 mandates again in other regions of Spain these efforts remained rather fruitless. Ready to take the blame Barrio submitted his resignation, which was rejected by Carlos VII.Escudero 2012, p. 416 His endeavours were finally crowned two years before death, in the 1907 elections, as the Traditionalists, mostly thanks to joining Solidaritat Catalana, recorded their largest electoral success so far and gained 16 mandates in the Cortes,there were 7 deputies elected from Vascongadas: Alcocer Valderrama (Alava), Castillo de Pineyro (Navarre), Dominguez Romera (Navarre), Feliu Perez (Navarre), Llorens Fernandez (Navarre), Vazquez de Mella (Navarre) and Diaz Aguado Salaberry (Gipuzkoa), 6 deputies from Catalonia: Alier Cassi (Lerida), Bofarull Palau (Gerona), Bordas Flaquer (Barcelona), Junyent Rovira (Vic), Llosas Badia (Gerona), Suelves Montagut (Tarragona) and 1 from Le√≥n: Barrio Mier himself (Palencia).

Prior to the creation of the BMAS, classes for amateur artists had been offered by the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences (BIAS), the Museum's parent organization. BIAS offered hands-on art classes dating back to 1841. The Brooklyn Museum Art School provided instruction for amateur artists as well until January 1985 when it was transferred to the Pratt Institute‚Äôs Continuing Education Division. History The Brooklyn Museum Art School title was first used in the 1941-42 annual report from the Brooklyn Museum, remaining separate from the Brooklyn Museum's Education Department, which was directed towards children. During World War II the Brooklyn Museum Art School offered limited classes in painting, photography and drawing. In 1945 the artist Augustus Peck became director of the school and expanded its offerings. As a result of the GI Bill the BMAS had very stable income and funding, allowing many prominent artists to teach or lecture at the school. Artists included Augustus Peck, William Baziotes, Max Beckmann, Ben Shahn, Raphael Soyer, and Reuben Tam. At its peak, the Brooklyn Museum Art School had almost 400 applicants. This number suffered as more institutions began to offer accredited programs in the fine arts during the late 1950s.

He participated in the 1921 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition following which he produced a geological map of the Everest region of Tibet. Early life and professional career Alexander Heron was born in Duddingston, Edinburgh on 31 July 1884, son of William Heron, a coal agent for William Baird & Co of Garthsherrie, who later became a macer (court usher), and Joan Heron, n√©e Macmillan. He graduated from University of Edinburgh in engineering in 1906 and in that year he joined the Geological Survey of India. In 1911, in South Stoneham, Hampshire, he married Margaret Kirsopp of Musselburgh and in 1915 they had a daughter, Marjorie Edgware Heron.Ancestry.co.uk Returning to study at the University of Edinburgh, he was granted his D.Sc. in 1919. He was elected fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1925 and, succeeding Sir Lewis Leigh Fermor, he became the Survey's director in 1936 until stepping down from that post in 1939. From 1934 to 1937 he was president of the Calcutta Geographical Society (which in 1951 became the Geographical Society of India). In 1948 Heron was geological advisor for Hyderabad. He continued publishing research papers for the Geological Survey into the 1950s and, after 23 years of geological survey in Rajasthan he published his magnum opus, \\"The Geology of Central Rajasthan\\", in 1953. He died in 1971 aged 86 while he was staying in the Nilgiri Hills of southern India. Mount Everest regional geological survey =1921 expedition= Background Heron's geological map of Everest region The 1921 Everest reconnaissance expedition was funded by the Royal Geographical Society, the Alpine Club and the Survey of India with a remit to explore the approaches to Mount Everest from Sikkim and through Tibet, and to investigate possible routes for climbing the mountain. Reaching the summit was not a primary objective. For geographical survey work the Survey of India appointed its own officers and the Geological Survey of India appointed Heron to conduct a widespread geological survey and to produce a map. Charles Howard-Bury led the expedition. Harold Raeburn and Alexander Kellas were to lead the climbing team but, after Kellas' sudden death on the walk-in, and Raeburn's illness requiring him to return to base, George Mallory effectively became lead climber. Henry Morshead led the survey work. Heron's travels Heron's party left Darjeeling on 19 May 1921. To begin with Mallory had found Heron dull in conversation but in the course of the long trek across the Tibetan plateau he formed a much better opinion. In letters home to his wife Ruth he wrote that Heron was a \\"solid treasure\\", was \\"cheerful and good-natured\\", and that although he was good at dealing with the porters he was no climber. Later, while exploring north of Everest, Mallory's photographs with one camera were ruined because he had been putting in the photographic plates back to front. Writing home he blamed Heron for not instructing him properly. Starting from the expedition's base at Tingri on 25 June, Heron set off south west towards the Kyetrak Glacier with Oliver Wheeler. Howard-Bury joined them later and while Wheeler surveyed on his own, they explored the area of the Nangpa La where Heron discovered marine fossils in the limestone at heights never thought possible. By 4 July they had moved to see Mallory and Guy Bullock in the Rongbuk valley and then they headed on north and then east to find a suitable base from which to explore the eastern approaches to Everest. They decided the Kharta valley was suitable. Heron separately surveyed from Kharta back to Tingri and went on to make several geological expeditions to the north. He returned to Kharta on 19 August after exploring, in very bad weather, a broad east-west region as far north as the Yarlung Tsangpo River. Heron visited the main party at Kharta on 14 September and then set off to explore Everest's eastern valleys taking no part in reaching the Lhakpa La and, beyond, the North Col. For Heron the expedition ended on 20 October when the group he was with arrived back in Darjeeling. Largely working alone, he had made geological investigations over and had produced the promised geological map. He also wrote the geological chapter for Howard-Bury's book about the expedition. Geological results Heron based his map on the topographical map that was being drawn by Morshead and his team, although for much of the time the region he was in had not yet been mapped so he had to transcribe his observations later. The scale was four miles to an inch (1:250,000). Heron discovered that the Tibetan plateau was intensely folded sedimentary Jurassic shale and Cretaceous limestone with an east-west strike with, he considered, the folding indicating movement from the north. The uppermost limestone, Cretaceous and later, contained fossils but the shale had little by way of fossils. Nearer to the mountains the shale was underlain by limestone (possibly Triassic or Jurassic) metamorphosed into crystalline form and into calcareous gneiss. In the vicinity of the high mountains the rock was biotite gneiss. The high peaks north west of Everest had granite intrusions and possibly the same would apply on Everest itself. He considered that the biotite gneiss was probably an igneous intrusion into the calcareous gneiss. There were no ores or minerals of commercial interest. The region surveyed was in Tibet from the Tsangpo in the north down to the Nepalese border. It included the basin of the Arun River, the region north and east of Everest, and in the west the headwaters of the Bhote Koshi flowing into Nepal. Heron considered that a river had once flowed east‚Äìwest just north of Himalaya, possibly joining the Tsangpo as a tributary. The Arun River flows southwards between Everest and Kangchenjunga and he thought that its headwaters had cut backwards and to the north until the east‚Äìwest river had been captured in the middle of its course. The Arun Gorge is deep as it cuts completely through the Himalayan ridge and for the origin of its upper part Heron was \\"unable to give an explanation\\". Complaint from Lhasa While the expedition was underway, on 28 September 1921, Charles Bell, who was in Sikkim as the British diplomatic representative to Tibet, received a telegram from the Tibetan prime minister passing on a complaint from the dzongpen of Shekar. The expedition had disturbed the monks at Rongbuk Monastery and, moreover, climbers had been digging up rubies, turquoises and other precious stones. Bell knew that no precious stones had been found but he was well attuned to Tibet culture and sympathetic with it so he understood the sensitivities. To make matters worse, a scarlet fever epidemic had indeed broken out in Tibet in late 1921. Heron's explanation was not helpful: Bell was infuriated and no official geologist, and certainly not Heron, would ever take part in an Everest expedition again. Moreover, officers of the Survey of India were also to be excluded. =1922 expedition= The Survey of India nominated Heron to accompany the 1922 expedition as geologist even though the Tibetan authorities had refused permission. Frederick Bailey (who in 1913 with Morshead, had explored the Tsangpo Gorge) had replaced Charles Bell as Britain's political advisor for Tibet and he continued with Bell's decision not to allow geologists.Bailey had himself made secretive visits to Tibet in earlier years. So, even though Heron joined the party at Kalimpong hoping for a last-minute reprieve, the Foreign Office in London, not wanting to cause diplomatic difficulty, instructed Charles Bruce, the leader of the expedition, not to allow Heron to participate ‚Äì he had to return to Darjeeling. Despite all this Heron's discoveries were to be the foundation for the unofficial later work of Noel Odell on the 1924 expedition and Lawrence Wager on the 1933 expedition.

She recorded her biggest win in the Washington, D.C.International in 1975, a year in which she became (and remains) the only filly since 1916 to finish placed in the Derby Stakes. As a two-year-old she won one minor race but showed promised when finishing sixth in the Grand Crit√©rium and third in the Prix des R√©servoirs. In the following year she won the Group Three Prix de la Grotte and was thereafter campaigned exclusively in Group One/ Grade I company. She won the Prix Saint-Alary and was placed in the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches, Epsom Derby, Irish Oaks and Prix Vermeille before ending her career with a win in the Washington, D.C.International. She had no success as a broodmare, producing only two foals. Background Nobiliary was a \\"strong, attractive\\" chestnut mare with a small white star bred in Kentucky by her owner Nelson Bunker Hunt. Her sire, Vaguely Noble, won the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in 1968 before becoming a successful breeding stallion whose best progeny included Dahlia, Exceller and Empery. Nobiliary's dam Goofed won four races and became a highly successful broodmare, also producing the outstanding racehorse and sire Lyphard and the Bowling Green Handicap winner Barcas. Nobiliary was sent to race in Europe where she was trained in France by Maurice Zilber. Racing career =1974: two-year-old season= Nobiliary ran four times as a two-year-old in 1974. After finishing third over 1400 metres on her racecourse debut she won a maiden race over 1700 metres at Longchamp Racecourse in September, beating Beautiful Sea by one and a half lengths. She was then moved up sharply in class and matched against colts when she contested France's most prestigious race for juveniles, the Grand Crit√©rium over 1600 metres at Longchamp on 13 October. Ridden by Maurice Philipperon she started at odds of 13/1 and finished sixth of the ten runners, nine lengths behind the winner Mariacci. On her final appearance of the season she finished third behind Dona Barod and Good Start in the Prix des R√©servoirs over the same course and distance. =1975: three-year-old season= Spring Nobiliary began her three- year-old season in the Prix de la Grotte over 1600 metres at Longchamp in April and won by a length from Lighted Glory, a filly who went on to finish fifth in the 1000 Guineas. On 4 May, Nobiliary, accompanied by her pacemaker Amata, started 3/1 second favourite for the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches over the same course and distance. Ridden by the British jockey Lester Piggott, she took the lead from Amata in the straight but was overtaken in the closing stages and was beaten one and a half lengths, with the odds-on favourite Broadway Dancer six lengths back in third place. The filly was then moved up in distance for the Prix Saint-Alary over 2000 metres on 25 May. Again ridden by Piggott she started the 8/5 favourite and recorded her first Group One win, beating Lighted Glory by two lengths. Summer In a highly unusual move, Nobiliary was then send to England and was matched against colts for the 196th running of the Epsom Derby, a race in which no filly had finished in the first three since Fifinella won a wartime version in 1916. Ridden by Yves Saint- Martin she ran on strongly in the straight to finish second to Grundy, three lengths behind the winner and four lengths clear of Hunza Dancer in third. Maurice Zilber later expressed the view that Nobilary could have won the race if Saint-Martin had made more use of the filly's stamina. Nobiliary was scheduled for a rematch with Ivanjica in the Prix de Diane but when the race was abandoned owing to industrial action by stable staff, she was rerouted to the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park Racecourse. As well as being matched against older horses for the first time, she was racing on firmer ground than she had previously encountered. She looked very unsettled before the start and after racing prominently for most of the race but looked outpaced in the closing stages and finished fifth behind the German horse Star Appeal. Nobiliary returned to one and a half miles for a clash with The Oaks winner Juliette Marny in the Irish Oaks at the Curragh Racecourse on 18 July. Piggott opted to ride Juliette Marny, the 5/2 favourite, whilst Nobiliary, ridden by Billy Pyers started at 3/1. Nobiliary moved into second place early in the straight but could make no further progress and eventually finished third, beaten a neck and two lengths Juliette Marny and Tuscarora. Autumn On her return from a summer break, Nobiliary started second favourite behind Ivanjica for the Prix Vermeille on 21 September, a race which also attracted the Oaks d'Italia winner Carnauba and the British filly May Hill, who defeated Juliette Marny in the Yorkshire Oaks. The finish of the race was similar to that of the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches with Nobiliary taking the lead in the straight before being outsprinted by Ivanjica and beaten one and a half lengths. The pair finished eight lengths clear of May Hill in third. In France's most prestigious horse race, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp on 5 October, she was coupled in the betting with Nelson Bunker Hunt's five-year-old mare Dahlia, and the pair started fourth in the betting on 8.75/1. Ridden by Pyers, she disputed the lead from the start before being overtaken 300 metres from the finish and eventually finished sixth behind Star Appeal. Pyers, who had been unseated by Nobiliary before the start, received some criticism for failing to exercise more restraint on the filly in the early stages. On 8 November Nobiliary and Dahlia started joint-second favourites for the 24th running of the Washington, D.C.International at Laurel Park Racecourse in Maryland. The market was headed by Snow Knight who had won the Epsom Derby in 1974, before being transferred to North America where he had won several major races including the Man o' War Stakes, Manhattan Handicap and Canadian International Championship. The other contenders included Star Appeal from Germany, Laomedonte from Italy, Comtesse de Loir and On My Way from France, Tsukisamu Homare from Japan and Shady Character representing the United States. With her intended jockey Yves Saint-Martin unable to ride at 117 pounds, Nobiliary was ridden by the Canadian Sandy Hawley. Hawley sent the filly into the lead from the start and set a very fast pace, with only Shady Character attempting to match her early speed: at one point the pair went seven lengths clear of the field making it appear to some observers that she was being employed as a pacemaker for Dahlia. Several challengers emerged on the final turn but Nobiliary rallied strongly in the straight and Comtesse de Loir emerged as her only serious danger. In the final strides Nobiliary edged away from the rail, slightly hampering Comtesse de Loir but prevailed to win by three-quarters of a length, with On My Way taking third place to complete a clean sweep of the places for French-trained horses. Assessment There was no International Classification of European two-year- olds in 1974: the official handicappers of Britain, Ireland and France compiled separate rankings for horses which competed in those countries. In the official French handicap, Nobiliary was rated fourteen pounds inferior to the top-rated Mariacci and twelve pounds below the top filly Broadway Dancer. The independent Timeform organisation gave her a rating of 112, nineteen pounds below Broadway Dancer. In their annual Racehorses of 1974, Timeform described her as certain to stay one and a half miles and \\"the type to do well at 3 yrs\\". In the official French handicap for 1975, Nobiliary was rated the second best three-year-old filly of the year behind Ivanjica. Timeform gave her a rating of 131, making her their third-best three-year-old filly behind Rose Bowl (133) and Ivanjica (132). Breeding record It was expected that Nobiliary would remain in training as a four-year-old but she never raced again after her win at Laurel Park and was retired to become a broodmare. She was unsuccessful in her new role, producing only two recorded foals: Winnsboro (a bay filly, foaled in 1979, sired by Youth) and Libillary (a bay colt, foaled in 1983, sired by Liloy) neither of whom made any impact as racehorses. At Nelson Bunker Hunt's dispersal sale in 1988, she was sold for $325,000 to the Allez France Stable, but never produced another foal.

A tender farewell to father and blind sister, Bertha, takes him to the road where he bids adieu to his sweetheart, Mary Fielding. There is then a lapse of three years and we find honest John Pereyhingle the husband of Dot. Mrs. Fielding has gotten into moderate straits and consents to the marriage of Old Tackleton, the grouch, to May. Of course this is repugnant to May whose heart is for Edward. Edward returning stops on the way at the inn where he learns of the approaching nuptials of Tackleton and May. Being a disguise from a strolling Merry Andrew, he goes in the garb of an old wayfarer on John‚Äôs cart to see Dot and find out the truth. John, prompted by Tackleton, watches the pair and not recognising Edward, assumes he is a lover and the first cloud shrouds the little home. Edward upon learning from Dot how inimical the match is to May resolves to carry off May, which he does with the assistance of Dot. They are married in the roadway just as the much perturbed Tackleton appears. Well, John discovers what a fool he has been in doubting Dot, Tackleton realises what an unpopular grouch he has been and decides to change, while Bertha and Old Caleb are overjoyed at the return of Edward.

Authorities accused Donnelly of being in possession of a mobile phone linked to the attacks. On 22 December of the same year the charges were dropped. In addition to Donnelly's March 2010 conviction, he has been charged with assaulting police officers on two other occasions. In both cases the charges were eventually dropped.

This was abolished following the Union with England, and since then most taxes in Scotland had been collected by the UK Government. Revenue Scotland was formed in 2012 as an administrative unit of the Scottish Government, in anticipation of it becoming responsible for collecting taxes devolved to the Scottish Parliament under the terms of the Scotland Act 2012. The Revenue Scotland and Tax Powers Act 2014, which established the legal basis for the operation of Revenue Scotland, was passed by the Scottish Parliament in August 2014. Revenue Scotland was founded on 1 January 2015, becoming the first Scotland-wide tax collection system in more than 300 years.. The Scotland Act 2016 devolved Air Passenger Duty and Aggregates Levy to the Parliament. However, devolution of Aggregates Levy has been delayed indefinitely due to long running legal issues surrounding the tax.

Early years Claude Dejoux was born on 23 January 1732 in Vadans, Jura. Descended from the Counts of Joux, Claude Dejoux was born into a family of poor farmers. He started work as a shepherd, but was soon apprenticed to a carpenter due to his love of sculpture. He was apprenticed to the sculptor Guillaume Coustou the Younger (1716‚Äì1777), where he met Pierre Julien (1731‚Äì1804). He became a close friend of Julien. Dejoux was accepted by the Academy in 1778, and in 1779 was named Academician. His morceau de r√©ception for the academy was a marble sculpture of Saint S√©bastien, high, now held in the Louvre. He became sculptor to King Louis XVI of France. Republic and empire Love and Friendship (1783) The French Revolution began in 1789. In 1792 Dejoux was made an adjunct professor. In 1795 he became a member of the newly formed Institut de France. He was commissioned by the French First Republic to make a sculpture of Calinat, which is now held by the Louvre. Dejoux was professor of David d'Angers, and supported him when he applied for a scholarship from the town of Angers. After Julien's death in 1804, Dejoux made a mausoleum ornamented with his portrait, which was erected in the garden of the Mus√©e des monuments fran√ßais. In 1815 this monument was transported to the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery. Dejoux was made a knight of the Legion of Honour. In 1805‚Äì07 he made a bronze statue to General Louis Desaix. The monument was erected in the Place des Victoires in 1810. It was destroyed in 1814 during the Bourbon Restoration. Claude Dejoux died on 18 October 1816 in Paris, aged 84.

White is an American archaeologist, an adjunct professor of Anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania, and executive director of the new Institute for Southeast Asian Archaeology. Her research primarily concerns decades-long multidisciplinary archaeological investigations in Thailand and Laos covering the prehistoric human occupation of the middle reaches of the Mekong River Basin. She is considered the world's leading expert on the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Ban Chiang, Thailand, and directs an archaeological fieldwork program in the Luang Prabang Province of Laos. She has become a strong advocate of cultural heritage preservation and has served as an expert witness in an antiquities trafficking case for the U.S. Department of Justice. Early life Joyce White initially settled on a career in archaeology when she observed an excavation at a medieval church and cemetery in England at the age of 15. While this initial incident inclined her towards a focus on Europe, this changed when she saw a photograph of Thailand during a professor's presentation on his excavation there in graduate school. She notes that \\"it was a vivid experience. I saw myself in that slide.\\" Despite discouragement from professors, she changed her focus to Southeast Asian archaeology.Localities in Thailand and Laos where Joyce White has conducted field research and/or studied recovered remains. Research and career White is a senior Southeast Asian archaeologist in the Greater Philadelphia area. She received her MA and PhD in Anthropology from the University of Pennsylvania and holds the position of Consulting Scholar at the University's Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. While working on her dissertation, she lived in Thailand doing field work for 20 months from 1979 to 1981. White founded the Institute for Southeast Asian Archaeology (ISEAA) in October 2013 in order to build upon the decades-long archaeological research programs in Thailand and Laos undertaken by the University of Pennsylvania. White is the current director of the Middle Mekong Archaeological Project and of the Ban Chiang Project (since 1982) at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. Ban Chiang Project Joyce White and Lung Li look over gathered plant specimens in 1981. White‚Äôs investigation of Southeast Asian prehistory began in the mid-1970s when, as a PhD student under the supervision of the late Chester Gorman, she ran the labs conducting post- excavation analysis of artifacts from Gorman‚Äôs excavations in northern and northeast Thailand. From 1976 she focused on the analysis of the metal age site of Ban Chiang, a site subsequently named in 1992 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In 1978 she initiated an ethnoecological research program in the Ban Chiang area studying the local understanding of indigenous natural resources with a special emphasis on native plants. While there, she compiled an ethnographic collection of everyday traditional material culture items (e.g., baskets, tools, pottery, etc.) for the Penn Museum. After conducting this field project in Ban Chiang village for nearly two years in 1979-1981, she returned to Philadelphia where, following Gorman‚Äôs premature death in June 1981, she curated the Smithsonian-produced traveling exhibition ‚ÄúBan Chiang: Discovery of a Lost Bronze Age‚Äù and authored its catalog. The exhibition was later installed in a branch of Thailand‚Äôs National Museum in Ban Chiang village and parts of it are still on display. In 1986, White completed her PhD thesis at Penn that revised the Gorman chronology for Ban Chiang. Since that time White‚Äôs career has centered on the multi-disciplinary investigation of the human past in Thailand and Laos. She continued with the analysis of the Ban Chiang site at Penn Museum as a Senior Research Scientist and later as an Associate Curator. In 1993 she founded the Friends of Ban Chiang to facilitate fund-raising to continue the post-excavation analysis and publication program. In the mid-1990s she was co-principal investigator of the Thailand Palaeoenvironment Project, which cored sediments from lakes in northeast, north, and south Thailand that for the first time in that country retrieved vegetation evidence from the terminal Pleistocene to the Late Holocene from each area. The first Ban Chiang monograph published in 2002 was on the human remains from the site and was authored by Michael Pietrusewsky and Michele Douglas. On February 9, 2010, White was honored by Her Royal Highness of Thailand Crown Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn at the opening of the new National Museum at Ban Chiang, Thailand. Middle Mekong Archaeological Project (MMAP) In 2010, MMAP undertook a test excavation at the Tham An Mah rockshelter in northern Laos. During the field season, evidence for Iron Age burials dating to about 2000 years ago, and Stone Age occupation dating back to about 13,000 years ago, was found in the rockshelter. In 2001, White initiated what was to become the first and so far only archaeological research program in Laos led by an American, the Middle Mekong Archaeological Project (MMAP). White has pursued larger Mekong regional questions raised by the original Ban Chiang excavations in Thailand and her work on the Thailand Palaeoenvironment Project. With seed funding from the National Science Foundation and the National Geographic Society in 2005, the Middle Mekong Archaeological Project (MMAP) has excavated and surveyed numerous sites along the Mekong and its tributaries in Luang Prabang province in northern Laos, with the goal of investigating early human settlement of the Mekong Valley.* J White, H. Lewis, B. Bouasisengpaseuth, B. Marwick & K. Arrell, 2009 Archaeological investigations in northern Laos: new contributions to Southeast Asian prehistory. Antiquity Vol 83 Issue 319 March 2009. From 2008-2013, during White‚Äôs tenure as Associate Curator for Asia at University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, she directed the Museum‚Äôs program to Strengthen Southeast Asian Archaeology, funded by the Henry Luce Foundation. In addition to surveys and cave excavations, a variety of scientific and capacity-building endeavors sought to enhance knowledge and skills among Asian and western archaeologists to lay the foundation for future development of archaeological research in the Middle Mekong Basin. By early 2010, 85 historic and prehistoric sites had been recorded by MMAP in Luang Prabang and four cave sites have been excavated, including Tham An Mah.Lewis, H., J. White, and B. Bouasisengpaseuth. 2015. \\"A buried jar site and its destruction: Tham An Mah Cave, Luang Prabang Province, Lao PDR,\\" in Advancing Southeast Asian archaeology 2013: selected papers from the First SEAMEO SPAFA International Conference on Southeast Asian Archaeology. Edited by N. H. Tan, pp. 72-82. Bangkok, Thailand: SEAMEO SPAFA Regional Centre for Archaeology and Fine Arts In 2013 several ancillary scientific studies were undertaken, including palaeoenvironmental research using speleothems led by a team from the University of California at Irvine, and population history research using modern human DNA led by a team from Oxford University. The Luce Program also included a year of intensive analysis of hundreds of pottery vessels excavated from Ban Chiang on loan to the Penn Museum as well as extensive development of a regional archaeological database that contains data from both the Ban Chiang and Lao research programs. Institute for Southeast Asian Archaeology (ISEAA) In 2013 White founded the ISEAA, which is dedicated to the multi- disciplinary investigation of Southeast Asia‚Äôs archaeological past in order to advance that knowledge for the benefit of scholars as well as the public. Due to strategic decisions to downsize its research staff, Penn Museum ended funding for its research program for Southeast Asian Archaeology in 2013. The new non-profit Institute was then created by White with initial support from several founding donors. The Institute‚Äôs objective is to continue the internationally renowned research and publication programs of the Ban Chiang Project and the Middle Mekong Archaeological Project (MMAP), in order to preserve for posterity the knowledge of the human past revealed by those pioneering research programs. ISEAA can also serve as a center for future research projects in Southeast Asian archaeology.  Recent scholarship  White‚Äôs scholarship has significantly influenced the scholarly discourse concerning the place of Southeast Asia in world prehistory, as well as public appreciation for Southeast Asian archaeology generally and for Ban Chiang in particular. A 2009 publication she co-authored with Dr. Elizabeth Hamilton has been described as providing an ‚Äúinnovative model of cultural transmission of metal technology [that is] a significant intellectual landmark in archaeometallurgy.‚Äù Recently, White, along with Elizabeth Hamilton, has been completing a four-volume Ban Chiang and Northeast Thailand metals monograph. The work presents metals and related evidence from four sites in northeast Thailand: Ban Chiang, Ban Tong, Ban Phak Top, and Don Klang. It is the second installment in the Thai Archaeology Monograph Series, published by the University of Pennsylvania Press and distributed for the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. The first volume of the metals monograph, published in 2018, discusses different viewpoints used to assess the materials at Ban Chiang and other Northeast Thai sites and reviews and critiques the current archaeological paradigm. It also introduces new archaeometallurgical paradigms for analyzing the materials found at these sites and their relation to ancient society, economics, and culture. The second volume, published in early 2019, explains the methodological and technical analyses for the metals, presents evidence from the four archaeological sites, and applies the paradigms from the first volume to support new insights for this evidence. Expert witness In the US federal investigation Operation Antiquity, which investigated an artifact smuggling ring especially dealing with Ban Chiang artifacts, White acted as an expert witness for the U.S. Department of Justice. In January 2008, 500 federal agents served warrants at 13 locations including several museums tied to the extensive ring. White was responsible for \\"authenticating more than 10,000 prehistoric Thai artifacts that had been smuggled from Thailand since about 2003.\\" Her testimony in the case argued the seized artifacts represented more than 150 times what had been scientifically excavated at Ban Chiang and similar sites. The case led to several convictions, fines, plea deals, and prison time for some smugglers. Some of the museums have returned to Thailand artifacts seized in the case.

(1785‚Äì1860) was an English nonconformist minister. Life Born in Oxford Street, London, on 27 September 1785, Redford was educated at Hoxton College and the University of Glasgow, where he matriculated in 1808 and graduated M.A. in 1811. In 1809 he was ordained in the Congregational ministry, and was admitted to the pastoral charge of the Independent congregation at Uxbridge in 1812. There he founded, and for some time ran, the Congregational Magazine. In June 1826 he succeeded Robert Vaughan in the ministry at Angel Street chapel, Worcester. In 1834 Redford was chosen president of the Congregational Union of England and Wales, and received from the University of Glasgow the honorary degree of LL.D., and the degree of D.D. was afterwards conferred upon him by Amherst University, Massachusetts. In 1856 he resigned his charge at Worcester, in poor health, and retired to Edgbaston, Birmingham, so as to be near his friend John Angell James. He died at his residence in Monument Lane, Edgbaston, on 20 May 1860. He was married and left a family. Works Redford composed the Declaration of the Faith, Church Order, and Discipline of the Congregational or Independent Dissenters that was adopted by the Congregational Union in 1833. He wrote also: * A Defence of Extempore Prayer, and of the Mode of Preaching generally adopted by the Calvinistic Dissenters, in reply to a Sermon preached by the Dean of Chester, London [1816]. Against Robert Hodgson. * The true Age of Reason: a candid Examination of the Claims of Modern Deism, containing a Demonstration of the Insufficiency of unassisted Reason to lead Mankind to Happiness, to Virtue, and to God, London, 1821. * Memoirs and Select Remains of the late Rev.

Early work His initial period of training may have taken place in Ferrara, Padua and Venice. He may have also had a stay in Italy. His works include the altarpiece of Calvary church of San Nicolas de Valencia, signed in 1476 and through which they have been able to attribute other works like the Piet√†, now in the Museu de Belles Arts de Val√®ncia, and performed between 1485 and 1490. Son There has been some confusion between Rodrigo and his son Francisco de Osona. Father and son worked closely together in their workshop in Valencia, therefore works are often attributed to both, although some assumptions are made that Francisco was more open to what was newer styles and forms in Italy. However, while the activity of Rodrigo ended with his death in 1518, Francisco died before him much younger in 1514. The second table of the Epiphany, preserved in London, is signed by \\"The teacher's son Rodrigo\\", in which, on the contrary, there seems to have more traditional trend seen in the works of the father. Legacy With basic art training, Rodrigo is considered one of the initiators of Renaissance forms in Spanish painting, coming to a full sense of quattrocento italiano. However, the Italian influences are colored by the knowledge and apply their own formulas of Flemish painting, such as remote expressiveness of idealization. Aspects of kindness and gentleness cater more devotional type reasons that a streamlined and rigorous view of reality. However, his paintings show a concern for the natural and architectural setting of the scenes and superb mastery of oil painting. The work of the father and son artist team, along with Paolo de San Leocadio, form the basis for Spanish classicism in painting.

Of course, the persistent tormenters flee in a panic when they behold; but, you know ‚Äúone but the brave deserve the fair,‚Äù and Commodore Fitzmorris sticks, thereby making a decided impression upon Nanette.

At the beginning of the war, these often vast subterranean spaces were converted to modern underground cities, by armies on both sides, using the technologies of the day: railways, electrical power plants, telephone networks, hospitals, food and water systems, theaters, chapels, housing and offices. Gusky estimates that tens of thousands of soldiers lived underground at any given time throughout the war. Many left their mark by carving evocative stone sculptures and leaving hand-written inscriptions on stone as they wanted someone to know that they once lived and that their lives mattered. The underground cities \\"provided soldiers shelter from the horrors of war on the surface.\\" In 2015, LensCulture Magazine described the link between Gusky's mission as an explorer and his mission as an emergency physician, \\"Gusky forms intimate bonds with complete strangers, helping to guide patients and their families on a journey through darkness to light and always towards hope.\\" Gusky's work as an emergency physician is grounded in helping patients circumvent immediate danger. In 2017, Gusky hosted The Smithsonian Channel television documentary, Americans Underground: Secret City of WWI. Silent Places Silent Places: Landscapes of Jewish Life and Loss in Eastern Europe, was authored by Jeffery Gusky and published by Overlook Duckworth in 2003. In 1995, Gusky visited Poland for the first time. His goal was to learn more about what Judaism meant to him. At the site of the former Plaszow Nazi concentration camp (depicted in Schindler's List), located just outside Cracow, Poland, Gusky found an original remnant of the camp that had been largely forgotten, even by local residents. Gusky has stated that in this place ‚ÄúIt was as if an intuitive switch flipped on inside me, and it has remained on ever since.‚Äù Released in 2003, Silent Places: Landscapes of Jewish Life and Loss in Eastern Europe was Gusky‚Äôs first book of photography. The book documents the modern remains of the destroyed civilization of Eastern European Jewry. According to Gusky, \\"His work as a physician is integrally related to his work as an explorer and photographer.\\" Bordertown Bordertown: The Odyssey of an American Place, was co-authored with Benjamin Heber Johnson and published by Yale University Press in 2008. According to the Dallas Observer, Bordertown contributes to a \\"larger mosaic about American identity\\".

Turtle Creek In 2008, Gusky conceived and implemented a public arts project for the Turtle Creek Association titled: Reimagining Dallas, an intimate walk along Turtle Creek. Exhibitions A traveling exhibition curated by the Santa Barbara Museum of Art paired Gusky's Poland photographs with the work of the legendary 20th Century photographer Roman Vishniac in an exhibit titled Of Life and Loss: The Polish Photographs of Roman Vishniac and Jeffrey Gusky.

Life Harold was the son of Theodore Salvesen, who had expanded the family shipping business into whaling in the late nineteenth century. His mother was Annie Forbes Burnet, one of the earliest women to graduate from the University of London and sister of the academic John Burnet.Elliot, pp. 10‚Äì26 The family lived at 16 Inverleith Place in north Edinburgh.Edinburgh Post Office directory 1898 They also owned a country estate at Culrain in northern Scotland. His grandfather Christian Salvesen had founded the family firm. From 1903 Harold was educated at Edinburgh Academy. He left in 1914 at the outbreak of the First World War to undergo officer training at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, where he was a prize cadet. By 1910, the family firm had become the world's leading whaling firm, thanks to a major boom in Antarctic whaling. On 12 May 1915 he was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the Indian Army,https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/29159/supplement/4540 and appointed to serve with the 42nd Deoli Regiment in November.https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/29588/page/4984 During the First World War, he served in the Middle East, Siberia, and Persia. He was twice Mentioned in Dispatches. He was promoted to Lieutenant in 1917 (backdated to May 1916),https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/30236/page/8460 and retired from the Army as a Captain in 1923. He continued to use the rank throughout his civilian career, finding it useful in conveying authority in a shipping business.Elliot, p. 29 After the war, Salvesen studied politics, philosophy and economics at University College, Oxford, and in 1923 was appointed a Fellow of New College to teach economics. In his four years there, he taught a number of undergraduates who would become prominent Labour politicians, including Hugh Gaitskell, Frank Pakenham, and Richard Crossman, a fact of which he was greatly proud. Salvesen himself was broadly leftwing, declaring himself to be a Labour voter, but was generally distrustful of government and strongly opposed to nationalisation, His nephew, Gerald Elliot, recorded \\"a faith in entrepreneurial capitalism [and] sympathies for social welfare\\", and suggested that his dislike of the Conservative government was at least in part a reaction to Conservative politicians who he saw as pompous and imperialist.Elliot, p. 56 While at Oxford, he took up a one-year fellowship to study at Harvard University in the United States. In 1934 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were James Young Simpson, Ralph Allen Sampson, James Hartley Ashworth and his uncle Edward Theodore Salvesen. In the Second World War he was Joint Manager for the Whaling Branch Oils and Fat Division of the Ministry of Food. After the war in 1945 he became Chairman of the family firm Christian Salvesen. In later life he lived at Inveralmond House near Cramond in north-west EdinburghCramond Through time, John dods He retired in 1967 and died on 1 February 1970. Family In 1933 he married Marion Eleanora (Mona) Cameron (b.1907) daughter of Admiral John Ewen Cameron and niece of General Archibald Rice Cameron.http://www.thepeerage.com/p19967.htm Their eldest daughter was the gardener Kirsteen (Kirsty) Marion Forbes Salvesen, later Kirsty Maxwell- Stuart. Edinburgh Evening News: 23 Jan 2016 Whaling Jarls√∏ in Norway, c. 1930 In 1928 Salvesen left Oxford to enter the family business, alongside his brothers Noel and Norman and his cousin Iver. The work was divided among the partners, with Norman responsible for chartering and agency work and Iver handling merchant shipping. Noel, with his father Theodore, headed the whaling division, which Harold joined. After learning Norwegian ‚Äì the universal language among the whalers ‚Äì he spent the summers of 1928/29 and 1929/30 in the Antarctic, the first senior manager to actually visit the Southern Ocean whaling fleet, and came back arguing strongly for more investment and more modern practices. He oversaw the conversion of two factory ships for pelagic whaling, Salvestria and Sourabaya, and brought a new zeal and efficiency to the operations at South Georgia and at sea. The boom in Antarctic whaling came to an abrupt halt in 1930/31, with the price of oil dropping by half, and over the following years Salvesen was a leading player in the negotiations to establish an agreed catch quota among the whaling firms. His major achievement was to set the quota in terms of whales killed rather than oil produced, encouraging a less wasteful approach to whaling.Elliot, pp. 27‚Äì34 As Harold grew more experienced with the business, he took over the operational aspects of running the fleet while Noel concentrated on selling the oil.Elliot, p. 46 During the 1930s he reorganised the staffing of the Salvesen fleet to include more British seamen ‚Äì it had previously been 95% Norwegian ‚Äì resulting in repeated clashes with the Norwegian seamen's unions, but a growing closeness with the British National Union of Seamen.Elliot, pp. 36‚Äì38 On the outbreak of the Second World War the Salvesen fleet headed south for the Antarctic summer, returning in 1940 to find that their Norwegian home ports were now occupied by Germany. The following season, after three Norwegian factory ships were captured by the commerce raider Pinguin the government ordered the suspension of all whaling for the duration of the war, despite Salvensen's protests that whale oil was a valuable food source. The entire British whaling fleet was dispersed, with the factory ships leased to the Ministry of Transport as oil tankers and military transports, and the whalecatchers leased to serve as patrol ships and minesweepers. Over the following years Salvesen worked to shepherd this fleet of ships through the Battle of the Atlantic, with great losses; every Salvesen and Unilever factory ship was sunk, along with two of the large modern Norwegian factory ships.Elliot, pp. 46‚Äì48 Publications *Modern Aspects of Whaling (1932) References * Category:1897 births Category:1970 deaths Category:British businesspeople in shipping Category:British Indian Army officers Category:Fellows of New College, Oxford Category:Alumni of University College, Oxford Category:People educated at Edinburgh Academy Category:Scottish people of Norwegian descent Category:Graduates of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst Category:Harvard University alumni Category:British people in whaling ","title":"Harold Salvesen"},{"id":"43605123","text":"Dan Smith (born February 23, 1989, in Manalapan Township, New Jersey) is an American professional poker player.\\"Dan smith\\" He now resides in Las Vegas, Nevada.

The film stars Sivaji Ganesan, Padmini and Kanchana. It deals with the romance between a woman who raises a bull and a man who sets out to tame it. Vilaiyaattu Pillai was released on 20 February 1970. The film was a commercial success, running for over 100 days in theatres. Plot Muthiah, a farmer, manages to tame Neelamani, a bull owned by Maragatham, the daughter of a wealthy man. After Muthiah's victory, Maragatham challenges him to participate in a Rekla race. Muthiah participates and emerges victorious, and Maragatham falls in love with him. Muthiah's mother, while happy about the accolades her son has won, believes he is too playful and advises him to marry and live more responsibly. Muthiah's uncle agrees to talk to Maragatham's father and fix Muthiah's marriage with Maragatham, but has plans of his own. Instead of Muthiah, he finalises Maragatham's marriage with his spoilt son Velu. On the day Maragatham is supposed to marry Velu, she and Muthiah elope and marry, and eventually have a son, Manickam. Maragatham inherits her father's wealth following his death. One day an elephant goes out of control, but Muthiah manages to overpower it, saving princess Indu in the process. She develops a liking for Muthiah and invites him and his family to the palace. Velu is jealous of Muthiah and, seeking to tarnish Muthiah's image, he spreads rumours about him and the princess.

The novel dealt with the romance between a woman who raises a bull and a man who sets out to tame it.

Vasan, the owner of Gemini Studios where the film was shot. Cinematography was handled by K. S. Prasad, and the editing by M. Umanath. Filming took place prominently in Mysore. Film historian Randor Guy believes this was the first Tamil film to have a race of the Tamil Nadu sport Rekla as its theme. Vasan died in 1969, when the film was still in production, and the film was dedicated to his memory. Soundtrack The music was composed by K. V.

History  The settlement of Saltillo was formerly located along the Salt Creek where the corners of Grant, Centerville, Yankee Hill, and Saltillo townships meet. Originally a community was planned at the site to be named Olathe. In 1862, John Cadman built a road ranch called Saltillo Station in the area to provide lodgings for travelers along the Oregon Trail between Nebraska City and Fort Kearny. A post office was established at Saltillo in 1862, and remained in operation until it was discontinued in 1906. The community was likely named after the city of Saltillo, Mexico. A 1925 edition is available for download at University of Nebraska‚ÄîLincoln Digital Commons. The name is derived from the Spanish word salto, meaning leap, the diminutive suffix renders the meaning of the name \\"little leap.\\" Saltillo remained a small community for its entire existence, never exceeding a population of 50 people. The village economy relied heavily on wagon train traffic from the Oregon Trail, which became obsolete in 1865 with the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad. Two railroads passed through Saltillo, the Atchison and Nebraska Railroad in 1872 and the a branch line of the Union Pacific called the Omaha and Republican Valley Railroad in 1883. The Atchison and Nebraska Railroad was later sold to Chicago, Burlington & Quincy in 1908. Plat maps produced in 1903 show the village with three streets and the path of Salt Creek flowing through roughly half of the lots. Frequent flooding, a lack of travelers and thus income, as well as the continuous growth of nearby Lincoln all sent the population of Saltillo into decline. By the 1950s, the last visible remnant of Saltillo was the grain elevator which was torn down in 1953.

The key is sometimes referred to as the \\"forward delete\\" key. This is because the backspace key also deletes characters, but to the left of the cursor. On many keyboards, such as most Apple keyboards, the key with the backspace function is also labelled \\"delete\\". Position and labelling on keyboards The key appears on English-language IBM-compatible PC keyboards labeled as or , sometimes accompanied by a crossed-out right-arrow symbol. However, sometimes the key labelled performs the Backspace function instead, for example on some Apple keyboards. In other cases, the Delete key is in its original IBM notebook position of above and to the right of the Backspace key. Many laptops add rows of smaller keys above the Function key line to add keys on a non- standard size keyboard. On this row of smaller keys, the position of the Delete key is positioned at or near the right-hand end. On a Macbook, the forward delete function can be achieved using the key combination. The Delete key is typically smaller and less-conveniently located than the Backspace key, and on keyboards where space is limited, for example those omitting the numeric keypad or virtual keyboards on mobile devices, it is often omitted altogether. On some compact keyboards (for example, the 60-key Happy Hacking Keyboard), the Delete key replaces the conventional Backspace key, and the Backspace function is achieved by holding the Fn key and pressing Delete.

The delete key often works as a generic command to remove a selected object, such as an image embedded in a document (on Apple Keyboards, both the forward delete key and the delete (backspace) key have the same effect when pressed while an object is selected). On Unix-like systems, the delete key is usually mapped to ESC which is the VT220 escape code for the \\"delete character\\" key. The delete key, on many modern motherboards, also functions to open the BIOS setup screen when pressed after starting the computer. In GUI applications where the Delete key is enabled, especially in file browsers, pressing it does not necessarily immediately delete the selected object, but often a confirmation dialog box will appear to allow the user to cancel the deletion, or the object may instead be silently moved to a \\"trash folder\\" or equivalent, so that it can be recovered later. In other GUI contexts, the Undo function can often reverse a deletion. Alternative Key Mapping As many Apple keyboards lack a dedicated key for the forward delete function, Mac users wishing to have a dedicated forward delete key can reassign the forward-delete function to a different key using various third-party applications, such as DoubleCommand, Karabiner or PowerKey. For example, installing and enabling the DoubleCommand application allows the user to use the , or numeric keypad keys as a forward delete key.Soundforge DoubleCommand download page, http://doublecommand.sourceforge.net/features.html Accessed 2016-11-10 See also * Control-Alt-Delete * Backspace References Category:Computer keys ","title":"Delete key"},{"id":"43605230","text":"Bruce Rosen is an American physicist and radiologist and a leading expert in the area of functional neuroimaging. His research for the past 30 years has focused on the development and application of physiological and functional nuclear magnetic resonance techniques, as well as new approaches to combine functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data with information from other modalities such as positron emission tomography (PET), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and noninvasive optical imaging. The techniques his group has developed to measure physiological and metabolic changes associated with brain activation and cerebrovascular insult are used by research centers and hospitals throughout the world. As Director of the Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at the Massachusetts General Hospital, he has overseen significant advances including the introduction and development of functional MRI in the early 1990s.  Development of functional MRI  Rosen is the senior author on two seminal papers in the development of functional MRI. He was one of John (Jack) Belliveau‚Äôs thesis advisers when Belliveau ‚Äì a Harvard graduate student working in the NMR Center (now the Martinos Center) at Massachusetts General Hospital ‚Äì performed his early experiments using MRI to reveal regional activity in the brain. Using an MR technique he had developed to track blood flow (‚Äúdynamic susceptibility contrast‚Äù) he imaged the visual cortex of volunteers during periods of both rest and activation. By subtracting one image from the other, he then demonstrated differences in MR signal between the two. Science recognized the significance of this work as the first demonstration of functional MRI in the human brain. It published Belliveau‚Äôs report in November 1991 ‚Äì with Rosen as the senior author ‚Äì and featured one of his images on the cover. The study opened the door to functional imaging the brain with MRI, but because the approach required the use of an intravenous contrast agent it was not suitable for wide application in humans. To address this limitation, Kenneth Kwong, a postdoctoral fellow in the NMR Center, developed a means to measure endogenous signals based on blood oxygenation using gradient echo imaging. He successfully demonstrated the technique in May 1991 and a report of the findings was published in 1992 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.  Research Activities  Rosen leads the activities of several large interdisciplinary and inter-institutional research programs, including the NIH Blueprint-funded Human Connectome Project; the NIH/National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering Biomedical Technology Resource Center, the Center for Functional Neuroimaging Technologies (CFNT); the Biomedical Informatics Research Network (BIRN) Collaborative Tools Support Network; and an NIH/National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH)-funded Center of Excellence for Research on Complementary and Alternative Medicine (e.g., he is, for instance, involved in animal and fMRI research investigating the neurophysiological responses to acupuncture stimulations). He is Principal Investigator/Program Director for two neuroimaging training programs. He has authored more than 300 peer-reviewed articles as well as over 50 book chapters, editorials and reviews. Education and career Rosen graduated from Harvard University in 1977 with an A.B. in Astronomy and Astrophysics. In 1980, he received an M.S. in Physics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He went on to earn an M.D. from Hahnemann Medical College in 1982 and a Ph.D. in Medical Physics from MIT in 1984. He joined the faculty of Harvard Medical School in 1987, when he was also made Director of Clinical NMR in the Department of Radiology at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Today he is Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and Professor of Health Science and Technology at the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, as well as Director of the Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at MGH. In 2013, he was named Laurence Lamson Robbins Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School. Awards and recognition Rosen is the recipient of numerous awards in recognition of his contributions to the field of functional MRI, including the 2011 Outstanding Researcher award from the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA), and the Rigshospitalet‚Äôs International KFJ Award 2011 from the University of Copenhagen/Rigshospitalet. He is a Fellow of the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine and an ISMRM Gold Medal winner for his contributions to the field of Functional MRI. In addition, he is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a Fellow of the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering, a member of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies and a member of the National Academy of Medicine. In 2017 Rosen was elected a Fellow of the National Academy of Inventors.

These mountains are protected in the Black Hills National Forest as part of its Bearlodge District. Devils Tower National Monument was the first U.S. National Monument and draws about 400,000 visitors per year to the area. The Bear Lodge Mountains are one of three mountain ranges that comprise the Black Hills region and national forest, including the Black Hills itself and South Dakota's Elk Mountains. Sundance, Wyoming is the closest major city and lies south of the Bear Lodge Mountains. Wyoming Highway 24 (the Bear Lodge Highway) passes through the northern part of the range. History Devils Tower, 1888 The place names Bear Lodge, Sun Dance, and Rock Gatherer (Inyan Kara) come from the history of Lakota people in this area. Devils Tower was declared a United States National Monument in 1906. From 1907 to 1908, the area was the Bear Lodge National Forest, then the Sundance National Forest through 1915, before becoming a district of the Black Hills National Forest. Geography The Bear Lodge Mountains were formed as a byproduct of the geological processes that created the Black Hills, and offer hikes throughout bottomlands, hills, and buttes. Unlike the Black Hills, this range is small and only a few igneous rocks are exposed. Just outside the range, however, lie the very large igneous intrusions of Devils Tower, Inyan Kara Mountain, and Sundance Mountain. Bounded on the north by the Belle Fourche River, the mountains have several Belle Fourche River tributaries including Redwater, Blacktail, Miller, Beaver, Lytle, Lame Jones, and Hay Creeks. There were coal mines in these river valleys. Habitat While ponderosa pine and mixed-grass prairie grow on the highland of this range, its ravines offer habitat to species such as wild rose, skunkbush sumac, and chokecherry. At the foot of the mountains grow bur oak. Groves of aspen frequently separate meadows with fine soil from ponderosa pine forests growing in coarse soil. Vegetation in the Bear Lodge Mountains is similar to that of the Black Hills, although the Bear Lodge Mountains have no white spruce. The mountains' growing season is long, and forest growth in this range and the Black Hills is high. This productivity has led to high levels of logging.

Early life  Shipway was born in 1935 in Birmingham. He studied piano first with his father and then with Alisa Verity. He earned a scholarship to The Royal College of Music to study piano and later switched to conducting. Shipway was further trained by John Barbirolli and attended masterclasses with Herbert von Karajan, modelling his style after Karajan's own.  Career  In 1963, Shipway became music director of the South-West Essex Symphony Orchestra, soon renamed the Forest Philharmonic Society (FPS), which he would lead until 1991. His first professional conducting position was with the Berlin Opera in 1973 as assistant conductor to Lorin Maazel. He also worked with the Glyndebourne Festival Opera and the English National Opera in this period and developed an operatic repertoire largely from the Classical and Romantic periods. In 1991, Shipway formed the Orchestra Sinfonica Nazionale della RAI in Italy and served as its chief conductor for four years. From 1996 to 1999 he was chief conductor and artistic director of BRT Philharmonic Orchestra in Brussels, and then of the Zagreb Philharmonic Orchestra. He also served as guest conductor with the Cleveland Orchestra, Teatro alla Scala Orchestra, and the Moscow, Helsinki and Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestras. For several years prior to his death, Shipway was a frequent guest conductor with the S√£o Paulo State Symphony; he made two recordings with the orchestra for BIS Records and was considered for the post of musical director upon the departure of John Neschling. In addition to conducting, Shipway gave masterclasses and served on the juries of a number of international competitions including the Nikolai Malko and Arturo Toscanini conducting competitions. Shipway died on 6 August 2014 of injuries sustained in a car accident in Wedhampton, England. He was 79.

As a propraetor he was assigned as Governor of Sicily in 104 BC at the outbreak of the Second Servile War.Cassius Dio, Roman History, Book 27, Fragment 101 In the midst of the Cimbrian War, Italian allies of Rome, upon the mustering of troops, protested publicani tax farmers selling their citizens into slavery as punishment for tax arrears. As these abuses interfered with Roman ability to speedily raise troops, the Senate decreed that any citizen of an ally would be immediately emancipated. The Senate assigned Nerva to establish a tribunal in Sicily to determine who qualified for release. A coalition of slaveholders in Sicily confronted the praetor and, with bribes and threats, shut the tribunal down. With to the mounting pressure from the slaveholders and the slaves themselves, Nerva feared violent outbreaks from the side who came off worse in the confrontation and refused to listen to any more of the slaves' complaints. Claiming that they would not face repercussions for their actions, Nerva told the slaves to disperse and return to their masters. However, the slaves instead decided amongst themselves to start a revolt.Cassius Dio, The Actions of the Roman Governor of Sicily, Publius Licinius Nerva, in 104 B.C., Third Century A.D. In Brent D. Shaw (ed), Spartcus and the Slave Wars: A Brief History with Documents (The Bedford Series in History and Culture) (pp. 121-122). Palgrave Macmillan: Boston; New York. Nerva tried to put down the revolt, but failed to react with decision; by false promises he was able to return one body of the rebels to slavery, but neglected to address more serious outbreaks near Heraclea and near Lilybaeum. Eventually, Nerva dispatched a detachment of 600 soldiers to Heraclea but they were defeated, the slaves now gained confidence, having won a large supply of armaments. Nerva was replaced at the end of his term by Lucius Licinius Lucullus.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica, 36,8; A. H.

Along with the true weevil Ceutorhynchus contractus var. pallipes and an undescribed race of flea beetle Psylliodes napi, it is known only from the Lundy cabbage. The species was first recorded by Thomas Vernon Wollaston in the 1840s, and was named by the Austrian entomologist Franz Kutschera in 1864. Adult Lundy cabbage flea beetle measure around in length. They have brassy-green heads and bodies, with reddish-brown elytra. The adults feed upon the leaves of the Lundy cabbage, while the larvae mine into the plants to feed. The species is threatened by fluctuating numbers of Lundy cabbages, particularly due to invasive common rhododendrons (Rhododendron ponticum). Taxonomy and evolution The species was first collected by Thomas Vernon Wollaston, who visited Lundy in 1844 and 1845. He collected specimens of 153 species of beetle, including a specimen of the species that later became known as P. luridipennis. Charles Owen Waterhouse listed the species in volume 2 of the Entomologist's Monthly Magazine as \\"Psylliodes 6 sp. ‚Äî?\\", and it was formally described and named by Austrian entomologist Franz Kutschera in the journal Wiener Entomologische Monatschrift in 1864. The ancestors of the modern P. luridipennis population would have been unable to survive on Lundy during the ice age. As such, the species must either be a relict species (a species once more widespread), a species which is not unique to Lundy with other undiscovered populations, or the result of comparatively recent speciation on or near Lundy. One climactic and geological study suggests \\"that the ancestors of Lundy cabbage and its beetles may have had the opportunity to colonise Lundy across land during a few hundred years around 10,800 years ago or may subsequently have been aided by [now gone] 'stepping stone' land to the north east\\" of the island. Description Psylliodes luridipennis adults are oblong-ovate, and the same size and build as P. hyoscyami, but not as broad, measuring between 2.8 and 3.6 mm in length. They have a brassy-green head and thorax, shining reddish-brown elytra and brassy- green legs. The hind femora are brassy in colour but paler at the base, and the antennae are brick-red. The adults are fully winged, and are capable of flight. Its brassy colour, smaller size, and more finely and closely punctate- striate elytra distinguish it from its ally, P. chrysocephala, which is also found on Lundy. P. luridipennis is sometimes called the \\"bronze Lundy cabbage flea beetle\\" to differentiate it from another beetle found on the Lundy cabbage. This latter beetle, the \\"blue Lundy cabbage flea beetle\\", is a short- winged form of the widespread P. napi. Ecology and distribution A specimen of the Lundy cabbage, growing at Bristol Zoo Adult Psylliodes luridipennis beetles are invariably found on the Lundy cabbage (Coincya wrightii), a species endemic to the island of Lundy, where they feed on the leaves. They are not found on other locally occurring plants. However, researchers were also able to lure the beetles onto other crucifers taken from gardens. Two other taxa are known only from Lundy cabbages‚Äîthe true weevil Ceutorhynchus contractus var. pallipes and an undescribed race of the flea beetle Psylliodes napi‚Äîmaking the plant unique to Britain as the only endemic species which is the exclusive host to endemic insect species. However, the Lundy cabbage is also host to a diverse variety of other invertebrate species. Psylliodes luridipennis is found throughout the highly limited range of the Lundy cabbage, including sheer sea cliffs and further inland at Millcombe House. The insects also found their way to Lundy cabbages artificially seeded within the cabbage's range within a year. It had been hypothesised that P. luridipennis and Ceutorhynchus contractus var. pallipes may help pollinate the Lundy cabbage, but observations of the taxa indicate that neither visit flowers. While there are no honey bees on Lundy, other species of winged insects are present. The plant may rely primarily upon pollen beetles of the genus Meligethes and the wind for pollination. Psylliodes luridipennis females lay their eggs on Lundy cabbage leaf stalks. The white larvae are leaf miners, digging into the petioles and stems. After emerging in late summer, they pupate in soil. Conservation Along with the Lundy cabbage, Psylliodes luridipennis has been listed in the United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan, and an action plan for its conservation, along with the conservation of other endemic species, has been prepared. This plan revolves mostly around the control of Rhododendron ponticum, an alien species which threatens the Lundy cabbage.Compton, S.G.; Key, R.S.; Key, R.J.D.; Parkes, E. (1998). \\"A strategy for control of the alien weed Rhododendron ponticum on Lundy in relation to the conservation of the endemic plant Lundy cabbage, Coincya wrightii.\\" English Nature Research Reports, 263: 1‚Äì67. The beetle is threatened by fluctuating numbers of Lundy cabbages. Though it is quicker than P. napi to recolonise new growth after bad years for the cabbage, it is slower to recover than the cabbage itself. The Joint Nature Conservation Committee recognise Psylliodes luridipennis as a \\"priority species\\" for conservation purposes, due to the fluctuating numbers of Lundy cabbages. Though the committee notes that \\"[h]ost plant numbers have been low, but relatively stable since 2001\\", it claims that P. luridipennis \\"has been noticeably difficult to find in recent years\\". Based on pre-1994 IUCN Red List guidelines, the species was informally deemed as \\"vulnerable\\".

Brainard, who first took office January 1, 1996, is currently serving his seventh consecutive four-year term, most recently reelected in 2019. Mayor Brainard is one of Indiana's longest serving mayors. He has led a city whose population has grown from 25,000 in 1996 to 100,000 in 2019. His keynote projects have been the creation of a new downtown called City Center, where a new 1,600-seat concert hall, the Palladium, opened in 2011; the redevelopment of the oldest part of town into a new Arts & Design District; and building several more city parks and trails. Early life and education Raised in Bristol, Indiana, the son of Jack and Dortha, he was always interested in music. He considered majoring in it but since he wanted to go to law school, he chose to follow his parents to Butler University because of their history department's reputation. After graduating in 1976, he went on to the law school at Ohio Northern University. He graduated in 1982. Political views =Transportation policy= Brainard is frequently asked to speak about city planning, redevelopment and roadway networks. Under his administration, the City of Carmel has eliminated dozens of traffic signals and dangerous intersections, replacing them with roundabouts. Carmel, with 122 roundabouts as of January 2019, has more roundabouts than any other city in the United States. The policy has resulted in a reduction of both carbon emissions and intersection accidents. Prior to his election, he guided the construction of the first roundabout in city limits at the corner of River Road and Main Street (currently the city's largest roundabout) in 1996 as part of private construction, and oversaw the first publicly funded roundabout's construction as mayor the following year at 126th Street and Hazel Dell Road. =Climate and energy= Brainard is a moderate Republican who has earned a national reputation for defending efforts to fight against the effects of global warming. Brainard is serving as a Trustee and co-chair of the Energy Independence and Climate Protection Task Force for the U.S. Conference of Mayors. In November 2013 he was appointed to the Task Force on Climate Preparedness and Resilience by the President of the United States. He traveled in 2015 to four cities in India to represent the United States as part of the US State Department's speaker's bureau. Also, in 2015 he was asked to speak on energy and climate policy at the German-American Centers in five German cities. Additionally, he has been a guest lecturer for Georgetown University, Butler University, Indiana University and Purdue University among others. He often speaks to city councils and planning commissions across the United States about city design and development. Because of his views, Brainard \\"was tapped to be on President Obama's Task Force on Climate Preparedness and Resilience. He [also] won first place honors from the 2008 Mayor's Climate Protection Awards Program.\\" In 2013, it was announced he would be \\"one of 26 local government representatives who make up a new task force to help communities deal with the effects of climate change.\\" =Fiscal and health policy= Brainard is also a fiscal conservative who has invested millions of dollars in local redevelopment projects while keeping the city tax rate among the lowest among cities in the state of Indiana. Because of Brainard's activity to create a health-conscious community, Carmel has received various awards for its healthy living. Concerns have been raised in recent years about Brainard's handling of Carmel city finances. In 2015 the city overestimated tax revenues by over $5 million and was forced to reallocate funds between accounts to meet then current obligations. In 2017 S&P; downgraded Carmel's long-term bond rating from AA-plus to AA, noting a $300 million increase in debt over the prior 3 years. In its analysis, S&P; noted \\"In our view, this demonstrates the risk of high leverage and a heavy dependence on sometimes more volatile tax-increment revenues. We feel the city's crowded budget and high fixed costs leave it vulnerable to unanticipated economic or operational swings.\\" In response to a question about the Green New Deal, Brainard has said, \\"I think we have [to] find that middle ground where we can do things that encourage green jobs‚Äîdo things that help the economy and reduce carbon at the same time.\\" =Civil rights and diversity= In 2015, he proposed and the City Council passed a new ordinance to designed to protect human rights regardless of race, religion, sexual orientation, or gender identity. The issue was first raised in Carmel during the election campaign and came to its closure during a time of heightened awareness. Brainard claims to be a supporter of diversity in Carmel. He hosts an annual Iftar for the local Muslim community and established a new Carmel Interfaith Alliance in the fall of 2015 designed to bring together pastors and religious leaders from a variety of faiths. Brainard has said, \\"When I study the history of our cities, I see that the most important advances take place when people of diverse backgrounds meet. Carmel's diversity brings a richness to the fabric of our community, and our freedom of religion should be celebrated.\\" On the other hand, following a November, 2019 investigation by a local news program, I-team 8, which found that African Americans received traffic tickets at eighteen times their rate in the local populations, Brainard declined an interview and stated \\"A large portion of our Asian population are Indians, which, through a car window would appear to be ‚Ä¶ a dark skin color [...] We talk with those folks all the time and they ‚Äî I‚Äôve never gotten a complaint they‚Äôre pulled over at any greater rate than anyone else\\". =Carmel and protests in the wake of the murder of George Floyd= On June 1, 2020, in the wake of a nationwide outbreak of protests against police brutality and racism in policing, Brainard and the city of Carmel released a statement saying that they had retained outside counsel and had sought to sue the city of Minneapolis for alleged costs incurred in \\"increased security\\" as a result of said protests. In the press release, Brainard is quoted, stating \\"I encourage other cities to join us in this lawsuit for recovery of our costs. Those in power need to understand the far-reaching consequences of their actions\\". The threat made national news, and Brainard subsequently publicly retracted the city's plan that same day evening.

He is best known as a folklorist and a hagiographer, and in particular for his comprehensive Lives of the Irish Saints. Life O'Hanlon was born in Stradbally, Laois. His parents were Edward and Honor Hanlon. He attended the Preston School in Ballyroan and then entered Carlow College to study for the priesthood. Before he completed his studies, however, he emigrated in 1842 with members of his family, initially to Quebec, but ultimately to Missouri in the United States of America (a migration perhaps occasioned by the death of his father). The family settled in Millwood in northeast Missouri. O'Hanlon was admitted to the diocesan college in St. Louis, completed his studies, and was ordained in 1847. He was then assigned a mission in the diocese of St. Louis, where he ministered until 1853. He then returned to his native Stradbally for health reasons. A year later, his health having improved, O'Hanlon offered his services to the Archdiocese of Dublin, and became a curate in the parish of Saints Michael and John. A fellow curate there was Charles Patrick Meehan and \\"many stories are told of their eccentricities\\". In 1880 he was appointed as parish priest of Sandymount and Ringsend in Dublin, where he ministered at the church of St. Mary's Star of the Sea in Irishtown (today there is a commemorative plaque on display in the church). He remained in Sandymount/Ringsend until his death in 1905. He had been made a Canon of the Dublin Cathedral by Archbishop Walsh in 1885, and celebrated his Golden Jubilee as a priest in 1897. He is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery. Writings O'Hanlon began writing while in America. His time there coincided with mass immigration from Ireland due to the Great Famine, and he was deeply affected by the plight of these immigrants. As one consequence, he wrote An Irish Emigrant's Guide to the United States (a revised edition of which he would issue in 1890). But he also engaged in more scholarly writing, working on a biography of Saint Malachy, publishing some of his research as articles in the Boston Pilot, where he also published articles about Saint Patrick He also wrote an Abridgment of the History of Ireland (1849) (in 1903, in Ireland, he would publish an Irish-American History of the United States), and for a time he was editor of a Catholic newspaper, The St. Louis News-Letter. O'Hanlon was very interested in local history and folklore, and when he returned to Ireland much of his writing concerned these topics. Among his first publications in Ireland were two letters, from 1856, published in the Journal of the Kilkenny and South-East of Ireland Archaeological Society, urging the usefulness of the records of the Ordnance Survey in the Phoenix Park for studying the history of the neighbouring counties of Kilkenny and his native Laois. The usefulness of the Ordnance Survey and the importance of local histories and topographies were constant themes for O'Hanlon and he would write twenty further bulletins about the Ordnance Survey and the histories of other counties in Ireland. Laois (which was known as Queen's County until 1922, but was always associated with the medieval kingdom of Lo√≠gis or Leix) was always of particular interest to O'Hanlon and he worked on a two-volume History of the Queen's County (although this was only posthumously published in 1907), published articles on the \\"Old Churches of Leix\\" in the Irish Builder during the 1880s, and collected the works of Laois patriot, balladeer and mythologist John Keegan, while the best known of his own poems is the \\"Land of Leix\\". O'Hanlon's best- known work remains his hagiography, in particular his Lives of the Irish Saints, which organizes its chronicles by feast day, from January 1 to December 31. O'Hanlon issued a prospectus for a subscription work on the lives of Irish saints in 1875, and published 9 volumes until he died in 1905, when he was working on a tenth, dealing with 3,500 saints across more than six thousand octavo pages. In addition to this magnum opus O'Hanlon published many works on individual saints, although he mostly re-used these articles and pamphlets in his Lives, often verbatim. In a similar manner, his work on the churches of Laois provided material for the Lives. As a work of hagiography, the Lives of the Irish Saints has been surpassed by modern scholarship, but it remains a treasure trove of local information and tradition. O'Hanlon did not limit himself to the lives of saints, and his interests extended to secular and more contemporary figures. He issued new editions of works by William Molyneux (The Case of Ireland's Being Bound by Acts of Parliament in England Stated, 1893) and Henry Joseph Monck Mason (History of the Irish Parliament, 1891) and had plans to publish a definitive biography of Daniel O'Connell, although he set these aside to work on his history of Laois. O'Hanlon was also a poet, publishing under the pseudonym \\"Lageniensis\\" (Leinster man). The collected works of Lageniensis centre on a long poem in Spenserian stanza, \\"The Land of Leix\\" and a series of lays recounting stories from Irish mythology. Characteristically, the poems are annotated with extremely copious local and historical information. O'Hanlon was always an eager traveller, frequently journeying to Europe to research the Lives, and travelling thousands of miles through the USA and Canada as a seventy-year-old man in 1891 (on the occasion of the jubilee of Archbishop Kenrick who had ordained him). Yet another string to his writer's bow could be said to be travel writing, in particular His Life and scenery in Missouri (1890). He also turned his hand to pedagogical works (Cathecism of Greek Grammar, 1865) and to devotional writing (Devotions for Cofession and Holy Communion, 1866). Interest in Art In addition to his other achievements, O'Hanlon was a competent illustrator, with a particular interest in recording local topographical features. Moycreddin lower Cemetery (1874) 128 of the illustrations in his Lives of the Irish Saints (about one fifth of the total) were made by O'Hanlon himself. O'Hanlon was a strong believer in the importance of topography, or the study of place, which is evident in his praise of the Ordnance Survey, for whom he advocated a government grant to employ artists to record local features. In his own drawings and his use of drawings by others he showed a clear concern to record visual antiquarian and historical details which otherwise might disappear. These artistic abilities were also expressed in an interest in architecture. O'Hanlon wrote about the churches of Laois, commended the newly built church of St. Laurence O'Toole in Seville Place, Dublin, in his The Life of St. Lawrence O'Toole, Archbishop of Dublin (1857) and worked on the restoration of his own parish church, St. Mary Star of the Sea. The Irish Language O'Hanlon was very interested in the revival and preservation of the Irish language. He had joined the Ossianic Society when he returned from the United States, and as a curate in Dublin he was already a council member of the Society for the Preservation of the Irish Language (founded in 1877), with which he remained active until his death, becoming a vice-president. He edited work by the Irish language activist Henry Joseph Monck Mason. A Star of the Sea branch of Conradh na Gaeilge was founded in 1900 with O'Hanlon as its president. He was known for frequently attending its classes to offer encouragement to students. Politics O'Hanlon's political convictions seem to date to his childhood. During that period there was a great deal of agitation and unrest in Ireland, both by moral and political activists, and by violent societies such as the Whiteboys and the Rockites. O'Hanlon recorded his early impression of the Ballykilvan evictions in 1828 and as a teenager attended Daniel O'Connell's meeting on the Great Heath in 1836. He was probably also influenced in his political convictions by his pastoral experiences a priest among the poor, in both St. Louis and Dublin. O'Hanlon was no radical priest and he always submitted to the authority of his bishop, but certain of his publications attest to his own political views and to a desire to contribute to the political discussions about Ireland's status, both in Ireland and Britain. He attended the House of Commons in London in 1893 for some of the debates about Home Rule for Ireland, of which he was a proponent, and admired Charles Stewart Parnell, as well as William Gladstone. It was in this period, the 1890s, that he published his editions of Molyneux's The Case of Ireland's Being Bound by Acts of Parliament in England Stated and Monck Mason's History of the Irish Parliament with the apparent goal of returning these earlier advocates of Irish autonomous government to popular consciousness. He dedicated the latter to Gladstone. When he collected his poetical works as Lageniensis, he addressed the dedication to Lady Aberdeen, whose husband had served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and had just been appointed as Governor General of Canada, both viceregal positions. O'Hanlon commends Aberdeen for her work with the poor in Ireland and her establishment of the Irish Industries Association. He then goes on to compare the situations of Ireland and Canada in relation to Home Rule, and argues that Ireland should be granted the same autonomy as Canada and, in a bitter reference to the Parnellite split deplores the \\"malign and sinister obstruction to which Irish Home Rule has been subjected through bigotry, unnatural party combination, class prejudice and selfishness\\", while hoping that eventually there will be established in Ireland \\"a Constitution, which shall secure equal rights and liberties for all creeds and parties in Ireland, while promoting and consolidating still more the strength and resources of the British Empire\\". After the failures of Parnell's party, as well as the final resignation of their key ally Gladstone, in 1894, O'Hanlon seems to have given up hope for Home Rule. But his true political hero remained Daniel O'Connell. O'Hanlon was General Secretary of the O'Connell Monument Committee, author of their Report (1888), and probably the main driver overcoming many setbacks during the difficult 20-year period it took to erect a monument to O'Connell in Dublin's Sackville Street (now O'Connell Street). A Modest Fame O'Hanlon was a modest man but he was recognized for his achievements. At his Golden Jubilee his parishioners and fellow priests recognized his pastoral work, his patriotic advocacy or Irish national interests, and his extensive writings. William Walsh, the archbishop of Dublin, remarked that he worked so hard at his pastoral duties that men wondered how he found time to write, but he wrote so much that men wondered how he found time to do any missionary work. He associated with literary circles in Dublin. He was elected a Member of the Royal Irish Academy. Finally, tribute was paid to O'Hanlon by none other than James Joyce, in the Nausicaa episode of Ulysses, where his activities in the St. Mary Star of the Sea church counterpoint Leopold Bloom's observation of Gerty McDowell on the nearby Sandymount Strand: \\"and the blue banners of the blessed Virgin's sodality and Father Conroy was helping Canon O'Hanlon at the altar\\".

The theatre is named after the man who led the campaign to open the Secombe Theatre in neighbouring Sutton. It was opened by Prince Edward in 1991. It closed in 2016, but in November 2019 it reopened under new management. Building Facade and eastern flank of the building The theatre is housed in a building which was built as a public hall in 1874 for the village. Prior to becoming a theatre it has been used as a roller skating rink (from 1900 to 1912) and a cinema (from 1912 to 1939). To convert the building to a theatre, the roof and the facade were renewed. A stone-set wind vane and three red brick entrance arches were kept. Notable are the tiled eaves to each side of the building, which project past the front. The interior was renewed including staircases and porthole shaped windows. A new floor was designed to divide the hall in half. There is a restaurant downstairs with the box office while upstairs are the auditorium and dressing rooms. The auditorium itself features flexible seating for between 68 and 125, dependent upon the arrangement. The stage has limited space to the sides. There is a rehearsal room for performing to 20 people or less. The 1992 RIBA Downland Design Award judges commented that \\"the project makes a significant social contribution to the High Street. The theatre is in constant use and well-liked\\". Productions and workshops Past performances have included a \\"sensitive treatment by a clever director and fine cast\\" in 2009 of Anton Chekhov's play Uncle Vanya by the Square Peg Theatre Company, which received a five star review from the Croydon Advertiser. In 2013 the theatre hosted the Breakfast Cat Theatre Company's treatment of George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, which was noted by the Croydon Citizen for its \\"skill and flair.\\" Other past productions have included Steel Magnolias, The Tempest, Jesus Christ Superstar and The Witches of Eastwick. The theatre was included by the Independent Newspaper in a 1998 article entitled \\"The 50 Best: Britain's Best- kept Summer Secrets\\", which covered its drama workshops for children. 2014 to 2015 closure risk, rescue and renaissance Because of the local council's need to make budgetary savings, the venue was, along with its sister theatre, the Secombe Theatre in Sutton, identified by the Theatres Trust as one of 33 theatres in the country for inclusion on its \\"At Risk\\" register. Comedian Tim Vine, called on Sutton Council to reconsider its proposals. In November 2014 the local council announced that four organisations submitting outline bids to take over the two theatres had been invited to submit full business cases. In January 2015 the bid by the new \\"Sutton Theatres Trust\\" (STT) was given approval by the council's environment and neighbourhood committee to take over the theatres, thus saving them from closure. Speaking about the future running of the theatres, a spokesperson for STT said: In June 2015 the theatres were official handed over to the STT. Cllr Jill Whitehead said: \\"Now we can look forward to an exciting programme of activity to be unveiled by Sutton Theatres Trust this summer and their contribution to cultural life in Sutton.\\"Sutton Guardian 2016 closure In August 2016, the Sutton Theatre Trust went into administration and the theatre (along with its sister theatre in the borough) closed. The administrator began looking for a buyer for the Trust. Audience numbers had doubled under the new management, but this was still not enough for the Trust to be financially viable without additional support.The Stage, 12 August 2016 Reopening of the theatre At a meeting in October 2018, the local council announced that the theatre would be brought back into use, following a successful bid to run the venue (on a 25-year lease) by Cryer Arts Ltd. The company plans a range of events, including music, film and theatre. In November 2019 it was announced that the theatre would reopen later that month. The local councillor responsible for cultural services, Steve Cook, said: \\"I‚Äôm really pleased that we have completed this lease and that Cryer Arts can move forward with their plans to make the Cryer a real asset to the community and a successful business. It‚Äôs great to have a new performance and music space and this has come at a good time for our bid to be London Borough of Culture in 2023. I wish Cryer Arts every success and would encourage everyone to visit, use the restaurant and bar, see a performance or hire the theatre for their group.\\"Sutton Guardian Transport The theatre is on TfL bus routes 127, 157, 407, and X26, and within walking distance of Carshalton railway station and Wallington railway station.

The game was released on June 6, 2014 for Microsoft Windows and OS X.  Gameplay  The core gameplay mechanic of Concursion is the progress across a series of separately defined levels which each feature a different take on the interplay among five different two-dimensional video game worlds overlapping one another for mysterious reasons. As the player passes through each geometrically defined genre region, the player's appearance and control scheme frequently transform in real time between: speed-based platformer, combat- based platformer, space shooter, jetpack explorer, and maze runner. The game's enemies, furthermore, will change form and behavior when crossing the border from one game dimension to another. There is a shared health system for all hero types, and the player will die when the health pool is reduced to zero by taking damage, or when they fall into a pit. The goal of Concursion is to rescue Princess Honeybluff, a stereotypical video game princess, who is kidnapped by a similarly stereotypical bad guy, Darklord Biganbad, at the game's start. Throughout the game, there are ‚Äúgem shards‚Äù to collect, which impact the player's ability to find the princess and put the world back to normal. There are seven acts, each consisting of a number of levels (between seven and eleven per act). Each level has a target time for completion, and a set number of gem shards to collect. Each act ends when the player defeats a Boss.  Development  Concursion is the first game developed by Puuba, Inc, an indie video game company owned and operated by Daniel Garfield, based in Encino, California. Christopher Hoag, an Emmy nominated composer best known for his work on the pilot episode of the TV show House, created a soundtrack for Concursion that features multiple versions of each level song, each aurally distinct from one another, which swap in real time, based upon which gameplay style is currently active in the game. Puuba developed Concursion over a period of fourteen months.  Reception  Metacritic gives the game a \\"mixed or average reviews\\" score of 66/100 based on 7 reviews. GameRankings gives the game a score of 66.6 based on 9 reviews. Shael Millheim of Impulse Gamer explains, \\"The game provides a fun, classic atmosphere that's easy to hop into, and keeps players on their toes.\\" Jeffrey Matulef of EuroGamer.net refers to Concursion as ‚Äúa premise so clever, so simple, that it‚Äôs a wonder it‚Äôs not been done before‚Äù. Pete Davison of USGamer.net says the game is ‚Äúan intriguing, creative curiosity worth keeping an eye on‚Äù.

O'Brian, D. Nez, and D. Close. 2006. Freshwater mussels (Bivalvia: Unionoida) of the Umatilla and Middle Fork John Day rivers in eastern Oregon. Northwest Science 80:95-107 However, this species is still common throughout parts of the northern Rocky Mountains, although some populations in Montana may be declining. The species is also found east of the Continental Divide in the headwaters of the Missouri River. Originally these populations were identified as the eastern species Margaritifera margaritifera, but recently scientists have confirmed that the populations are in fact M. falcata, which means that the species somehow was able to cross the divide.Gangloff, M. M. and D.L. Gustafson. 2000. The mussels (Bivalvia: Unionida) of Montana. Central Plains Archaeology 8(1):121-130 The most likely explanation for this distribution is headwater capture, where pre-glacial watersheds were cut and reconfigured by glacial advance or retreat. Westslope cutthroat trout are thought to have crossed the Continental Divide from the West into the headwaters of the present-day Missouri River during the Pleistocene glaciation, more that 20,000 years ago. Since cutthroat trout are an important host species for the glochidia larvae of M. falcata, it is likely that the mussels crossed the divide by hitching a ride on the trout.

The museum also manages other heritage sites. History The main museum was founded on 1 May 1814 by three people, Professor Faustin Ens, Franz M√ºckusch von Buchberg and the mayor of Opava Johann Joseph Sch√∂√üler. The museum was placed into a building that was a grammar school and the new collection was known as the Museum Gymnazijni. During the nineteenth century three more museums were founded in the town. After the first world war the Czechoslovak state created a Silesian Museum and an Agricultural Museum was started in 1924 and a Leigionnaires Museum dedicated to the spirit of resistance. This multitude of museums was partially simplified in 1939 when the Museum Gymnazijni and the Silesian Museum were merged as the Reichsgaumuseum. At the end of the war this museum's collections gained artefacts from nearby buildings and the confiscated property of German people. In 1949 the Reichsgaumuseum was given its last name change when it became this Silesian Museum. The museum's current authority comes from a document dated 27 December 2000. Description Owl exhibition The museum is the third largest museum in the Czech Republic and it has 2,400,000 artefacts.Silesian Museum, in English, retrieved 19 August 2014 The museum cares for a number exhibits which are distributed at different locations.

In: Proceedings of the Fifth Nilo-Saharan Linguistics Colloquium, Nice, 1992. ed. R. Nicolai and F. Rottland. 68‚Äì118. K√∂ln: Rudiger K√∂ppe. Earlier proposals along this line were made by linguist Edgar Gregersen in 1972. These proposals have not reached a linguistic consensus, however, and this connection presupposes that all of the Nilo-Saharan languages are actually related in a single family, which has not been definitively established. Linguist Christopher Ehret has made a case that a proto-Nilotic language was spoken by the third millennium B.C. He cites the eastern Middle Nile Basin south of the Abbai River as the supposed urheimat of the speakers of this language, that is to say south-east of present-day Khartoum.Ehret, Christopher. An African Classical Age: Eastern & Southern Africa in World History 1000 B.C. to A.D.400. University of Virginia, 1998, p. 7 Beginning in the second millennium B.C., particular Nilotic communities began to move southward into far South Sudan, where most settled. However, the societies today referred to as the Southern Nilotes pushed further on, reaching what is present-day north-eastern Uganda by 1000 B.C. The earliest area in the Great Lakes region that is recognized as inhabited by the Southern Nilotic speakers lies in the present day Jie and Dodoth country in Uganda.De Vries, Kim. Identity Strategies of the Argo-pastoral Pokot: Analyzing ethnicity and clanship within a spatial framework. Universiteit Van Amsterdam, 2007 p. 39 Early presence in East Africa Areas where Nilotic languages are spoken Ehret postulates that between 1000 and 700 BC, the Southern Nilotic speaking communities, who kept domestic stock and possibly cultivated sorghum and finger millet, lived next to an Eastern Cushitic speaking community with whom they had significant cultural interaction. The general location of this point of cultural exchange was somewhere near the common border between Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, and Ethiopia. This corresponds with a number of historical narratives from the various Kalenjin sub-tribes, which point to Tulwetab/Tuluop Kony (Mount Elgon) as their original point of settlement in Kenya. There are also accounts from Kalenjin speaking communities, in particular, the Sebeii, living near Mt. Elgon, who point to Kong'asis (the East), and more specifically the Cherangani Hills, as their original homelands in Kenya.Kipkorir, B.E. The Marakwet of Kenya: A preliminary study. East Africa Educational Publishers Ltd, 1973, p. 64 The impact of the cultural exchange that occurred around the Mt. Elgon region was most notable in borrowed loan words, adoption of the practice of circumcision, and the cyclical system of age-set organisation.Ehret, Christopher. An African Classical Age: Eastern & Southern Africa in World History 1000 B.C. to A.D.400. University of Virginia, 1998, p.161-164 Neolithic The beads and pendants forming this c. 3,000-year-old neck chain are of the Elmenteitan culture and were among the finds at Njoro River cave. The arrival of the Southern Nilotes on the East African archaeological scene is correlated with the appearance of the prehistoric lithic industry and pottery tradition referred to as the Elmenteitan culture.Ehret, C., History and the Testimony of Language, p.118 online The bearers of the Elmenteitan culture developed a distinct pattern of land use, hunting, and pastoralism on the western plains of Kenya during the East African Pastoral Neolithic. Its earliest recorded appearance dates to the ninth century BC (i.e. 900 to 801 BC). It is thought that around the fifth and sixth centuries BC, the speakers of the Southern Nilotic languages split into two major divisions: the proto- Kalenjin and the proto-Datooga. The former took shape among those residing to the north of the Mau range, while the latter took shape among sections that moved into the Mara and Loita plains south of the western highlands.Ehret, C., History and the Testimony of Language, p.118 While few large-scale excavations have been done on sites outside the Central Rift, regional surveys indicate that the population was far denser in the southern highlands during this time.Goldstein, S., Quantifying endscraper reduction in the context of obsidian exchange among early pastoralists in southwestern Kenya, 2014, W.S.Mney & Son, p.5 online The Datooga were specialized pastoralists on considerable scale, spreading their settlements westward after 400BC across the Mara plains and as far as southeastern Lake Nyanza. Their presence on the Mara and Loita plains would continue through to the seventeenth century AD when they were driven south by the Maasai during the Il-Tatua wars.Ehret, C., An African Classical Age, Eastern & Southern Africa in World History, 1000B.C to A.D400, p.162 Archaeological and linguistic evidence point to significant differences in ways of life between the Elmenteitan culture and the Savanna Pastoral Neolithic cultures that had preceded them in Kenya. =Lithic industry= Grinding stones, pestles and axes of the East African Pastoral Neolithic For both the Elmenteitan and SPN producing societies, obsidian was the dominant source of lithic raw material for tool production, though lower quality alternatives were used occasionally. The obsidian was sourced at two discrete points with the Elmenteitan culture sourcing their obsidian from an outcrop of green obsidian on the northeast slope of Mt. Eburu.Goldstein, S., Quantifying endscraper reduction in the context of obsidian exchange among early pastoralists in southwestern Kenya, 2014, W.S.Mney & Son, p.5 =Social organisation= The Southern Nilotes of this time, like some of their neighbors, practiced circumcision of both sexes though significant differences in practice are discerned through linguistics. Unlike the Southern Cushities and somewhat like the early Bantu, they initiated circumcised men into age- sets. The age-sets, however, were quite different from those of the Bantu of the time in that they formed a cycling system which in its early form comprised both age-sets as well as a generational component. It is thought that the eight age-sets in the system were grouped into two generations, each comprising four of the sets. Within the system, a man and his son would belong to age-sets that were of alternate generations. Alongside the age-sets there was an age grade system which had been simplified to a two-tier system by the early stages of the Sirikwa era. By that time, a young man when initiated would join an age-set while simultaneously joining the first age-grade known as muren. At the same time, his father would join the senior age-grade known as payyan. It is speculated, though yet unproven, that the age-grade system of the Southern Nilotic period comprised four pairs of age-grades to match the four stages of each generation in the age-set system. The full complexity of this system would breakdown differently in the descendant communities with the Kalenjin retaining the age-sets and losing the age-grades while the Datooga dropped the age-sets and retained the age-grades as central to social cohesion. =Burials= The Southern Nilotic speakers cremated their deceased in caves as at Njoro River cave, Keringet caves and possibly Egerton caves, much unlike the Southern Cushitic speakers who buried their dead in cairns. Both however had similar grave goods, which typically included stone bowls, pestle rubbers and palettes.Robertshaw, P., The Elmenteitan; an early food producing culture in East Africa, Taylor & Francis, p.57 onlineEhret, C., and Posnansky M., The Archaeological and Linguistic Reconstruction of African History, University of California, 1982 online Pastoral iron age =Early iron age= Linguistic studies indicate separate and significant interaction between the Southern Nilotic speakers and Bantu speaking communities. Word evidence shows that in this interaction, there was highly gendered migration from the Bantu speaking communities into Southern Nilotic-speaking areas during the period, ca. 500-800 A.D., with Luhya women being the migrants. The evidence for this lies in the words that passed from the Bantu language into the Southern Nilotic language during this period. In contrast to the wide variety of Kalenjin loanwords in Luhya today, all but one of the words that were adopted from Luhya relate to cultivation and cooking, which were traditionally women's duties in ancient Luhya society. It has been suggested that the social institution of marriage led to the select migration. In that, whereas the Southern Nilotic speaking pastoralists contracted marriage through payment of cattle and other livestock by the groom's family to the prospective bride's family, the Bantu of 1500 to 2000 years ago likely contracted marriage through bride service, whereby the prospective groom would work in the potential bride's household for a period of time. This arrangement, therefore, served to make men the migrants in contrast to payment of bride price which made women the migrants. The marrying of Luhya women to Kalenjin men would have conferred benefits to men of both societies at the time since for the Kalenjin, Luhya women would have contributed expanded agricultural variety and productivity to the homestead. On the other hand, a Luhya father, by marrying his daughter to a Kalenjin man could increase his own wealth and position within Luhya society. Over the long term such relations, by increasing men's wealth in cattle, undoubtedly helped bring into being new customary balance's between men and women's authority and status in Luhya society. These societies are today patrilineal unlike the ancient Luhya societies which appear to have been matrilineal.Lacassen, J. Lacassen, L. and Manning, P, Migration History in World History: Multidisciplinary Approaches, 2010 pg. 139 =Late iron age= From the archaeological record, it is postulated that the emergence and early development of the Sirikwa culture occurred in the central Rift Valley i.e. Rongai/Hyrax Hill, not later than the 12th century A.D. From here the culture expanded into the western highlands, the Mt. Elgon region and possibly into Uganda.Kyule, David M., 1989, Economy and subsistence of iron age Sirikwa Culture at Hyrax Hill, Nakuru: a zooarcheaological approach p. 211 For several centuries, the Sirikwa, linguistic ancestors of the Kalenjin would be the dominant population of the western highlands of Kenya. At their greatest extent, their territories covered the highlands from the Chepalungu and Mau forests northwards as far as the Cherangany Hills and Mount Elgon. There was also a south-eastern projection, at least in the early period, into the elevated Rift grasslands of Nakuru which was taken over permanently by the Maasai, probably no later than the seventeenth century. Here Kalenjin place names seem to have been superseded in the main by Maasai namesSpear, T. and Waller, R. Being Maasai: Ethnicity & Identity in East Africa. James Currey Publishers, 1993, p. 42 (online) notably Mount Suswa (Kalenjin - place of grass) which was in the process of acquiring its Maasai name, Ol-doinyo Nanyokie, the red mountain during the period of European exploration.Pavitt, N. Kenya: The First Explorers, Aurum Press, 1989, p. 107 Archaeological evidence indicates a highly sedentary way of life and a cultural commitment to a closed defensive system for both the community and their livestock during the Sirikwa era of Kalenjin prehistory. Family homesteads featured small individual family stock pens, elaborate gate-works and sentry points and houses facing into the homestead; defensive methods primarily designed to proof against individual thieves or small groups of rustlers hoping to succeed by stealth.Spear, T. and Waller, R. Being Maasai: Ethnicity & Identity in East Africa. James Currey Publishers, 1993, p. 44-46 (online) A commitment to trade in this period is also highlighted by fact that the ancient caravan routes from the Swahili coast led to the territories of the Kalenjin ancestors.Hollis A.C, The Nandi - Their Language and Folklore. The Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1909, p. xvii Pre-19th century A body of oral traditions from various East African communities points to the presence of at least four significant Kalenjin-speaking population groups present prior to the 19th century. Meru oral history describes the arrival of their ancestors at Mount Kenya where they interacted with a community referred to as Lumbwa. The Lumbwa occupied the lower reaches of Mount Kenya though the extent of their territory is presently unclear. North-east of this community, across the Rift Valley, a community known as the Chok (later Suk) occupied the Elgeyo escarpment. Pokot oral history describes their way of life, as that of the Siger (or Sengwer), a community that appears to have lived in association with the Chok. The name Siger was used by the Karamojong and arose from a distinctive cowrie shell adornment favored by this community. The area occupied by the Sekker stretched between Mount Elgon and present-day Uasin Gishu as well as into a number of surrounding counties. Far west, a community known as the Maliri occupied present day Jie and Dodoth country in Uganda. The Karamojong would eject them from this region over the course of the century and their traditions describe these encounters with the Maliri. The arrival in the district of the latter community is thought by some to be in the region of six to eight centuries ago. Bordering these communities were two distinct communities whose interactions and those with the Kalenjin-speaking communities would lead to notable cultural change. The Maliri in Uganda were neighbored by the Karamojong, an Iron Age community that practiced a pastoral way of life. To the north of the Sekker and Chok were the Oropom (Orupoi), a late neolithic society whose expansive territory is said to have stretched across Turkana and the surrounding region as well as into Uganda and Sudan. Wilson (1970) who collected traditions relating to the Oropom observed that the corpus of oral literature suggested that, at its tail end, the society \\"had become effete, after enjoying for a long period the fruits of a highly developed culture\\". Towards the end of 18th century and through the 19th century, a series of droughts, plagues of locusts, epidemics, and in the final decades of the 19th century, a rapid succession of sub-continental epizootics affected these communities. There is an early record of the great Laparanat drought c.1785 that affected the Karamajong. However, for communities then resident in what is present-day Kenya many disaster narratives relate the start with the Aoyate, an acute meteorological drought that affected much of East and Southern Africa in the early nineteenth century. 19th century Nile records indicate that the three decades starting about 1800 were marked by low rainfall levels in regions south of the Sahara. East African oral narratives and the few written records indicate peak aridity during the 1830s resulting in recorded instances of famine in 1829 and 1835 in Ethiopia and 1836 in Kenya. Among Kenyan Rift Valley communities this arid period, and the consequent series of events, have been referred to as Mutai. A feature of the Mutai was increased conflict between neighboring communities, most noted of these has been the Iloikop wars. Earlier conflicts preceding the Iloikop wars appear to have brought about the pressures that resulted in this period of conflict. Von H√∂hnel (1894) and Lamphear (1988) recorded narratives concerning conflict between the Turkana and Burkineji or at least the section recalled as Sampur that appear to have been caused by even earlier demographic pressures. =Turkana - Burkineji conflict= Many foundation narratives, such as that of alt=Cheptaleel's Prayer.jpg Turkana narratives recorded by Lamphear (1988) provide a broad perspective of the prelude to the conflict between the Turkana and a community he refers to as Kor, a name by which the Turkana still call the Samburu in the present day. Lamphear notes that Tukana traditions aver that a dreamer among them saw strange animals living with the people up in the hills. Turkana warriors were thus sent forward to capture one of these strange beasts,which the dreamer said looked 'like giraffes, but with humps on their backs'. The young men therefore went and captured one of these beasts - the first camels the Turkana had seen. The owners of the strange beasts appear to have struck the Turkana as strange as well. The Turkana saw them as 'red' people, partly because of their lighter skin and partly because they daubed their hair and bodies with reddish clay. They thus gave them the name 'Kor'. Lamphear states that Turkana traditions agree that the Kor were very numerous and lived in close pastoral association with two other communities known as 'Rantalle' and 'Poran', the names given to the Cushitic speaking Rendille and Boran communities. According to Von H√∂hnel (1894) \\"a few decades\\" prior, the Burkineji occupied districts on the west of the lake and that they were later driven eastwards into present day Samburu. He later states that \\"some fifty years ago the Turkana owned part of the land on the west now occupied by the Karamoyo, whilst the southern portion of their land belonged to the Burkineji. The Karamoyo drove the Turkana further east, and the Turkana, in their turn, pushed the Burkineji towards Samburuland\\". =Collapse of Siger community= Lamphear states that Turkana narratives indicate that at the time of interaction with the 'Kor', the Turkana were in even closer proximity to a community referred to as Siger. This was the Karamoja name for the community and derived from an adornment that this community favored. The Siger like the Kor, were seen as a 'red' people, they are also remembered as a 'heterogeneous, multi-lingual confederation, including Southern and Eastern Nilotic-speakers, and those who spoke Cushitic dilects'. According to Turkana traditions the Siger once held most of the surrounding country 'until the Kor and their allies came up from the south and took it from them. In the process, the Kor and Siger had blended to some extent'. According to Lamphears account, Turkana traiditons directly relate the collapse of the 'Siger' to the Aoyate. He notes that; The collapse of the Siger/Sengwer community is generally believed to have seen the rise of a prophet-diviner class among many pastoral communities and a period marked by reformation. Cultural changes, particularly the innovation of heavier and deadlier spears amongst the Loikop led to significant changes in methods and scale of raiding. The change in methods introduced by the Loikop also consisted of fundamental differences of strategy, in fighting and defense, and also in organization of settlements and of political life. The cultural changes played a part in significant southward expansion of Loikop territory from a base east of Lake Turkana. This expansion led to the development of three groupings within Loikop society. The Sambur who occupied the 'original' country east of Lake Turkana as well as the Laikipia plateau. The Uasin Gishu occupied the grass plateaus now known as the Uasin Gishu and Mau while the Maasai territory extended from Naivasha to Kilimanjaro. This expansion was subsequently followed by the Iloikop wars. The expansion of Turkana and Loikop societies led to significant change within the Sirikwa society. Some communities were annihilated by the combined effects of the Mutai of the 19th century while others adapted to the new era. =Iloikop wars= Members of collapsing communities were usually assimilated into ascending identities. Three Nandi warriors. The 19th century saw wide annihilation and assimilation of many identities Significant cultural change also occurred. Guarding cattle on the plateaus depended less on elaborate defenses and more on mobility and cooperation. Both of these requiring new grazing and herd-management strategies. The practice of the later Kalenjin ‚Äì that is, after they had abandoned the Sirikwa pattern and had ceased in effect to be Sirikwa ‚Äì illustrates this change vividly. On their reduced pastures, notably on the borders of the Uasin Gishu plateau, when bodies of raiders approached they would relay the alarm from ridge to ridge, so that the herds could be combined and rushed to the cover of the forests. There, the approaches to the glades would be defended by concealed archers, and the advantage would be turned against the spears of the plains warriors.Spear, T. and Waller, R. Being Maasai: Ethnicity & Identity in East Africa. James Currey Publishers, 1993, p. 47 (online) More than any of the other sections, the Nandi and Kipsigis, in response to Maasai expansion, borrowed from the Maasai some of the traits that would distinguish them from other Kalenjin: large- scale economic dependence on herding, military organization and aggressive cattle raiding, as well as centralized religious-political leadership. The family that established the office of Orkoiyot (warlord/diviner) among both the Nandi and Kipsigis were migrants from northern Chemwal regions. By the mid-nineteenth century, both the Nandi and Kipsigis were expanding at the expense of the Maasai.Nandi and Other Kalenjin Peoples ‚Äì History and Cultural Relations, Countries and Their Cultures. Everyculture.com forum. Accessed 19 August 2014 The Iloikop wars ended in the 1870s with the defeat and dispersal of the Laikipiak. However, the new territory acquired by the Maasai was vast and left them overextended thus unable to occupy it effectively. This left them open to encroachment by other communities. By the early 1880s, Kamba, Kikuyu and acculturating Sirikwa/Kalenjin raiders were making inroads into Maasai territory, and the Maasai were struggling to control their resources of cattle and grazing land. The latter decades of the nineteenth century, saw the early European explorers start advancing into the interior of Kenya. Many present-day identities were by then recognized and begin to appear in the written record. In the introduction to Beech's account on the Suk, Eliot notes that they seemed \\"unanimous in tracing their origin to two tribes called Ch√¥k(or Ch≈©k) and Sekker (and that) at present they call themselves P√¥kwut...', he also recognizes five dialects, \\"Nandi, Kamasia, Endo (and) Suk, the difference being the greatest between the first and the last. The Maragwet language, which is presumably akin, appears not to have been studied, and there are probably others in the same case\\". About the time contacts were being made this time, two instances of epizootics broke out in the Rift Valley region. In 1883, bovine Pleuro-Pneumonia spread from the north and lingered for several years. The effect of this was to cause the Loikop to regroup and to go out raiding more aggressively to replenish their herds. This was followed by a far more serious outbreak of Rinderpest which occurred in 1891. This period - characterized by disasters, including a rinderpest epidemic, other stock diseases, drought, mass starvation, and smallpox was referred to as a Mutai. 20th century =Resistance to British rule= By the latter decades of the nineteenth century, the Kalenjin - more so the Nandi, had acquired a fearsome reputation. Thompson was warned in 1883 to avoid the country of the Nandi, who were known for attacks on strangers and caravans that would attempt to scale the great massif of the Mau.Pavitt, N. Kenya: The First Explorers, Aurum Press, 1989, p. 121 Koitalel Arap Samoei Mausoleum and Museum in Nandi Hills, Kenya Nonetheless, trade relations were established between the Kalenjin and incoming British. This was tempered on the Kalenjin side by the prophesies of various seers. Among the Nandi, Kimnyole had warned that contact with the Europeans would have a significant impact on the Nandi while Mongo was said to have warned against fighting the Europeans. Matson, in his account of the resistance, shows 'how the irresponsible actions of two British traders, Dick and West, quickly upset the precarious modus vivendi between the Nandi and incoming British'.Nandi Resistance to British Rule 1890‚Äì1906. By A. T. Matson. Nairobi: East African Publishing House, 1972. Pp. vii+391 Conflict, led on the Nandi side by Koitalel Arap Samoei - Nandi Orkoiyot at the time, was triggered by West's killing in 1895. The East Africa Protectorate, Foreign Office, and missionary societies administrations reacted to West's death by organizing invasions of Nandi in 1895 and 1897.Bishop, D. Warriors in the Heart of Darkness: The Nandi Resistance 1850 to 1897, Prologue Invading forces were able to inflict sporadic losses upon Nandi warriors, steal hundreds of livestock, and burn villages, but were not able to end Nandi resistance. 1897 also saw the colonial government set up base in Eldama Ravine under the leadership of certain Messrs. Ternan and Grant, an intrusion that was not taken to kindly by the Lembus community. This triggered conflict between the Lembus and British forces which included Maasai and Nubian soldiers and porters. The British eventually overcame the Lembus following which Grant and Lembus elder's negotiated a peace agreement. During the negotiations, the Lembus were prevailed upon by Grant to state what they would not harm nor kill, to which the response was women. As such, they exchanged a girl from the Kimeito clan while Grant offered a white bull as a gesture of peace and friendship. This agreement was known as the Kerkwony Agreement. The negotiations were held where Kerkwony Stadium stands today. On October 19, 1905, on the grounds of what is now Nandi Bears Club, Arap Samoei was asked to meet Col Richard Meinertzhagen for a truce. A grand-nephew of one of Arap Samoei's bodyguards later noted that ‚ÄúThere were about 22 of them who went for a meeting with the (European) that day. Koitalel Arap Samoei had been advised not to shake hands because if he did, that would give him away as the leader. But he extended his hand and was shot immediately\\".EastAfrican, December 5, 2008: Murder that shaped the future of Kenya Koitalel's death led to the end of the Nandi resistance. =Kalenjin identity= Until the mid-20th century, the Kalenjin did not have a common name and were usually referred to as the 'Nandi-speaking tribes' by scholars and colonial administration officials. Kenya African Democratic Union Eldoret Branch Starting in the 1940s, individuals from the various 'Nandi-speaking tribes' who had been drafted to fight in World War II (1939‚Äì1945) began using the term Kale or Kore (a term that denoted scarification of a warrior who had killed an enemy in battle) to refer to themselves. At about the same time, a popular local radio broadcaster by the name of John Chemallan would introduce his wartime broadcasts show with the phrase Kalenjok meaning \\"I tell You\\" (when said to many people). This would influence a group of fourteen young 'Nandi-speaking' men attending Alliance School and who were trying to find a name for their peer group. They would call it Kalenjin meaning \\"I tell you\\" (when said to one person). The word Kalenjin was gaining currency as a term to denote all the 'Nandi- speaking' tribes. This identity would be consolidated with the founding of the Kalenjin Union in Eldoret in 1948 and the publication of a monthly magazine called Kalenjin in the 1950s. In 1955 when Mzee Tameno, a Maasai and member of the Legislative Assembly (LEGCO) for Rift Valley, tendered his resignation, the Kalenjin presented one candidate to replace him; Daniel Toroitich arap Moi. By 1960, concerned with the dominance of the Luo and Kikuyu, Arap Moi and Ronald Ngala formed KADU to defend the interests of the countries smaller tribes. They campaigned on a platform of majimboism (devolution) during the 1963 elections but lost to KANU. Shortly after independence in December 1963, Kenyatta convinced Moi to dissolve KADU. This was done in 1964 when KADU dissolved and joined KANU. 21st century Paul Tergat set a new world record to the marathon at Berlin, 2003. The Kalenjin have been called by some \\"the running tribe.\\" Since the mid-1960s, Kenyan men have earned the largest share of major honours in international athletics at distances from 800 meters to the marathon; the vast majority of these Kenyan running stars have been Kalenjin.Why Kenyans Make Such Great Runners: A Story of Genes and Cultures, Atlantic online From 1980 on, about 40% of the top honours available to men in international athletics at these distances (Olympic medals, World Championships medals, and World Cross Country Championships honours) have been earned by Kalenjin. In 2008, Pamela Jelimo became the first Kenyan woman to win a gold medal at the Olympics; she also became the first Kenyan to win the Golden League jackpot in the same year.Million Dollar Legs, The Guardian online Since then, Kenyan women have become a major presence in international athletics at the distances; most of these women are Kalenjin. Amby Burfoot of Runner's World stated that the odds of Kenya achieving the success they did at the 1988 Olympics were below 1:160 billion. Kenya had an even more successful Olympics in 2008. A number of theories explaining the unusual athletic prowess among people from the tribe have been proposed. These include many explanations that apply equally well to other Kenyans or people living elsewhere who are not disproportionately successful athletes, such as that they run to school every day, that they live at relatively high altitude, and that the prize money from races is large compared to typical yearly earnings. One theory is that the Kalenjin has relatively thin legs and therefore does not have to lift so much leg weight when running long distances.Running Circles around Us: East African Olympians‚Äô Advantage May Be More Than Physical, Scientific American online References Category:Kalenjin Category:History of Kenya ","title":"History of the Kalenjin people"},{"id":"43606030","title":"1999 Longford County Council election"},{"id":"43606034","text":"The Money Free Party is a political movement that has political parties in New Zealand and the United Kingdom.

Zbigniew Dunin Wasowicz  Family  He was the son of Boleslaw Dunin-Wasowicz, a local nobleman, officer of the Imperial Austrian Army and chamberlain at the imperial court. Furthermore, his grandfather, Mikolaj Dunin-Wasowicz, was a Chevau-l√©ger during Napoleonic Wars, who fought in the Battle of Somosierra.  Military career  After graduation from military cadet school in Lobzow (now a district of Krak√≥w), Dunin-Wasowicz became a professional officer of the Austro-Hungarian Army. In 1910, he became Second Lieutenant of Cavalry, serving in the 13th Cavalry Regiment. In 1912 he was transferred to reserve, and became an active participant of Polish paramilitary unit, the Riflemen's Association. In August 1914, after mobilization had been announced, he came to Krak√≥w and on August 11 was named commandant of a mounted unit of the Sokol movement. Together with his unit, Dunin-Wasowicz crossed the pre-1914 border between Austrian Galicia and Congress Poland. He fought the Russians in the area of Kielce, and on August 23 was sent back to Krak√≥w, charged with training of additional cavalry units of Polish Legions in World War I. There, he formed 2nd and 3rd squadrons, and in early September 1914 was named commandant of the 2nd squadron. In October 1914, both squadrons were sent to Hungary, and then to Eastern Galicia, where on October 26 in Cyculow near Stanis≈Çaw√≥w, 2nd squadron was involved in its first clash with Russians. In recognition of his services and bravery, on November 2 Dunin-Wasowicz was promoted to the rank of Rittmeister. In late November and early December 1914, he fought with his unit in the area inhabited by Hutsuls, and in January 1915, Dunin-Wasowicz 2nd squadron was transferred to Bukovina, to repel Russian invasion of this province. Zbigniew Dunin-Wasowicz was killed on June 13, 1915, in the Charge of Rokitna. He was commemorated in one of the first zurawiejkas, called ‚ÄúSong of Wasowicz‚Äôs Squadron‚Äù: ‚ÄúOur Wasowicz, a great guy, beat up the Moskals in Cucylowa. Second squadron distinguished itself, by shedding streams of enemy blood‚Äù. He was buried at Rakowicki Cemetery in Krak√≥w: mass funeral of uhlans killed at Rokitna took place on February 25, 1923. A street in Krak√≥w was named after him. Dunin-Wasowicz was posthumously awarded Silver Cross of the Virtuti Militari and Cross of Independence.

Early life Sherman Drexler was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1925. He spent his infancy in Seagate, Coney Island but he grew up mainly in the Bronx. Drexler began painting at an early age; he took up and painting in earnest when he was 17 years old, modelling his work after Henri Matisse and Amadeo Modigliani. He was admitted to University of California, Berkeley as an English major, but began studying the works of Old Masters, Da Vinci in particular, and left Berkeley without completing his studies there. He earned his degree a decade later when he returned to receive a B.F.A.Bui, Phong. \\"Sherman Drexler with Phong Bui,\\" The Brooklyn Rail, July/August, 2009.' Career Drexler's first exhibition, in 1956, was in Berkeley, California at the Courtyard Gallery. Drexler returned to New York in the same year and began teaching at a local junior high school. In 1958, Drexler made his New York premier with an exhibition at the Seven Arts Gallery. He also enrolled at Hunter College where he studied under prominent artists including Robert Motherwell. Although Drexler was a figurative painter at a time when abstract expressionism enjoyed great popularity, he soon became a part of the New York School of the late 1950s and 1960s. He met and befriended Franz Kline, Andy Warhol and Alex Katz. In the early 1960s Drexler was featured in many solo exhibitions including shows at New York City galleries including the Rice and Tibor De Nagy Galleries. Many of Drexler's works in this period took female nudes as subjects, setting them against monochromatic backgrounds. Drexler's works often made reference to contemporary events, including Pete Rose's defeat by Joe DiMaggio, or mythical/biblical narratives, such as Leda and the Swan or Adam and Eve's expulsion from Eden. Drexler's works often portrayed the human body in motion. From 1961 to 1963, Drexler curated art exhibits for Special School (P.S.) #619 to benefit the Brother Island Drug Rehabilitation Facility in The Bronx. The facility closed in 1963. In 1966, Drexler was awarded a fellowship from the Guggenheim Foundation.Sherman Drexler at Guggenheim Foundation In 1983, Drexler made a journey to the Cave of Altamira in Spain and the Grotte Chauvet in southern France. The Paleolithic drawings that he saw there influenced his later work. Though Drexler continued his work with the female nude, he turned his attention to representing animals, using found objects, painting on stones wood and scrap metal as his canvases. He developed an interest in Primitivism which he displayed in 1995 in a group show featuring older artists titled \\"Still Working.\\"Ebony, David.\\" Sherman Drexler at 479 Gallery,\\" Art in America, 83.10; 128. In 2005, the New York Times reviewer Ken Johnson described a \\"persuasive sense of urgency\\" in the work and described Drexler as a \\"modern cave painter\\". Drexler died on July 19, 2014 of cancer at his studio in Newark, New Jersey.

The rose was hybridised by crossing the English rose 'Chaucer' (Austin, 1970) with the pink Hybrid Tea 'Aloha' (Boerner 1949) and is named after the breeder's father. It was one of the early English roses. Double, flat or slightly cupped flowers with a strong, fruity fragrance, and an average diameter of 10 cm (4 inches) appear in small cluster of 3 to 5 in flushes throughout the season. Their colour is an apricot blend, with stronger colours at the petal base, fading to cream at the edges. The flowers have about 70 petals arranged in a quartered bloom form, with the outer ones lighter than the inner ones, and are well suited as cut flowers. The tall and bushy shrub can grow well in excess of 200 cm, especially in warmer climates and is somewhat slow to rebloom, especially if not drastically pruned after the first flush. The cultivar has large leaves and fine, red prickles, is winter hardy up to ‚àí20 ¬∞C (USDA zone 5b ‚Äì 10b), but susceptible to black spot and mildew. Due to its size, it can be grown as a freestanding shrub, pegged or trained as a small climber. 'Charles Austin' was further used by Austin as a parent rose and fathered the cultivars 'Leander' (1982), 'Graham Thomas' (1983), 'Swan' (1987), 'Brother Cadfael' (1990), 'Golden Celebration' (1992), 'Tradescant' (1993), 'Teasing Georgia' (1998) and 'Benjamin Britten' (2001). In 1981, Austin introduced a sport (mutation) ‚Äì 'Yellow Charles Austin' ‚Äì with lemon to golden yellow colours, that fade to cream. Charles Austin (Ausfather) is one of a number of varieties which has been 'retired' by the David Austin Roses company in favour of other more modern and healthy varieties.

He failed at the imperial examinations many times, even though he had a reputation as a prodigy in his childhood, and eventually wrote for the newspaper Shen Bao in Shanghai. In 1892, he started what can be considered China's first for-profit literary magazine, the Wonderbook of Shanghai (Êµ∑‰∏äÂ•áÊõ∏; Haishang qishu), which lasted eight months, and in which he published his novel Shanghai Hua in instalments. The novel has been widely acclaimed as a classic (particularly by Lu Xun, Hu Shih, and Eileen Chang) but is little read today, likely due to its being written entirely in Wu Chinese, unintelligible to Mandarin speakers. It was translated into Mandarin and English by Eileen Chang. After Chang's death in 1995, the translation was discovered among her papers and published in English as The Sing-song Girls of Shanghai in 2005 after revision by Eva Hung.

While working as a freelance war correspondent during the Syrian Civil War, he was abducted on November 22, 2012, in northwestern Syria. He was beheaded in August 2014 purportedly as a response to American airstrikes in Iraq, thus becoming the first American citizen killed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS). Before he became a journalist, Foley was an instructor for Teach For America. In 2008, he became an embedded journalist with USAID-funded development projects in Iraq, and in 2011 he wrote for the military newspaper Stars and Stripes in Afghanistan, and GlobalPost in Libya. There, he was captured by Gaddafi loyalist forces and held for 44 days. The next year, James Foley was captured in Syria while he was working for Agence France-Presse and GlobalPost. Early life Foley was born in Evanston, Illinois, the oldest of five children born to Diane and John Foley of Rochester, New Hampshire. He grew up in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, where he attended Kingswood Regional High School. He was raised as a Catholic. In 1996, he graduated from Marquette University, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in History and Spanish, followed by a Master of Fine Arts from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2002, and a Master of Arts from Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism in 2008.  Career  Foley began his career as a teacher in Arizona for Teach For America (TFA). In 1999, Foley decided to pursue his MFA in Creative Writing at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst. Upon completion of his MFA in 2003, Foley returned to Phoenix for one year before relocating to Chicago in the summer of 2004 and taking a job teaching writing to young felons at the Cook County Boot Camp. In 2007, Foley enrolled in Northwestern's Medill School of Journalism, which signaled the beginning of his career as a journalist. Starting in 2008, Foley worked for USAID-funded 'Tatweer' development projects in Baghdad. He helped organize conferences and training seminars for a program designed to rebuild Iraq's civil service, crippled by decades of isolation and autocratic administration. In 2010, he left Iraq and applied for military embed- journalist accommodation status in Afghanistan to become a freelance journalist. He was an embedded journalist with U.S troops in Iraq, where his brother was serving as an officer in the United States Air Force. In January 2011, Foley joined Stars and Stripes as a reporter on assignment in Afghanistan. Two months later he was removed from his post after being detained by U.S. military police at Kandahar Air Field on suspicion of possessing and using marijuana. On March 3, 2011, Foley admitted that he had marijuana in his possession and resigned his position. In 2011, while working for the Boston-based GlobalPost, Foley went to Libya to cover the uprising against Muammar Gaddafi, embedding himself with rebel fighters.  2011 detention in Libya  According to media reports, on the morning of April 5, 2011, Foley, fellow American Clare Morgana Gillis, a freelance reporter (Atlantic Monthly, Christian Science Monitor, USA Today), as well as Spanish photographer Manu Brabo, were attacked and captured near Brega, Libya, by forces loyal to Gaddafi; fellow photojournalist Anton Hammerl was killed. When the shooting started, Foley and Gillis both heard Hammerl yell out, \\"Help!\\" Foley, Gillis, and Brabo were beaten by the pro-Gaddafi forces and then taken as their prisoners. Foley stated: \\"Once I saw Anton lying there dead, it was like everything had changed. The whole world has changed. I don't even know that I felt some of the blows.\\" Gillis said, \\"We all glanced down at him as we were being taken by, and I saw him just lying in a pool of blood. And then we were put into the truck and our heads were pushed down. We weren't able to see anything that happened after that to him.\\" Foley was released from jail 44 days later. On May 18, Foley, Gillis and Brabo, as well as Nigel Chandler (an English journalist also being held), were brought to the Rixos Hotel in Tripoli after release. Foley returned to Milwaukee to thank the community for praying for his safe return. In an interview, he said, \\"You go through different emotions when you're in captivity... These weird extreme ideas of where you are based on this capture. You don't want to be defined as that guy who got captured in 2011. I believe front line journalism is important [without it] we can't tell the world how bad it might be.\\" Foley also wrote an article for Marquette Magazine about how rosary prayers helped get him through his captivity. His experience of being captured did not deter him; he quickly returned to Libya, and was at the scene of Muammar Gaddafi's capture with GlobalPost correspondent Tracey Shelton on October 20, 2011.  Kidnapping in Syria, hostage negotiations, and rescue attempt  During the Syrian Civil War, Foley continued working as a freelancer for GlobalPost, in addition to other media outlets, such as Agence France-Presse. On November 22, 2012, Foley was kidnapped by an organized gang after departing from an internet caf√©, along with his translator and British journalist John Cantlie, in northwestern Syria while on their way to the Turkish border. Their taxi driver and Foley's translator were not taken. They were reportedly working on a film depicting Cantlie's abduction and dramatic rescue by four members of the Free Syrian Army in July 2012. Sources close to the family said that they believed Foley was kidnapped by the Shabiha militia, a group loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad. He was later reportedly held in a Syrian Air Force Intelligence complex in Damascus. During negotiations from November to December 2013, Foley's captors demanded 100 million euros in ransom (approximately 132 million U.S. dollars) from Foley's family, GlobalPost (his employer), and the U.S. in exchange for his release. The chief executive officer of GlobalPost, Philip Balboni, stated that the company spent millions on efforts to bring Foley home, including hiring an international security firm, Kroll Inc. In September 2013, the firm was able to locate Foley and track his location. He was moved many times during his captivity. Kroll's research led to GlobalPost reporting that Foley was being held in a Damascus prison run by Syrian Air Force Intelligence, along with at least one other Western journalist, possibly Austin Tice. In June 2014, ISIS released Danish photojournalist and fellow hostage Daniel Rye Ottosen, and Ottosen called Foley's family to recite a memorized message that came to be known as Foley's final letter. In it, Foley addressed members of his family, and described his captivity in a cell with seventeen other hostages, who passed the time with improvised strategy games and lectures. The family released the letter on their Facebook page shortly after Foley's death. (includes original letter) In July 2014, U.S. President Barack Obama authorized a \\"substantial and complex\\" rescue operation after the U.S. intelligence community said a \\"broad collection of intelligence\\" led them to believe that the hostages were being held at a specific location in Syria. However, the mission failed because the hostages had been moved. The operation involved special operations forces from multiple branches of the US military, including: the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, helicopters, fixed wing aircraft, and drones. When Delta Force commandos landed in the eastern Syrian city of Raqqa, they were met with gunfire, and it became apparent that the hostages had been moved. ISIS suffered numerous casualties, while American forces suffered a single minor injury. The operation was only declassified after Foley's death. It represented the first confirmation of U.S. troops operating on the ground within Syria during the Syrian Civil War. On August 12, 2014, ISIS sent Foley's parents an email saying that U.S. government‚Äîunlike other governments‚Äî had refused to pay ransoms or negotiate prisoner exchanges, and saying that they would kill Foley. The email's authors said they had left the U.S. alone since its \\"disgraceful defeat in Iraq,\\" but would \\"avenge\\" the U.S. bombings, initially with the death of Foley. John Foley, the father of James, said he didn't realize how \\"brutal\\" his captors were. Even after receiving the email, he held out hope that his son's release could still be negotiated. The family had reportedly been preparing to break U.S. law by offering to pay a ransom for his release. Due to his nationality, Foley's captors subjected him to regular torture and mock executions during his captivity.  Beheading  Foley's whereabouts were unknown to most until August 19, 2014, when ISIS uploaded a video to YouTube entitled \\"A Message to America\\". Though quickly deleted, it continued to circulate elsewhere on the Internet. Filmed in several takes,Foley execution footage 'may have been staged', au.news.yahoo.com. the video started with Obama's announcement of the first U.S. airstrikes against ISIL in Iraq. It then cut to Foley kneeling in the desert next to a masked, black-clad ISIL terrorist and reading a long message expressing regret. After Foley finished the message, the executioner condemned U.S. airstrikes and threatened that any aggression by America would \\"result in the bloodshed of your people.\\" This account gives a complete written transcription of the entire video. The actual beheading took place in less than ten seconds, although the entire recording was longer than four-and- a-half minutes. It did not show the actual moment of Foley's decapitation, unlike previous beheading videos, which typically showed the entire act. After Foley's beheaded corpse was shown, his executioner revealed that ISIL was holding another American journalist, Time magazine contributor Steven Joel Sotloff, and that he would be killed if President Obama failed to halt air strikes against ISIL.Parts of James Foley execution video may have been acted: experts, theaustralian.com.au. A video showing the beheading of Sotloff was released on September 2, 2014. The video of Foley being beheaded was shot at an unknown desert location, and media sources gave the name Jihadi John to the man (later discovered to be Mohammed Emwazi) who made the threats and spoke with a \\"Multicultural London English\\" accent. The video was produced and distributed by Al Hayat Media Center, a media outlet of ISIL and part of its propaganda arm, the Al-Itisam Establishment for Media Production, which targeted Western and non-Arabic speaking audiences. Foley's family confirmed his death on August 19. His mother, Diane Foley, posted on the Free James Foley page on Facebook: \\"We have never been prouder of our son Jim, he gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people\\". On August 20, the United States National Security Council confirmed that the video was authentic. ISIL appeared to have used post-production techniques on the execution video. On August 22, fellow hostage Peter Moore, who had been held with Foley before his release, called on their captors to release Foley's body to his family. British analyst Eliot Higgins offered photographic and video forensic evidence that Foley was executed at a spot in the hills south of the Syrian city Raqqa. Foley's remains were never recovered, despite efforts to do so.Barbara Starr, Lawmakers press for return of ISIS-slain US hostage bodies, CNN (September 22, 2016). =Death of perpetrator= The U.S. Justice Department conducted a criminal investigation into Foley's death. Attorney General Eric Holder said in 2014: \\"We will not forget what happened and people will be held accountable, one way or the other.\\" Mohammed Emwazi, who murdered Foley, was killed in a targeted drone strike in Raqqa in November 2015.'Jihadi John' death: Islamic State says Mohammed Emwazi killed, BBC News (January 16, 2016). Video In response to the widespread posting, viewing, and commenting on the video depicting Foley's murder, Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe warned \\"We would like to remind the public that viewing, downloading or disseminating extremist material within the UK may constitute an offence under terrorism legislation.\\" He went on to explain that while viewing the video was technically a crime, his officers would be focused on tracking down those who shared the footage or glorified it. Twitter and YouTube executives also warned objectionable material would be deleted and accounts that posted it, or spread it, would be blocked. Legacy Pope Francis called Foley's family to express his condolences. Foley's brother said he believed the U.S. government could have done more to save James during hostage negotiations, adding he hoped the government would \\"take another look at our approach to terrorist and hostage negotiation.\\" In 2014, Foley's family started the James W. Foley Legacy Fund to work in three areas: \\"building a resource center for families of American hostages and fostering a global dialog on governmental policies in hostage crises; supporting American journalists reporting from conflict zones and promoting quality educational opportunities for urban youth.\\" Former students and colleagues from Lowell elementary (where he taught for three years) have since started a scholarship in his name. The James Foley Scholarship in the J. William and Mary Diederich College of Communication was established at Marquette University in his honor.\\"James Foley scholarship, Marquette University\\" Retrieved August 23, 2014. On August 22, 2014, Indian sand artist Sudarsan Pattnaik created a sculpture depicting the face of Foley, made of four tons of sand on the beach of Puri city in the eastern province of Odisha. The sculpture, with a message reading \\"Don't kill innocents!\\", drew a sizeable crowd on the beach. The Boston-based GlobalPost, for which Foley had been a contributor, released a statement saying, \\"While we continue to send staff correspondents to Syria, we no longer accept freelance work from that war zone.\\" Agence France-Presse (AFP) also released a statement saying that it would \\"no longer accept work from freelance journalists who travel to places where we ourselves would not venture.\\" In 2016, the documentary film Jim: The James Foley Story was released, directed by Brian Oakes and distributed by Dogwoof. English singer Sting wrote and recorded \\"The Empty Chair\\", a song about Foley's fate, appearing as the last track on his solo studio album 57th & 9th released in November 2016. The song was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. According to Charlie Savage, writing in The New York Times, Foley's mother Diane has called for the individuals who murdered him and abused him, should be given a fair trial, not tried through a Guantanamo Military Commission. She argued that an unfair trial would aid the terrorist cause. The James W. Foley Legacy Foundation (JWFLF) was established following his death. His family and friends felt challenged to continue his legacy of commitment to the truth and compassion for those without a voice. The foundation seeks to \\"advocate for the safe return of Americans taken hostage [and] educate student journalists about staying safe in dangerous situations.\\"  See also * 2014 American Intervention in Syria * 2014 ISIL beheading incidents * Austin Tice * Daniel Pearl * Foreign hostages in Iraq * Islamist beheading * Kenneth Bigley * Nick Berg * John Cantlie * Steven Sotloff * Aafia Siddiqui * The Beatles, terrorist cell of ISIL that held Foley and eventually beheaded him * Mohammed Emwazi, Kuwaiti-British terrorist who beheaded Foley  Notes  References  External links  Articles written by James Foley at GlobalPost James Foley Foundation, family website * James W.

He is best known for his 38 years of work on the monumental Hermannsdenkmal near Detmold, honoring Arminius' victory over Roman troops in 9 AD. Early life  Ernst Bandel was born on 17 May 1800 at Ansbach. His father, Georg Karl Friedrich Bandel (1741‚Äì1818) was a Prussian civil servant (Regierungsdirektor). His childhood was dominated by political events (the French occupation in 1805; the 1813 War of Liberation) which left him a lifelong patriot. After Ansbach became Bavarian in 1806, Ernst's father worked for the new government and became the president of the local appellate court. In 1813, he became a noble. At fourteen, Ernst von Bandel began to take drawing lessons at the Academy of Fine Arts, Nuremberg, with the engraver . Two years later, he went to Munich to apply for a position with the Royal Bavarian Forestry Office. While there, he met the architect Karl von Fischer and became his student. His father's death in 1818 and the resulting financial stress almost forced him to give up his interest in art, but through his father's connections with the royal family, he was able to arrange a generous grant from King Maximilian I. The following year, he was given a job as a draftsman at the Hofbauamt (the office responsible for the construction and maintenance of the royal buildings). Bust of King Maximilian I (1826) Career as an artist In 1820, he refused a job offer as an assistant to the architect Leo von Klenze, as he was not amenable to Bandel's preference for the Gothic style. Later that year, he entered the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich, first as a painter but soon switched to sculpting. There, he studied under Moritz Kellerhoven, Wilhelm von Kobell and others. In 1819/20, he first worked on drafts for a statue of Arminius. In 1822/23, Bandel was at Nuremberg, working on completing the figures on the Gothic Sch√∂ner Brunnen While there, he met Karoline von Kohlhagen, whom he married in 1827. They were to have a total of seven children (five sons, two daughters). With a final stipendium from the king, he was able to study and work in Italy from 1825 to 1827. While in Rome he met Bertel Thorvaldsen and several members of the Nazarene movement, but was unimpressed by them. His closest associates were Ludwig Schwanthaler and . He worked as a sculptor in Rome. After his return to Germany, he made the figurine on the gable of the Staatliche Antikensammlungen, following a design by his teacher . He also found employment with Christian Daniel Rauch at the Glyptothek, where he remained until 1834. In 1832, he and Hans Ferdinand Massmann founded the local Gymnastics Society. Maximilian's successor, Ludwig I, asked Leo von Klenze to design the Walhalla memorial near Regensburg between 1830 and 1842. Bandel contributed to the work and made the statue of Franz von Sickingen. However, he felt the Neoclassical design to be alien to Germany and thus inappropriate for a national memorial. Bandel also had personal problems with some of his colleagues and the king. Bandel found himself receiving little support or understanding from the new king, so he moved to Berlin in 1834, following his former employer, Rauch, who was working on a huge equestrian statue of Frederick the Great. He soon began making his own proposals for a grand national monument, but got little encouragement and less interest, so he moved, this time to Hanover where, with the intercession of architect , King William IV entrusted him with the design of the residential palace. Bandel contributed to the interior design of the palace and the Schlosskirche (chapel). He also worked on the new auditorium at Georg August University in G√∂ttingen, creating the pediment reliefs and a statue of William IV in front of the building. The Hermannsdenkmal Bandel with Hermann's head (1872). Photograph by From 1837 to 1846, he lived in Detmold, working on the Hermannsdenkmal, which had been a lifelong dream of Bandel's. It commemorates a victory over three Roman Legions by the Cheruscian prince, Arminius (Hermann, in German), in 9 AD. In 1838, Bandel again travelled to Italy, meeting Ludwig I en route, who offered financial support to the Hermannsdenkmal, but requested some changes. At Carrara, Bandel worked on a statue of Thusnelda, wife of Arminius, eventually sold to the Prince of Lippe. Another trip to Italy followed in 1843/44. After a great deal of initial support for the project, public interest began to wane and donations decreased dramatically. Bandel had to use up his entire personal fortune in an effort to complete the monument. In 1846, he had a falling out with the Hermannsverein (the civic association promoting the project) over financial issues. He returned to Hanover, broke and embittered, but began re-soliciting donations. After the end of the Franco-Prussian War, the government and the public found their enthusiasm for the project restored. Bandel now made the copper plates for the statue at a Hanover workshop. In 1869, Wilhelm I (William I) visited him there. From 1871, Bandel worked at Detmold again and in 1872 moved to the construction site with his wife. In 1873, the Hanover workshop was closed. The statue was finally inaugurated on 16 August 1875 by (as he now was) Kaiser William I. After the creation of the German Empire, the Reichstag and the Kaiser had provided the necessary sum for completion. Bandel took part in the ceremony, and by now had become a celebrity, showered with honors including honorary citizenship of Detmold (1871) and Ansbach (1875). William I awarded him a lifelong stipend of 4,000 thaler per year. Tomb of Ernst von Bandel However, Bandel had been weakened by the years of work on the exposed hilltop and by kidney disease. He opened a studio in Hanover and in 1876 went on another trip to Italy. He died on the return trip at his half-brother's estate at Neudegg near Donauw√∂rth on 25 September 1876. He is buried at the ' at Hanover. References  Further reading  * Brigitte B√∂tel: Joseph Ernst von Bandel (1800‚Äì1876). Das bildhauerische Werk. Dissertation.

An agreement between Azerbaijan and Georgia allows hikers to cross the border freely to and from the reserve.\\"Lagodekhi Protected Areas\\", Kakheti Travel, retrieved 22 August 2014. Flora and fauna Hornbeam-beech forest The reserves extend from beech forests (broadleaf woodland dominated by Oriental beech) to the Alpine zone. Approximately 70% of the area is forested; the second and third most prominent trees are European hornbeam and various species of maple (particularly velvet maple, Cappadocian maple, field maple and Norway maple). The forest includes a wide variety of plant species; reputedly almost two thirds of those found in the entire country; and the lowland parts have been compared to the warm temperate vegetation in the Black Sea region (locally called \\"subtropical\\").PilƒÅts and Laivi≈Ü≈°, p. 113. Lagodekhi is also known for its animal life, and has been famous for its hunting. It is one of the major reserves for the East Caucasian turPaul J. Weinberg, \\"Capra cylindricornis\\", Mammalian Species 695, 5 July 2002, pp. 1-9, p. 6. and also has many chamois and red deer. Major predators include Eurasian lynx, grey wolf, brown bear, and the raptors bearded vulture, eastern imperial eagle, golden eagle and steppe eagle. Altogether 150 species of birds, 53 mammals, 5 amphibians, 12 reptiles, and 4 fish are found in the reserves; 26 of the plants and more than 40 of the animals are in the Red Data Book of Georgia listing of rare and endangered species. The raccoon, an alien species, is also present in the Lagodekhi reserves.PilƒÅts and Laivi≈Ü≈°, p. 126. History Tourists at the entrance to the reserve The Lagodekhi reserves include archaeological traces of Bronze Age settlement and burials, especially in the village of Ulianovka. The reserves originated with the Polish army officer and amateur naturalist Ludwik M≈Çokosiewicz, who established a regimental park at the settlement of Lagodekhi while stationed with the garrison there. After resigning from the army out of pacifism in 1861, he was ultimately arrested on returning to Tiflis and sent back to Poland, but returned in 1867 and spent the rest of his life living with his family on a cottage farm in the forest, studying the flora and fauna of the area as Inspector of Forests for the Signakhi District. He discovered more than 60 species and supplied specimens to collections in other countries.PilƒÅts and Laivi≈Ü≈°, pp. 115, 121-22. Beginning in 1889, M≈Çokosiewicz urged that the area be protected, but this did not occur until 1912, after advocacy by the Imperial Russian Geographical Society and by Nikolai Ivanovich Kuznetsov, a professor of geobotany at the University of Dorpat (now Tartu). In response to his report and the society's urging that the forest no longer be used for firewood, the Tsar's viceregent in the Caucasus region accepted the application for a strict nature reserve,PilƒÅts and Laivi≈Ü≈°, pp. 115-16, 122-24. the first reserve to be established in the Caucasus region.George Nakhutsrishvili, \\"Georgia: Protected Areas\\", in The Vegetation of Georgia (South Caucasus), Geobotany Studies, New York: Springer, 2013, , pp. 223-25. After the Russian Revolution, poaching and probably wood gathering were problems in the reserve. In 1929 it was again declared a strict nature reserve (zapovednik). The Soviets created other nature reserves as well as hunting reserves in Georgia, and in 1935, 1945 and 1970 increased the size of the Lagodekhi reserve; but conversely in 1951 they eliminated all zapovedniks in Georgia except for Lagodekhi, and again in 1962-64 reduced the number of such reserves while leaving Lagodekhi intact. It was also not used for experiments in rehabilitation of endangered species from other regions, as were some other strict reserves.PilƒÅts and Laivi≈Ü≈°, pp. 117-18, 124-26. After the breakup of the Soviet Union and the re-establishment of independent Georgia in 1991, a period of war led to a great increase in poaching and reduction in the animal populations at Lagodekhi. In 1996 the country adopted the Laws on Protected Areas System and reclassified its natural areas under the International Union for Conservation of Nature schema, and in 2003 were added to the reserve at Lagodekhi and it was divided into a large strict reserve and a small managed reserve in the strip of land between the strict reserve and the neighbouring villages, in which tourist facilities including an information building and trails were created.PilƒÅts and Laivi≈Ü≈°, pp. 118-19, 126.
