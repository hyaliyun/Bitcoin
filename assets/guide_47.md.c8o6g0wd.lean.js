Cuomo disbanded the commission after approving modest ethics reform in March 2014, whereupon U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara announced that he would continue investigating the commission's targets and the governor's office itself. History The commission's investigations included looking into the use of \\"housekeeping accounts\\" held by politicians, and how the funds contributed to these accounts were used. In New York, such accounts are permitted for general administrative expenses and are allowed to accept unlimited donations‚Äîbut the funds may not be used for campaign expenses, including political advertising. According to the New York Times, one target for this element of the investigation was the New York Democratic Party, which is alleged to have spent as much as $4 million from housekeeping accounts on television advertising. Governor Cuomo The commission also issued subpoenas to the law firms that employ many New York legislators, including the Assembly speaker Sheldon Silver, and Senate leaders Dean Skelos and Jeffrey D. Klein. The purpose of the subpoenas was to determine what work the full-time legislators performed to earn their outside income, and whether any conflict of interest existed between the clients of the legislators and the firms and the business of the state. The legislature sued in state court, arguing that the governor and the Moreland Commission did not have the power to issue subpoenas. The lawsuit was dropped when the commission was disbanded. The commission was discontinued by Governor Cuomo in March 2014, after a package of ethics reforms was negotiated into the annual state budget by the New York legislature. The commission issued a preliminary report of its findings on December 2, 2013. During its work and following its dissolution, the governor's office was accused of interfering with and restricting the investigations of the commission. Media reports alleged that Lawrence Schwartz, the secretary to the governor, barred the commission from issuing subpoenas to organizations with ties to Governor Cuomo, and that the commission was not permitted to investigate any improprieties on the part of the executive administration. In response, Cuomo argued that the commission was an executive body that was not independent, and the Moreland Act under which the commission was convened allowed him to monitor and control its activities. In quotes reported by Crain's New York, Cuomo said \\"It's not a legal question. The Moreland Commission was my commission... It's my commission. My subpoena power, my Moreland Commission. I can appoint it, I can disband it. I appoint you, I can un-appoint you tomorrow.\\" Ex-U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara After the commission was disbanded, the governor and the commission were criticized by government watchdogs, New York prosecutors and the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara. Bharara opened an investigation into the commission, the possible interference by the governor's office, and into the targets of the commission's own incomplete investigations. He also instructed legislators and the governor's office to retain any documents related to the commission. In 2015, investigations by Bharara's office resulted in the arrest and conviction of Assembly speaker Silver and Senate majority leader Skelos. Then in January 2016 the U.S. Attorney announced the end of his investigation into the closing of the commission. In March 2017, President Donald Trump fired Bharara in the midst of an investigation concerning Trump appointees. Bharara later tweeted: \\"By the way, I know what the Moreland Commission must have felt like.\\" References External links *Official website (archival link) Category:Political history of New York (state) Category:Anti-corruption agencies Category:Andrew Cuomo ","title":"Moreland Commission to Investigate Public Corruption"},{"id":"43375364","text":"The Sandringham Sandstone is a geologic formation in England.

It was produced by Frogpad Inc. The keyboard is optimized by character frequency. 85% of average keystrokes in English text can be typed without chording, and chords are limited to 2 fingers (opposable thumb and one finger). As a result, the FrogPad has many more keys than a GKOS or Microwriter or Baudot keyboard but fewer than a conventional computer keyboard.  History  The founder and CEO of the company was Linda Marroquin. She left the company in 2008.https://www.linkedin.com/in/frogpad The original FrogPads on the market at this time were intended to be used with mobile phones and supported only Bluetooth. Two attempts to relaunch the Frogpad had been made. The first was made in February 2012 by Frogpad and Linda Marroquin. However, due to funding difficulties, this launch was canceled and the cost of pre-ordered units was refunded to customers in June 2012. The second relaunch attempt was made by Andrew Taylor of IT consulting firm Satori Tech Solutions and began to advertise in November 2013 and solicit pre-orders in January 2014 for a \\"prototype\\" version to be delivered in February and a final production version in April of that year. However, neither version of the keyboards shipped, and a post on the company Facebook page from 20 May 2014 states that they \\"... WILL NOT ship a product I can‚Äôt be proud of that lives up to what all of you expect and deserve.\\". Since then, the company has ceased communication. On August 14, 2014, Frogpad founder Linda Marroquin stated that the Frogpad license to Satori Tech Solutions has expired and that she does not know why Mr. Taylor is not responding to consumers who pre-purchased products.

Life He was the only son of the Rev. Edward Harington by his wife, Frances, daughter of John Boote of Fifield House, Oxfordshire; Sir Edward Harington was his grandfather. He appears to have been educated privately, and entered Worcester College, Oxford, on 6 July 1824, aged 19, where he graduated B.A. in 1828, and M.A. in 1833. Taking orders (deacon 1828, priest 1829), Harington became incumbent of St David's Church, Exeter, and with the support of Bishop Henry Phillpotts of Exeter, was made a prebendary of Exeter Cathedral in 1845, and in 1847 chancellor of the church. He resigned his incumbency, and concentrated on diocesan work, especially education. He managed consensus in establishing the Diocesan Training College, taught there, and contributed to its endowments. In 1856 he became a canon residentiary of Exeter, spending no less than ¬£15,000 on the repairs of the fabric, and ¬£1,000 in providing seats in the nave. He also acted as subdean. Harington was shy and considered somewhat eccentric, residing at first with his sisters and then alone. He attended the turning of the first sod of every new railway in England, and collected a good library. On 4 July 1881 he was attacked by apoplexy while attending a meeting at the Exeter Guildhall for the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and died on the 14th of the month. He was buried with his Haringtom ancestors at Kelston. Legacy Harington left money to the poor of Kelston parish, and bequeathed his library to the dean and chapter of Exeter Cathedral, with ¬£2,000 for a librarian. He left legacies to church institutions and to poor dependents.

Life and work Hallen was born in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1875. After spending six years in Puerto Rico and two years in Cuba, he was appointed as the official photographer of the Panama Canal by the Isthmian Canal Commission in 1907. Hallen was contracted to capture ‚Äú‚Ä¶ a series of photographs‚Ä¶ about once a month‚Ä¶ to show construction progress‚Äù to satisfy both Washington and the American public. In addition to showing the construction and progress of the Panama Canal, Hallen depicted the day-to-day life of the ‚ÄúZonians‚Äù ‚Äì Americans living in the Panama Canal Zone - and its development over the course of the years. Throughout his 30-year career, Hallen produced between 12,000 and 16,000 images, each with a ‚Äústrangely satisfying aesthetic experience‚Äù portraying life in the Panama Canal Zone. For his service to the Panama Canal Zone and as an employee of the Isthmian Canal Commission, Hallen was awarded the Roosevelt Medal with two bars. Hallen retired as the official photographer of the Panama Canal Zone in 1937, after 30 years of service. Hallen and his wife Maude then moved to Monterey Park, California. Hallen died in 1947 at the age of 72. The University of Florida Digital Collections maintains an extensive collection of Hallen's work for the Isthmian Canal Commission.

It was previously known as the Thanet Beds, the Thanet Sands and the Thanet Sand Formation. It was named after the Isle of Thanet. The type sections are Herne Bay in Kent for the upper part of the formation and Pegwell Bay for the lower part. It lies unconformably on the Late Cretaceous Chalk Group. It unconformably underlies the Lambeth Group, generally the Upnor Formation but in Essex it is the Reading Formation.  Distribution  The Thanet Formation is known at outcrop and in the subsurface over central and eastern parts of the London Basin. To the west it is missing, with the Lambeth Group lying directly on the Chalk, and to the north it is replaced by the Ormesby Clay Member. It thins to the west and north of London. It reaches a maximum thickness of over 30 m in North Kent.  Lithology  The predominant lithology is very pale grey or buff fine-grained glauconitic sand. Particularly towards the base of the formation, the sand is interbedded with silts and clays. At the base of the formation a bed of flint pebbles is often developed with clasts up to cobble size in a matrix of glauconitic clayey sand. At Herne Bay the beds are divided as follows (top to bottom): * A layer of concretionary blocks (‚Äòdoggers') of calcareous indurated sandstone of 0.3 metre thickness * A pale grey sandstone with abundant shells 2.6 metre thickness * A layer of calcareous sandstone doggers, 0.3 metre thickness * A bedded, clayey buff sand with many shells, seen to 0.9 metre thickness  Depositional environment  The Thanet Formation was deposited in open marine conditions. The water depth was relatively shallow, above normal wave-base, in an inner or outer shelf setting.  Fossil content  The sequence is known for its rich fossil content, particularly molluscs and fish. The fauna give somewhat contradictory evidence of the climate, with molluscs of both cold and warm water type being found and tropical to sub-tropical fish recognised. Overall, a sub-tropical climate is indicated. The formation also has provided fossils of flora of Pinus macrocephalus, Pinus prestwichi, Palmae and Osmunda dowkeri.

Allred had no involvement in the film's production, though he appeared in a cameo.  Release  A preview of G-Men from Hell screened at the 2000 San Diego Comic Con. Advanced Film released it in Germany, and Framework Entertainment released it on DVD in the US in 2002.  Reception  Dennis Harvey of Variety called it a goofy, nonsensical mystery that is somewhat entertaining. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club wrote, \\"G-Mens bare-bones production values are forgivable, but its lack of wit and creativity isn't.\\" Rachel Morgan of Film Threat rated it 3.5/5 stars and wrote, \\"The film is super campy, but fun to watch.\\" At DVD Talk, Earl Cressey rated it 2/5 stars and Bill Gibron rated it 1.5/5 stars; both called it boring and poorly acted. In Fervid Filmmaking, author and filmmaker Mike Watt wrote that the film is \\"the epitome of a Kitchen Sink movie\\", in which a cult film throws in every bizarre idea they can imagine.

Description  The Buildwas Formation comprises olive-green and grey calcareous mudstones and nodular to lenticular calcareous mudstones and argillaceous limestones with shell fragments present throughout. The basal part of the formation consists of grey-green rubbly mudstones, containing comminuted shell debris and overlies the mottled green, grey and purple mudstones of the Rubery Formation with a thick transition in colour and upward decrease in number of hard siltstone beds. The top of the Buildwas Formation shows a gradational increase in thickness of beds and a number of limestone beds, where it grades into the overlying Barr Limestone Formation. The thickness of the formation ranges from , with the thinnest outcrops occurring near Walsall thickening towards Wenlock Edge.

At its base is a bone-bed yielding ancient marine, reptilian and ammonite fossils. White lias varies in colour from white-cream to pale grey and is traditionally used for building and flooring. Evidence of its use can be seen in manor houses, churches and cathedrals all over the UK. It is most prevalent in the Somerset towns of Midsomer Norton, Radstock, Langport and Wincanton.

The album explores 12 Christmas carols exploring a wide set of musical genres including classical music and opera preserving the same musical track that Majida had sung over the years. The album peaked the top of the music charts in Virgin Megastores in Lebanon from the day of its release for several consecutive weeks. Critics also gave largely positive reviews, favoring its shift between modern and global sounds, and its ability to join these sounds with local music and Arabian themes. Lyrically, the record speaks of love, forgiveness, family and the relationship between God and men.  Development and release  Majida had been always known for her gratitude of praising the Lord as well as hosting many live recitals for charity or on television since the beginning of the 90s. In the summer of 2013, she got the chance to gather some of her most famous songs and carols previously performed in a unique studio album also with new ones written specially for this record. Nour Men Nour was released on December 6, 2013, and promoted on Lebanese radio stations by two singles, \\"Sahrit Eid\\" and \\"Min lli Tall\\", as well as a teaser on Majida's official Facebook page. it was promoted majorly online, via the official Facebook page and YouTube channel. Majida also filmed a Christmas special episode aired on Christmas Eve on MTV Lebanon which included a live recital from Coll√®ge du Sacr√©-C≈ìur catholic cathedral in Gemayzeh, Downtown Beirut, and scenes from a visit she had to \\"Mission De Vie\\" charity center. Bassem Christo directed the whole episode in HD for the first time on MTV channel and got a French lighting crew supervised by Jean-Philippe Bordon specially for this occasion. As Majida stated, Christmas is an occasion to celebrate as a one big Arabic family, while she added that all sales income and profits went to charity to encourage the spirit of sharing in the Arab World during the unstable periods.  Composition and musical styles  Lebanese violinist and music arranger Claude Chalhoub arranged all 12 tracks. He is also the music producer for this record and worked with the Berlin Symphony Orchestra (BSO). All the music was recorded and mixed in Berlin, Germany at FWL, N-HOW Studios by sound engineer Kai M√§eder, while Majida put her voice in JMR Studios in Lebanon where the album was also mastered by sound engineer Xavier Escabasse. The album booklet is designed by Michelle Daou and all photographs are taken by professional photographer Fares Jammal in the neighborhoods of Batroun in northern Lebanon. Starting with its wide arrangement, Nour Men Nour holds some of the most famous international tunes and jingles with new adapted styles, like the Waltz for \\"Sahrit Eid\\" with Arabic lyrics from Henry Zoughaib, originally \\"We Three Kings\\" composed by John Henry Hopkins, and \\"De'e Bwabon\\" originally adapted from \\"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing\\" by Felix Mendelssohn. Freely inspired from the ancient days of Bethlehem, Habib Younes wrote the lyrics of track 7, \\"Bethlehem\\" with music originally from \\"O Little Town of Bethlehem\\" by Lewis Redner. Younes also wrote most of the Arabic versions of the album carols such as track 8 adapted from the traditional music of \\"Deck the Halls\\" and Tango styled track \\"Rass El Seni\\", a short jingle composed by Khaled Mouzanar with folk music inspired arrangement. Henry Zoughaib wrote \\"Min Lli Tall\\", too. Its large string sections and harp noted a remarkable adaptation of Adolphe Adam's \\"O Holy Night\\" transposed to a classical mood carol by Majida's operatic abilities. Music composer and vocal coach Lena Khater composed \\"Fiyyi Raja\\" by poet Germanos Germanos and \\"Ya Raytak Bi Hal Milad\\" written by Nizar Francis. The special flavor that had \\"Fiyyi Raja\\" in the album was the choir accompaniment for Majida during the full recording reminding of the Byzantine music through the merge of more than one Arabic maqam without any orchestra included, while \\"Ya Raytak Bi Hal Milad\\" came expressing a different style with percussion interference and smooth a cappella moments. Track 11, \\"Yenaad Alaykon\\" gives the album its oriental character with music from Majida's late father Halim El Roumi. The song exposes warm wishes for the holidays' season with a joyful arrangement suitable for the lyrics by Habib Younes. \\"Woulida El Massih, Hallelujah\\" is a short Christmas jingle by Joseph Khalifeh, who also composed \\"Nour El Alam\\", a classical wide-ranged song with high pitches and large orchestration. Majida had always performed this song with the French poetry of \\"√î Verbe Dieu\\" but then switched to the Arabic lyrics specially for this record. Khalifeh also composed \\"Nachid El Hobb\\" previously released by Majida as a single in 2001 following her UN ambassador appointment. It is originally taken from the prologue of Dam'a wa Ibtisama (A Tear and A Smile) by Lebanese artist, poet and writer Gibran Khalil Gibran. Claude Chalhoub re- adapted the old version into a new one with a new dramatic orchestration exposing more the operatic pitches in the middle part as the song extends to more than two octaves.

Several of his still-life paintings are currently held by the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. and on display at the National Museum of African American History and Culture. Background Born in Savannah, Georgia on June 23, 1928 to a well-to-do family, whose members include Louis Pleasant, co-founder of the Savannah Tribune (known then as the Savannah Colored Tribune) and former director of the Savannah Ports Authority. As a child, Pleasant was featured on national radio as part of the Major Bowles Amateur Hour. However, despite his and his family's social contributions, their status was nevertheless mitigated by the climate of racial attitudes in the Jim Crow South. In his paintings, Pleasant sought to memorialize the local character of African-American life in Savannah amid the turmoil of the Civil Rights Movement. Pleasant himself had early on become active in the movement, frequently working in collaboration with friend and fellow civil-rights leader W. W. Law. His concern for Savannah's cultural and historical legacy lead to his 1971 publication of the first Black History coloring book. He served as a member of the Savannah NAACP and a Corporal in the United States Army. Pleasant continued to work in the entertainment industry until his death in 1997, primarily as television voice-over actor.

Bernard Perlin was an American painter. He is primarily known for creating pro-war art during World War II and magic realism paintings of urban American life.  Early life and education  Perlin was born in Richmond, Virginia in 1918 to Davis and Anna Schireff Perlin. His parents were Jewish immigrants from Russia, and his father died when Perlin was 10 years old. Perlin grew up with two older sisters, Mildred and Jeanette. At the encouragement of a high school teacher, he was enrolled in the New York School of Design. He studied there from 1934 to 1936, the National Academy of Design with Leon Kroll in 1937, and then the Arts Student League with Isabel Bishop, William Palmer, and Harry Sternberg until 1940.Who Was Who in American Art, Madison, CT: Sound View Press, 1999, vol. 3, page 2577. In 1938, he was awarded the Kosciusko Foundation Award to study in Poland.  Career  Perlin was rejected from service in the United States military because he was openly gay. He entered the Graphics Department of the Office of War Information in 1942, creating pro-war propaganda popular in the United States. The OWI was shut down in 1943 due to budgetary issues.Roth, Mitchel P., and James Stuart Olson. Historical Dictionary of War Journalism, Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 1997, , page 235. He continued his focus on war as an artist-correspondent for Life Magazine from 1943‚Äì1944 and then again for Fortune Magazine in 1945. As an artist-correspondent for Life, he brought back to the U.S. the first news and sketches obtained in Greece since the German occupation began in 1941.Perlin, Bernard, \\"Liberation will find the Greeks ready,\\" Life, Chicago, IL: Time Inc., September 4, 1944, pages 35‚Äì36 & 38. His two most notable wartime pieces, both created in 1943, are arguably his \\"Let Em Have It\\" war bonds ad, which depicts a soldier throwing a grenade, and \\"Americans Will Always Fight for Liberty,\\" a painting of World War II soldiers marching in front of Continental Army soldiers. In 1939, he painted a country scene on a post office wall for the US Treasury. After the war, his work began to focus on magic realism, aiming to capture special moments in everyday life. He produced his most famous work, Orthodox Boys, in 1948. The painting depicts two Jewish boys standing in front of a subway graffiti backdrop. In 1950, it was the first postwar work by an American artist to be acquired by Tate. Perlin moved to Italy for six years, and his work became more brightly colored. After moving back to New York City, Perlin grew distasteful towards the competitive culture of the city's art scene. He moved to Ridgefield, Connecticut, and continued to paint until the 1970s. After several years of retirement, a friend encouraged Mr. Perlin back to the canvas in 2012, and after completing two new pieces the Chair and the Maiden Gallery (New York City) hosted a retrospective of Mr. Perlin's work in 2013. In 1968, Bernard Perlin commemorated Mayor Richard J. Daley and the 1968 Democratic National Convention, which was held in Chicago, in a work entitled Mayor Daley. This example of Perlin's work has been used by educators to teach about the Vietnam War. The painting is currently at the Columbus Museum of Art.  Personal life  In 2009, Perlin married Edward Newell, his partner of 54 years. When he stopped painting, Perlin took up growing flowers. Perlin died at the age of 95 in 2014 in his home in Ridgefield. Awards and honors He received Guggenheim Fellowships in 1954 and 1959.  Legacy  Examples of his work are in a number of museums and libraries, including the Smithsonian Institution, the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Pritzker Military Museum & Library.

It comprises a low-lying area of flood meadows located at the head of the Teign Estuary by Kingsteignton. History In the Middle Ages the area was used for archery practice. It was later developed as a transport route for clay excavated from sites in Chudleigh Knighton, Preston and Kingsteignton areas, which were in full production from the 1700s. Clay was initially transported from the pits by packhorse to the nearest port; Teignmouth. However, in 1843 Lord Clifford, owner of the Hackney Marshes land, developed the Hackney Canal between the hamlet of Hackney and Newton Abbot. The development included building a tidal lock capable of holding two barges, making is possible for clay to be stored in clay cellars in Hackney, where it was then loaded onto barges to be carried to Teignmouth. 16 cellars with the capacity to store 7,000 tons of clay were built to store the clay in transit. The hamlet is no longer populated, with the ruins on the border of the nature reserve. The only remaining building in use is the Passage House Inn, built in 1761.

The canal ceased to be active as a trading route in 1928. Wildlife and environment As a local nature reserve, the marsh is a habitat for various wildlife species. There are often sightings of birds of prey such as buzzards and kestrels, for the latter of which the marsh is an important nest site. Additionally there are pheasants, and herons, mallards, moorhens, kingfishers, and the rare Cetti's warbler and cirl bunting line the waterway. The wildflower meadows and pond sites attract butterflies, dragonflies, and damselflies, including the emerald damselfly as a Devon rarity. There are also a variety of mice and vole species, as well as larger mammals such as badgers and foxes. The woodland comprises oak, alder, ash, and willow.

Social uterus as an integrative model of family development was invented by Vladislav Chv√°la and Ludmila Trapkov√° in 1990's. The metaphor of a social uterus was formed by comparing the biological function of the uterus and the maturation of the foetus inside it from conception to childbirth with the changes in the family from the birth of the child up to its separation around the age of 18. The metaphor translates facts well known from the biology of reproduction to the social level. In the \\"social uterus\\", the development and maturing of the indispensable \\"social organs and functions\\" of man can be observed. At a higher, social level of organization of live matter, the physical birth of the child may be viewed as the moment of the child's social conception. This approach sums up the achievements of developmental psychology and the family therapy into a practical and understandable model, which is useful in clinical practice. The model offers an understanding of psychosomatic symptoms within a family. The concept has been gradually developed by the authors through extensive clinical work with individuals and families. It has shown to have clinical validity, particularly in family therapy for psychosomatic disorders and various chronic somatic diseases. See also A similar concept of a social womb has been used in a 2013 book by J. Ronald Lally, designating a protected, nurturing environment needed by babies from birth to age 3 for a healthy brain development.

B. bifidum is one of the most common probiotic bacteria that can be found in the body of mammals, including humans. Structure and characteristics B. bifidum is a Gram-positive bacterium that is not motile, anaerobic, and not spore-forming. The bacterium is rod-shaped and can be found living in clusters, pairs, or even independently. The majority of the population of B. bifidum is found in the colon, lower small intestine, breast milk, and often in the vagina.Palmer, Chana, et al. \\"Development of the human infant intestinal microbiota.\\" PLoS biology 5.7 (2007): e177. B. bifidum is an essential bacteria found in the human intestine. When it is low or absent all together in the human intestine, it is an indication of being in an unhealthy state. Intestinal flora can be improved if someone takes oral B. bifidum. Also, oral B. bifidum is used for other things such as therapy for enteric and hepatic disorders, for activating the immune response, and for preventing some cancers. Mitsuoka, T. Journal of Industrial Microbiology (1990) 6: 263. https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01575871 B. bifidum decreases as people age. As B. bifidum decreases, other gut bacteria such as Lactobacilli, Enterococci, Enterobacteria and Clostridia increase. All of these increase an older adults risk for cancer and decrease the ability for their liver to function adequately and efficiently. Benefits The use of B. bifidum in probiotic applications may reduce the chances of acute diarrhea and the risk of E. coli infections, and contributes to the maintenance of vaginal homeostasis. Intestinal microbial balance is important for an individuals digestive system. Some people keep this balance through diet alone where others take probiotics, which are microbial supplements. Consuming dairy products seem to be the most efficient way to keep a healthy gut flora. B. bifidum is an important intestinal microbe. One study shows that because hard cheese has a higher pH, higher fat content and is more solid, it is more effective in carrying probiotics such as B. bifidum to a person through ingestion.√ñZER, BARBAROS, et al. ‚ÄúEffect of Microencapsulation on Viability of Lactobacillus Acidophilus LA-5 and Bifidobacterium Bifidum BB-12 During Kasar Cheese Ripening.‚Äù International Journal of Dairy Technology, vol. 61, no. 3, Aug. 2008, p. 237. EBSCOhost, search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType;=shib&db;=edb&AN;=34186221&site;=eds- live Health concerns The manipulation of the gut flora is complex and may cause bacteria-host interactions. Although probiotics, in general, are considered safe, there are concerns about their use in certain cases. Some people, such as those with compromised immune systems, short bowel syndrome, central venous catheters, heart valve disease and premature infants, may be at higher risk for adverse events. Rarely, consumption of probiotics may cause bacteremia, and sepsis, potentially fatal infections in children with lowered immune systems or who are already critically ill.

Hacked material from Parrish was leaked during the campaign, but the Costello campaign took the position that they would not use the illicitly obtained materials during the election. Vincent Galko, a consultant for Costello, said, \\"When news broke that this material had likely been stolen by a foreign actor, we immediately said, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre not going to use it.'\\" Costello was re-elected by a wide margin of 57.2 to 42.8. = Tenure = For his first two terms, Costello represented a district that took in northern Chester County and western Montgomery County, then reached across Berks County to take in much of heavily Republican Lebanon County. However, in February 2018, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which has a Democratic majority, released a new map for the state's congressional districts to replace a map which the court had previously struck down as a Republican partisan gerrymander. The court imposed a new map after the state legislature refused to submit a replacement. Costello was the only incumbent who retained his old district number. However, the 6th was made significantly more compact. It lost most of its heavily Republican western portion, as well as its share of Montgomery County. Instead, it now took in all of Chester County as well as most of the more Democratic portions of Berks County, including Reading. Even before the old map was thrown out, Costello had already attracted a well-financed Democratic challenger, entrepreneur and Air Force veteran Chrissy Houlahan. According to The Philadelphia Inquirer, \\"Of the many Republicans who took a political blow from Pennsylvania's new congressional map, Chester County's Ryan Costello got hit the hardest.\\" The new 6th was significantly more Democratic than its predecessor. Had the redrawn district existed in 2016, Hillary Clinton would have won it with 52 percent of the vote to Donald Trump's 43 percent;Presidential results by congressional district for districts used in 2018, from Daily Kos Clinton carried the old 6th with 48 percent of the vote.Presidential results by congressional district for districts used in 2016, from Daily Kos Along similar lines, Nate Cohn of The New York Times wrote that the new map put Costello in \\"very serious trouble,\\" and wondered if Costello would even run for a third term. The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote that \\"the previous, GOP-drawn map was one factor aiding Republicans as they held a firm grip on every competitive seat in the moderate Philadelphia suburbs.\\" According to the Pottstown Mercury, the Republican-drawn congressional map was \\"widely viewed as among the nation‚Äôs most gerrymandered.\\" After the new congressional map was released, Costello said he supported impeaching the justices who imposed the map, calling the court corrupt and undemocratic. Republicans requested that the United States Supreme Court intervene in the redistricting dispute, although Politico reported that the Republican challenge was unlikely to be successful. In March 2018, a panel of federal judges refused to block the new congressional map from going into effect. In March 2018, Costello filed petitions to get on the 2018 ballot, but later that month, he announced that he was dropping his reelection bid. According to The Hill, he became frustrated with the Trump administration, which contributed to his dropping from the race.

At the fall of Habsburg monarchy he moved to Barcelona, where he became a naturalized Spanish citizen. He married morganatically twice and had a daughter from his second marriage. During World War II he lived in the United States, working in the forestry industry. In 1955 he returned to Austria. He inherited the Carlist pretensions to the Spanish throne of his brother Archduke Karl Pius and called himself Duke of Madrid. He died in 1975.  Early life Archduke Franz Josef of Austria was born on February 4, 1905, in Vienna, the ninth child and fourth son of Archduke Leopold Salvator of Austria and Infanta Blanca of Spain. His father, Archduke Leopold Salvator of Austria, a member of the Tuscan line of the Habsburg family and thus a descendant of Emperor Leopold II, had been Inspector General of the Austrian Artillery and Commander of the 18th infantry regiment. Franz Josef's mother, Infanta Blanca of Spain, was the eldest daughter of Carlos, Duke of Madrid, who had been as Carlos VII, pretender to the Spanish throne.Harding, Lost Waltz, p. 19 Archduke Franz Josef was given the baptismal names Franz Josef Karl Leopold Blanka Adelgunde Ignatius Rafael Michael von Habsburg-Lothringen. Archduke Franz Josef's early years coincided with the last period of the Habsburg monarchy. His childhood was spent in the various properties owned by his parents, enjoying a comfortable and privileged life. The family's main residences were the Palais Toskana in the district of Wiede in Viena and Schloss Wilhelminenberg, on the Eastern slopes of the Gallitzinberg. Due to World War I, Franz Josef was not educated by private tutors like his three eldest brothers had been, but was sent instead to Stella Matutina, a Catholic school for boys run by Jesuits priest in Feldkirch. He shared the same classroom with Prince Gaetan of Bourbon Parma, the youngest brother of Empress Zita.Harding, Lost Waltz, p. 36  Exile At the fall of Habsburg monarchy, the republican government of Austria confiscated all the properties of the Habsburgs. Franz Josef's family lost all its fortune.McIntosh, The Unknown Habsburgs, p. 48 His two eldest brothers, Archdukes Rainer and Leopold, decided to remain in Austria and recognized the new republic. The rest of the family emigrated to Spain. In January 1919 the family arrived in Barcelona where they settled for over a decade. To continue his education, Franz Joseph was sent to Bonanova, a boarding school run by catholic priest.Harding, Lost Waltz, p. 115 In 1926, Archduke Franz Josef officially became a Spanish citizen with the name Francisco Jos√© Carlos de Habsburgo y Borb√≥n. While completing his education, Franz Joseph worked in Barcelona as a garage mechanic. He graduated from the Peritaje industrial de Terraza and the Barcelona School of Agriculture and obtained his license as a pilot at the Marine Flying School.Harding, Lost Waltz, p. 191 He purchased a small airplane with his brother Archduke Anton of Austria. The two brothers worked giving flying tours over Barcelona. In the turmoil of the Spanish Civil War, Archduke Franz Joseph returned to Austria. He initially lived with his widowed mother and his unmarried siblings, Archduchess Dolores and Archduke Karl Pius of Austria, Prince of Tuscany.Harding, Lost Waltz, p. 219 Working in advertising, he moved to Paris where he found employment in tourism promotion for two airlines.  Marriage and later life While on a visit to Berlin, he fell in love with an Austrian emigre, Marta Baumer, who had divorced Baron von Kahlera, a wealthy Czech sugar exporter. She was a daughter of Andreas Rudolf, an army officer, and Anna Countess di Locatelli.Harding, Lost Waltz, p. 245 With his mother's approval, Archduke Franz Joseph married Martha Baumer in London on 22 July 1937. Theirs was a morganatic union.Harding, Lost Waltz, p. 254 The couple settled in France. During World War II, the archduke emigrated with his wife to the United States. The couple settled in Franconia, New Hampshire, where he worked in the agricultural and forestry industry. During this period of his life, Archduke Franz Josef collaborated with author Bertita Harding in her book Lost Waltz: A Story of Exile, which recounts the story of his family from the last years of the Habsburg dynasty until 1943. After the war, the archduke and his wife returned to Europe. They lived for sometime in Madrid and in Berne Village, Lower Austria. The marriage was childless and ended in divorce in 1954. From 1955 Archduke Franz Josef lived again in Austria working in the forestry industry.

The Rationality Debate‚Äîalso called the Great Rationality Debate‚Äîis the question of whether humans are rational or not. This issue is a topic in the study of cognition and is important in fields such as economics where it is relevant to the theories of market efficiency. Many studies in experimental psychology have shown that humans often reason in a way that is inaccurate or imperfect‚Äîthat they do not naturally chose the ideal method or solution. An example of a problem which causes difficulty and debate is the St. Petersburg paradox. This is a lottery which is constructed so that the expected value is infinite but unlikely so that most people will not pay a large fee to play. Gerd Gigerenzer explained that, in this case, mathematicians refined their formulae to model this pragmatic behaviour. Keith Stanovich characterizes this as a Panglossian position in the debate‚Äîthat humans are fundamentally rational and any variance between the normative position and empirical outcomes may be explained by such adjustments.

He was one of thousands of Americans sympathetic towards Communism who went to the Soviet Union in the early 1930s to work but who met tragic fates during the Stalin purges. He briefly held the world record in 1934 for the highest parachute jump and became known as the 'Lindbergh of Russia'. His memoir of his experiences, Coming Out of the Ice (1979), became the basis for a 1982 CBS-TV movie starring John Savage and country-singer Willie Nelson. Biography Herman was born in Detroit where his father, a Jewish immigrant from Ukraine, was active in organizing unions at the Ford Motor Company. After Henry Ford made a deal with the Soviets, 300 Ford workers and their families from Detroit moved to Russia to help build a new Ford factory in Gorky. Victor Herman's family was among them, his father holding pro-socialist views. In 1931 when Herman was 16, he moved with his family to Russia for a 3-year work shift, while retaining US citizenship. However, in 1934, the Great Purge began and many American expatriates were disappearing, arrested or deported. During these years Herman focused on his prodigious athletic talents and he was eventually noticed and recruited by the Soviet Air Force which taught him how to parachute. He was competitive and strove to be number one. On September 6, 1934 he achieved international notice after he set the World Record for the highest parachute jump, from 24,000 feet. He became known as the 'Lindbergh of Russia'. Soviet authorities asked Herman to sign the World Record documents which included a blank space for citizenship which Herman filled in as \\"U.S.A.\\" After continually refusing to change it to the U.S.S.R., he was arrested in 1938 for \\"counter-revolutionary activities\\" and spent a year in a local prison that included brutal tortures: he had to sit on a bench 18 hours a day unmoving and nonspeaking facing a door, he was beaten in his kidneys every night for 52-days straight, he was thrown into a cell with violent criminals who tried to kill him, the diet was starvation, among other things. Most of his fellow cell-mates during this period died from similar deprivations. Herman believed his youth and strength saved him. Herman was then sentenced to 10-years hard labor in a Siberian gulag where he suffered extreme hardships including beatings, starvation, torture, freezing, and hard labor. He survived by various means, for example, he ate rats which thrived on the frozen corpses which littered the camp. He was briefly released from the Gulag system in 1948, but was required to stay in Siberia as an exile as part of his parole agreement. However, he broke his parole when he married a local Russian woman, Galina, who then had a baby girl, Svetlana. He was re-interned, but this time his wife and child were allowed to live with him under less severe conditions. The death of Stalin in 1953 brought improved conditions for Gulag inmates. In 1956, Soviet authorities claimed they had no file on Victor Herman, as if he had never been a prisoner, and he was free to leave Siberia but not Russia. Herman spent the next 20 years moving with his family to various locations in the USSR taking odd jobs as a boxing instructor, English- language teacher and farmer on a collective. Through it all he never gave up hope of returning to the United States. In 1976, after nearly a decade of filing applications with Soviet authorities who refused to recognize his American citizenship, he was allowed to return to the US. Galina, his 2 girls and his mother-in-law soon followed him. Herman's mother died in Russia in the early 1930s, his father died there in the 1950s and his brother Leo died in Russia in 1974 after committing suicide. His sister remained in Russia for the rest of her life, she married a Russian and had a career researching pathologies. In 1978, Herman filed a $10 million lawsuit against Ford Motor Co. for all of the hardships which he had suffered, but the suit was unresolved at the time of his death. The memoir of his experiences, Coming Out of the Ice (1979) was ghostwritten by Gordon Lish. The book later became a TV movie in 1982 starring John Savage, Willie Nelson and Ben Cross.

The scope includes diplomatic, economic, security, and cultural relations, as well as Asian-American history. Geographical coverage includes the United States, Canada, other countries in the Americas, and East Asia, typically China, Japan, and Korea, but also the Pacific area, Australasia, Southeast Asia, and the Russian Far East. JAEAR is indexed and abstracted in more than thirty services.Brill website Journal of American-East Asian Relations and is listed as a \\"fast track\\" journal by the Bibliography of Asian Studies.Bibliography of Asian Studies Fast-track Journal List Origins and history Although JAEAR published its first issue in 1992, its roots date from the late 1960s, when many Americans were concerned about their country's engagement in Vietnam. Critical scholars of Asia, such as those in the Committee of Concerned Asian Scholars, charged that their profession had failed its intellectual duties and that Asianists had slighted their political responsibilities. In partial response, the American Historical Association set up a Committee on American-East Asian Relations. The chair was Ernest R. May, a diplomatic historian. Other members were John Fairbank, a China scholar, also at Harvard, whose goal as early as the 1930s had been to educate the American public about the ‚ÄúFar Eastern Crisis,‚Äù and Dorothy Borg, an Independent Scholar who had worked for the Institute of Pacific Relations in the 1940s. Younger members of the Committee included Akira Iriye and James C. Thomson, Jr., students of Fairbank and May, and Warren I. Cohen, then at Michigan State University. The Committee by 1990 had become inactive but the number of scholars in the field increased. Anthony Cheung, who had been Iriye‚Äôs graduate student at University of Chicago but dropped out to work at University of Chicago Press, then founded an independent publishing house in Chicago, Imprint Publications. Cheung convinced Iriye, Cohen, and May that the field could support a journal to carry on the work of the Committee. JAEAR also received early support from Frank Gibney, who established the Pacific Basin Institute in Claremont, California. The first issue appeared in spring 1992. In 2012, Brill Publishers, headquartered in Leiden, Netherlands bought JAEAR from Imprint Publications. JAEAR is now published both in hard copy and online, and more than thirty services index or abstract the journal. Mission and significance JAEAR first appeared at a time when scholars in American- East Asian relations were confident that their field was on the \\"cutting edge.\\" Ernest R. May, who would become a sponsor of the journal, told the first conference of the Committee on American-East Asian Relations in 1971 that ‚Äúpolitically and economically Americans and Asians have become almost as interdependent as Americans and Europeans,‚Äù but ‚Äúdo not, however have any understanding of one another comparable to the understanding ‚Äì faulty though it often is ‚Äì between Americans and Europeans.‚Äù Warren I. Cohen, another who would become an early sponsor, in his 1985 address as president of the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations touted the field of American-East Asian relations as a model and insisted that it was on was on the ‚Äúcutting edge‚Äù of historical scholarship.

At the beginning of the period there was a largely complete network of parish schools in the Lowlands, although there were gaps in provision in the Highlands. Wealth from the Agricultural Revolution led to a programme of extensive rebuilding of schools. From the 1790s urban schools were often rebuild in a more imposing classical style. Many poorer girls were taught in dame schools, informally set up by a widow or spinster to teach reading, sewing and cooking. Literacy rates were lower in the Highlands than in comparable Lowland rural society, and despite these efforts illiteracy remained prevalent into the nineteenth century. Increasing numbers of girls from the higher social orders were taught in boarding schools. Female literacy rates remained high, but there were highly educated women who emerged as authors in this period. Scottish universities went from being small and parochial institutions, largely for the training of clergy and lawyers, to major intellectual centres at the forefront of Scottish identity and life, seen as fundamental to democratic principles and the opportunity for social advancement for the talented. Chairs of medicine were founded at all the university towns. By the 1740s Edinburgh medical school was the major centre of medicine in Europe and was a leading centre in the Atlantic world. Access to Scottish universities was probably more open than in contemporary England, Germany or France. Attendance was less expensive and the student body more representative of society as a whole. The system was flexible and the curriculum became a modern philosophical and scientific one, in keeping with contemporary needs for improvement and progress. Scotland reaped the intellectual benefits of this system in its contribution to the European Enlightenment. Many of the key figures of the Scottish Enlightenment were university professors, who developed their ideas in university lectures. Schools =Background: early modern era= The old school at Kingsford, East Ayrshire In the sixteenth century the Reformation had led to a disestablishment of the monastic and choir schools and the ambition to create a system of parish schools. This was enshrined in legislation in 1696. By the late seventeenth century there was a largely complete network of parish schools in the Lowlands, but in the Highlands basic education was still lacking in many areas.R. Anderson, \\"The history of Scottish Education pre-1980\\", in T. G. K. Bryce and W. M. Humes, eds, Scottish Education: Post- Devolution (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd edn., 2003), , pp. 219‚Äì28. =School building= Hospitals continued to be built by benefactors and some of these had very impressive buildings, like that of Robert Gordon's Hospital in Aberdeen, which was designed by William Adam (1689‚Äì1748) in the 1730s. Until the late eighteenth century most schools buildings were indistinguishable from houses, but the wealth from the Agricultural Revolution led to a programme of extensive rebuilding. Most schools had a single schoolroom, which could hold up to 80 pupils, were taught by a single schoolmaster. There might be smaller adjoining rooms for the teaching of infants and girls. There was sometimes with a schoolmaster's house in the same style nearby. Many burgh schools moved away from this model of teaching from the late eighteenth century as the new commercial and vocational subjects led to the employment of more teachers. From the 1790s urban schools were often rebuild in a more imposing classical style, from public subscription, or a legacy, and renamed academies.R. D. Anderson, \\"Buildings: 2 educational\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 53‚Äì5. =Democratic myth= Engraving by G. J. Stodart of Lady Grisell Baillie (1645‚Äì1746), after a portrait by Maria Verelst, one of the highly educated women that emerged in this period One of the effects of the extensive network of parish schools was the growth of the \\"democratic myth\\", which in the nineteenth century created the widespread belief that many a \\"lad of pairts\\" had been able to rise up through the system to take high office and that literacy was much more widespread in Scotland than in neighbouring states, particularly England. Historians now accept that very few boys were able to pursue this route to social advancement and that literacy was not noticeably higher than in comparable nations, as the education in the parish schools was basic and short and attendance was not compulsory.T.

Devine, The Scottish Nation, 1700‚Äì2000 (London: Penguin Books, 2001), , pp. 91‚Äì100. =Girls= By the eighteenth century many poorer girls were being taught in dame schools, informally set up by a widow or spinster to teach reading, sewing and cooking.B. Gatherer, \\"Scottish teachers\\", in T. G. K. Bryce and W. M. Humes, eds, Scottish Education: Post- Devolution (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd edn., 2003), , p. 1022. From the mid-seventeenth century there were boarding schools for girls, particularly in Edinburgh or London. These were often family-sized institutions headed by women. Initially these were aimed at the girls of noble households, but by the eighteenth century there were complaints that the daughters of traders and craftsmen were following their social superiors into these institutions.K. Glover, Elite Women and Polite Society in Eighteenth- Century Scotland (Boydell Press, 2011), , p. 36. Among members of the aristocracy by the early eighteenth century a girl's education was expected to include basic literacy and numeracy, needlework, cookery and household management, while polite accomplishments and piety were also emphasised.K. Glover, Elite Women and Polite Society in Eighteenth-Century Scotland (Boydell Press, 2011), , p. 26. Female illiteracy rates based on signatures among female servants were around 90 per cent from the late seventeenth to the early eighteenth centuries, and perhaps 85 per cent for women of all ranks by 1750, compared with 35 per cent for men.R. A. Houston, Scottish Literacy and the Scottish Identity: Illiteracy and Society in Scotland and Northern England, 1600‚Äì1800 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), , pp. 63‚Äì8. Overall literacy rates were slightly higher than in England as a whole, but female rates were much lower than for their English counterparts.R. A. Houston, Scottish Literacy and the Scottish Identity: Illiteracy and Society in Scotland and Northern England, 1600‚Äì1800 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), , p. 72. There were some notable aristocratic female writers, including included Lady Elizabeth Wardlaw (1627‚Äì1727) and Lady Grizel Baillie (1645‚Äì1746).R. Crawford, Scotland's Books: a History of Scottish Literature (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), , pp. 224, 248 and 257. There are 50 autobiographies extant from the late seventeenth to the early eighteenth century, of which 16 were written by women, all of which are largely religious in content.D. G. Mullan, Women's Life Writing in Early Modern Scotland: Writing the Evangelical Self, C. 1670-c. 1730 (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2003), , p. 1. =Highlands= In the Scottish Highlands, popular education was challenged by problems of distance and physical isolation, as well as teachers' and ministers' limited knowledge of Scottish Gaelic, the primary local language. Here the Kirk's parish schools were supplemented by those established from 1709 by the Scottish Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. Its aim in the Highlands was to teach English language and end the attachment to Roman Catholicism associated with rebellious Jacobitism. Though the SSPCK schools eventually taught in Gaelic, the overall effect contributed to the erosion of Highland culture.C. Kidd, British Identities Before Nationalism: Ethnicity and Nationhood in the Atlantic World, 1600‚Äì1800 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), , p. 138. Literacy rates were lower in the Highlands than in comparable Lowland rural society, and despite these efforts illiteracy remained prevalent into the nineteenth century.R. A. Houston, Scottish Literacy and the Scottish Identity: Illiteracy and Society in Scotland and Northern England, 1600‚Äì1800 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), , p. 70. Universities =Background= Old College, University of Edinburgh, built to plans drawn up by Robert Adam and completed in the nineteenth century The five ancient Scottish university colleges recovered from the disruption of the Reformation, civil wars and Restoration with a lecture-based curriculum that was able to embrace economics and science, offering a high-quality liberal education to the sons of the nobility and gentry. They established chairs of mathematics,J. Durkan, \\"Universities: to 1720\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 610‚Äì12. astronomy was facilitated by the building of observatories, and Robert Sibbald was appointed as the first Professor of Medicine at Edinburgh and he co-founded the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh in 1681.T. M. Devine, \\"The rise and fall of the Scottish Enlightenment\\", in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , p. 373. helping the universities to become major centres of medical education and would put Scotland at the forefront of Enlightenment thinking. =Reform= In the eighteenth century Scotland's universities went from being small and parochial institutions, largely for the training of clergy and lawyers, to major intellectual centres at the forefront of Scottish identity and life, seen as fundamental to democratic principles and the opportunity for social advancement for the talented.R. D. Anderson, \\"Universities: 2. 1720‚Äì1960\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 612‚Äì14. Chairs of medicine were founded at Marsichial College (1700), Glasgow (1713), St. Andrews (1722) and a chair of chemistry and medicine at Edinburgh (1713). It was Edinburgh's medical school, founded in 1732 that came to dominate. By the 1740s it had displaced Leiden as the major centre of medicine in Europe and was a leading centre in the Atlantic world.P. Wood, \\"Science in the Scottish Enlightenment\\", in A. Broadie, ed., The Cambridge Companion to the Scottish Enlightenment (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), , p. 100. The universities still had their difficulties. The economic down turn in the mid-century forced the closure of St Leonard's College in St Andrews, whose properties and staff were merged into St Salvator's College to form the United College of St Salvator and St Leonard. =Access= Access to Scottish universities was probably more open than in contemporary England, Germany or France. Attendance was less expensive and the student body more representative of society as a whole.R. A. Houston, Scottish Literacy and the Scottish Identity: Illiteracy and Society in Scotland and Northern England, 1600‚Äì1800 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), , p. 245. Humbler students were aided by a system of bursaries established to aid in the training of the clergy. In this period residence became divorced from the colleges and students were able to live much more cheaply and largely unsupervised, at home, with friends or in lodgings the university towns. The system was flexible and the curriculum became a modern philosophical and scientific one, in keeping with contemporary needs for improvement and progress. Scotland reaped the intellectual benefits of this system in its contribution to the European Enlightenment.A. Herman, How the Scots Invented the Modern World (London: Crown Publishing Group, 2001), . =Achievements= Hugh Blair, Professor of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres at the University of Edinburgh Many of the key figures of the Scottish Enlightenment were university professors, who developed their ideas in university lectures. The first major philosopher of the Scottish Enlightenment was Francis Hutcheson (1694‚Äì1746), who held the Chair of Philosophy at the University of Glasgow from 1729 to 1746. A moral philosopher who produced alternatives to the ideas of Thomas Hobbes, one of his major contributions to world thought was the utilitarian and consequentialist principle that virtue is that which provides, in his words, \\"the greatest happiness for the greatest numbers\\". Much of what is incorporated in the scientific method (the nature of knowledge, evidence, experience, and causation) and some modern attitudes towards the relationship between science and religion were developed by his prot√©g√©s David Hume (1711‚Äì76) and Adam Smith (1723‚Äì90).. Hugh Blair (1718‚Äì1800) was a minister of the Church of Scotland and held the Chair of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres at the University of Edinburgh. He produced an edition of the works of Shakespeare and is best known for Sermons (1777‚Äì1801), a five-volume endorsement of practical Christian morality, and Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres (1783), an essay on literary composition, which was to have a major impact on the work of Adam Smith. He was also one of the figures who first drew attention to the Ossian cycle of James Macpherson to public attention.G. A. Kennedy, Classical Rhetoric and Its Christian and Secular Tradition Form Ancient to Modern Times (University of North Carolina Press, 1999), , p. 282. Hume became a major figure in the sceptical philosophical and empiricist traditions of philosophy. His scepticism prevented him from obtaining chairs at Glasgow and Edinburgh. He and other Scottish Enlightenment thinkers developed what he called a 'science of man',. which was expressed historically in works by authors including James Burnett, Adam Ferguson, John Millar and William Robertson, all of whom merged a scientific study of how humans behave in ancient and primitive cultures with a strong awareness of the determining forces of modernity. Indeed, modern sociology largely originated from this movement.A. Swingewood, \\"Origins of Sociology: The Case of the Scottish Enlightenment,\\" The British Journal of Sociology',' vol. 21, no. 2 (June 1970), pp. 164‚Äì80 in JSTOR. Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations (1776) is considered to be the first work of modern economics. It had an immediate impact on British economic policy and still frames twenty-first century discussions on globalisation and tariffs.M. Fry, Adam Smith's Legacy: His Place in the Development of Modern Economics (London: Routledge, 1992), . The focus of the Scottish Enlightenment ranged from intellectual and economic matters to the specifically scientific as in the work of William Cullen, physician and chemist, James Anderson, an agronomist, Joseph Black, physicist and chemist, and James Hutton, the first modern geologist.J. Repcheck, The Man Who Found Time: James Hutton and the Discovery of the Earth's Antiquity (Cambridge, MA: Basic Books, 2003), , pp. 117‚Äì43.

Further subspecialist expertise is established for the diagnosis and surgical and medical treatment of vitreoretinal and macular disorders as well as strabismus.  History  Albert Mooren was the first well known ophthalmologist in D√ºsseldorf, whose name today is reflected in the postal address of the University Hospital. He trained with the famous founder of the German Ophthalmological Society, Albrecht von Graefe (1828‚Äì1870), before becoming chairman of the newly established Eye Hospital of D√ºsseldorf in 1862. The hospital was promoted to medical school in 1919. Ernst Custodis, Professor and chairman of the department from 1946 to 1967, introduced scleral buckling to ophthalmology in 1949 as a revolutionary new concept to treat retinal detachment.Custodis, E.: Bedeutet die Plombenaufn√§hung auf die Sklera einen Fortschritt in der operativen Behandlung der Netzhautabl√∂sung?.

It was built between 1906‚Äì07. The church, along with its former manse and boundary walls, has been a Grade II* Listed since May 1993. Its church hall was formerly a Wesleyan school, dated 1878 on the porch. The school, with the boundary wall, was designated Grade II in May 1993. The church remains active to date, as part of the Portland Methodist Circuit ‚Äì which involves two churches; Underhill Methodist Church and Easton Methodist Church. History Easton Methodist Church, with the 1878 Wesley School on the left Robert Carr Brackenbury, of Lincolnshire, came to Portland in 1791. Alongside Mr George Smith, the pair successfully established a Methodist following on Portland. By 1793 Brackenbury had a chapel built at his sole expense in Fortuneswell.http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~pbtyc/Portland/PYB/Churches.html However, the 19th-century construction of Portland Harbour's Breakwaters, and the other associated government works and defences, led to a large increase within Portland's Methodist population. A Wesleyan Church at Easton was built in 1854, and in 1878 a Wesleyan School within the village followed, built to accommodate 227 children.http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~pbtyc/Portland/Easton/Meth_Thill/Church.html By the end of the 19th-century, the decision was made to build a new Methodist church, known as Underhill Methodist Church, by 1899, replacing Brackenbury's original chapel.http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~pbtyc/Portland/PYB/Churches.html The increasing Methodist community led to the need for a Tophill church, and this was built between 1906‚Äì07. It was designed by Latrobe and Weston of Bristol, and built by builders Wakeham Brothers of Plymouth, for a total cost of ¬£7,000. As it was sited alongside the 1878 Wesleyan School, the school building was transformed into the church hall. Easton Methodist Church is still active today as part of the Portland Methodist Circuit. The congregation is currently at approximately 120 members, and the church is often the host of many different events and community projects. Design The twin-spired church, which seats 900, is made of rock-faced snecked Portland stone with ashlar dressings, or rubble, and has a plain tile roof. The twin-towered front, transepts with semi-octagonal apse containing organ gallery, and a low flat-roofed vestry are all designed with a mixture of late muscular Gothic with Art Nouveau detailing. The central doorway is in French High Gothic style. The interior of the church features a three-bay nave with two-bay transepts, and mosaic floors. There are galleries on three sides of the church. A grand organ and case is behind a tall moulded painted arch, and surrounded by choir seating; which consist of plain pews. The pulpit and reading desk is made of Portland stone, bowed front with the high relief carving of The Last Supper. The church's mannered, robust exterior conceals an unusually rich interior, all of which has been retained unchanged and helps to demonstrate the strength of Methodism on the island. The church hall was formerly a Wesleyan school, dating 1878 on the porch, reading \\"Wesleyan 1878 School\\". It is a cruciform building, but probably built first as a single hall to which 'transept' and rear wing was later added. The north side was linked to the main church by a 1906 wall with door.

During his academic career, he taught abroad on sabbaticals and Fulbright scholarships in Poland, Norway, Denmark, Taiwan and Australia. He also taught at the University of California, Irvine from 1992 to 1994.  Biography  =Early life= Les Milbrath was born in Bertha, Minnesota on 29 October 1925, the son of Walter Rudolph and Lila Henrietta Milbrath. He grew up on his parents‚Äô farm in Todd County, Minnesota. In 1945, he enlisted in the United States Navy, serving as an electrician on the USS General H. W. Butner (AP-113) and a Landing Craft Infantry ship (LCIL-820).National Archives at College Park; College Park, Maryland, United States; Muster Rolls of U.S. Navy Ships, Stations, and Other Naval Activities, 01/01/1939 - 01/01/1949; Record Group: 24, Records of the Bureau of Naval Personnel, 1798 - 2007; Series ARC ID: 594996; Series MLR Number: A1 135. After the war, he earned bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Minnesota, graduating Phi Beta Kappa. He received a doctoral degree in political science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1956. =Career= After his graduation, Milbrath held a research fellowship at the Brookings Institution. He then taught at Duke University, Northwestern University, and the University at Buffalo , where he spent most of his career. Milbrath joined the Department of Political Science at University at Buffalo in 1966, which had a newly established doctoral program in political science. (He also held a joint appointment in the Department of sociology beginning in 1987.) He continued to write 80-plus chapters and papers in political science journals or edited books. He regularly taught undergraduate and graduate courses on political psychology, political attitudes and behavior, and research methodology. Between 1969 and 1976, Milbrath directed the campus- based Social Science Measurement Center and the Social Science Research Institute between and served as the associate provost of the Faculty of Social Sciences and Administration during the same period of time. Between 1976 and 1987 he headed the Environmental Studies Center, and he later directed the Research Program in Environment and Society, which focused on the issues of the sustainability of future societies, environmental beliefs and values, public policy, political beliefs, social measurement and social change. He also served as a fellow of the Rockefeller Institute of Government. =Retirement= Milbrath retired from teaching at University at Buffalo in 1991. Milbrath spent three winter quarters teaching and lecturing at the University of California, Irvine. In 1997, Milbrath received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Political Science Association. The award was presented, said an APSA spokesperson, in recognition of Milbrath‚Äôs \\"distinguished lifetime achievement in scholarship, teaching and advancement of the field of ecological and transformational politics.\\" On October 11, 2001, he received a Lifetime Environmental Achievement Award from the University at Buffalo Environment and Society Institute. In addition to the award, the Institute established The Lester W. Milbrath Environment and Society Institute Fellowship in his honor for a graduate student . Milbrath died Wednesday, December 26, 2007 at Canterbury Woods in Amherst, New York. He was buried at the Forest Lawn Cemetery in Buffalo, New York in the Rosewood Mausoleum.  Work  = The Washington Lobbyists, 1963 = In 1963, while at Northwestern University, Milbrath published The Washington Lobbyists. Building upon his early interest in the role money plays in politics, he sought to analyze and explain the influence of lobbyists on congressional actors in Washington, D.C. Very little empirical research had been conducted on them before that time. The Washington Lobbyists was considered a path breaking work. Much to the surprise of political scientists at the time, his survey suggested that lobbyists exerted little influence and, instead, were a critical source of information for legislators. Exactly how lobbyists communicated with legislators was a focus of Milbrath's study. = Other publications = In 1965 he published,Participation: How and Why do People Get Involved in Politics. It examined the literature on citizen political participation, organizing empirical findings reported in previous studies. The book became widely cited, prompting him to co-author a second, substantially updated edition of the volume in 1977 with M. Lal Goel The topics of environmental beliefs and values, and environmental policy making became a research focus for Milbrath throughout the remainder of his career. In addition to his numerous journal articles and book chapters, he published Environmentalists: Vanguard for a New Society (SUNY Series in Environmental Public Policy) State University of New York Press 1985 in 1984. This book compared and contrasted the attitudes, values, and perceptions of environmentalists with those of the \\"rearguard,\\" a group of people who embrace the dominant social paradigm of economic growth at any cost. The book, based on extensive survey data, received a great deal of acclaim by political scientists and scholars in environmental studies. He tackled the problem of sustainable development in Envisioning a Sustainable Society: Learning Our Way Out? State University of New York Press . As with his previous books, this one received very favorable reviews. After his retirement Milbrath continued to write, and to testify in public settings on environmental matters. In 1996 he published Learning to Think Environmentally: While There is Still Time with a foreword by David T. Suzuki, In the book, he utilized a fictional conversation with a neighbor about important environmental issues and what we must do to develop a sustainable society. Time is running short, he told the neighbor, and we must act now. Unlike his previous publications, this book was intended for reading by the general populace. At first, SUNY Press was reluctant to publish the book because of its nontraditional approach. However, it has been widely adopted in many environmental studies, policy, and politics courses.

Life Montigny's father was a lawyer and government official who oversaw several boards and commissions and was later Dean of the law faculty at the University of Ghent. Her mother was of English origin. At seventeen, she decided to become an artist, knowing that she could not count on her parent's support.

After seeing a painting by Emile Claus (The Kingfishers), Montigny decided to seek out a position in his studios near Deinze. In the summer of 1893, she and several other female students took his course in plein air painting. After 1895, she commuted regularly between Ghent and Deinze.Galerie Oscar De Vos: Biography of Montigny Despite the fact that Claus was married and twenty-six years her senior, they began a relationship that lasted until his death in 1924. In 1902, she made her debut at the Ghent Salon, followed by shows in Paris. Two years later, she and her younger brother moved into a villa in Deurle. She later became a member of the luminist group Vie et Lumi√®re. At the outbreak of World War I, she followed Claus and his wife in emigrating to London, where she became a member of the Women's International Art Club and exhibited at the Grafton Galleries. After the war, she returned to Belgium and, finding it necessary to sell her villa, moved into a more modest home. In 1923, she joined the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts. After Claus' death, she found herself in worsening financial straits. Her painting style was no longer popular and it was necessary to accept charity from family and friends. She was largely forgotten after her death until 1987, when exhibitions were held in Deurle and Dienze. In 1995, a major retrospective took place at the Mus√©e Pissarro in Pontoise.

Israeli leadership has placed the responsibility for their abduction on Hamas. On 30 June, corpses of the teenagers were found. Other commentators, such as Israeli historian, Ilan Pappe, and NBC reporter Ayman Mohyeldin, queried the abduction and murder of the Israeli teenagers as being the real start of the chain of events leading to the major conflict. They saw parallels in the earlier killing of two Palestinian teenagers in the Beitunia killings. The autopsy report confirming that live IDF fire had been the cause of death of one of the Palestinian teenagers had become public knowledge the day before the kidnapping of the Israeli teenagers.

In June 2014, 66 rockets were fired in 30 attacks, wounding three people. In the eight first days of July, 250 missiles were fired in 104 attacks, injuring seven people. On 7 July, 80 rockets were fired from the Gaza Strip. On 7 July 2014, the Security Cabinet of Israel decided to begin a \\"counter-terrorist operation\\". After an airstrike killed seven Hamas militants in Khan Yunis, Hamas itself assumed responsibility on 7 July for missiles fired from Gaza and launched 40 rockets towards Israel. =Phase 1: Air strikes= As the Israeli operation began, and the IDF bombarded targets in the Gaza Strip with artillery and airstrikes, Hamas continued to fire rockets and mortar shells into Israel in response. A cease- fire proposal was announced by the Egyptian government on 14 July, backed by Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas; the Israeli government accepted it and temporarily stopped hostilities on the morning of 15 July, but Hamas rejected it in \\"its current form\\", citing the fact Hamas has not been consulted in the formation of the ceasefire and it omitted many of their demands. By 16 July, the death toll within Gaza had surpassed 200 people. =Phase 2: Ground invasion= On 16 July, Hamas and Islamic Jihad offered the Israeli government a 10-year truce with ten conditions centred on the lifting of the blockade and the release of prisoners who were released in the Gilad Shalit prisoner swap and were re-arrested; it was not accepted. On 17 July, a five-hour humanitarian ceasefire, proposed by the UN, took place. Approximately five and a half hours prior to the ceasefire's effect, the IDF sighted 13 armed Hamas militants emerging from a Gazan tunnel on the Israeli side of the Gaza border. IDF destroyed the tunnel's exit, ending the incursion. After the ceasefire, IDF began a ground offensive on the Gaza Strip focused on destroying tunnels crossing the Israel border. On 20 July, the Israeli military entered Shuja'iyya, a populous neighborhood of Gaza City, resulting in heavy fighting. On 24 July, over 10,000 Palestinians in the West Bank protested against the Israeli operation; 2 Palestinian protesters died. 150 Hamas militants who surrendered to the IDF were being questioned about Hamas operations.globes On 25 July, an Israeli airstrike killed Salah Abu Hassanein, the leader of Islamic Jihad's military wing. On 26 July, another humanitarian ceasefire took place for twelve hours, followed by a unilateral extension by Israel for another twenty-four hours, which was rejected by Hamas. The Palestinian death toll in the Gaza Strip topped 1,000. On 1 August, the US and UN announced that Israel and Palestine had agreed to a 72-hour ceasefire starting at 08:00. There was dispute about the terms of the ceasefire: Israel and the US stated that they allowed Israel to \\"continue to do operations to destroy tunnels that pose a threat to Israeli territory that lead from the Gaza Strip into Israel proper as long as those tunnels exist on the Israel side of their lines\\"; Hamas said that it would not accept such a condition. The ceasefire broke down almost immediately after it started. Israel blamed Hamas for violating the ceasefire, saying a group of Israeli soldiers were attacked by Palestinian militants emerging from a tunnel. Palestinians said the IDF was the first to breach the ceasefire when at 08:30 it destroyed 19 buildings while undertaking work to demolish tunnels. According to the PLO, the Palestinian Authority and Gazan sources, Hamas attacked an Israeli unit, killing an Israeli officer (Hadar Goldin, who was initially thought to have been captured) while Israeli forces were still engaged in military activities in Rafah on Gaza's territory before the truce came into effect. Tweets reported the battle in Rafah before the deadline for the cease-fire.Max Blumenthal and Allison Deger, 'Who broke the ceasefire? Obama blames Hamas against the evidence,' Mondoweiss 2 August 2014. Hamas also killed two soldiers in a suicide bombing attack.

According to court documents, Kawasmeh stated that Hamas members in Gaza financed the recruitment and arming of the killers. On 10 August, another Egyptian proposal for a 72-hour ceasefire was negotiated and agreed upon Israeli and Palestinian officials, and on 13 August it was extended for another 120 hours to allow both sides to continue negotiations for a long-term solution to end the month-long fighting. On 19 August, a 24-hour ceasefire extension renewal was violated just hours after agreement with 29 Hamas rockets fired in 20 minutes, with IAF airstrikes in response, killing 9 Gazans.

In the address, he said: \\"Our goal was to ignite an intifada in the West Bank and Jerusalem, as well as within the 1948 borders... Your brothers in the Al-Qassam Brigades carried out this operation to support their imprisoned brothers, who were on a hunger strike... The mujahideen captured these settlers in order to have a swap deal.\\" Hamas leader Khaled Mashal accepted that members of Hamas were responsible, stating that he knew nothing of it in advance and that what the leadership knew of the details came from reading Israeli reports.'Mashal: Hamas was behind murder of three Israeli teens', Ynet, 22 August 2014. Meshaal, who has headed Hamas' exiled political wing since 2004, has denied being involved in the \\"details\\" of Hamas \\"military issues\\", but \\"justified the killings as a legitimate action against Israelis on \\"occupied\\" lands.\\" On 21 August, an Israeli airstrike in Rafah killed three of Hamas's top commanders: Mohammed Abu Shammala, Raed al Atar and Mohammed Barhoum. During the period from 22 to 26 August, over 700 rockets and mortar shells fired into Israel, killing 3 Israelis. On 26 August, Israel and Hamas accepted another cease-fire at 19:00. =Result and post-conflict events= On 16 September, a mortar shell was fired to Israel for the first time since the cease-fire commenced. Defense Minister Moshe Ya‚Äôalon reassured border town populations that fighting would not resume with the Gaza Strip at the end of this month, the same time of year as the Jewish new year. According to Palestinians on 1 October, Israeli forces entered the Gaza Strip and fired upon Palestinian farmers and farms. No injuries were reported. IDF reported that on 31 October a rocket or a mortar shell was launched from Gaza into southern Israel without causing harm. On 23 November, a Palestinian farmer was shot dead in Gaza, marking the first time a Palestinian from Gaza had been killed by Israeli fire since the seven-week war between Israel and Hamas militants ended with an Egyptian-brokered ceasefire on 26 August. The Israeli army said two Palestinians had approached the border fence and had ignored calls to halt, prompting troops to fire warning shots in the air. \\"Once they didn't comply, they fired towards their lower extremities. There was one hit,\\" a spokeswoman said.

Israeli infantry, aircraft, and a naval vessel engaged the Hamas commandos, killing all five. A short while later, a parachute was found abandoned near Yad Mordechai and a Gaza tunnel exploded near Kerem Shalom. This was followed by Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu instructing the IDF to \\"take their gloves off\\" against Hamas and instructed them to take any means necessary to restore peace to Israeli citizens.

Hamas originally scheduled a press conference for 21:30, when they were expected to announce that the ceasefire talks failed. Israel however has agreed to extend the ceasefire an additional 72 hours. At 21:45, few hours prior to the end of the ceasefire, sirens were heard in Ashkelon, in which the rocket landed in an open area. Israeli police later confirmed that an additional rocket from Gaza landed in Sha'ar HaNegev. Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri denied any rocket fire. The Palestinian factions, shortly before the ceasefire expired, announced the extension of the ceasefire by five days. Despite the ceasefire extension announcement, shortly before midnight the Iron Dome intercepted a rocket over Netivot, while two more landed in open areas. 14 August During the night, despite the ceasefire still in affect, Netanyahu ordered the IDF to retaliate for the rocket fire. Israel struck four targets in Gaza, followed by two more rockets fired from Gaza into Israel. The US confirmed that it has suspended the sale of Hellfire Missiles to Israel due to the current conflict. 15 August PIJ officer Ziad al-Nakhaleh stated that even if a lasting agreement isn't achieved by Monday, the ceasefire will continue, in addition to confirming that the seaport and airport talks have been postponed. A report by al-Shorouk stated that the 11 terms of the ceasefire are: * Israel will halt military actions in Gaza by land, air or sea. * All Palestinian factions in Gaza will stop all attacks against Israel by land, air or sea. * The openings between Israel and Gaza for the transfer of goods to rebuild Gaza will be determined between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. * Israel and PA will coordinate all issues of funds related to Gaza's reconstruction. * The elimination of the buffer zones along the security fence, in stages, with the deployment of PA troops. * The fishing zone in stages will be extended to 12 miles, coordinated by Israel and the PA. * Israel will assist the PA in rebuilding infrastructure destroyed in Gaza as well as assisting those whose homes were destroyed. * International aid groups will provide the basic products needed to rebuild Gaza. * Egypt implores the international community to provide swift humanitarian and monetary assistance for Gaza's reconstruction. * The exchange of prisoners and remains will also be discussed at a later time. * The seaport and airport will be discussed at a later time 16 August Palestinians in Cairo tell Israel to meet their demands or \\"face a long war.\\" Israeli officials stated that if talks in Cairo fail, it will be up to the UN Security Council to negotiate a truce. 17 August Israel responded to Palestinian demands by saying that no demands will be met without security being guaranteed in Israel, including the demilitarization of Gaza. As a sign of good faith, Israel removed the fishing blockade and allowed Gazan fishermen to fish up to the three miles out. 18 August In the evening, as the five-day ceasefire neared an end, Netanyahu stated that they are prepared for any scenario in Gaza. In preparation for possible restart of violence, the train to Sderot was canceled, so they could be fortified to protect against anti-tank missile attacks on them. Israel arrested 93 Hamas activists, who were planning a third intifada by overthrowing the PA, according to the Shin Bet. Later in the evening, reports began circulating that Israel and the Palestinian factions had agreed to a long term ceasefire, which would be signed and announced at 23:00. The Palestinians later confirmed they had accepted the ceasefire. =Week 7= 19 August Overnight news leaked that the US and Israel came to an agreement over the blockade of Gaza. Israel agreed to ease the blockade and in exchange, the US will use their international influence to prevent Hamas from rearming. In the afternoon, shortly before 16:00, three rockets fired from Gaza exploded outside of Be'er Sheva, breaking the ceasefire with the first action by either side in nearly 6 days. Shortly before the rocket fire, Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum stated \\"If Netanyahu doesn‚Äôt understand ‚Ä¶ the language of politics in Cairo, we know how to make him understand,\\" possibly hinting at the rocket fire, although Hamas denied involvement in the rocket fire. Netanyahu ordered the IDF to retaliate against the renewed fire, and ordered the negotiators to return from Cairo due to the violations. At about 18:30 the Iron Dome intercepted two rockets over Netivot, its first interception in over a week. Later, two rockets were shot down over Sderot and another two over Be'er Sheva, as well as several fired at Tel Aviv, which Hamas took credit for. Hamas announced that they blame Israel for the ending of the ceasefire. The US however has stated that they hold Hamas responsible for breaking the ceasefire and reiterated Israel's right to defend itself. According to a senior Fatah official Qatar threatened Hamas' political bureau chief Khaled Mashal that it would expel him if Hamas accepts the Egyptian ceasefire deal. Israel attempted to assassinate the chief commander of Hamas' military wing, Mohammad Deif, in an airstrike on his house in the Sheikh Radwan district of Gaza City, killing his wife and two children. Israeli intelligence concluded in April 2015 that Deif had survived the assassination attempt, the fifth Israeli attempt to assassinate him.'Hamas‚Äôs chief of staff alive and active, Israel confirms,' The Times of Israel 29 April 2015. In total 50 rockets were fired from Gaza at Israel, and Israel struck 30 targets in Gaza, on 19 August. 20 August In the morning, reports leaked that Qatar threatened to expel Khaled Mashaal if Hamas accepted the Egyptian ceasefire. Hamas threatened to fire additional rockets at Ben Gurion on 21 August as 06:00. Their warning stated that all airlines should cancel their flights. On 20 August from Gaza 168 rockets were fired at Israel, a record since the operation began, accounting for over 200 rockets since the conflict resumed. In response, Israel carried out 92 attacks into Gaza. 21 August In the morning the IDF killed three Hamas commanders in an airstrike: *Raed al Atar - The commander of Hamas' Rafah company and member of its high military council; participated heavily in attacks against Israel, including the kidnapping of Gilad Shalit. *Muhammad Abu Shamala - The head of its southern command, believed by Israel to have been involved in every attack from Rafah since 2001. *Mohammed Barhoum - Commander of the southern sector All three were also heavy involved with the cross-border tunnels. Attar and Abu Shamaleh were also believed to have been involved in the attack in which Hadar Goldin was killed and his body seized. Hamas said that Israel would not break their resistance, and would pay a heavy price for their crimes. The IDF in the afternoon called up 10,000 reservists. Hamas killed 3 Palestinians and seven were arrested. 22 August In the morning Hamas shot dead 11 Palestinians it suspected of being informants for Israel at an abandoned police station, and another seven near a mosque.

In Sha'ar Hanegev a 4 year old Israeli child was killed in a mortar attack on kibbutz Nahal Oz. The Israeli Prime Minister said that military operations would intensify in response. At least 130 rockets were reported to have been fired, of which some were intercepted; others caused some damage and injuries. A rocket attack on Gan Yavne fatally wounded an IDF soldier who was on home leave from his unit after having served in the war. He died of his injuries a week later. Five others were also injured in the attack, including the soldier's younger brother.http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/ForeignPolicy/Terrorism/Victims/Pages/Netanel- Maman.aspx The IDF initially carried out about 30 airstrikes in Gaza, killing seven people according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Later, an Israeli airstrike destroyed a building in Gaza. The Palestinians reported at least 12 dead and dozens wounded. It was reported that 20 militants were killed and 50 wounded in the attack. 23 August In the early afternoon the IDF stated that more than 100 rockets and mortars were fired into Israel since midnight. Hamas killed four more Palestinians for collaborating with Israel, saying that they had been tried based on evidence. An aid to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the executions as \\"provocative,\\" illegal, and without a fair trial. Amnesty International said \\"Hamas must also remember that the right to a fair trial before a competent court remains in force during times of armed conflict\\". An apartment complex, known as Al Zafer Tower 4, collapsed after an Israeli strike which was preceded by roof knocking to warn the residents. According to the IDF, the building was used as one of the headquarters for Hamas. An unnamed Israeli army intelligence officer said that Hamas had over 2,000 short-range rockets and many dozens of mid-range rockets left, less than 30% of those they had before the operation started. 24 August Israel assassinated senior Hamas official Mohammed al-Ghoul, who was Hamas' payroll head, in an airstrike on his car in northern Gaza. He had just taken $13 million from a contact who had smuggled it into Gaza from the Sinai which was to be used to pay the salaries of Hamas fighters. The cash he had taken was destroyed, which severely impacted Hamas' ability to pay salaries. In the afternoon a mortar wounded three Israeli Arabs who worked as taxi drivers tasked with taking a group of Gazans from the crossing into Israel for medical care. About 135 rockets and mortar shells were fired on 24 August; five fell in built-up areas, ten were intercepted, and the remainder exploded in Israeli territory. Five rockets from south Lebanon were fired into northern Israel early in the morning, the Lebanese Army later located the launcher used. The rockets caused an electrical power failure and injuries in two kids. Israel did not return fire but appealed to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon to investigate. Five rockets were fired from Syria into the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. The IDF later assessed that rocket fire was unintentional and was a stray rocket from the Syrian Civil War. The Israeli Prime Minister said \\"I call on the inhabitants of Gaza to vacate immediately every site from which Hamas is carrying out terrorist activity. Every one of these places is a target for us.\\" 25 August In the early morning hours news began to leak of Abbas's new plan for an independent Palestinian state, which would be announced on 26 August. In the first stage of the plan, Abbas would request from the UN a deadline for Israeli withdrawal to the 1967 borders. The response from the Israeli Prime Minister's office indicated that Israel would oppose a withdrawal Hamas, one day after Iran claimed it down an Israeli drone, claimed it as well had downed an Israeli drone over Gaza. In the afternoon, according to an unnamed Palestinian source said to be familiar with the issue, the Palestinian factions would agree to a monthlong ceasefire proposed by Egypt in order to restart truce talks in Cairo. Egyptian mediators were awaiting Israeli approval before formally announcing the plan on Monday evening Hamas POWs interrogated by the IDF revealed that Hamas does in fact use mosques in Gaza for military operations. They also revealed that their tunnels were strategically built near kindergartens and clinics. In the late evening, a rocket once again was fired from Lebanon into Israel, landing in the Upper Galilee. The IDF returned fire toward the source of the rocket launch. More than 120 rockets and mortars have been fired from the Gaza Strip. =Week 8= 26 August Gazan sources reported that overnight Israel struck a 13-story building in Gaza known as the Italian Tower, after firing three warning shots into the building, which contained a mix of residences, offices (including the Ministry of Public Works), and retail stores. Two were reported killed, about 20 injured, and most of the complex was destroyed. Hamas fired at sick Gazans as they tried to leave the Strip for treatment Three Salafist militants in Rafah were killed in an Israeli airstrike as they fired rockets at Israel. The head of the Palestinian delegation to the Cairo cease-fire talks, said that difference of opinion among different Palestinian groups was delaying an agreement.official: Haaretz:'Hidden hands' stopped signing of Cairo accord, 26 August 2014 Hamas stated that the wording in the new Egyptian ceasefire proposal was acceptable to them, stating \\"we‚Äôre prepared to discuss at a later stage the various controversial issues: the sea port, the prisoners and the airport, what‚Äôs important at this stage is ending the Israeli aggression, opening the crossings and rebuilding the Strip.\\" In hopes to restart future peace talks, the US sent Marine Corps general John Allen to Israel as a negotiator. During the day, rockets hit a house and kindergarten playground. Two Israeli civilians were killed and four were injured in a mortar attack on kibbutz Nirim. A border crossing used by Gazans seeking medical treatment in Israel, among others, was under frequent rocket fire.Ynet News:'Hamas fires at ill Gazans as they try to leave Strip for treatment', 26 August 2014. Report of a visit, date of visit not spcified Power lines were damaged in the Eshkol Region. Hamas, and Islamic Jihad accepted an Egyptian ceasefire draft at 19:00 for a month. Hamas claimed it was accepted by both sides, and that they were waiting for a Cairo to determine the zero hour for implementation. Israel approved the ceasefire. The ceasefire was infringed. Egypt agreed to open the Israel‚ÄìGaza barrier. It was reported that the cease-fire was accepted by Netanyahu without a cabinet vote, leading Bennett to call for a vote on the proposed Gaza ceasefire. In Gaza, Hamas declared victory during a news conference, and television showed Palestinians celebrating in the streets, with some waving the Hamas flag and others waving the Palestinian Authority flag. The truce came into effect at 19:00 on 26 August; in the previous day over 182 rockets and mortar bombs were fired at Israel, 143 of them falling in open areas and five in residential areas, while 27 were intercepted. Since the collapse of a ceasefire the week before, over 1,045 rockets and mortars were fired at Israel, 141 of which were intercepted. Status following start of August 26 cease-fire , when a month-long ceasefire was agreed to by both parties, nearly 2,000 people had been killed in Gaza, as well as 69 Israelis. It was estimated that reconstruction in the Gaza Strip after damage suffered in this conflict would take 10 years. After Hamas had declared victory, Israeli sources said that the IDF had struck 5,200 \\"terror targets\\" in Gaza and killed 1,000 \\"terrorists\\", that Hamas had received \\"the worst blow in its history\\", and that over 4,500 rockets had been fired into Israel. The UN estimated that at least 100,000 Gazans had been internally displaced following Operation Protective Edge. Political status =Israel= After the first comments of Netanyahu on August, opinions differ. Hamas wants to persuade the Gazans that it has won a victory, but others wonder if the costs of the battle were worth it. The cost of the war was economically and socially expensive as the Governor Karnit Flug states that she agrees with an increase the budget deficit for 2015 from 2.5% to 3% provided it stems from one-time requirements for covering the costs of Operation Protective Edge and its results.Globes English - Karnit Flug lends support to raising deficit Some will said that the war started after Israel opposed to the unity government of Palestinian Authority with Fatah and Hamas and as result, the negotiations plunged into crisis. Supposedly, those actions gave a validated to Hamas to kidnapping and kill the three teenage boys, which end, in fact, with an agreement with Hamas about ceasefire. Other said that Hamas is a terrorist argumentation that uses the suffer and the pain in Gaza for his own purpose. Netanyahu by himself told, all ready, that Hamas is adamantly opposed to negotiations with Israel, and that the reason why so soon, after the sign deal, they were shooting from Gaza towards Israel. Even after the fighting ends Hamas warned that this was only an interlude in Hamas' fight against Israel. Therefore, the agreement with Hamas let for nothing, not only Israel had loss money and lives, she also get nothing because Hamas still control in Gaza and become even stronger in Gaza. The head of the Central Committee of Netanyahu's Likud party told \\"We promised the voters we would be decisive against Hamas, but when we had the chance we hesitated. It‚Äôs only a matter of time until we will have to face Hamas again.\\" The fact that Netanyahu didn't call the cabinet for a vote show that he was afraid of the opposition. Netanyahu's right flank in the government has been sharpening its knives even before the fighting with Hamas began and by the middle of the fighting, Minister Avigdor Lieberman reported to the media that Likud Yisrael Beiteinu dismantles partnership with Likud- Beiteinu. Liberman reported that \\"Israel can't ensure safety of citizens in the South as long as Hamas rules Gaza\\", in additional he said, \\"It is impossible and forbidden to trust lowly murderers. Therefore, we are against a cease-fire that allows Hamas to rearm and wage another battle against Israel whenever it finds it comfortable...A real peace process and a strategic breakthrough will only be possible after we succeed in freeing the Middle East and the Palestinians from the threat of Hamas (and no one else will do so in our place)\\" Others have sniped at Netanyahu for his handling of the crucial US-Israel relationship, \\"He shouldn‚Äôt have gone into a direct confrontation with the Americans,\\" Israeli Knesset member David Tzur. In response, on 27 August, Netanyahu, in his first comments, told that Hamas was hit hard and won few concessions. He also said that the goal of the opening Operation Protective Edge was not brings down Hamas but a long-term calm and inflicting substantial damage to \\"terrorist infrastructure\\". Israeli officials emphasized that there were no direct talks with Hamas because the Palestinian delegation was headed by a Palestinian Authority official. Israel already open the border crossings reopen. In addition Israel prevent many attacks. A source close to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said \\"not an arrangement; it is a cease- fire‚Ä¶a comprehensive deal will be possible only after the two sides discuss the various demands in a month's time.\\" On 28 August, at the Morning Show, \\"Keshet - Morning\\" it was reported that Israel also respected the requests of the Arab countries which worried to citizens of Gaza. Skeptical citizens in the South said that they lost there trust in the Government. Many believe that the goods planned to enter Gaza under international supervision will fall into the hands of Hamas. Eshkol Regional Council Mayor: \\"We'll see what happens in the coming days, I don't think the cease-fire will last,\\" Although Netanyahu standing that Israel would not accept any further rocket fire, and if the attacks resumed, Israel would react with even more force. On 1 September, it was reported by BBC that Israel intended to \\"expropriate 4 sq km (1.5 sq miles) of Palestinian land in the occupied West Bank\\". The military-run local administration said it was a response to the kidnapping and killing of three Jewish teenagers in the area in June. On 7 July, political source warns Hamas rebuilding Gaza warfare tunnels despite the ceasefire. Lieberman response that he does not believe it is possible to demilitarize Gaza. Meantime, Mahmoud al- Zahar continues to threaten, \\"If the Palestinian resistance in the West Bank held a quarter of the tools at the disposal of the resistance in Gaza ‚Äì Israel would be demolished in a day.\\" =Gaza and PA= The celebration took hold for two days. Two men were killed during the celebration. Abu Obeida, a spokesman for the Hamas military wing, stood over an Israeli flag as he addressed the crowd. \\"Gaza achieved victory because it has done what major armies failed to do. It forced the enemy to retreat,\\" he said. \\"We must know that no voice is louder than the voice of the resistance.\\" , \\"We are here today to declare the victory of the resistance, the victory of Gaza, with the help of God, and the steadfastness of our people and the noble resistance,\\" Hamas spokesman Sami Abu said in a news conference at Gaza's Shifa Hospital. Zuhri also said that their main goal is to liberating Jerusalem. Abbas associates said that the PA would take legal action against Israel in The Hague, home to the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice. on 1 September, It appears that the unity government of Hamas Fatah is in crisis. There were allegations that Hamas abused Fatah members during Gaza war. They harassed, beaten and in some cases even killed Fatah members. Fatha soucre said, \\"they are just closed minded, unethical racist people who discriminate against non- Hamas people\\" In addition, on 1 September, Abbas told that Mashaal is a lair because Hamas worked to bring down the PA ever since its establishment. As mentioned, on 18 August Israel arrested 93 Hamas men, which tried to carry out a coup of the Palestinian Authority. Abbas was quoted as saying, \\"Hamas‚Äôs goal is to destroy the West Bank and create chaos in order to stage a coup against us. Hamas wants to drive me crazy. Since the kidnapping of [IDF soldier] Gilad Schalit they have been contacting the Americans and Israelis and Europeans and others. They have been doing things behind our backs.\\" He also point out about the murder of the three youths, \\"When I asked Mashaal [about the murder of the three youths] he replied: ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know.‚Äô Then he told me, ‚ÄòI neither deny nor confirm.‚Äô Lies and beating around the bush.\\" Abbas pointed out that Saleh Arouri, later confirmed that his movement had been behind the murder of the youths.Mashaal enied the claim. After Operation Protective Edge, support for Hamas rises, 61 percent of Palestinians say they would vote for Hamas. On 6 September, there were made first hints for the ending of the unity government. Abbas called in the media that \\"We won't accept the continuation of the situation with Hamas as it is now and in this shape. There must be one authority and one regime.\\" He also reported that Hamas killed 120 men who defied because the house arrest imposed on them. Meanwhile, U.S. opposed for Abbas‚Äô diplomatic plan since it is a unilateral Palestinians say, Herzog asked Abbas to avoid unilateral moves at the United Nations \\"that might hamper the chances for an agreement.\\" Herzog added that he supports \\"real negotiations based on security and the fixing of borders as a first step.\\" Despite this Abbas would be expected to bring the plan for a vote in the United Nations General Assembly but in any case, the General Assembly resolutions are not binding. On 7 September, during the speech at Arab League, Abbas interrupted after he mention the revolution made by Hamas in 2007.News channel 10, 8 July 2014 It reported that the session was planned to be closed to media. Hamas officials responded to Abbas's allegations by urging him to stop \\"inciting\\" against them. The Palestinian Ma‚Äôan News Agency reported today that in a speech given to Fatah Party on Sunday, Abbas said that the Egyptian government offer to the PA 618-square mile area of the Sinai adjacent to Gaza. Abbas rejected the offer. =Arab countries= Qatari media which knows that Qatar's support of Hamas calling Hamas' efforts a victory. On Al-Akhbar, Lebanese media, reported as the end of the firecaese that \\"Israel in shock: Intelligence failure in handling the rockets\\", and other media say that Israel had caved to Hamas' demands. Egypt which has a strong opponent of the Muslim Brotherhood condemns Israeli action in Gaza but thoughts that the actions of Hamas lead for nothing, only to more pain and suffering of the citizens's Gaza, while \\"The Hamas movement continues listening to voices from Qatar and Khaled Mashal who stays there and enjoys his time at the gym of one of the most luxurious hotels in Qatar\\" =USA= U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Tuesday that the United States welcomed the newly announced cease-fire. \\"We strongly support today's cease-fire agreement, and call on all parties to fully and completely comply with its terms. ... We are all aware that this is an opportunity, not a certainty.\\" See also * List of Israeli strikes and Palestinian casualties in the 2014 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict * List of Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel, 2014 References External links *Timelines of the first and second phases of operation, idfblog.com; accessed 23 July 2014. * Category:2014 in Israel Category:2014 in the Gaza Strip Category:Timelines of military conflicts since 1945 ","title":"Timeline of the 2014 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict"},{"id":"43376378","text":"Gaston Dumont (24 December 1932 - 21 May 1978) was a Luxembourgian cyclist.

Foundation The founding members of the Canadian Guild of Potters were Nunzia D'Angelo, Robert Montgomery and Bobs Cogill Haworth. Howarth was the first honorary president, Montgomery was chairman and Molly Satterly was secretary. Although representing itself as a national organization, most of the early members were based in Toronto. The Guild held its first meeting on 20 March 1936. Mary Dignam's representative invited them to become an affiliate of the Women's Art Association of Canada (WAAC) and to hold their meetings in the WAAC building at 23 Prince Arthur Avenue in Toronto. Shortly after being founded, in 1936 the Canadian Guild of Potters decided to join the Canadian Handicrafts Guild, based in Montreal. Activities Bailey Leslie at the Wheel - First Demonstration by the Canadian Guild of Potters at Eaton's College Street Store, Toronto 1940 In the early years most of the members were amateurs and quality was a concern. In 1943 Pearl McCarthy wrote in The Globe and Mail, \\"If this art craft is to advance in quality and number of workers it will need the kind of new member who is willing to take both chemistry and art seriously.\\" Outside Quebec, this amateur image was an ongoing problem, although professionalism grew steadily over the years. Nunzia D'Angelo made great efforts to ensure that members could exhibit on the Ceramic National exhibitions organized by the New York State College of Ceramics. The Canadian sculptor Elizabeth Wyn Wood gave a speech on \\"Handicrafts in Relation to Community Art Centres in Canada\\". at the National Arts Club in New York City on 21 March 1945 that was reproduced in part in the summer issue of Canadian Art. She noted the important role of the Canadian Guild of Potters, and of ceramic educators such as Peter Haworth and Bobs Cogill Haworth at the Central Technical School in Toronto. An exhibition was held in the Art Gallery of Toronto in March‚ÄìApril 1950 for the 50th anniversary of the gallery. All the visual art schools, styles and media were represented. The Canadian Guild of Potters was among the eight art societies that contributed to the show. The guild held exhibitions of Canadian Ceramics / C√©ramiques canadiennes in Montreal and Toronto every two years from 1955 to 1971. Ceramics selected from the second national Canadian Guild of Potters exhibition in 1957 were selected by jury for the Canadian Fine Crafts show that year, the first national juried crafts show in Canada. The Guild sent three representatives to the First World Congress of Craftsmen, held on 8‚Äì19 June 1964 at Columbia University. The Guild eventually lost momentum, and was replaced around 1975 by an organization named Ceramic Masters Canada, later renamed Ceramists Canada. Members Noted members of the Guild included Florence Wyle (1881-1968), Bobs Cogill Haworth (1900-1988) and Eileen Hazell (1903-1984).

These compounds are ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) and can be further classified as thiopeptides. The overall structure of the cyclothiazomycins comprises a macrocyclic bicyclic peptide containing several thiazoles and thiazolines. The cyclothiazomycins are reported to have multiple inhibitory effects ranging from decreasing blood pressure to interfering with RNA transcription; they also exhibit some antibiotic activity.  History  Cylothiazomycin A was first isolated from Streptomyces sp. NR0516 in 1991. The structure of cyclothiazomycin A was solved via NMR spectroscopy and chemical degradation. Previously, a peptide compound 5102-II had been isolated in 1982 from Streptomyces hygroscopicus 10-22. The discovery of the genes responsible for the biosynthesis of cyclothiazomycin in 2010 showed that 5102-II and cyclothiazomycin A were the same compound. Structural analogues cyclothiazomycin B1 and B2 were isolated from Streptomyces sp. A307 and solved in 2006 with the help of high-resolution mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. A third analogue, cyclothiazomycin C, was discovered in 2014 with the aid of genome mining, nucleophilic 1,4-addition labeling reactions, high resolution mass spectrometry, and NMR spectroscopy. Structure The cyclothiazomycins are thiazole-containing bicyclic and macrocyclic peptides that are structurally similar to thiostrepton and noshiheptide. Formally classified as thiopeptides within the larger family of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs), the cyclothiazomycins are initially biosynthesized as peptides which subsequently undergo chemical modifications, including macrocyclization, aromatization, cyclodehydration, and dehydrogenation. Cyclothiazomycins exist as three analogues that differ at two amino acid residues in the core peptide. The image below denotes in red the differences between the analogues as well as the amino acid sequence that becomes the final compounds. The structure of cyclothiazomycin A was established primarily by two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Cyclothiazomycin A contains a dehydroalanine and two dehydrohomoalanine residues within a bicyclic, macrocyclic scaffold composed of thiazolines, thiazoles, and a trisubstituted pyridine. Cyclothiazomycin B and C vary from cyclothiazomycin A at the second and third threonine residues in the core sequence of the precursor peptide. In cyclothiazomycin B, the second threonine is an arginine. Cyclothiazomycin B exists as a pair of diastereomers, cyclothiazomycin B1 and cyclothiazomycin B2, that differ at the configuration of one of its dehydrohomoalanine moieties. Cyclothiazomycin B1 and B2 interconvert by isomerization in solution but are stable in the solid state. Cyclothiazomycin C has a lysine in place of the second threonine residue found in cyclothiazomycin A and a serine residue in place of the third threonine residue, resulting in a dehydroalanine instead of the dehydrohomoalanine observed in cyclothiazomycin A. The cyclothiazomycin family of antibiotics includes cyclothiazomycins A, B, and C. The structural differences between the analogues are shown in red. Also depicted are the sequences of the peptides that are chemically modified to become the final molecules.  Biosynthesis  Cyclothiazomycin family gene clusters. Gene names are found above and below genes. The varying nomenclature is due to differing understanding of gene purpose. Cyclothiazomycin is part of a class of natural products that are ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). As such, cyclothiazomycin begins as a peptide that is synthesized in the bacterial ribosome. A series of chemical steps by biosynthetic enzymes transform the original peptide into the final (mature) natural product. The gene encoding for cyclothiazomycin begins with a short open reading frame (ORF) ctmA (cltA). CtmD (cltB) encodes a \\"fused\\" TOMM cyclodehydratase believed to take part in the formation of thiazolines. The enzyme encoded by the ctmB (cltC) gene is believed to catalyze the dehydrogenation of thiazolines to thiazoles. CtmE and ctmF (ctlE and cltF) each encode a split lanthipeptide dehydratase which dehydrates serine and threonine to dehydroalanine and dehydrobutyrine. CtmG (cltG) is believed to aide in the production of the central pyridine. CtmI (cltD) encodes a ThiF-like protein. CtmH (cltH) is a LuxR-type regulatory gene. CtmJK are not present in the cycloythiazomycin A and C clusters; there is no known function. The cltN gene is believed to encode an enzyme that is involved in the formation of the tertiary thioether, however this has not been proven and cltN is not regulated by ctmH.CtmA, ctmD, ctmF, and ctmG deletion leads to the disappearance of cyclothiazomycin A. CtmH is a LuxR-type regulatory gene that was shown to regulate ctmA-ctmL.  Bioactivity  Each analogue of cyclothiazomycin is believed to interact with at least one biological target. Cyclothiazomycin A has been shown to inhibit blood plasma renin leading to a decrease blood pressure; it also exhibits weak anti-fungal activity. Cyclothiazomycin B shows inhibitory activity against RNA polymerase, and it is believed to act by reducing ribosome dependent GTPase. Cyclothiazomycin B also exhibits anti- fungal activity by binding to the chitin of cell walls, thus producing a fragile cell wall. Recently discovered cyclothiazomycin C has an unknown biological role, but cyclothiazomycins B and C both exhibit antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including Bacillus anthracis.

It has been under development since about 2003 by Ivan Godard and his startup Mill Computing, Inc., formerly named Out Of The Box Computing, in East Palo Alto, California. Mill Computing claims it has a \\"10x single-thread power/performance gain over conventional out-of-order superscalar architectures\\" but \\"runs the same programs, without rewrite\\". Mill Computing was founded by persons who formerly worked together on a family of digital signal processors (DSPs), the Philips Trimedia. Approach The designers claim that the power and cost improvements come by adapting a DSP-like deeply- pipelined processor to general-purpose code. The timing hazards from branches and memory access are said to be handled not via speculative execution, pipelining, and other late binding, but statically-scheduled logic. The claimed improvements in power and area are said to come from eliminating dynamic optimizing hardware: register-renaming, out-of-order execution hazard management, and dynamic cache optimizing. To replace that hardware, each Mill processor is designed to have timing and memory-access behavior predictable to single cycles, so that all the scheduling is subject to a highly-optimizing compiler. Very long instruction words and split stream instructions Mill uses a very long instruction word (VLIW)-style encoding to place up to 33 simple operations, a.k.a. opcodes in wide instruction words. These words are not contiguous in memory, but are split into two instruction bundles and placed into two data streams. Each stream is handled by a mostly independent decoder with its own top-level instruction cache. Instructions are arranged in extended basic blocks, and decoding for both halves begin at the same address in the middle of the block. As the instruction bundles are decoded the program counter in one stream increases and the counter in the other decoder decreases Each instruction bundle has a header containing the byte count of the instruction, and offset of opcode bundles within. The Mill uses 3 bundles per instruction. Each opcode in the bundle is a fixed bit length, and controls a specific execution slot or pipeline. However each bundle has a variable number of instructions actually encoded. Each execution slot can start speculatively executing its instruction field in the bundle buffer, and if later found to be outside the actual instruction bundle, the slot is stopped and results discarded. If one of the decoders has no instructions in its stream, a no-op delay can be issued by a small fixed-format data item located in an alignment hole of the instruction bundle in the opposite decoder. This helps maintain code density by reducing the incidence of no-operation codes in Mill code. The belt, a pipelining register system Ivan Godard, the designer of Mill, quotes research finding that during operation of a standard register machine, of values stored to processor registers: 6% are accessed never; 80%, once; and only 14%, more than once. Thus, the Mill uses a novel temporal register addressing scheme, the belt by analogy to a conveyor belt. The operands of the arithmetic logic units (ALUs) and other functional units may be taken from any position on the belt, and the result from the computation is dropped (stored) in the front position of the belt, advancing the belt to make room. As the belt is fixed length, drops in the front are matched by older operands falling off the back; pushed-off operands become inaccessible and must be explicitly saved if still needed for later work. Most operations of the instruction set work only with data on the belt, not on data registers or main memory cells.http://millcomputing.com/docs/belt/ For a typical instruction like \`add\`, both argument operands come from explicitly named positions on the belt, and the result is dropped on the front, ready for the next instruction. Operations with multiple results simply drop more values at the belt front. For example, division can produce a quotient and a remainder. Operations with overflow can produce double-wide results. Most belt instructions are encoded as just an operation code (opcode) and two belt positions, with no added fields to specify a result register, memory address, or literal constant. This encoding is easily extended to richer operations with more than two inputs or more than one result. Constant operands are dropped by separate \`load immediate\` instructions. All access of program variables in main random-access memory (RAM) is segregated into separate \`load\` or \`store\` instructions containing one memory address, or some way to calculate that address from belt operands. All belt machines have variants of the load/store opcodes to access local variables and the heap. This can be by offsets, from a pointer on the belt, or from various special-purpose base registers. Similarly, there will be instructions to branch to an address taken from the belt, along with branches relative to the program counter. = Temporal addressing = Because each drop of a result moves the prior belt content along to later positions in the queue, a given operand continually changes its position (and hence address) as a result of later execution. In effect, an access to the operand at position zero is a request for the most recent value dropped to the belt, while (for example) a reference to position five is to the sixth most recent drop. Thus the addresses of belt operands reflect the belt history over time. This is temporal addressing. It is hard for human programmers to keep track of belt contents, and hence operand addresses, when writing assembly code for a belt machine. However, it is easy for a compiler to track the changing contents and emit the correct position addresses in generated code. = Spill and fill = The belt is fixed length and may be too short to hold all live transient operands before they are pushed off the end. If an operand is needed for longer than its belt lifetime, it must be saved while still on the belt (spill) and later restored to the belt when needed again (fill). This situation is equivalent to the need to spill registers to memory when a program runs out of registers in a general-register machine. Spilled operands may be written to memory using normal store instructions, and restored using normal load instructions, or spill and fill may use special-purpose storage and associated operations that are faster or offer other advantages over load and store. = Freedom from hazard = The operands on the belt are read-only. New results do not overwrite prior values. The belt is thus a single- assignment structure, and is immune to the data hazards that must be dealt with by modern out-of-order general-register machines. = Compact object code = Dense machine code was very valuable in the 1960s, when main memory was very costly and limited, even on mainframe computers. It became important again on the initially-tiny memories of minicomputers, and then microprocessors. Density remains important today, for applications for smartphone, or downloaded into browsers over slow Internet connections, and in read-only memory (ROM) for embedded applications. A more general advantage of increased density is improved effectiveness of caches and instruction prefetch. Belt machines have smaller instructions than register-based machines, due to not needing a destination address for results. This saving can make a significant difference for fixed-length instruction formats, which normally use power-of-two instruction widths. If there are thirty-two addressable elements (registers on a general-register machine, belt positions on a belt machine), then each element address occupies five bits in the instruction, needing 15 bits for the three-address format of a general- register machine, but only 10 bits using the two-address format of a belt machine. Because bits are also needed for opcode and other information in the instruction, the (power-of-two constrained) instruction width often determines the maximum number of addressable elements possible in a design. Typically a belt machine instruction can support the encoding of double the number of addressable elements compared to a general-register machine of the same instruction width. There are similar gains in variable-length instruction encodings. Overall, belt machine code is less compact than for stack machines, which use no operand addresses, but often must introduce stack-manipulation instructions unneeded on a belt machine. The instructions for accumulator machines are not padded out with multiple register fields, instead, they use the return stack and need no extra memory reference instructions. = Implementation = While a belt machine presents an operand queue as the program model, the mill architecture doesn't implement the belt as a physical queue (shift register) in the implemented hardware. Instead it is a semantic representation of the bypass network present in most fast computers, which intercepts pipelined accesses to registers, routing them directly to the execution units that need the result. The number of registers is reasonably small: those needed to pipeline the output of each functional unit, and one for each possible belt item. The small number of registers reduces the size, power and complexity of the network to access the registers. Live data values are kept in conveniently addressable physical resources (individual registers, register files, static random-access memory (SRAM), or operand forwarding from functional units) and generally not moved for the duration of their belt lifetime. Instruction decoder maps logical belt positions to physical locations. The mapping is updated to reflect the changes of logical position arising from newly dropped results. A patent on the belt was granted in 2016. Metadata use Depending on the type and success of load operations, the Mill also assigns metadata to each belt item, including status, width, and vectorization count. Operations operate on the item described. Thus, the width and vector count are not part of the instruction coding. If an operation fails, the failure information is hashed, and placed in the destination, with its metadata, for use in debugging. The Mill also uses the metadata to assist speculative execution and pipelining. For example, if a vector load operation fails (e.g., part of it leaves a protection boundary) those parts of that belt entry will be marked as \`not a result\` (NaR) in the metadata. This allows speculatively-executed vector code to emulate per-vector-item fault behavior. The NaR items create a fault only if an attempt occurs to store them or perform other non-speculative code on them. If they are never used, no fault is ever created. The Mill's architecture appears able to reduce the size and complexity of pipelined loop code. In the pipeline video, every operation was required to cope with a special operand value called \`None\` (not to be confused with \`not a number\` in floating point formats), which has special semantics for this purpose: operations where at least one argument is a \`None\` generally produce a \`None\` as output, and when a \`None\` is attempted to be stored to memory, that store (or portion of a store for vectors where only some elements are \`None\`) is ignored, leaving that memory location undisturbed. This special \`None\` value is not implemented as a reserved bit pattern, but by using the extra metadata bits that are associated with each belt item. In the first few iterations of a pipelined loop, the code drops a group of \`Nones\` on the belt using a special \`retire\` operation, which tells the CPU how many items should drop in that cycle (that is, however many real items drop onto the belt from previous scheduled operations, \`retire\` drops only enough additional \`Nones\` to bring the total number of drops that cycle to the requested amount - once steady state is reached, generally no \`Nones\` will be generated). This way, the belt always has the expected number of new items for the usual steady-state loop body to operate on, with the \`Nones\` acting as placeholders for data that isn't ready. As the operations scheduled from previous iterations of the loop begin dropping results, the belt therefore starts each new loop iteration with more real data items and fewer placeholder \`Nones\` (the ordering rules for simultaneous drops from different- latency operations and \`retire\` ensure that as more real results appear in new iterations, they always occupy a position that had a \`None\` in all previous iterations, so that each operation can use the same input belt number for all iterations). Meanwhile, the store operations in the loop body receive \`None\` values until the loop's steady state is reached, and therefore have no effect until real results are available for storing. Thus, the loop body that handles the steady-state of the pipeline code, which includes appropriate \`retire\` operations, acts as its own prologue code. The processing of the final elements through the pipeline can generally be finished by having this same loop deliberately execute extra iterations, such that the remaining scheduled operations have time to finish and be stored to memory, because nearly all operations have no side effects (attempted invalid memory reads merely produce a \`NaR\` value on the belt, which does not cause a fault unless it is then used by a store or flow control operation). To pipeline nested loops, the Mill treats each loop almost like a subroutine call, with automatic saves and restores of appropriate state (belt and scratchpad). Lockstep phased execution Mill instructions are phased, with the up to 33 operations in a single instruction word being issued over three clock cycles. Mill phasing can capture very short traces and data-flows in a single instruction, and is claimed to improve the available instruction-level parallelism, particularly around control flow. Each phase is overlapped with different phases from neighboring instructions. The phases are also closely tied to the decode bundle arrangement, and allow the decode hardware to be simpler and pipe- lined. Within an instruction, the reader phase occurs first. These are operations that require no inputs and create output that is available the next cycle. These drop values directly from the instruction stream or from reading static byte addresses of the scratchpad. Next is the op or compute phase that takes inputs from the belt and drops values onto the belts, such as loads or arithmetic operations. Outputs from the compute phase may take several cycles to retire, dropping onto the belt with hardware-enforced static latency and order. Then writer phase reads value from the belt and changes global state, but not does not create belt values. Stores and branches occur here, as well as writes to scratchpad addresses. There are a few other conceptual phases that aren't part of the 3-cycle skew. The pick operation is equivalent to the ternary if operator (?:) and is implemented on bypass network control between the compute and writer phase and adds no computational delay. The Call phase is implemented in the same place, and the hardware saves/restores state such that from the program model no cycles have occurred in the callee, even though many real cycles may have passed until the return. Family traits There are several versions of the Mill processor in development, spanning Tin (low-end uses) to Gold (high-performance uses). The company estimates that dual-core Gold chips implemented with 28 nm lithography may work at 1.2 GHz with a typical thermal design power (TDP) of 28watts and performance of 79 billion operations per second. Different versions of the Mill are intended for different markets, and are said to have different instruction set architectures, different numbers of execution units, different pipeline timings, and thus, very different binaries. To accommodate these, compilers are required to emit a specification which is then recompiled into an executable binary by a recompiler supplied by the Mill Computing company. In this way, code that can be distributed is adapted to specifics of the exact model's pipeline, binary coding, etc. The development of so many tool sets and processor designs may be impractically costly. Ivan Godard said that Mill's plan is to develop software tools that accept a specification for a Mill processor, and then write the software tools (assembler, compiler backend, and simulator), and the Verilog describing the CPU. In a demo video, Mill claimed to show early versions of the software to create an assembler and simulator. The bulk of the compiler is said to be a port of LLVM. , it is incomplete.

He mainly worked for the Oakland Tribune for 40 years and was the syndicated political cartoonist for the Los Angeles Times. His work was syndicated with the Los Angeles Times, and was seen daily throughout the country, as well periodically worldwide in Newsweek, (1960-1986) and Time Magazine (1960-1986). His life's work covered comedy and political satire, sports, radio, and political cartoons.  Biography  Lou Grant started his career in the newspaper business as a copy boy for the Los Angeles Examiner in 1937. He illustrated his high school yearbook at Fremont High School in Los Angeles, and worked as a cartoonist during the war years for the Camp Roberts newspaper. His first art lesson came from winning a contest on a matchbook cover called \\"Learn How to Draw.\\" He then received free lessons, but he was a natural talent. During World War II, Grant was stationed at Fort MacArthur, San Pedro, California, where he worked for the camp newspaper, after having been diverted from the infantry unit that was sent to Anzio Beach in Italy, experiencing a hugh loss of life. At that time he met his future writing partner in comedy, Bob Schiller, who created All in the Family and was a comedy writer in television for I Love Lucy. They worked together as comedy writers for the radio show Duffy's Tavern. After the war, Grant went to Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, to work with cartoonist Jimmy Hatlo, the comic strip artist for King Features Syndicate, inking the panels for They'll Do It Every Time. After his marriage to Doris Weisel, the couple moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where Grant worked as a sports cartoonist in 1944 for the Milwaukee Sentinel. His sports cartoons were known as Swine Skin Gulch (referencing the site for the baseball stadium Borchert Field in Milwaukee). In 1949, William Randolph Hearst recruited Grant to be the sports cartoonist for the News Cal- Bulletin in San Francisco and his cartoons appeared daily in the sports section, 1949-1953. Grant's political career took him to the Oakland Tribune. His editorial cartoons appeared daily from 1954-1987, and he remained as then paper's editorial cartoonist until his retirement in 1986. He never took a day off due to the nature of being current with the politics of the day. The Los Angeles Times Syndicate distributed Lou Grant cartoons to newspapers and news magazines nationally on a daily basis. Grant was memorialized by Ed Asner in the television show The Lou Grant Show, for MTM productions.  Personal life and death  His family includes son Bill Grant, wrestling hall of fame coach, and daughter Josie Grant, artist and muralist (and archivist of the Lou Grant Archives). He lived with his family in Palo Alto and San Francisco. He later resided in Oakland, California. He remarried Florenzi Pooley in 1973. She is the executor of his estate. Lou Grant's obituary appeared in many newspapers nationally and locally in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Awards  Grant received many awards, including from the National Safety Council for \\"Drinking & Driving Awareness\\"; from the National Press Club, the National Headliners Organization's award for Outstanding Editorial; The National Conference of Christians & Jews Brotherhood's award for Promoting World Peace, and posthumously the Sparky Award 2001 from the Charles M. Schulz Foundation and The Cartoon Art Museum of San Francisco. Grant was honored with a one-man show at the Oakland Museum of California called The Pointed Pen in 1983.  Archives  His work is archived in the collection The Best of Lou Grant of 1954-1955 cartoons and in the book Artists in California 1786 - 1940 by Edan Hughes.

The house is part of the Alvar Aalto Museum, which functions in two cities, Jyv√§skyl√§ and Helsinki. The other location in Helsinki where the museum functions is Studio Aalto, which is located ca. 450 metres from the house, at Tiilim√§ki 20. Background Aalto became acquainted with Munkkiniemi and developed a liking toward it when he was drafting a proposition for building of the shores of Laajalahti Bay for the company of M.G. Stenius. The proposition never materialised, it would have meant that the shores would have been lined with long, white apartment buildings. However, in 1934 Aino and Alvar Aalto acquired a lot in Munkkiniemi, in a place that was still nearly in its natural state, and designed for the lot a house, which was completed in August 1936, roughly at the same time as the Viipuri Library. When he house was under construction, passers-by are said to have wondered what kind of a henhouse it was going to be, as the house was radically different from anything that had been built in Munkkiniemi by that time. Features of the house The house was designed to be both a home for the family and the studio of an architect. The slender office wing is in white-painted, lightly rendered brickwork. The positioning of the windows still shows clear hints of functionalism. The residential part is clad with slender, dark-stained timber battens. The roof is flat and on the courtyard side there is a large terrace opening up to the south. The fa√ßade is toward the street, it is closed-off and harsh, but it is rendered softer by climbing plants and a slate path leading up to the front door. The house anticipates the later Villa Mairea, and it bears hints of a ‚Äúnew‚Äù Aalto, of romantic functionalism. This is seen in the plentiful use of wood as a finishing material and in the four fireplaces built of brick. But in contrast to Villa Mairea, this house is not a luxurious residence but a cozy and intimate living quarters, in which simple, uncluttered materials are used. Later, in 1955, Studio Aalto was completed, also in the Tiilim√§ki neighbourhood of Munkkiniemi, but the architect is known to have enjoyed working in Villa Aalto even after that. Details of and episodes at the private home The living room is dominated by a grand piano, which Aino Aalto is known to have enjoyed playing. The whole interior is designed by Aalto, except for three Renaissance chairs, which were a memory from their honeymoon trip to Italy. Many times tourists, who came from far-away countries tried to peek at the house from a nearby sports field. The locals knew that Aalto and his wife liked to take ‚Äúopen air baths‚Äù naked in the yard when services were held at the nearby church. Especially Japanese tourists tried to climb over the fence and into the garden, and this habit of the resident couple came as a surprise to them. The neighbours could always hear it when this reality dawned upon the tourists. The locals were under the impression that the Aalto's found all this amusing. Aalto lived in the house up to his death in 1976, and after this his second wife Elissa Aalto lived there until her death in 1994. The house was protected by a law in 1982, and it was renovated inside and out in the early years of the new millennium, funded by the Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture and the city of Helsinki. Open hours The house is open much the same as any museum in the country. Guided tours are given regularly, more often in the summer (several times a day in August) and less so in the winter (on only one day each week in December and January).

The bill furthermore requires states to implement the 2008 UIFSA version, which is required so the 2007 Hague Maintenance Convention can be ratified by the US. The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. The bill is a compromise measure made up of pieces of six other bills. Background =Adoption= Adoptions in the United States may be either domestic or from another country. Domestic adoptions can be arranged either through adoption agency or independently.Adopting in America: How To Adopt Within One Year, by Randall Hicks, WordSlinger Press 2005 Adoption agencies must be licensed by the state in which they operate.http://www.adoption101.com/agency_adoption.html The U.S. government maintains a website, Child Welfare Information Gateway, which lists each state's licensed agencies. There are both private and public adoption agencies. Private adoption agencies often focus on infant adoptions, while public adoption agencies typically help find homes for waiting children, many of them presently in foster care and in need of a permanent loving home.ADOPTION: The Essential Guide to Adopting Quickly and Safely, by Randall Hicks, Perigee Press 2007 To assist in the adoption of waiting children, there is a U.S. government-affiliated website, AdoptUSKids.org, assisting in sharing information about these children with potential adoptive parents. The North American Council on Adoptable Children provides information on financial assistance to adoptive parents (called adoption subsidies) when adopting a child with special needs.http://www.nacac.org/adoptionsubsidy/adoptionsubsidy.html Independent adoptions are usually arranged by attorneys and typically involve newborn children. Approximately 55% of all U.S. newborn adoptions are completed via independent adoption.Independent adoptions The 2000 census was the first census in which adoption statistics were collected. The estimated number of children adopted in the year 2000 was slightly over 128,000, bringing the total U.S. population of adopted children to 2,058,915.https://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/censr-6.pdf In 2008 the number of children adopted increased to nearly 136,000.http://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/adopted0708.pdf#Page=26&view;=Fit =Child support= signatories (green) and parties (purple) to the Hague Maintenance Convention Provisions for recovery of child support are a subject of state-law (rather than federal law) in the US. For the international recovery of child support, bilateral agreements are in place between the US and a number of countries, and certain US States have bilateral agreements with countries in place. In 2007 the Hague Maintenance Convention was adopted within the framework of the Hague Conference on Private International Law, aimed at recovery of international maintenance. The convention requires countries to set up Central Authorities to coordinate recovery of maintenance, and provides for recognition and enforcement measures of judicial maintenance decisions. The US was the first to sign the convention in 2007 and the Senate approved it several years later. Ratification by the US could not take place because domestic legislation needs to be amended. Meanwhile the agreement has entered into force with respect to the European Union and 5 other European countries: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Norway and Ukraine. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act would amend part E (Foster Care and Adoption Assistance) of title IV of the Social Security Act (SSA) to require the state plan for foster care and adoption assistance to demonstrate that the state agency has developed policies and procedures for identifying, documenting in agency records, and determining appropriate services with respect to, any child or youth over whom the state agency has responsibility for placement, care, or supervision who the state has reasonable cause to believe is, or is at risk of being, a victim of sex trafficking or a severe form of trafficking in persons. The bill would authorize a state, at its option, to identify and document any individual under age 26 without regard to whether the individual is or was in foster care under state responsibility. The bill would add as state plan requirements: (1) the reporting to law enforcement authorities of instances of sex trafficking, as well as (2) the locating of and responding to children who have run away from foster care. The bill would include sex trafficking data in the adoption and foster care analysis and reporting system (AFCARS). The bill would direct the state agency to report immediately information on missing or abducted children or youth to law enforcement authorities for entry into the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. The bill would require the designated state authority or authorities to: (1) develop a reasonable and prudent parent standard for the child's participation in age or developmentally appropriate extracurricular, enrichment, cultural, and social activities; and (2) apply this standard to any foster family home or child care institution receiving funds under title IV part E. The bill would direct the Secretary to provide assistance to states on best practices for devising strategies to assist foster parents in applying a reasonable and prudent parent standard in a specified manner. The bill would make it a purpose of the John H. Chafee Foster Care Independence Program to ensure that children who are likely to remain in foster care until age 18 have regular, ongoing opportunities to engage in age or developmentally-appropriate activities. Authorizes increased appropriations for the program beginning in FY2020. The bill would limit to children age 16 or older the option, in an initial permanency hearing, of being placed in a planned permanent living arrangement other than a return to home, referral for termination of parental rights, or placement for adoption, with a fit and willing relative (including an adult sibling), or with a legal guardian. Prescribes documentation and determination requirements for such an option. The bill would give children age 14 and older authority to participate in: (1) the development of their own case plans, in consultation with up to two members of the case planning team; as well as (2) transitional planning for a successful adulthood. Specifies additional requirements for a case plan. The bill would require the case review system to assure that foster children leaving foster care because of having attained age 18 (or a greater age the state has elected), unless in foster care less than six months, are not discharged without being provided with a copy of their birth certificate, Social Security card, health insurance information, copy of medical records, and a driver's license or equivalent state-issued identification card. The bill would amend SSA title XI to establish the National Advisory Committee on the Sex Trafficking of Children and Youth in the United States. The bill would amend SSA title IV part E to extend through FY2016 revise certain requirements for the adoption incentive program, renaming it the adoption and legal guardianship incentive payments program. The bill would require states to report annually to the Secretary on the calculation and use of savings resulting from the phase-out of eligibility requirements for adoption assistance. The bill would preserve the eligibility of a child for kinship guardianship assistance payments when a guardian is replaced with a successor guardian. The bill would require notification of parents of a sibling, where the parent has legal custody of the sibling, when a child is removed from parental custody. The bill would extend the family connection grant program through FY2014. The bill would revise requirements for international child support recovery,forming the federal implementation required for ratification of the 2007 Hague Maintenance Convention. The provisions enter into force after a revised version of UIFSA has been passed in all states, and place a penalty on those states that don't do so in the quarter following their next legislative year. The bill would grant Indian tribes access to the Federal Parent Locator Service (FPLS). The bill would express the sense of the Congress about the offering of voluntary parenting time arrangements. The bill would set forth requirements for data exchange standards for improved interoperability. The bill would amend part D (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity) of SSA title IV to give the employer the option of using electronic transmission methods prescribed by the Secretary for income withholding in the collection and disbursement of child support payments. Procedural history The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on June 26, 2014 by Rep. Dave Camp (R, MI-4). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Ways and Means and the United States House Committee on the Budget. On July 23, 2014, the House voted to pass the bill in a voice vote. Debate and discussion According to Rep. Camp, who sponsored the bill, \\"we have already seen great progress in increasing adoptions since (the Adoption Incentives program) was created in 1997, and it is our hope to continue this progress with this bill.\\" The organization First Focus Campaign for Children supported the bill, writing a letter that \\"urges House leadership to bring this bill to the floor and ensure its swift passage so that vulnerable youth and children can benefit from these important reforms.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *Foster care in the United States *Adoption in the United States References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 4980 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 4980 *GovTrack.us H.R. 4980 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 4980 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 4980 *Congressional Budget Office's report on H.R. 4980 Category:Acts of the 113th United States Congress ","title":"Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act"},{"id":"43376864","text":"Pilestr√¶de (lit. English: Willow Alley) is a street in central Copenhagen, Denmark. It is a side street to the pedestrianized shopping street Str√∏get and commonly associated with the newspaper publishing house Berlingske Media, which has its headquarters in the street. History Pilestr√¶de photographed by Frederik Riise The street name refers to Pileg√•rden, a farm which was located at the site in the Middle Ages. Pileg√•rde is first mentioned in 1419 and was divided into several smaller properties in 1579. In the 16th century, Copenhagen's stud farm (K√∏benhavns Avlsg√•rd), where the city's bulls were stabled, was also located along the street. The stud farm was in 1671 sold to Trinitatis Church for use as a cemetery. The northernmost part of Pilestr√¶de was originally called Springergade with a reference to the bulls at the farm. Local residents found the name inappropriate and the street was therefore included in Pilestr√¶de in 1881. In 1765, Berlingske's publishinghouse established in one of the yards on the east side of the street. Notable buildings and residents No. 32-34 was built for Berlingske Publishing House in 1930 to a design by Helweg-M√∏ller. The building to the right of it is from 1741 and is part of the Berlingske complex. No. 26 was built in 1764 for mayor Peter Harloff Wieck. No. 33 is from some time before 1745 and is listed. No. 37, 39, 44-45 are also listed. The rectory of Trinity Church (No. 67) is from 1928 and was designed by Henning Hansen in collaboration with Thomas Havning.

Strains of the virus have predominantly been found in China, though strains have also been isolated from ducks in Germany and the United States. Duck circovirus is a small nonenveloped virus with a monomeric single-stranded circular DNA genome. DuCV has been clustered in the Circoviridae family genus Circovirus, according to the eighth report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Pathogenicity Scientists have studied the Duck circovirus by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods and dot blot hybridisation (DBH) tests. Infection with DuCV appears to cause growth disorders in ducks as well as eventual immunosuppression due to depletion of lymphatic cells. Transmission It was found that ducks between the ages of 40‚àº60 days were more susceptible to Duck circovirus. There was no evidence showing that the DuCV virus was capable of vertical transmission. Symptoms The symptoms are immunosuppression, stunting in growth, and also feather abnormalities. Research The PCR and dot blot hybridization (DBH) test was used in 2006‚Äì2007. 742 ducks from 70 duck farms were tested. The overall infection rate was 33.29%. Ducks at 3‚Äì4 weeks of age where more susceptible to DuCV virus. Type of Ducks Affected Anas platyrhynchos, Cairina moschata, and the American Pekin Duck are the ducks most affected by the DuCV virus. These ducks come from various regions of the world. Prevention A vaccine to provide protection against Duck circovirus has not been approved for use, though research to create one has occurred. Experimental DNA vaccines encoding the DuCV capsid protein were found to provide protection in vivo, as well as inactivated vaccines that were tested on Muscovy ducks.

TubeMogul is headquartered in Emeryville, California and has global offices located in Chengdu (China), Chicago, Detroit, Kiev, New York, London, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Paris, S√£o Paulo, Singapore, Shanghai, Sydney, Toronto, and Tokyo. In November 2016, Adobe Systems Incorporated announced an agreement to acquire TubeMogul. Company history =2007-2009= TubeMogul was founded by Brett Wilson and John Hughes while enrolled as MBA students at the University of California Berkeley's Haas School of Business. In 2007, the TubeMogul team led by Wilson and Hughes won the Haas Business Plan Competition, which provided seed money enabling the development and launch of the product. In its original conception, TubeMogul was a cross-platform online video analytics tool in 2007. Video producers uploaded content through TubeMogul, which would then distribute and track performance across video sharing sites. =2010-2013= In 2010, TubeMogul launched Playtime, an online video ad network, to help advertisers deliver ads to their target audience. Playtime differentiated itself from other online ad networks with its self- service features as well as the level of transparency it provided. In 2011, TubeMogul combined the Playtime ad network with the video syndication platform to become a demand-side platform (DSP) for brand advertisers. TubeMogul's DSP aggregates multiple inventory sources, including advertising exchanges, supply-side platforms, advertising networks as well as direct relationships with premium publishers, local and national broadcasters, cable networks and multichannel video programming distributors. In 2012, TubeMogul introduced its BrandSafe technology, which ensured that advertisements did not appear alongside objectionable content or run in ineffectively-small video players. In 2013, TubeMogul launched BrandPoint, which allows marketers to execute digital video buys on a gross rating point (GRP) basis, traditionally used by TV advertisers to measure a campaign's effectiveness. In March 2016, TubeMogul partnered with Facebook to reach TV audiences via Nielsen data. =2014= TubeMogul became a publicly traded company on July 18, 2014, and is listed with the NASDAQ Global Select Market using the ticker symbol \\"TUBE\\" (See ). In December 2014, TubeMogul released PTV, a Programmatic TV software solution that allows advertisers to plan and execute data-driven local, national, addressable and VOD television media buys. =2015-Present= In November 2015, TubeMogul launched technology enabling cross-screen advertising planning. The software helps marketers understand which media channels to invest in by deduplicating their target audience across traditional TV, social platforms and digital channels. This technique improved upon previous solutions that only allowed advertisers to control reach and frequency across digital-only desktop and mobile devices. Also in 2015, TubeMogul participated in a third-party assessment of Video Demand Side Platforms conducted by Forrester Research. In the Q4 2015 Wave Report, TubeMogul was named a leader among video advertising demand-side platforms and was also awarded the highest ranking in the \\"Current Offering\\" category. The results were based on three key categories: current offering, strategy and market presence. Out of ten companies evaluated, TubeMogul received the highest score in \\"Planning Capabilities,\\" achieving 4.60 out of 5 possible points, and 5 out of 5 points in both \\"TV Campaign Extension\\" and \\"Client Satisfaction\\" categories. In 2016, TubeMogul announced partnerships and integrations with the social media platforms Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and SnapChat. TubeMogul received the distinction of being the first video advertising platform awarded a Partner Marketing badge from Facebook and was one of eight advertising partners chosen by Snapchat in their initial monetization release strategy. Financing TubeMogul received its initial funding after winning the Lester Center's Business Plan Competition while co-founders John Hughes and Brett Wilson were studying at UC Berkeley‚Äôs Haas School of Business in 2007. The company received seed funding from NetService Ventures later that same year. They also received angel funding from Roger Ehrenberg of IA Capital in early 2008. In February 2008, TubeMogul raised $3 million in Series A funding led by Trinity Ventures. In October 2008, they acquired Illuminex, a video analytics company founded by Jason Lopatecki and Adam Rose, for an undisclosed amount. They raised a combined $10 million in their Series B round in March 2009, led by Foundation Capital. In December 2012 the company raised $28 million in the first tranche of its Series C, led by Northgate Capital. The second tranche of the Series C was led by SingTel Innov8, corporate venture capital arm of the SingTel Group, along with Cross Creek Capital, for $10 million in May 2013. =IPO= TubeMogul CEO Brett Wilson rings NASDAQ's opening bell July 18, 2014 on the first morning of the company's public offering. TubeMogul filed its S-1 form with the SEC on March 26, 2014. On July 18, 2014 TubeMogul became a publicly traded company. They made 6.3 million shares available to investors at $7 per share to raise a total of $43.8 million in their initial offering. =Adobe Acquisition= In November 2016, Adobe Systems Incorporated announced an agreement to acquire TubeMogul for $14 per share, or approximately $540 million, in cash. The deal is expected to close in Adobe's first quarter of 2017. Industry Initiatives =Non-Human Traffic Credit Program= In February 2016, TubeMogul announced the development of a new anti-ad fraud initiative called the Non-Human Traffic Credit Program. Effective April 2016, the company will automatically refund clients whose ads were served to non- human traffic, also known as bots. TubeMogul partnered with ad fraud detection company White Ops, which will apply its verification technology across every video ad bought through TubeMogul's Open RTB platform. The service is available to all clients who have a master service agreement with TubeMogul. =Independence Matters= In March 2016, TubeMogul launched an advertising campaign alleging Google's dual position as both media owner as well as buying platform creates inherent conflicts of interests for marketers. TubeMogul claims that \\"Google has made a conscious decision to wall itself off from the rest of the industry.\\" The campaign hints at Google's move to restrict third- party companies from buying YouTube ads via the DoubleClick Ad Exchange. =Open Video Viewability (OpenVV)= In May 2013, TubeMogul and several other advertising technology vendors formed the Open Video View (OpenVV) consortium to help facilitate the adoption of a viewability standard for online video advertising. OpenVV is an open-source code that provides marketers verification that their ad was actually seen by human eyes and reasons for non-viewability. TubeMogul founded the initiative along with video technology vendors BrightRoll, Innovid, SpotXChange, and LiveRail; current members include Nielsen, comScore, TrustE, and VivaKi. In June 2015, the IAB Tech Lab took over management of the OpenVV initiative as they continued to ramp up efforts in creating a common, scalable and interoperable technical solution to effectively measure viewability for video. The transfer of management for OpenVV marked the first industry initiative to be on-boarded into the IAB Tech Lab, a nonprofit research and development organization charged with producing and helping companies implement global industry technical standards and solutions. =Fraud/Fake Pre-Roll= In 2012, TubeMogul launched fakepreroll.com to raise awareness about video ads that were shown in inventory normally reserved for display advertisements, oftentimes without the marketer's knowledge. The site was taken down after several companies sent TubeMogul cease-and-desist orders. =Botnet Detection= In 2014, TubeMogul reported the existence of three botnets, responsible for defrauding advertisers for a potential $10 million each month. =IPG Internship= In March 2014, IPG Mediabrands and TubeMogul announced the \\"Ad-Tech Apprenticeship,\\" a one-year intensive training program designed to give college graduates a holistic view of the digital advertising industry.

The purpose of route clearance is to secure an important route and render it for safe transport. This mission relies on the use of Sapper and EOD forces to accomplish this task. Although mines have been used in warfare for years, the rise of IEDs in current conflicts has led to the development of the current route clearance doctrine. A typical route clearance package, or RCP, consists of a sapper platoon, an EOD team, at least one medic, and a HEMTT wrecker staffed by a team of mechanics. RCPs are clearly recognized by troops as they use the Husky vehicle-mounted mine detector, as well as the Buffalo (mine protected vehicle). While these vehicles provide superb protection and are critical in finding and destroying IEDs they are unarmed, so the rest of the platoon must protect them while in operation. Moreover, the loss of the Buffalo or the Husky vehicles would greatly reduce the counter-IED potential of the RCP as it would no longer possess the capability to locate or remove IEDs with high effectively resorting to secondary options such as using remote controlled vehicles, using standard MRAPs equipped with digging tools in place of the Buffalo, and dismounted foot patrols to locate the trigger points in known danger areas. Afghanistan 1431st Company, deployed as part of the 168th Engineer Brigade, conducts a Route Clearance patrol through the Khost- Gardez Pass in eastern Afghanistan, note the Chubby mine detector vehicles leading the convoy, which are typically unique to sapper units US forces entered the war in Afghanistan in 2001. Although there was fierce fighting such as the Battle of Tora Bora and Operation Anaconda, the IED threat remained generally low until later in the war. Afghanistan is a rural country with rough terrain, most of the roads are unimproved and due to the abundance of rivers many culverts are present. Because of this IED threats are numerous. Typically tactics include placing high yield IEDs weighing several hundred pounds deep underground causing massive damage. However modern MRAP vehicles are capable of withholding most blasts. Another tactic is placing small IEDs at choke points, the vehicle becomes disabled and the passing troops are ambushed. Due to the decade long Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War many Soviet mines are still used by Taliban fighters to make IEDs. RCPs are not designated units and are normally brought together from existing Combat Engineer and EOD units. They are then deployed to areas of need. Not all parts of Afghanistan are equally covered by RCPs, for example the remote FOB Salerno near Khost housed RCP7 and RCP9, which were composed of National Guard sappers and active duty EOD personnel, on the other hand Gradez had no dedicated RCP units and relied on nearby units from FOB Salerno, FOB Shank, and Orgun-E. 2003 invasion of Iraq Unlike Afghanistan threats of IEDs evolved almost instantly after the invasion. Indeed the MRAP vehicles were largely developed for the Iraq war even though the War in Afghanistan was already several years old by the time first troops stepped on Iraqi soil. Iraq was much more urban, Iraq also had many paved highways. The insurgents in Iraq relied much more on EFPs, contrary in Afghanistan EFPs never became prevalent. An EFP is capable of slicing through several inches of armor by forming a projected missile, once the armor is penetrated the EFP often kills the crew due to the heat associated with the blast.

His was considered the \\"most arcane and convoluted litigation in OSI history\\", owing to the convergence of three unusual legal factors in the case: * the question of whether the inability of American mothers to transmit citizenship to children born outside the U.S. before 1934 was unconstitutional, * if so, then whether Breyer should be retroactively a U.S. citizen at birth and whether that citizenship was lost by volunteering to participate in SS activities, ** and if so, then whether those activities or a later misrepresentation of his wartime activities to evade U.S. immigration law and enter the U.S. allowed for loss of his later-acquired citizenship, and * his lawsuits against the media over coverage of the case. In a series of rulings, federal district courts and the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit overall held that Breyer should have been born a U.S. citizen, and that while he had volunteered for SS activity in support of a totalitarian regime and its actions while age 17, there was insufficient evidence of the voluntariness of his activities after reaching age 18 to result in renunciation of that citizenship. In 2013 Germany issued an arrest warrant accusing him of aiding in killing 216,000 Jews as a guard at Auschwitz. He was arrested at his home in Philadelphia on June 17, 2014, age 89, and held without bail pending an extradition hearing. His health rapidly deteriorated while in custody and he died on July 22 prior to his hearing.  Background  Johann Breyer was born in 1925 in the ethnic German farming village of Neuwalldorf, Czechoslovakia (now Nov√° Lesn√°, Slovakia), to farmer Johann Breyer and his wife Katrina. Katrina Breyer was purported to have born in 1895 in Manayunk, Philadelphia and to have moved with her family to Neuwalldorf while a teenager. (While there was no official record of her birth there and there was conflicting secondary evidence as to the place of her birth, a district court eventually ruled her to have been born in the United States. This issue of her birth in the U.S., and the failure of the Department of Justice to timely investigate and raise the issue of whether it was later lost or automatically renounced before giving birth to Johann Breyer would play a pivotal role in the efforts to deport him.) Johann Breyer attended German school and worked on his parents‚Äô farm. In 1942, at age 17, Breyer volunteered to enlist in the Waffen SS, and was then placed with the SS's Death's Head Battalion (the SS-Totenkopfverb√§nde), composed of volunteers from the overall SS. He was assigned as a guard at Buchenwald and Auschwitz. He acknowledged serving as an armed guard and escorting prisoners to their work sites and denied any personal role in or witnessing of any atrocities. Soviet troops began to approach Auschwitz in January 1945; Breyer was on home leave at the time and was re-routed to a forward fighting unit until taken prisoner by the Soviet Army in May 1945. He emigrated to the United States in 1952 under the Displaced Persons Act (DPA). The DPA, in its form at that time, specifically excluded from admission to the United States \\"any person . . . who is or has been a member of or participated in any movement which is or has been hostile to the United States or the form of government of the United States, or to any person who advocated or assisted in the persecution of any person because of race, religion, or national origin.\\" This would later lead the government to allege the Breyer had engaged in willful misrepresentation or deliberate concealment of his particular World War II activities when he immigrated, in violation of federal law. Breyer settled in Philadelphia where he raised three children with his wife and worked as a tool and die maker for an engineering company. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1957.  OSI prosecution  The OSI became aware of Breyer when a routine cross-check of Auschwitz guard records with Immigration and Naturalization Service records showed that he had emigrated to the United States. In 1992 the OSI filed a denaturalization action with the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania alleging that Breyer was ineligible to enter the U.S. through the DPA because he had assisted in wartime persecution and been part of a movement hostile to the U.S., which he had concealed from the U.S. government in violation of federal law. Breyer asserted that he should be deemed to have entered the country lawfully as his mother had been born in the U.S. and that the laws in place at the time that granted derivative citizenship only patrilineally were in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. He therefore had to file an application for derivative citizenship with the INS. The cases then proceeded on parallel tracks (the OSI's efforts at denaturalization and Breyer's claim of derivative citizenship) for many years. In the OSI litigation, the district court held that Breyer was ineligible to enter under the DPA but that the statute denying Breyer citizenship at birth was unconstitutional. At that time, the INS had yet to rule on Breyer's application for derivative citizenship so the court deferred to the INS, thus abstaining from deciding whether Breyer was indeed a U.S. citizen at birth. Meanwhile, the Immigration and Nationality Technical Corrections Act had been introduced in Congress to retroactively provide for United States citizenship at birth for persons born abroad before 1934 to a mother who was a United States citizen and a father who was not. The OSI pressured Congress to place a \\"singular exception into the statute\\" to \\"deny application of the law to anyone who would not have been eligible to enter the United States under the DPA.\\" As explained by Senator Ted Kennedy at the introduction of the amendment, this was designed to \\"prevent the possible development of an anomalous situation\\" that would result in \\"gender-based discrimination\\": \\"the conferring of citizenship on an individual\\", born abroad to a U.S. citizen mother, \\"whose wartime activities on behalf of the Nazis could be considered by a federal court to have resulted in his or her\\" loss of U.S. citzenship had he or she instead been \\"born abroad of a U.S. citizen father.\\" Then-Congressman Charles Schumer noted that the exception would avoid placing into jeopardy \\"Nazi expatriation cases pending in the United States\\", for whom \\"proper prosecution ... depends on the ability to denaturalize and deport them to stand trial overseas for war crimes,\\" although the only case that was to be affected at that moment was the Breyer litigation. The INS denied Breyer's application based on the new statute and OSI therefore filed a deportation case. Breyer appealed the INS decision in district court on the grounds that the new statute was a bill of attainder in violation of Article I, Section 9 of the United States Constitution and also unconstitutional under the equality clause as those inadmissible under the DPA were denied citizenship only if it was derived maternally. The district court ruled against Breyer. He also lost his deportation case in immigration court. He appealed both losses to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The Third Circuit held that the new statute was \\"arbitrary and irrational\\" and that he was entitled to derivative citizenship at birth; however, its also held that \\"a voluntary oath of allegiance to a nation at war with the United States and to an organization of that warring nation that is committed to policies incompatible with the principles of American democracy and the rights of citizens protected by the American constitution -- an organization such as the Death's Head Battalion -- is an unequivocal renunciation of American citizenship whether or not the putative citizen is then aware that he has a right to American citizenship.\\" The court noted that Breyer voluntarily joined both the Waffen SS, which was a voluntary organization, and then the Death's Head Battalion, which was composed of volunteers from other SS units. It also quoted Holocaust scholar Helmut Krausnick's commentary that any person volunteering to join the SS after 1934 (other than perhaps its almost exclusively military arm, the SS- Verfugungstruppe) would have been aware that he was joining an organization where he would carry out orders that were illegal in nature, and would be committing culpable actions effectively furthering a totalitarian ideology at odds with ethical and lawful behavior and free democratic society. The OSI then brought suit in district court alleging that Breyer's service in the SS was in itself an expatriating act (i.e., an act that would cause him to lose his citizenship). Under U.S. law in 1942, loyalty oaths and military service with foreign powers were not expatriating if the individual was a minor, as held by the district court. However, the question remained as to whether he had committed any acts after his 18th birthday that were expatriating. \\"Breyer testified that he had done everything possible to be excused from service,\\" he refused the SS blood group tattoo, he deserted in August 1944 and returned \\"only because he feared he might be killed if he failed to do so.\\" The district court held that Breyer's service after his 18th birthday was involuntary and not expatriating. The court also declined to hear evidence on whether Breyer's mother had lost U.S. citizenship due to her acquisition of Czechoslovakian citizenship, and potentially for taking other actions that could have resulted in renunciation, due to the late stage of the litigation. The OSI appealed but the Third Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling noting \\"deserting his unit under what he believed to be penalty of execution suggests that Breyer's service was not voluntary.\\"Breyer v. Ashcroft, 350 F.3d 327, 335 (3rd Cir. 2003)  Extradition request from Germany and death  On June 17, 2013 the District Court of Weiden, Germany issued an arrest warrant for Johann Breyer for complicity in the commission of murder while a guard at Auschwitz. He was arrested at his home in Philadelphia one year later and although he was in frail health at age 89 he was held without bail pending an extradition hearing. Considering advanced age and that he was a teenager when World War II ended in Europe he is likely to be the last person pursued by the U.S. government for his service in the SS. He died in a hospital before his extradition hearing was held.

It is the oldest surviving missal of this kind in Scandinavia. It is written in Latin, and is in folio format. Only about one eighth of the original remains, or 44 pages. The book was originally bound in a single volume, but is since the 13th or 14th century split into two volumes. One of the volumes is currently part of the permanent exhibition of V√§sterg√∂tland Museum. It was written by two different scribes. It contains text, illuminations and musical notes. The illuminations consist of two full page illustrations, four large decorative initials and a number of smaller ones. Certain traits indicate that the illuminator may have come from Scandinavia. The Skara Missal is sometimes referred to as \\"Sweden's oldest book\\" but its origins remain unclear. It may have been made in Winchester (England), Normandy (France), or possibly Norway; it mentions the saint Swithun who was venerated in both England and Norway. Studies of its contents have pointed to possible connections with other illuminated manuscripts from Fulda (Germany), Echternach (Luxembourg), Winchcombe (England) as well as French manuscripts. The missal is mentioned in the catalogue of the library in Skara for the first time in 1748, but according to the Skara Stiftshistoriska S√§llskap (Skara Diocese Historical Society) it has belonged to the Diocese of Skara since the Middle Ages. A team of researchers from the University of Lund has dated the pages of the missal to the mid-12th century, using radiocarbon dating techniques. This makes the book contemporaneous to the inauguration of Skara Cathedral. The book is bound in covers made of oak wood covered with leather, which in turn have been dated to 1264 using dendrochronology; the researchers' analysis also determined that the oak trees used grew in the vicinity of Skara. The book has been displayed in international exhibitions, e.g. in Paris and Copenhagen, and has attracted the interest of both art historians and church historians. In 2006, a facsimile edition, supplemented by a number of scholarly articles, was published.

The entire project cost US$490 million, of which US$145 million was provided by the World Bank. The power station operates by shifting water between an upper and lower reservoir to generate electricity. The lower reservoir was formed with the existing Huiwu Dam at the foot of Mount Tongguan. The Yixing Upper Reservoir is located atop Mount Tongguan which peaks at above sea level. During periods of low energy demand, such as at night, water is pumped from Huiwu Lower Reservoir up to the upper reservoir. When energy demand is high, the water is released back down to the lower reservoir but the pump turbines that pumped the water up now reverse mode and serve as generators to produce electricity. Water from the nearby Huangtong River can also be pumped into the lower reservoir to augment storage. The process is repeated as necessary and the plant serves as a peaking power plant. The power station is operated by East China Yixing Pumped Storage Co Ltd. The lower Huiwu Reservoir is created by a tall and long rock-fill dam.

He lived for twelve years with his father at Guy's, and succeeded him in the treasurership in 1797. Caricature depicting Benjamin Harrison as a king on a throne, with his subjects prostrating themselves. For fifty years Harrison governed the hospital and managed its estates, despotically and without salary. With Sir Astley Cooper he, in 1825, established Guy's as a complete medical school separate from St. Thomas's Hospital, with which it had always previously been allied. Harrison resented an inquiry into the hospital administration which was made by charity commissioners in 1837; but no abuses were discovered. He was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, deputy-governor of the Hudson's Bay Company and South Sea Company, and chairman of the Exchequer Loan Board. He was selected as one of the three appeal commissioners for the city of London on the first imposition of an income tax. Towards the end of his life Harrison lived at Clapham Common, and was closely connected with the Clapham sect. He died there on 18 May 1856, aged 84. Family Harrison married in 1797 Mary, daughter of H. H. Le Pelly of Upton and Aveley, Essex. They had three sons, the eldest, Benjamin Harrison, becoming archdeacon of Maidstone; and six daughters, the eldest of whom married William Cripps.

The song is a parody of the 2013 single \\"Royals\\" by Lorde. It begins as an ode to the uses of aluminum foil for food storage, but becomes a parody of conspiracy theories, the New World Order, and the Illuminati in its second verse. \\"Foil\\" received positive reviews from music critics, and peaked at number three on the Billboard Comedy Digital Tracks. The song's music video stars Yankovic as the host of a cooking show, and features cameo appearances from Patton Oswalt, Tom Lennon, and Robert Benjamin Garant. Background and composition An image of aluminum foil, the song's namesake. \\"Foil\\" is a parody of Lorde's 2013 single \\"Royals\\". It retains the original song‚Äôs instrumentation, but is slowed down to match Yankovic's singing voice. He mimics Lorde's \\"sultry croon\\". At two minutes and 23 seconds, it is the shortest parody on Mandatory Fun due to its omission of the bridge and final chorus from the original track. In an interview with Billboard, Lorde said Yankovic \\"asked ages ago if he could do it‚Äù and she agreed to his offer. Lorde enjoyed Yankovic‚Äôs music, specifically his parody of \\"Confessions\\" (2004) by Usher. The song opens with Yankovic lamenting that he cannot finish food at restaurants, opting for a doggy bag. The first verse and chorus expand upon the usage of aluminum foil for food storage and preventing food spoilage, which Yankovic deems better than other food storage options such as \\"Tupperware containers.\\" In a twist, the second verse discusses conspiracy theories; in particular, he mentions the Illuminati, shadow organizations, \\"black helicopters comin' cross the border,\\" the New World Order and reinforces the belief that the moon landings were staged. Yankovic planned to incorporate a twist in the song while outlining ideas. To conclude the song, Yankovic supports the benefits of aluminum foil by placing a tin foil hat atop his head to shield himself from \\"thought control rays\\" and \\"psychotronic scanning.\\" Reception \\"Foil\\" received positive reviews from music critics. Randall Roberts of Los Angeles Times deemed the song a highlight of Mandatory Fun. Consequence of Sound writer Henry Hauser noted that it could have been included in his 1993 record The Food Album. Kenneth Partridge of Billboard wrote that while both \\"Tacky\\" (2014) and \\"Foil\\" could have been \\"one-joke affairs,\\" they were both successful. The song received a nomination for Best Individual Performance at the 2015 Webby Awards, but lost to \\"If Google Was a Guy\\" by CollegeHumor. Other critics were less positive. Paste considered \\"Foil\\" to be less clever than the other parodies on Mandatory Fun. Ben Kaye, writing for Consequence of Sound, praised the first half of the track, but criticized the \\"weird switch to Illuminati jokes\\". Commercially, \\"Foil\\" peaked at number three on the Billboard Comedy Digital Tracks. Music video The music video for \\"Foil\\" was released on July 16, 2014 through CollegeHumor's YouTube channel. It was part of an eight video series, released once per day, produced for Mandatory Fun. \\"Foil\\" was the most successful video, attracting 11 million views in five days. The video begins with Yankovic singing straight into the camera as a waiter gives him a doggy bag. Throughout the sequence, he spoofs Lorde's \\"on- camera intensity\\"; Breanna Ehrlich of MTV News also observed that the video highlights the similarity between Yankovic and Lorde's hair styles. He then walks out of a restaurant and onto the set of a cooking program titled Now We're Cookin'!. L.V. Anderson of Slate described his role in the video as an \\"infomercial huckster.\\" During the chorus, three woman dressed in foil outfits appear as they ad-lib the song's lyrics. The lights then dim as Yankovic sings about conspiracy theories; the camera shows the director (played by Patton Oswalt) watching \\"in horror\\". Stock footage of the Eye of Providence, an atomic bomb explosion, a set of military helicopters, troops marching, and police men in riot shields is shown. Yankovic looks into a fisheye lens camera in static filter and twice a man with a blood face quickly appears on screen. The following scene proceeds to show a video of a staged moon landing and thought control rays. Two men in black suits (played by Tom Lennon and Robert Ben Garant) insert a sleep injection into Yankovic's neck and drag him off set. The video ends with Oswalt taking off his human head to reveal the face of a reptilian humanoid. Live performances Yankovic performed \\"Foil\\" as part of the Mandatory World Tour (2015‚Äì2016). The live version replicates the majority of the music video, with Yankovic behind a Now We're Cookin'! table and accompanied by various props including a roll of aluminum foil, a teapot, and a foil hat. For some international performances, Yankovic changed the pronunciation of \\"aluminum\\" to \\"aluminium\\" to reflect the different ending being commonplace outside of North America.

It was created and written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais. There were 8 episodes over one series and starred Bob Hoskins, John Thaw and Pat Ashton. Synopsis The plot revolves mainly around George (Bob Hoskins), whose last job as a house burglar ended up with his getting sent to prison. After three long years, he returns to his home and wife Annie (Pat Ashton), only to find everything is not quite as he left it. His best friend Stan (John Thaw) moved into George's house with his wife eight months previously. This was the moment Annie and Stan were dreading, but when it came to the crunch she found she not only loved Stan, but also still loved husband George. Confused, and not helped by George's perhaps understandable annoyance at the situation, she finds she is unable to decide which will stay and which will go. As the series moves on the answer to the trios problems doesn't get any clearer. Cast Bob Hoskins as George John Thaw as Stan Pat Ashton as Annie = Other recurring characters = Johnny Briggs as Spiggy Michael Robbins as Sergeant Black Background Dick Clenent and Ian La Frenais had written the successful sitcom \\"Whatever Happened To The Likely Lads\\" (follow-up to their previous 1960's hit series, \\"The Likely Lads\\"). This success led to their writing for \\"Seven of One\\" in 1973, a series of seven individual comedy playlets starring Ronnie Barker. Each 30-minute segment from different writers each would be considered potential 'pilot' which if decided it had the potential could be developed into a series in its own right. Clement and LaFrenais's contribution was \\"Prisoner And Escort\\" featuring Fletcher, an ageing lag and his misadventures while being transported to Slade prison in Cumberland after having been sentenced to (yet another) five-year stretch inside. While \\"Whatever Happened To The Likely Lads\\" continued into 1974, they developed \\"Thick As Thieves\\" for London Weekend television (LWT), the UK television broadcaster at the weekends in the ITV London region. (Thames Television was the weekly broadcaster during weekdays.) There was only one series in 1974 Production The series was made on a tight budget, as evidenced by the small number of sets used. External scenes were kept to a minimum, mainly for setting the scene, or as a short linking sequence. Where used, these sequences were on videotape instead of film. Film was used for the sequences used behind the opening and closing titles each week. Typically, ITV comedy programmes that are deemed to last 30 minutes includes adverts in the running times. With adverts, this left some 23‚Äì24 minutes of actual programme time and included an advert break halfway through, something which risked breaking the narrative. These restrictions meant writers had to write concisely and economically to deliver a full programme plot in that time. Resulting series can have their episodes shown out-of-sequence without ruining any overall story arc. To get round such limitations and develop their characters, Clement and La Frenais allowed individual plot threads in \\"Thick As Thieves\\" to cross between successive episodes, meaning the series must be run in its serial-like series running order for some of the plotlines to make sense. The series (produced by Derrick Goodwin) was moderately successful, however makers LWT declined a second series. Writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais found themselves suddenly offered a new series by the BBC, the writers' \\"Prisoner And Escort\\" segment of Barker's \\"Seven of One\\" series having impressed the BBC enough have it developed into a full series that followed the fortunes of Fletcher and his fellow inmates. Again starring Ronnie Barker, it became the much-loved claustrophobic prison-based series Porridge. Episodes =Episode 1 ‚Äì The Home Coming (1 June 1974)= George Dobbs is released from a three-year sentence but no-one welcomes him at the prison gates. He seeks out his best mate, the womanizing Stan, to have a drink with, only to be told that Stan has moved on. The truth is that Stan moved in with Annie eight months ago, originally for company but they became romantically involved. George does not duff up Stan as expected but tells his friend to move out. In the process Stan falls downstairs and no-one believes George didn't do it for real. =Episode 2 ‚Äì Happy Release (8 June 1974)= Stan is laid up in George's bed, claiming he cannot be moved while Annie cooks him a hearty breakfast. George can have a cuppa if he gets his own cup. Stan's taking advantage of George's soft nature by playing sick comes to an end when he is found creeping round the kitchen. =Episode 3 ‚Äì Good Conduct (15 June 1974)= George is having a long hard think while walking along the Thames when he comes upon a group of youths trying to save their friend from the river. In a moment of heroism he saves the drowning boy and goes home, claiming his dampness was caused by his doing himself in. The lies start when Sergeant Black knocks on their door and in the face of initially stiff opposition reveals George is actually a bit of a local celebrity but from here the deceit only gets worse. =Episode 4 ‚Äì Two Men in My Life (22 June 1974)= George and Stan have Annie losing her patience and walking out on both of them to stay with a friend and think things through. The pair of failed burglars have to work together to keep their house in order. The potentially gruelling housework is possibly the worst domestic nightmare they have faced so far, perhaps ever. =Episode 5 ‚Äì The Trouble with Tommy (29 June 1974)= Tommy is an escaped felon whom police have narrowed the search for to the local area, so it's no surprise when he arrives and makes himself more than at home, ordering a string of demands that tests both George and Stan to the limit. However, thanks to Tommy's violent reputation there's little either can do about it. If three's a crowd, Annie's unexpected return proves that four's a catastrophe. =Episode 6 ‚Äì Three Into Two Won't Go (6 July 1974)= George has slowly resigned himself to the current domestic situation with himself, Annie and Stan. George discovers that Annie has planned a holiday to Benidorm - with Stan. The ensuing arguments cause so much friction that George thinks about booking his own holiday but instead only succeeds in letting Annie and her girlfriend take both tickets while the two boys slum it out at home. =Episode 7 ‚Äì Home & Away (13 July 1974)= With Annie away in Benidorm for a holiday with her friend, George and Stan make a decent fist of keeping the home in good order and clean, even learning not to burn their dinner along the way. However the cat's away, so a couple of strays start sniffing out the territory - and the two boys feel that they must rise to the challenge. Any chance of one-upmanship when Annie returns home are dashed by their respective dates still hanging around. =Episode 8 ‚Äì Holy Deadlock (20 July 1974)= Annie may have double the trouble with two men at her beck and call - nearly - but for this she has sacrificed the other luxuries life has to offer. She stops short of saying she wants them to start stealing stuff again. Instead, competing against each other to vie for Annies' affections, both men independently decide to secretly get some loot in - both by doing a house over. Except that they both choose the same house at the same time, and their collective talents are going to be no match against its owner - the girlfriend of the local gangland boss. Trivia Pat Ashton who played Annie was almost 11 years older than Bob Hoskins who played her husband George, and nearly 12 years older than John Thaw who played her lover, Stan. Theme Music The theme music was written by Mike Hugg and Ian La Frenais, and was reminiscent of their theme for \\"Whatever Happened To The Likely Lads\\", which series was also penned by Clement and La Frenais. The theme song, \\"Do The Best You Can\\" was released on 7\\" single in 1974 by Fontana Records (6007 037). The group's name was Porridge and it was produced by Hugg and Heath- Hadfield for Flanelcat Productions. The b-side was Look At Yourself, also written by Hugg and La Frenais.

The episode first aired on 24 February 1999 on ITV. The television story is loosely based on C. S. Forester's novel Mr. Midshipman Hornblower, chapter \\"Hornblower, the Duchess, and the Devil\\". Plot Acting Lieutenant Horatio Hornblower and his men launch a surprise attack on the French supply ship Le Reve and capture it. Back on , Captain Edward Pellew orders Hornblower to take command of Le Reve and sail it to Portsmouth with extremely important despatches. Pellew informs him that they have both been invited to a dinner party hosted by Major General Sir Hew Dalrymple, the Governor of Gibraltar. Among the guests is the widowed Duchess of Wharfedale, whose manner of speaking makes it clear she comes from the lower classes. After the party, Captain Pellew orders Hornblower to also escort the Duchess home to England. However, before they can reach England, Le Reve is caught in a dense fog and finds that it has sailed smack into the middle of the Spanish fleet, which they had erroneously believed still anchored at Cadiz. At first Hornblower tries to disguise himself and his crew as French, but an officer aboard one of the Spanish ships knows of the recent capture of Le Reve. Forced by overwhelming odds to surrender, Hornblower reluctantly accepts the Duchess's offer to hide the despatches rather than destroying them, as he had been ordered to do if captured. Hornblower and his crew are imprisoned in the dungeons of Spanish fortress commanded by Don Alfredo de Massaredo, while the Duchess, in deference to her rank, is hosted as Don Alfredo's guest. In his cell, Hornblower is reunited with another prisoner, who turns out to be Midshipman Archie Kennedy, who in episode one, \\"The Even Chance\\", had been set adrift while unconscious by the vindictive Jack Simpson. Kennedy is now a physical and emotional wreck after undergoing prolonged torture as punishment for his multiple escape attempts. Kennedy confides to Hornblower that he recognises the supposed Duchess as a London stage actress named Katherine \\"Kitty\\" Cobham, who has assumed the role of the widowed Duchess of Wharfedale in order to get passage to England from Gibraltar. Don Alfredo, still supposing her to be a Duchess, arranges for her to travel on the Almeria, a ship bound for Oporto in neutral Portugal. Meanwhile, Hornblower's crew chafes under Hornblower's orders to bide their time until their re-discovered shipmate, Kennedy, who speaks Spanish, will be well enough to try to flee with them. The crew, moreover, resents Hornblower's friendship with the \\"Duchess\\" and the attentions she convinces Don Alfredo to show him. Unbeknownst to Hornblower, they join the hot-headed Midshipman Hunter in a premature escape attempt. It fails, leaving Hunter with a gunshot wound. Hornblower, though he had nothing to do with it, takes sole blame for the failed escape attempt upon himself and submits to being tortured as punishment. Don Alfredo, who admires his gallantry, soon releases him, however. Not long afterwards, Hornblower and Don Alfredo witness a nighttime naval encounter close to shore between the ship Almeria and the English Indefatigable. The encounter results in the Almeria foundering on the rocky shoals during a dangerous storm. Hornblower volunteers himself and his crew to take a rescue boat and brave the stormy waves to save those on board, pledging on his word of honour to Don Alfredo that he and his crew will afterwards return to the prison. Though not fully recovered from his wound, a contrite Midshipman Hunter insists on coming along. Those rescued include Kitty (aka the Duchess) and the injured captain of the Almeria whom Hunter dies in saving. They spend the rest of the night at sea in the rescue boat and in the morning are picked up by the Indefatigable. The Duchess returns the despatches to Captain Pellew, who informs Hornblower that in recognition for his bravery in the fireship attack on Gibraltar he has been promoted to lieutenant. Hornblower asks permission to honour his pledge to Don Alfredo to return to the Spanish prison after the rescue. Though not bound by Hornblower's promise, his men choose to return with him. They are shortly released, however, by special order of the King and Queen of Spain in recompense for their gallantry in saving the Spanish captain and crew of the wrecked Almeria.

She was completed at Kure Navy Yard on 18 September 1943, whereupon she entered into service with the Imperial Japanese Navy Yokosuka Naval District, SubRon 11, and sailed to Yokosuka for final trials under the command of Lt. Commander Tamori Yoshimatsu. This was completed by 15 December 1943 and command was transferred to Lt. Commander Itakura Mitsuma. I-41 was reassigned to the Sixth Fleet in SubRon 1's Sub Division 15. World War II service =Supply submarine= On 29 December 1943 the new submarine departed Tokosuka for Truk. Arriving at Truk on New Years Day 1944, her deck gun and all of her torpedoes were taken on shore to prepare the sub for a supply mission. Nine days later I-41 was designated as the flagship of SubDiv 15. On 15 January 1943 I-41 sailed from Truk for Rabaul. While en route, SubRon1 was disbanded and the submarine was attached directly to the Sixth Fleet Headquarters. She docked at Rabaul on 19 January 1944, loaded supplies, and left four days later on her first supply run to Sarmi, New Guinea. I-41 arrived at Sarmi on 25 January and unloaded, departing immediately to return to Rabaul. She arrived there on 27 January. Heading to sea again on 31 January the submarine made for Bougainville Island. After evading minefields and enemy patrols she arrived at Buin, unloaded on 4 February, and returned to Rabaul on 7 February. Between 12 February and 24 February she made another supply run to Buin, tying up at Rabaul once again before setting out for Truk on 27 February carrying 98 naval pilots and staff officers as passengers, including the commanding officer of the 501st Naval Air Group. She arrived safely at Truk on 2 March and discharged her passengers. She sailed on 7 March toward Rabaul, but was recalled to Truk on the 9th. After a week's respite I-41 sailed for Rabaul once again on 15 March. While en route, on March 19, I-41 was running surfaced north of Rabaul when she was attacked by two torpedoes from an unknown enemy submarine. The lookouts saw the \\"fish\\" in time and Lt. Commander Itakura was able to evade the attack by turning sharply to port; the nearest torpedo passed 55 yards ahead of the submarine. Upon arrival at Rabaul the next day she was reassigned to SubRon 7. USN Fleet Radio Unit Melbourne (FRUMEL) intercepted and decoded a message the same day indicating that I-41 was expected to leave Rabaul at 0300 on 21st, pass through 3-08S, 149-21E at 0200 on 23rd, and arrive Truk at 1330 on 25th. This was accurate information. The sub left at the appointed time transporting 98 passengers including the CO of SubRon 7, Rear Admiral Owada Noboru, his staff, and a number of airmen. While she was en route FRUMEL intercepted another message reading, \\"Expect submarine I-41 to arrive South Channel about 0900 tomorrow 25th.\\" This was also accurate. Despite this, the submarine was not attacked and arrived safely at Truk on 25 March. She was escorted in through the south channel by Kinpo Maru No. 1. =Operation Tatsumaki= In April 1944, I-41 was selected as one of several submarines to participate in an amphibious assault on Majuro in the Marshall Islands. She was ordered to train with I-36, I-38, I-44, and I-53 for this attack, which called for the submarines to carry amphibious tanks armed with torpedoes from Kure to Majuro. Once there they would be put ashore, make their way overland, and enter the water again to attack ships in harbor there. The plan was cancelled before it could be realized, however. =Return to supply duty= With the cancellation of Operation Tatsumaki, I-41 returned to her previous duties as a supply sub. She left Truk on 1 April 1944, making her third run to Buin with 50 tons of food. She arrived on 7 April, unloaded, embarked 73 passengers, and returned to Truk. I-41 docked at Truk on 13 April. Her deck gun was remounted during her layover in Truk Lagoon. For his successful supply runs, Lt. Commander Itakura is given a gift of cigarettes from Vice Admiral Takagi Takeo, the CINC of the Sixth Fleet. On 19 April the sub departed Truk for Yokosuka, where she arrived on the 25th. She was then transferred to Kure. =First War patrol= After needed upkeep, I-41 departed Kure to patrol between the Admiralty Islands and Wewak, New Guinea, on 15 May 1944. No targets were sighted, but while still on patrol 13 June word was received by Admiral Toyoda Soemu, CINC, Combined Fleet, that the American anchorage at Marujo was empty. The admiral ordered Vice Admiral Takagi to redeploy his boats, I-41 among them, toward the Marianas. I-41 received the order the next day, being dispatched to a region South of Guam at best possible speed. On 15 June 1944 the American invasion of Saipan started. As a result, communication with Vice Admiral Takagi Takeo and Sixth Fleet Command was disrupted and command of sixth fleet submarines passed to Rear Admiral Owada Noboru of SubRon 7 at Truk. In his final message sent from the island, Takagi announced he and his staff were planning to join a banzai charge imminently. He was promoted to Admiral, posthumously. Following this, I-41 was redirected to a patrol area southeast of the Marianas in the company of the submarines RO-113, RO-114, RO-115, and RO-116. On 22 June 1944, I-41 was detached from her group and ordered to Guam to evacuate naval aviators stranded there. She arrived two days later and surveyed the island from periscope depth in search of a suitable embarkation point. After sunset she surfaced 1,100 yards offshore and contacted units on land. Two barges managed to transfer a total of 106 pilots (mostly from the 705th Naval Air Group) before an approaching patrol bomber (a Consolidated B-24 Liberator) forced the submarine to dive. Further embarkation was aborted. The submarine and her passengers returned to ≈åita on Kyushu, landing there on 30 June 1944. Beginning 1 July, the submarine arrived at Kure and commenced battle training. On 5 August command of the submarine was transferred to Lt. Commander Kondo Fumitake, the former CO of ; training continued until 9 October, when I-41 was transferred to the Otsujima Kaiten base in the Inland Sea to train human torpedo crews, returning to Kure thereafter. =Second War patrol= On 13 October Operation Sho-I-Go (Defense of the Philippines) was ordered. Six days later I-41 departed Kure to patrol east of the Philippines. The next day an American fleet of 738 ships landed on Leyte, precipitating an order to I-41 to proceed at flank speed to a patrol area east of Leyte. There she operated in tandem with . I-41 reported sinking an American transport on 27 October, but there is no corroborating loss on the American side. On 30 October the submarine reported sighting a task force with three aircraft carriers 220 miles east by northeast of Suluan Island but was not able to engage. A few days later, on 3 November, I-41s looksouts sighted what they believed was an aircraft carrier near the San Bernardino Strait, in the company of other ships. It is possible this was , which was in the area at the time. At 2330 hours Lt. Commander Kondo set up his shot and fired a salvo of torprdoes at the target. One of these hit the light cruiser in the port side. Kondo reported sinking a carrier, but in fact no hits were scored on any carrier and Reno did not sink, later being towed to Ulithi by the tug . A Yokosuka P1Y \\"Frances\\" attack bomber \\"confirmed\\" Lt. Commander Kondo's claim and he was awarded a special citation from Emperor Hirohito. On 12 November 1944 Lt. Commander Kondo reported attacking another task force. This communication was the last word received from I-41. =Loss= East of Samar on 18 November 1944 during an ASW patrol in the Philippine Sea, Task Group 30.7's was alerted to the presence of a Japanese submarine in her operating area by an \\"Ultra\\" signals-intelligence message. Anzios aircraft conducted an ASW sweep. One of the aircraft reported a radar contact on a submarine on the surface. After a 14-hour hunt, , in a coordinated depth charge attack with her sister ship and two planes from Anzio, sank I-41 at . There were no survivors. Overdue from patrol, I-41 was presumed lost with all hands on 2 December 1944 and removed from the Navy List on 10 March 1945. Notes Sources * Hackett, Bob & Kingsepp, Sander.

During a surgery this information is given continuously to the surgeon, significantly accelerating biological tissue analysis and enabling identification and removal of cancer cells. Electroknives have been in use since the 1920s and smart knife surgery is not limited only to cancer detection. In clinical studies the iKnife has shown impressive diagnostic accuracy - identifying benign gynaecological tissue from ovarian cancer (97.4% sensitivity, 100% specificity), breast tumour from normal breast tissue (90.9% sensitivity, 98.8% specificity) and recognises histological features of poor prognostic outcome in colorectal carcinoma. Furthermore, the technology behind iKnife - rapid evaporative ionisation mass spectrometry (REIMS) - can identify Candida yeasts down to species level.  Research and development  Zolt√°n Tak√°ts, Ph.D., a Hungarian research chemist associated with Semmelweis University, in Budapest, invented the intelligent surgical knife. He currently is Professor of Analytical Chemistry at Imperial College London (UK). His iKnife has been tested in three hospitals from 2010 through 2012. Following laboratory analysis of tissue samples in 302 patients that were included in a data base, they included 1624 of cancer and 1309 of non-cancer samples. The current pilot version for the iKnife cost the creating Hungarian scientist, MediMass Ltd. (Old Buda based company) participating in the research, colleagues at Imperial College, and the Hungarian government approximately ¬£200 thousand (68 million HUF). According to Tak√°ts, the investments will have been worth it, however, as the device is on a likely path to marketing. The instrument has been acquired by the Massachusetts Waters Corporation for development by MediMass Ltd., which identifies it as substantive innovative technology labelled, \\"Intelligent late\\" and \\"REIMS\\", according to their press release on 23 July 2014. The business transaction included all MediMass innovation, including patents, software, databases, and human resources related to the technology.  Principle of operation  = History of direct examination of biological tissue by mass spectrometry (MS) = Direct examination of biological tissue by mass spectrometry (MS) began in the 1970s, but at that time the next advance in technical conditions did not exist. The method did not provide any useful information on the chemical composition of the samples tested.INTELLIGENS SEB√âSZETI ESZK√ñZ SZ√ñVETEK M≈∞T√âT K√ñZBENI AZONOS√çT√ÅSA T√ñMEGSPEKTROMETRI√ÅS M√ìDSZERREL Szaniszl√≥ Tam√°s D√©nes J√∫lia PhD- hallgat√≥ PhD, tudom√°nyos munkat√°rs Tak√°ts Zolt√°n PhD, igazgat√≥ z.takats@imperial.ac.uk Semmelweis Egyetem CellScreen Alkalmazott Kutat√≥k√∂zpontMagyar Tudom√°ny ‚Ä¢ 2012/6 The first breakthrough came with desorption ionisation methods (secondary ionization mass spectrometry - SIMS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization - MALDI) a release said. Using these methods, after appropriate sample preparation, chemical biological tissue imaging analysis may be achieved.van Hove et al., 2010. From the end of the 1990s, it became apparent that mass spectrometry data in imaging studies showed a high degree of tissue specificity, that tissue histology could determine mass spectral information, and vice versa. In the case of the detected protein and peptide components, tissue-specific expression of the proteins is known commonly. Precise immunohistochemical methods are based on this phenomenon. The mass spectrometer detection, mainly from cell membranes and similar tissue, specifically, of complex lipids from similar tissue, however, yields surprising results. Since the distribution of proteins are in good agreement with the distribution patterns obtained by immunohistochemical methods, the distribution of the lipid components of the direct ionization mass spectrometric, previously were relative methods leading to the appearance of a new era in the study of biological specimens. The desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) was the first-MS technique, which allowed non-invasive testing of any objects (or organisms) without sample preparation, regardless of their shape or mechanical properties.Takats et al., 2004 = Rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry = Lymph node excision During the summer of 2009, rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry (REIMS) was described. This is the second generation method. Primarily, lipid components of tissues provide the information, but different metabolite molecules and certain proteins also allow detection. The most important advantage of the specificity of mass spectrometry data is at the histological level, providing the opportunity to identify biological tissue based on chemical composition. The REIMS method is unique, in that, while the above-described mass spectrometry techniques specific to the particular method developed ion sources should be used, but it is difficult in the case of ion source devices used in surgical practice. With the operation of a variety of tissue-cutting tools, such as a diathermy knife, a surgical laser, or an ultrasonic tissue atomizer, an aerosol is formed having a composition characteristic of the tissue cut, which also contains ionized cell constructs. Among them, in terms of using the REIMS method, the intact membrane-forming phospholipids are important, which easily are detectable by mass spectrometry on the one hand, and on the other hand, contain the combination of the characteristics of the particular tissue type. Mass spectrometric analysis is just one implementation of an effective extraction system development that was needed to cut the surgical site at the time of running the generated aerosol mass spectrometer. For this purpose, a so-called Venturi-tube serves, as well as the above- mentioned surgical hand pieces, being modified to smoke the aerosols through them. Analysis of the flue gas in the mass spectrometer is realized instantaneously, within a few tenths of a second, resulting in a tissue- specific phospholipid mass spectra being obtained, allowing a response by the surgeon in less than two seconds. The analysis of the collected spectra is made of special-evaluation software, which was developed for this purpose. The software continuously compares the incoming data during surgery, validates mass spectra stored in a database, assigns the appropriate class, and the result is displayed visually to the surgeon. It also may provide information to the surgeon via an audio signal.Heath, Nick, The Intelligent knife that helps surgeons sniff out cancer, European Technology, November 26, 2014, distributed in TechRebuplic Daily Digest, TechRepublic.com, November 27, 2014 It is estimated that the tissue identification accuracy during operation is higher than 92%. Therefore, the method is suitable for use in a surgical environment for carrying out measurements, as well as for being a part of a complex tissue identification system used during surgical tumor removal, and it can assist the surgeon in the operating surgical site with accurate histological mapping. The rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry (REIMS) is a novel technique that allows electrosurgery cuts with near real- time characterization of human tissue in vivo analysis through analysis of the vapors released during the process of tissue and aerosols. The REIMS technology and electro-surgical procedure adds tissue diagnosis to the intelligent knife iKnife operating principle.

It was the first CPR steamship on Okanagan Lake and carried passengers and cargo from Okanagan Landing to Penticton from 1893 to 1919. Aberdeen connected communities along Okanagan Lake for the first time, creating a new era in the Okanagan Valley and greatly aiding the economy and settlement of the interior of British Columbia. Construction Aberdeen was commissioned by CPR to extend the Shuswap and Okanagan Railway line from Okanagan Landing to Penticton. President William Cornelius Van Horne authorized construction in 1892. The ship was designed by the Danish shipbuilder John F. Steffen and master builder Edwin G. McKay supervised the building of the steamer. Horace Campbell of Portland, Oregon designed the engines, which were built at B.C. Iron Works. CPR built the boiler in Montreal. Aberdeen burned wood until 1902, when she was converted to a coal burner. A shipyard named Okanagan Landing was constructed near Vernon to build and maintain Aberdeen. Okanagan Landing was later used for many ships, such as , SS Naramata, and Sicamous. The construction of Aberdeen also provided work for local businesses, such as those supplying moulding, lumber, and fittings. Aberdeen was a sternwheeler of classic western design, and called the ‚ÄúFinest inland steamer set afloat in the Northwest in 1893\\". She measured 146.2 feet (44.6m) by 29.9 feet (9.1m) and her depth of hold was 6.8 feet (2.1m). Her passenger capacity was 250 and her cargo deck capacity was 200 tons (180 tonnes). The first deck held the boiler, machinery, freight, and crew‚Äôs quarters for eight. At the front of the freight deck was a staircase leading to the saloon deck, which had a smoking room in front, purser‚Äôs office aft, and a spare room. The dining saloon was in the center with 11 staterooms lining both sides. The stewardess‚Äô room, pantry, and ladies‚Äô toilet and cabins were also on the saloon deck. However, the cabins were not completed when Aberdeen was launched. The woodwork needed a year to shrink fully before the last coat of paint and gilt stripping could be applied. Officers‚Äô quarters were behind the pilothouse. Crew The first captain of Aberdeen was Captain J. Foster, former mate of the coaster liner Islander. R. Williams was first mate, H. Fawcett was purser, and W.B. Couson was first engineer. A notable captain was Captain Joseph Weeks, who first joined Aberdeens crew as a deckhand. He later went on to command and Aberdeen before becoming the last captain of Sicamous. Name Aberdeen was named after John Campbell Gordon, 7th Earl of Aberdeen. He owned the large Coldstream Ranch near Vernon and was appointed Governor General of Canada in 1893. Service Aberdeen was launched on May 22, 1893, with crowds arriving on foot or by train to Okanagan Landing to participate in the festivities. Farmers, settlers, and merchants were pleased to have a first-class, modern steam vessel to connect the Okanagan for the first time. Before Aberdeen, only primitive transportation was provided by individuals on Okanagan Lake. The operations were small, unreliable and insufficient to promote the development of the region. Aberdeen greatly improved service for residents and held a virtual monopoly on the lake as there were no comparable vessels to compete with her. She made round trips from Penticton to Okanagan Landing three times a week, with service being suspended between mid-January to March, when the steamer Penticton would fill in twice a week. In later years, this was done by and Greenwood. Until the construction of Okanagan in 1907, Aberdeen ran south on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, leaving Okanagan Landing in the morning and arriving in Penticton by the afternoon. She ran from Penticton to Okanagan Landing on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. In the beginning, wharves were primitive and there were few traveller amenities, but improvements were made and business increased. Mining developments in the 1890s meant large volumes of traffic. The Okanagan had a booming fruit industry by the early 1900s and steamers were essential for exportations. York was launched in 1902 as relief steamer for Aberdeen. By 1904, it was becoming clear that the ageing Aberdeen could not handle the traffic on the lake. Okanagan was launched in 1907 and replaced Aberdeen, freeing her for freight. Aberdeen was retired in 1916 and her hull was sold for $35.

Background UFC 181 was the organization's 300th event and was expected to be headlined by a Middleweight Championship bout between the current champion Chris Weidman and top contender Vitor Belfort. However, on September 22, it was announced that Weidman had suffered a broken hand and the bout was again rescheduled to take place at UFC 184. The new main event was a Welterweight championship rematch between champion Johny Hendricks and number one contender Robbie Lawler. Their first fight at UFC 171 ended in a unanimous decision victory in favor of the reigning champion. Co-featured on the card was a Lightweight Championship bout, which also served as the coaches bout for The Ultimate Fighter Season 20, as current champion Anthony Pettis made his first title defense against Gilbert Melendez. Gian Villante was expected to face Corey Anderson at the event. However, Villante pulled out of the fight citing an injury and was replaced by Jonathan Wilson. A few days later, it was announced that Wilson was forced out of the fight and undefeated newcomer Justin Jones took his place. Touted newcomer, Holly Holm was expected to face Raquel Pennington at this event. However, Holm pulled out of the fight in mid- November, citing a neck injury. Holm was replaced by UFC newcomer Ashlee Evans-Smith.

Today the site is within Custer National Forest and is occupied by a Bureau of Land Management Fire Station. Location The Fort Howes redoubt is located on private property near County Road 484, also known as Otter Creek Road, in present-day Powder River County, Montana, near the unincorporated community of Otter, Montana and about south of the present-day census-designated place of Ashland, Montana. It stands at above sea level; its coordinates are . History Fort Howes was established in the spring of 1897 by Custer County civilians after a sheepherder named John Hoover, who worked for John Barringer, and his sheep dog were murdered by several Cheyenne warriors between April 28 and May 3, 1897, near the town of Ashland, Montana. After Hoover's body was recovered on May 27, the women and children that lived near Ashland were sent to Sheridan, Wyoming and Miles City, Montana. Men of the Ashland area began building a fortified redoubt on the crest of a hill located on the Howes ranch, along Otter Creek, a tributary of the Tongue River, to discourage further Indian attacks. The walls were built with spaces for rifles to shoot through, and one large opening for men to enter through. Finally there was a wooden plank roof built over the fort. Weapons, ammunition, food, and water were stored inside. At its completion, the walls measured . The redoubt was named after Captain Calvin C. Howes, who owned the land under the fort. Cowboys and stockmen were posted at the fort as guards, and on multiple occasions in the early summer of 1897 they observed Cheyenne warriors riding nearby and examining the structure. Custer County Sheriff John Gibbs came to the Howes ranch and deputized twelve men, including Levi Howes, the son of Calvin C. Howes. The group was joined by cowboys, and when they numbered about 200 men, rode into Lame Deer, Montana to apprehend the Cheyenne warriors that had killed John Hoover. A contingent of U.S. Army soldiers from nearby Fort Keogh also traveled to Lame Deer to keep the peace. After discussing the situation with the Cheyenne through interpreters, the guilty Cheyenne warriors were turned over to Sheriff Gibbs and his deputies, and later released. The anticipated \\"Indian uprising\\" did not take place, and the redoubt was abandoned in the summer of 1897. Fort Howes today The rock walls are present at the original location and as of 2020 have been standing for 123 years, although the original roof has been replaced. A U.S. Forest Service Ranger Station was built just north of the site in 1936 and was replaced by a Bureau of Land Management Fire Station in 2014, equipped with a helitack office and hangar, three helipads suitable for Type II helicopters, offices, and a barracks with laundry facilities. The station is staffed by BLM fire operations personnel and three Type 6 engines, which have direct fire suppression responsibility for BLM, USFS, and private affidavit lands within Custer National Forest in Powder River County and portions of Custer, Rosebud, and Big Horn counties.

It is predominantly a coralliferous sedimentary rock, laid down in the Oxfordian stage of the Jurassic. It is a hard variety of \\"coral rag\\". Building stones from this geological structure tend to be irregular in shape. It is often found close to seams of Portland Limestone (e.g. Abbotsbury in Dorset, England). It is a younger limestone than its near-neighbour, the Oolitic, as found in the Cotswolds, in Gloucestershire. It is laterally equivalent to and interfingers with units of the Ancholme Group. A ridge of Corallian Limestone rises above the Vale of Avon and the Thames Valley in its Oxfordshire stretch. The Oxfordshire Corallian ridge is an escarpment holding back the hanging valley that is the Vale of White Horse and its hardness forced the River Thames to take a wide northern detour, to cut through the low ridge at Oxford. High points along the ridge are Cumnor Hurst and Wytham Hill. The outcrop known as Headington stone was quarried at Headington Quarry on the outskirts of Oxford and used for many of the historic University buildings there. Hilly outcrops above this corallian ridge, composed of Lower Greensand, occur at Badbury Hill, Faringdon (Folly Hill) and Boars Hill. Softer sandy deposits occur within the Corallian, found for example at Faringdon, Shellingford and Hatford in Oxfordshire, where the sands and gravels are extensively quarried. The Corallian Limestone aquifer is present at outcrop in Yorkshire and in the Cotswolds. In Yorkshire it consists of limestones and grits up to about 110 m thick, thinning to about 20 m towards the south of the region, where the limestones are progressively replaced by clay. It is typically well jointed and gives rise to numerous springs. Here it yields up to 15 l/sec. In the Cotswolds the aquifer is up to 40 m thick, give yields of 5 to 10 l/sec, with water quality becoming increasingly saline down dip as the aquifer becomes confined in the Wessex Basin. In England, Corallian Limestone is to be found in Dorset, Wiltshire, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire and Yorkshire. The most noted scholar of the Corallian strata of England was the geologist W.J. Arkell (1904‚Äì1958).

It is the lowermost part of the Windermere Supergroup, which was deposited in the foreland basin formed during the collision between Laurentia and Avalonia. It lies unconformably on the Borrowdale Volcanic Group. This unit was previously known as the Coniston Limestone Group or Coniston Limestone Formation and should not be confused with the significantly younger (uppermost Silurian) Coniston Group. Distribution The Dent Group is exposed in four areas, the southern Lake District as a narrow strip across the whole width of the outcrop, in the Cautley and Dent inliers, the Cross Fell inlier and the Craven inliers. =Lake District outcrop= In the main Lake District outcrop, the group consists of calcareous siltstones and mudstones of the basal Kirkley Bank Formation, micritic limestones of the Broughton Moor Formation and dark blue-gray shales of the Ashgill Formation. Locally volcanic formations are developed, including the Yarlside Volcanic Formation at the base of the Kirkley Bank Formation and the High Haume Tuff and Appletreeworth Formations at the base of the Ashgill Formations. =Cautley and Dent inliers= In the Cautley and Dent inliers, rocks of the Dent Group occur in two fault bounded strips next to the Dent Fault. In these inliers, calcareous mudstones of the Cautley Mudstone Formation are overlain by the Ashgill Formation. The Cautley Volcanic Member is a unit of volcaniclastic rocks, within the Cautley Mudstone Formation. =Cross Fell inlier= In the Cross Fell inlier, the basal Dufton Shale Formation is followed by the Swindale Limestone Formation and the Ashgill Formation. In the Keisley area, the uppermost part of the Dent Group is represented by the highly fossiliferous Keisley Limestone Formation, exposed in the core of an anticline. =Craven inliers= The Craven inliers are found to the north of the North Craven Fault. In these inliers, calcareous siltstones and muddy limestones of the Norber Formation are overlain by siltstones and mudstones of the Sowerthwaite Formation. The Dam House Bridge Tuff Member forms the basal part of the Sowerthwaite Formation. Tectonic setting The early Paleozoic geology of northern England records the convergence and eventual collision of the Avalonia microcontinent with the continent of Laurentia. The underlying Borrowdale Volcanic Group formed in an island arc, caused by the southerly subduction of the crust of the now vanished Iapetus Ocean. At the end of active arc volcanism, the area began to subside, allowing deposition of the shallow marine Dent Group. The final closure of Iapetus occurred during the Devonian Acadian orogeny, with the resulting continental collision causing deformation of the Ordovician rocks, including folding, thrusting and cleavage development. Depositional environment The Dent Group was deposited in a shallow water environment.

Cole incorporated pieces of architecture from Egyptian, Greek, Roman, and Gothic styles in various different parts of the painting, having dabbled in architecture previously. Cole finished the painting in only five weeks and showed it in the National Academy of Design annual exhibition that year. However, the painting was not well received by Town, who refused to accept the painting because he claimed that it was \\"exclusively architectural\\".Parry, Ellwood C., III. The Art of Thomas Cole: Ambition and Imagination. Newark, Delaware: University of Delaware Press, 1988 In a letter written in the late 1830s, Cole stated that: > For architecture to arrive at the perfection which we see in the best > examples of Greece, Ages of expression and thought must have been necessary > [for] the human mind [to] have traveled by slow degrees from the rude column > of unknown stone such as formed the druidical structures through the > stupendous portals of Egyptian Art to unsurpassed beauty of the Grecian > Temple...Roman architecture is but depraved Greek. The forms are borrowed > but the spirit was lost & it became more and more rude until it sank to the > uncouth incongruities of what are called the dark ages... [Gothic] > Architecture aspires to something beyond finite perfection[.] It leaves the > philosophic completion of Grecian Art when all is finished to the eye and > touch and appeals to the imagination. Partaking of the Genius of > Christianity it opens a world beyond the visible in which we dwell...All is > lofty, aspiring and mysterious.

Tobin formed a firm in partnership with John Bayley Bland in 1831 which operated a packet service between Halifax and St. John's, and was also involved in general inter-colonial trade. The partnership was dissolved in 1839 but Tobin continued operations in partnership with James B. Hutton. The new firm, James Tobin and Company, also became heavily involved in the seal fishery. In 1834, he married Emily Cecilia Bullen. Tobin was named to the Executive Council in 1841 and became a member of the amalgamated legislature in 1842. In 1848, when the assembly and council were again split, he continued as a member of the Executive Council. In 1849, Tobin was named a special stipendiary and a customs inspector for St. George's. However, he was unpopular and was removed from these posts in 1853. In 1855, Tobin presented himself as a candidate for the Placentia and St. Mary's seat in the assembly; however, he withdrew his candidacy after he was named to the Legislative Council.

Most cases have been found in the upper jaw of patients. Unchecked growth of the tumor can make swallowing and eating difficult, and can also lead to grotesque facial swelling. In most cases, surgery is required to remove the extra teeth and tumorous tissue. Prior to 2014, the maximum recorded number of teeth removed in such an operation was 37. However, in July 2014 Ashiq Gavai, a 17-year-old boy in India, suffered from an extreme case of composite odontoma in his lower jaw, which required the removal of more than 232 teeth altogether. The surgery was performed by Dr. Sunanda Dhiware at Sir J. J. Hospital in Mumbai, India.

Kanai was born December 5, 1908 in the small town of Koloa in what was then the Territory of Hawaii. He received his B.A. in English from the University of Hawaii in 1930, and in 1935, after his return from an extended trip to Japan, he began working for the Lihue, Kauai YMCA. In 1937, Kanai moved to California to take a job at San Francisco's Buchanan Street YMCA, where he remained until the war. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Kanai testified before the Tolan Committee and corresponded with various political and military leaders, attempting to persuade them against the mass removal of Japanese Americans from California and quell the tide of anti-Japanese prejudice that had cost many Japanese Americans their jobs. His proposals to hold hearings to assess the loyalty of Japanese Americans instead of removing them en masse, and to allow students, the elderly and handicapped individuals to avoid incarceration went unheeded. When the Western Defense Command issued an order for the Japanese American residents of San Francisco to present themselves for \\"evacuation\\" on May 20, 1942, Kanai did not comply, instead remaining in the city and continuing his advocacy efforts. On June 1 he left the Bay Area to attend a series of conferences and meetings on the removal and confinement of West Coast Japanese, and on July 11 he was arrested by the FBI at a YMCA convention outside Milwaukee, for violating Public Law 503, which enforced the provisions of President Roosevelt's Executive Order 9066. Kanai's lawyers issued a writ of habeas corpus, arguing that the creation of the West Coast exclusion zone was unconstitutional, but the court denied the petition, citing the fact that Kanai had admitted to knowing he was violating the law when he left California. He was tried under Public Law 503 in San Francisco and, on August 27, sentenced to six months. He was \\"released\\" to the Heart Mountain concentration camp in Wyoming on February 6, 1943, two months early for good behavior. In October 1943, Kanai was granted leave to move to Milwaukee, where he took a job working with under-resourced boys. He moved to Battle Mountain, Michigan in 1950, where he remained until his death.

All four locations are open to the public. They are: *The Alvar Aalto Museum in Jyv√§skyl√§, which is a museum specialised in architecture and design and functions as the national and international centre on all things Aalto (in more detail below). *The Muuratsalo Experiential House (in more detail below) *Villa Aalto in Munkkiniemi, Helsinki *Studio Aalto, also in Munkkiniemi, Helsinki The Alvar Aalto Museum in Jyv√§skyl√§ This museum, which is specialised in architecture and design, is located in Jyv√§skyl√§. It was founded in 1966 to foster the legacy of the architecture of Alvar Aalto. The museum is located in a building designed by Aalto and completed in 1973. The museum functions as a centre of information on all things related to Aalto, and it organises exhibitions both in Finland and abroad and produces publications on Alvar Aalto. The museum houses a permanent exhibition on the life work of Alvar Aalto. The current permanent exhibition was opened in 1998, the centennial of Aalto's birth. The mission of the building heritage section of the museum is the protection of buildings designed by Alvar Aalto. It maintains a national register of protected Aalto buildings and gives expert assistance on matters relating to Aalto buildings. The building heritage section works in close cooperation with the Finnish National Board of Antiquities. Before the Jyv√§skyl√§ Art Museum was established in 1998, the Alvar Aalto Museum also hosted exhibitions of visual arts. The museum building The museum, designed by Alvar Aalto and completed in 1973, is located on a slope which lies next to Lake Jyv√§sj√§rvi. Together with the Museum of Central Finland (Alvar Aalto, 1961), these buildings form a cultural centre in the immediate vicinity of the University of Jyv√§skyl√§ (Alvar Aalto, 1951‚Äì71). Both museums represent Aalto's \\"white period\\". The ten years' difference in the design of the buildings can be seen especially in the fa√ßades ‚Äî the fa√ßade of the Museum of Central Finland, rising from a slope of a hill, shows the geometric practicality of early functionalism, whereas the Aalto Museum is more closed in, but at the same time more free in its form. The outside walls of the Aalto Museum are clad in light-coloured ceramic tiles named \\"Halla\\" (\\"frost\\"), manufactured by the famous Finnish porcelain manufacturers Arabia. The high concrete socle was painted white. The vertical bands of baton-shaped, glazed tiles divide up the rampart-like elevations to form a relief that gives a strong effect of depth when the surface is washed with light. The rampart-like quality is emphasised by the vertical battens on the roof windows of the exhibition galleries, which cause the roof lights to merge into the fa√ßade when looked at from a certain angle. The first floor of the museum contains the foyer and cloakrooms, a museum shop, Caf√© Alvar, a reference library, office and storage spaces and the museum's URBS Workshop. The windows of Caf√© Alvar have a view to a series of open-air pools, with water trickling from one to another along the route of what was once a natural stream. The exhibition space of the second floor has a total area of 700 m2. The wave-like surface of the back wall contains a trace of the pavilion that Aalto designed for the 1939 New York World's Fair. Light flows in through skylight windows. The second floor houses the permanent exhibition of the museum, entitled Alvar Aalto, Architect, as well as changing exhibitions on architecture and design. Collections The collections of the museum amount to nearly 1,500 items: furniture, light fittings, glass art items and other things designed by Aino Aalto and Alvar Aalto. They also include paintings by Alvar Aalto and more than 30 models of his buildings. In addition to unique pieces of furniture, the collections include almost all models that were mass-produced, as well as a great number of prototypes. The Alvar Aalto collection of drawings contain ca. 200,000 original drawings and documents related to his designs, beginning from 1917. The museum also has in Jyv√§skyl√§ a photo archive, a newspaper archive, a reference library and the archive of Aalto's correspondence. Exhibitions The permanent exhibition Alvar Aalto, Architect presents the output of Aalto through models, original drawings and photographs. Special attention is given to 24 individual buildings or groups of buildings. Also present is Aalto's design of interiors, glass objects and pieces of furniture. In addition to the permanent exhibition, the museum Gallery contains changing exhibitions on architecture and design. The museum also organises touring exhibitions on Aalto's works. It is also possible to acquaint oneself with Aalto's architecture and design in the museums web exhibitions. =Web exhibitions= * Alvar Aalto‚Äôs life 1898‚Äì1976 * The Paimio Sanatorium * Chairs * Light fittings * S√§yn√§tsalo Town Hall The Muuratsalo Experimental House Muuratsalo Experimental House The experimental house of Muuratsalo is located on the shores of Lake P√§ij√§nne. The house was used as the summer home by the Aalto family until 1994. Since then, the house has been acquired by the museum. The house is enclosed by a provisional courtyard space which, when looking outward, frames the landscape within its entrance. This partial enclosure mediates the space, creating a distinction between interior and exterior, open and closed form. Aalto described this group of buildings as a combination of an architect's studio and an experimental centre, in which one could also carry out experiments that are not yet sufficiently well developed to be tried out in practice and where the proximity of nature may offer inspiration for both form and structure. It was a kind of a laboratory, which at the same time was combined with a playful approach.

Personal life The Willows (date unknown) From a young age, he worked in his father's painting and decorating businessGalerie Oscar De Vos: Biography of Huys and later studied at the \\"Gentse Nijverheidschool\\" (Ghent Industrial School). In 1891 or 1892, he came into contact with Emile Claus, who encouraged his artistic inclinations. In 1900, he enrolled at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp), where his teachers were Eug√®ne Joors and Frans Van Leemputten (1850-1914), but he never completed his studies.Olsene website: Biography with photograph It was about this time that he became lifelong friends with the author Stijn Streuvels. In 1909, he married and settled near Waregem.  Career  Fairground in Kerselaere (c.1912) In 1902, he debuted at the Sint- Lucasgilde in Kortrijk and began to exhibit more widely. He spent time in Meetjesland, painting landscapes. From 1905, he participated in the exhibitions of Vie et Lumi√®re, a luminist group, along with Claus, James Ensor and Jenny Montigny. At the outbreak of World War I, he fled to the Netherlands, although he returned in 1915 and moved about as the war dictated. His home and studio were destroyed in 1918 and he ended up living with a forester near Brakel. After the armistice, he painted scenes of the devastation at the front, then settled in Wakken the following year. He again began to exhibit extensively, including shows at the Paris Salon and the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh. During this period, his colors became darker and the contrasts harsher, approaching expressionism. In 1926, he built his ideal home-studio, the \\"Zonnehuys\\" (Sun House), in Zulte. Several taverns in the area claim to have frescoes that he painted. A square in Olsene (a district of Zulte) was named after him in 1999. References Further reading * Willem G.

The committee was paid a lump sum for the valuable timber which it used to establish the reserve, fence off additional entrances and pay for the laying of paths, building of viewing decks and planting of indigenous flora. Some residents bordering on the reserve have pulled their fences back increasing the overall size of the reserve. Fauna and flora Its indigenous forest, wetland and grassland are home to many species of birds and small mammals, and the small dam which was built is populated with fish. Bushbuck, blue duiker, porcupine, dassies and mongooses are resident and some 47 species of bird have been recorded. The plant life is diverse but many exotic species are present.

Early life Ljubibratiƒá was born in Piva, and belonged to the Ruƒëiƒá brotherhood, at a time when the region was part of the Ottoman Empire. Ljubibratiƒá, as many of his relatives, took monastic vows and later became a bishop. Bishop of Herzegovina Since 1687, he was a notable participant in the struggle against the Ottomans, in Venetian support. On 10 December 1687, he was present at Tvrdo≈° when the priest and vojvoda Vuka≈°in Gavriloviƒá with his people came from Nik≈°iƒá. In 1690, he and the Tvrdo≈° brotherhood (including his brother Stevan) left Trebinje for Herceg Novi, fleeing the Ottomans, where they renovated the Savina Monastery. The Republic of Venice recognized Savatije's episcopal rule as Metropolitan (Vladika) of Zahumlje in Novi in 1695. His ecclesiastical province stretched over \\"newly conquered areas\\". The Serbian Church made the first steps to establish an independent Serb municipality in the region of old Draƒçevica. Bishop of Dalmatia Metropolitan Nikodim Busoviƒá, the bishop \\"of all Orthodox Serbs on the Dalmatian continent\\", was banished from Dalmatia in early 1705. On the demand of the Krka monastery and Krupa monastery, Ljubibratiƒá was appointed Nikodim's office by the Venetian government. Ljubibratiƒá had taken this office in spite of Melentije Tipaldi (1658‚Äì1730), the Greek-Catholic bishop who was a driving force of Uniatism, and continued the struggle against the Uniatism of Serbs in Dalmatia. Tipaldi greatly undermined against Ljubibratiƒá, so far that the Church Synod in Constantinople condemned Tipaldi and excluded him from the Orthodox Church as a traitor; with this support, Ljubibratiƒá was able to continue his service. In July 1705 Metropolitan Savatije Ljubibratiƒá came back from the pilgrimage from Palestine and from the time his vessel entered the quarantine station called lazaretto, he was subjected to the sanitary procedure by the staff of lazaretto in Herceg Novi as every other traveller aboard. After a lapse of 15 days, he was released. There he proceeded to build a bridge, churches and restore others. Savatije is credited for restoring Savina Monastery, Montenegro. Savatije and his brother Stevan became friends with colonel Mihailo Miloradoviƒá, who had along with Metropolitan Danilo I Petroviƒá-Njego≈° been recruited by Peter I of Russia to incite rebellion in Herzegovina against the Ottomans in 1710‚Äì11 (during the Pruth River Campaign).Schultz, C. C. (2004). . Taleon Club Magazine, 2004 no. 8 . Retrieved 2011-07-16. Archived from the original on 2006-01-12. Ljubibratiƒá successfully opposed the orders of the Catholic curia against the Orthodox believers in Dalmatia. Savatije declined Venetian official Ivan Buroviƒá's offers to begin Uniatism, Buroviƒá having sent the Catholic bishop of Kotor and his relative Viƒáentije Zmajeviƒá from Perast. He strengthened ties with the Serbian Patriarchate of Peƒá, and as a result of that, Serbian Patriarch Mojsije I visited Dalmatia in 1714, after Ljubibratiƒá's request; this visit proved important for the preservation of Orthodoxy and somewhat paused pressure on the Orthodox church in Dalmatia. Savatije Ljubibratiƒá died in January 1716, in the village of Topla, near Herceg Novi. His successor was his brother Stevan Ljubibratiƒá. Legacy He was one of the more successful Serb national leaders of the 18th century.

Big W consisted of Kingfisher's main retail chains that they owned at the time - Comet, B&Q;, Superdrug and Woolworths in one store format. Despite sharing the name with the Australian chain of the same name, the two of them are not related, as they were owned by different companies. Woolworths scrapped the Big W format in 2004 and sold off 1/3 of the stores, while continuing to operate 14 of the stores in a smaller format known as Woolworths Out-of-Town Stores, sometimes sharing the space with Peacocks. History In 1967, The F.W. Woolworth Company opened their first British Woolco store in Oadby, Leicestershire. The store was 63,000 sq.ft and offered many products like groceries, fashion and household products under one roof. Woolworth later opened 2 more stores in Thornaby, Stockton on Tees and Bournemouth, Hampshire. All the stores were very successful, and eventually, Woolworth operated 12 stores under the Woolco name. When the F.W. Woolworth Company spun off the British Woolworth chain into Woolworth Holdings PLC in 1983, the Woolco stores were later converted to regular Woolworth stores, and then the company sold them off to Supermarket chain Gateway in 1986. Gateway then sold the stores once more, this time to Asda in 1988. Only a few former Woolco stores remain to this day under Asda ownership. In 1980, Woolworth acquired the DIY chain B&Q;, which at its peak had 26 stores. In 1982, Both the British Woolworth and B&Q; chains were split from the F.W. Woolworth Company into Woolworth Holdings PLC. The company expanded by acquiring the Comet Group in 1984 and then Superdrug in 1987. Woolworth Holdings PLC was renamed Kingfisher Group PLC in 1989 to focus less on the Woolworths brand. In 1998, the CEO of Kingfisher Group, Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy publicly revealed Big W, a chain of stores that would combine Kingfisher's four main brands. This chain was similar to Woolco, and featured products from Woolworths, Superdrug, Comet and B&Q; in a single format. In the same year, the Canadian-born Bob Hetherington was chosen to run the chain. Bob had experience with the American F.W. Woolworth Company as he had previously run the American Woolco chain before all the stores were closed in 1982. Hetherington wanted the Big W stores to be fun places to shop in and to offer entertainment during the weekend. A location in Edinburgh, Scotland was chosen to be the first Big W location. Construction started in September 1998, and the store opened in June 1999, and was a success for the Kingfisher Group. Kingfisher later opened up stores in other locations, such as Stockton, Bristol, Bradford, Glasgow, Birmingham, Redruth and Tamworth. In 2000, clothing and food brands for Big W were created with assistance from The Big Food Group and Peacocks. Only a few stores would supply both of those selections. =Fate= In 2000, Kingfisher Group PLC began to demerge, after losses from the Comet and B&Q; chains and the battle of the ownership of French DIY chain Castorama. In 2001, Kingfisher split their General Merchandise division, which included Woolworths, Big W, Music and Video Club and Superdrug into its own company, known as Woolworths Group PLC. Superdrug was later sold to Dutch company Kruidvat in the same year, and eventually Kingfisher began to focus exclusively on DIY after selling off Comet. The Kingfisher demerger affected the Big W chain, as the stores would simply become oversized Woolworths stores after the loss of the other chains, and was renamed to Woolworths Big W. Despite this, stores continued to open up stores monthly under the new name, with some existing stores having their logo on the top of the building changed to the modified version. In 2003, Woolworths started to open stores less often as the chain was beginning to become very unprofitable for the company. Following a period of losses, Woolworths confirmed in 2004 that it would abandon the Big W concept. The group sold seven of the 21 Big W stores in 2005 to Tesco and Asda, which also included a store in Grimsby that never opened due to the Big W format already being scrapped. The gross internal floor area of the remaining sites was reduced to an optimum trading size of around 40,000 to and were rebranded as regular Woolworths stores, some sharing space with the clothing chain Peacocks or others shunk down in size entirely. The Tamworth store closed in April 2008 so that M&S; could expand (They already owned the other half of the former Big W) and the remaining 13 stores closed in 2008 and 2009 after Woolworths ceased trading. =About= Much like Woolco, Big W stores were found on retail parks or out-of-town areas around the UK and supplied goods from the four main Kingfisher brands. When the stores became Woolworths Big W, they supplied only Woolworths products. These remained mainly the same when the stores became regular Woolworths Stores. Peacocks (who supplied Big W's Clothing Brand) shared half of the out-of-town stores with Woolworths. Some stores later introduced Woolworths Clearance Outlets at the back of the stores. =Stores (Incomplete)= =Stores converted to Woolworths= *Edinburgh, Opened in 1999 and was rebranded as Woolworths/Peacocks in 2005, also containing a Burger King.

Synopsis  Olallo Rubio traces the history of the Mexican rock band Molotov and their wider significance to Mexican politics explaining how Mexican rock music has always had a rather ambiguous relationship with the Mexican government and society in general since the late 1950s, passing through the Avandaro Festival's La Onda hippie generation until modern times.  Cast  * Sergio Arau * Olallo Rubio * Juan Villoro * Fernanda Tapia * Molotov: Tito Fuentes, Miky Huidobro, Paco Ayala, and Randy Ebright * Luis de Llano Macedo * Alex Lora * Armando Molina S.  Production  Rubio had wanted to do a rockumentary for a long time and was inspired to direct one after he saw the band perform in Spain in 2003. He said that he hoped the film would inspire young people to be more critical of the government.  Release  Gimme the Power was released in Mexico on June 1, 2012, timed to appear just before the general election.  Reception  According to El Universal, the film was received well in Mexico.

Dr. Henry Brown Henry Brown (July 20, 1848 ‚Äì 1931) was a Methodist missionary and minister in Washington state at the turn of the century, a prohibitionist, and an author of one book. Born in Guernsey County, Ohio, Reverend Dr. Henry Brown was the presiding elder of the Spokane District of the Columbia River Conference for many years during the 1890s to the early 1900s.Books\\", Northwestern Christian Advocate, vol. 52, no. 1, Chicago, IL. January 6, 1904. Support of prohibition Brown was a prohibitionist, and continually challenged local papers coverage of prohibition and its supporters, especially the Daily Journal in Walla Walla, which in January 1888 announced it would not publish a proposed article in support of prohibition. Brown challenged the editor on the grounds that newspapers were meant to act as a ‚Äúmirror to reflect public opinion‚Äù and that excluding the support of a policy that the editor disagreed with would be a disservice to the paper‚Äôs patrons.\\"Communicated\\", The Daily Journal, Walla Walla, Washington. January 27, 1888. Support of women's suffrage Brown was a vocal supporter of women‚Äôs suffrage in the Washington Territory,\\"Woman Suffrage\\" The Daily Journal, Walla Walla, Washington. November 15, 1887. one of the first territories in which women gained the right to vote through full enfranchisement in 1883.Stevenson, Shanna. Women‚Äôs Votes, Women‚Äôs Voices: The Campaign for Equal Rights in Washington. Washington State Historical Society, Tacoma, Wa, 2009. Brown wrote many letters to the editor of the Daily Journal in Walla Walla about the paper‚Äôs representation of women‚Äôs newly acquired right to vote. In 1887, a year before the Washington Territorial Supreme Court revoked women‚Äôs right to vote, the paper asserted that the Union did not want to force women to vote, but that many women, once they could vote, only voted in the first ballot out of curiosity and thereafter ceased to vote as the novelty of voting dissipated. Brown challenged this interpretation, writing that the Union did not force men to vote, so why would they force women to do so? He argued that while the Union did not believe in forcing women to vote, it did believe in forcing women to abstain from voting, and that the Union would continue to reinforce and perpetuate the legal barriers that kept women from voting. As author Brown published one book, The Impending Peril: Or, Methodism and Amusement, which describes the dangers that \\"popular amusements of the day\\" posed to Christianity. In his preface, he went as far as to say that popular amusements were \\"insidious attacks\\" and that they emanated \\"evil\\"Brown, Henry, The Impending Peril, Or, Methodism and Amusements: a Compilation of Testimony, Rules, Speeches, and Articles on the Amusement Question with an Argument in Review, Cincinnati, OH: Jennings and Pye, 1904. His book also describes his support of prohibition ‚Äî specifically, that he believed that as God created the ten commandments, the \\"moral law\\", it was up to religious leaders like himself to help make moral laws, as \\"the world has not yet been won over to righteousness.\\" The Impending Peril: Or, Methodism and Amusement was published at a time when many in the Methodist church were pressing for the official relaxation of the rules governing leisure activities, citing the demand for a \\"freer life\\" for members in good standing in the church. Brown‚Äôs book pushed back against the increasing desire for more liberal rules and fewer restrictions, asserting that if the rules were to be loosened, current members would leave the church and the church would begin to attract people who were less committed than current members.\\"Literature\\", The Religious Telescope, Dayton, Ohio, January 6, 1904.

Its height of occupation was between 1260 and 1320 CE. The pueblo is believed to have been similar to Taos Pueblo and had about 400 rooms on the ground floor for storage, with additional rooms in the multiple-storied dwellings used as dwellings.Pot Creek Cultural Site. Carson National Forest. Four Corners Geotourism. Retrieved July 23, 2014. It is estimated that the pueblo was occupied for about three generations, with its peak population about 1310. Around 1318 a great kiva was under construction, but it was never completed. It is believed that the pueblo was abandoned about 1320, at which time the southern portion of the site was destroyed by fire. Residents moved to nearby Picuris and Taos Pueblos. The pueblo people lived primarily on a diet of corn, squash and beans that they grew. They also ate bison, local animals and wild plants. The made their own pottery. Gray pottery was used for cooking. They also decorated black-on-white pottery vessels and made tools from stone and animal bones.

The upper reservoir began impounding water in March 2013 and the first generator and all four generators were commissioned by 30 November 2015. The power station operates by shifting water between an upper and lower reservoir to generate electricity. The lower reservoir is located on Qin River and the upper reservoir is located in a valley above the west side of the lower reservoir. During periods of low energy demand, such as at night, water is pumped from Qingyuan Lower Reservoir up to the upper reservoir. When energy demand is high, the water is released back down to the lower reservoir but the pump turbines that pumped the water up now reverse mode and serve as generators to produce electricity. The process is repeated as necessary and the plant serves as a peaking power plant. It is operated by China Southern Power Grid Company. The lower reservoir is created by a tall and long rock- fill dam on the Pan Wen River. It can withhold up to of water, of which can be pumped to the upper reservoir. The upper reservoir is created by a tall and long rock-fill dam. It can withhold up to of water, of which can be used for power production.

An illegal demonstration gathered about 500 persons (the police and organisers having similar figures), without incident, but the riots broke out quickly after the dispersion of the demonstration, starting with 50 protesters provoking the police and eventually involving up 300 people according to the report of the riot police. Jewish-owned businesses and non-Jewish owned businesses were attacked and looted by local youths armed with metal bars and wooden clubs. Members of La Ligue de d√©fense juive (LDJ, Jewish Defense League) were present in Sarcelles, and attempted to defend a synagogue by forming a line in front of it and holding motor-cycle helmets as weapons. Palestinian groups accused the League of provoking the attack by taunting demonstrators and throwing projectiles. Background =Pro-palestinian demonstrations= The Operation Protective Edge created a lot of emotions in France, in particular within the French population of Arab descent. This social composition of the pro-Palestinian is both put forward by radical-left and post-colonial groups and by right-wing medias, and most of the events occurred in low-income and high-immigration neighbourhoods. However, after having given an unusually direct support to Isra√´l, the French government took a hard stance and forbid almost every pro-Palestinian demonstration. The interdictions begun around 14 July, mostly presented as technical and due to the overlap with the festivities of the national holiday, but not everywhere. Then the justifications put forward for later interdictions quickly became the clashes between pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel activists, which begun as soon as 13 July. This led to many illegal demonstrations during this month, in a context of tensions. In particular those of Barb√®s and Sarcelles. Those demonstrations have often been described as anti-semitic, and many comments pointed out the presence of Islamic or ethnic (\\"communautaristes\\") orientations inside those demonstrations, although they have mostly been organised by the radical left and the far-left (in particular the NPA). Some incorrect news was broadcast and corrected afterwards, while we have oral reports of anti-semitic sentences which are hard to check (such as the rumour of a \\"Mort aux Juifs !\\", \\"Death to the Jews!\\") but a few pictures from the Dieudonn√© sphere can be found. In parallel, the pro-Israel counter- demonstration in Sarcelles was forbidden as well, since groups such as Jewish Defense League have already participated in several violent confrontations with pro-Palestinian demonstrators in the previous days. =Claims of rising of anti-semitism= France has the third largest community of Jews after Israel and the U.S. and anti-Semitism in France has increased significantly in recent years with one monitoring group claiming that it has increased 700% since the 1990s.FT, Anti-Semitic attacks rise in France as Gaza conflict stirs tensions, By Adam Thomson in Paris, http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/aee8175c-2472-11e4-be8e-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3Ek6FKVM9 Since the beginning of the 21st century, antisemitism in France has found new sources of recruitment from certain leftist groups and in the identification of a significant proportion of the Muslim immigrant population with the Palestinian cause on the one hand and with radical Islamism on the other.New York Times Magazine: \\"A Frenchman Or a Jew?\\" By Fernanda Eberstadt February 29, 2004Haaretz: \\"French hatred of Jews goes far beyond Muslim anti-Semitism, says U.K. author\\" by Daniella Peled February 18, 2014 By early 2014 the number of French Jews immigrating to Israel had overtaken the number of American Jews and at the same time 70% of French Jews were concerned about insults or harassment and 60% about physical aggression because of their Jewishness, both figures being much higher than the European average. A kosher grocery store was set ablaze, for which the perpetrator was convicted of arson. Reactions =Government response= Prime Minister of France Manuel Valls condemned the attack as antisemitic. He said of the attack, \\"What's happened in Sarcelles is intolerable: attacking a synagogue or a kosher grocery, is quite simply anti-Semitism, racism.\\" Minister of the Interior Bernard Cazeneuve said that the violence prompted the ban, not that the ban prompted the violence. Three men, aged 21 and 28, were jailed for between six and ten months for their part in the riot. A fourth man received a suspended sentence, and a minor received a fine. Three other men received suspended sentences for their part in a riot in Paris on the same day. None of the convictions in Sarcelles were for 'anti-Semitism'. Instead they were for minor public order offences. The term 'riot' was never used by police or prosecutors.

The Holbein Gate and a second less ornate gate, Westminster Gate, were constructed by Henry VIII to connect parts of the Tudor Palace of Whitehall to the east and west of the road. It was one of two substantial parts of the Palace of Whitehall to survive a catastrophic fire in January 1698, the other being Inigo Jones's classical Banqueting House. The Holbein Gate was described by Thomas Pennant as \\"the most beautiful gate at Whitehall\\". It was demolished in 1759. The name of Holbein Gate reflects a tradition that it was designed by Hans Holbein, although any connection with Holbein seems unlikely. It was also known as the King's Gate or the Cockpit Gate, being close to the Royal Cockpit. The Westminster Gate or Kings Street Gate further south was built in a simpler more classical style with circular corner towers and domed turrets, and was demolished in 1723. The Holbein Gate is shown in drawings and engravings, including an engraving made by George Vertue in 1725 and published in 1747 in Vol. I of Vetusta Monumenta. The gate was a rectangular building of three floors, with the principal rooms on the upper two floors. Projecting square bases on each corner supporting octagonal towers and turrets. A passageway between the towers approximately wide allowed traffic to pass beneath a flat archway, with one footway to the east and possibly a second footway to the west through the towers (although the west footway may have been blocked and then cleared). Above the arch was an oriel window with two row of six lights (one to either side and four in the centre) on the first floor, and a window of four lights in a double row on the first floor. The top of the tower was surmounted by a parapet with battlements. Each face of the octagonal towers had two-light windows in double rows. Both sides of the gate were faced with chequerboard patterns of flint and stone, and also decorative carved panels, including a royal coat of arms above the arch, gryphons holding shields, and other royal emblems, such as the portcullis, fleur-de-lys and Tudor rose. Roundels to either side of the large central windows held with busts, possibly by Giovanni da Maiano. (Three terracotta busts by Pietro Torrigiano owned by the Wright family in Hatfield Peverel until the 1920s were thought to come from the Gate, but later scholarship doubts any connection.) The arch was later filled in down to the springing, flattening its profile. A gallery to the west overlooked the Royal Tiltyard (now Horse Guards Parade) leading eventually to St James's Park. Another gallery led to the Cockpit. The upper storey was used as the Paper Office, from perhaps 1672 until 1756. The lower storey was used as lodgings. Residents included Duke of Lennox in around 1620, later General Lambert until 1657 and then Viscount Fauconberg. It was occupied by Lady Castlemaine from around 1664 to around 1670 and then by her daughter, the Countess of Sussex. William Van Huls, Clerk of the Queen's Robes and Wardrobes, was the occupant in 1712. Like the gate at Temple Bar on Fleet Street, the Holbein Gate obstructed the movement of traffic along the road below. Proposals for its demolition were put forward in the early part of the 18th century, successfully opposed by John Vanbrugh and others The gate was left in place when the King Street Gate was demolished in 1723, but the filled-in segment of the arch was cleared to increase headroom for traffic passing below. The adjacent red brick Van Huls house (depicted by Canaletto in a painting of 1747 at Goodwood House) was acquired in March 1759, and the arch and the house were demolished in August 1759. There were plans for the Duke of Cumberland to rebuild the gate in Windsor Great Park, but in the end it seems that the materials were incorporated in repairs to other buildings.

Controversial issues have included the level of racism in Russian football and the discrimination against LGBT people in wider Russian society. Russia's involvement in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine has also caused calls for the tournament to be moved, particularly following the annexation of Crimea and support of separatists in war in Donbass. The then FIFA President Sepp Blatter declined requests for the tournament to be moved. The 2015 allegations and criminal investigations of corruption, including a Swiss inquiry into the bidding process for the 2018 World Cup, intensified the public discussion of the appropriateness of Russia as the World Cup venue. In late May 2015, Russia's president Vladimir Putin said that he viewed the corruption investigations as an attempt by the U.S. to oust Sepp Blatter from his post as punishment for his support of Russia as host for the 2018 World Cup. Allegations of corruption Football Association chairman David Bernstein called for all UEFA nations to boycott the 2018 and 2022 World Cups due to allegations of corruption in the bidding processes The English FA, which competed against Russia to host the tournament, was not satisfied by the 42 page summary released by FIFA, in November 2014, of the 350 page Garcia Report, which cleared both Russia and Qatar of corruption in the bidding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. FA Chairman Greg Dyke called for a re-investigation of the claims, while his predecessor David Bernstein called on all UEFA nations to boycott the two tournaments. Reinhard Rauball, President of the Deutsche Fu√üball Liga (DFL), called on UEFA to secede from FIFA unless the corruption investigation was released in full. Anatoly Vorobyov said \\"We have enough disciplinary measures which are laid out in our regulations. On the other hand, perhaps they need to be used more strictly\\". In an interview published on 7 June 2015, Domenico Scala, the head of FIFA's Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that \\"should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled\\".  Military conflict in Ukraine  = Crimea = U.S. Senator Dan Coats wrote to Sepp Blatter requesting that Russia be barred from the 2018 World Cup due to its annexation of Crimea The annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation in 2014 led to several British and American politicians calling on FIFA to overturn its decision of hosting the 2018 World Cup in Russia ‚Äî British Shadow Secretary of State for Health Andy Burnham said that football's governing body should reconsider, \\"Fifa urged to rethink staging 2018 World Cup in Russia\\".

Waterfield, Bruno (2014-08-29):\\"Ukraine crisis: Britain wants Russia stripped of right to host World Cup 2018\\". Telegraph.co.uk. Retrieved 1 September 2014.

Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 In July 2014, after Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down, Western leaders blamed Russia and there were again calls for the tournament to be moved. Michael Fuchs, a parliamentarian in the German government, stated his belief that moving the tournament would have more impact than sanctions on Russia. The German FA (DFB) did not comment on the issue, although its Dutch counterpart (KNVB), representing the country with the most victims in the disaster, declared that such discussion should wait until the investigation of the accident. Nick Clegg, the then‚ÄìDeputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, also stated his belief that due to the crash Russia should be stripped of the World Cup. The Prime Minister, David Cameron, did not share this idea, but appreciated the concern. Sepp Blatter said that the tournament should be a \\"force for good\\". Events after Russia winning to host the World Cup =Racism= Yaya Tour√© said in 2013 that black footballers could boycott the tournament if actions were not taken against racism in Russian football After it was announced that Russia would host the 2018 World Cup, Dr Rafa≈Ç Pankowski, a head of UEFA FARE Monitoring Centre, accused the Russian Football Union of downplaying racist chants in stadiums. In October 2013, after allegedly being racially abused by fans of the Russian club CSKA Moscow, Ivorian footballer Yaya Tour√© stated that black players might boycott the 2018 World Cup unless Russia tackles racism in football. On 13 July 2014, when the next World Cup was handed to Russia, Russian President Vladimir Putin said: \\"President Blatter puts a lot of personal effort into addressing social issues, and we hope that the preparations for the World Cup in Russia will also contribute to tasks, such as fighting drugs, racism and other challenges we face today\\". In March 2015, Anatoly Vorobyov, the general secretary of the Russian Football Union, said that \\"not everything is going smoothly\\" in the campaign to eliminate the \\"virus\\" of racism from Russian football before the tournament. Later that month, Vyacheslav Koloskov, a member of the Russian bid team and former Vice President of FIFA, said that too much is made of racism in Russia, and that monkey chanting is not racist. = LGBT activism = In response to perceived discrimination against LGBT people in the country, a number of petitions have been circulated calling for FIFA to strip Russia of hosting rights. Thousands have signed these petitions, including United States senators Mark Kirk and Dan Coats and gay rights activists Greg Louganis, Stephen Fry and George Takei. = Ban on negative news reporting = Russia's interior ministry ordered police not to provide negative news to the media during the World Cup and instead report only of solved crime cases to project a more positive image of the country. Russian police was instructed not to publish information about conducted raids or results of investigations into the crimes such as robberies and murders.  UK response, reception and the British media  UK news media had repeatedly warned English football fans travelling to Russia of potential hooligan violence, anti-British hostility and racist intimidation. English fans who have travelled have said they have received a warm welcome after arriving in Russia. The Independent reported that \\"Most of the English fans blamed the low attendance for a 2-1 win on what they described as alarmist press stories.\\" Also Polish media reported on the friendly reception of Polish fans in Moscow and fears of repeated violence between Polish and Russian fans in Warsaw 2012 have not been met. = England's failed attempt to stage the 2018 World Cup = The Daily Telegraph reported in June 2017 that the former Prime Minister David Cameron and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge \\"were at a meeting during which a vote-swapping deal between England and South Korea was discussed, according to an official report ...

Belfast Telegraph. 28 June 2017. =Skripal poisoning and aftermath= British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson On 14 March 2018, following the apparent poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury in the United Kingdom, the British government announced that all official visits to the World Cup were suspended. No ministers or members of the Royal Family will attend matches or other ceremonies. The participation of the England team would not be affected. On 21 March, British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson accused the Russian government of planning to use its hosting of the World Cup for propaganda, comparing it to Nazi Germany's use of the 1936 Olympics in Berlin for such purposes. Contrarily, however, he added that it would be unfair to ban the British football teams from competing. Russia denied the accusations and denounced Johnson's statements as \\"unacceptable and totally irresponsible\\" and \\"poisoned with venom of hate, unprofessionalism and boorishness\\". United States sanctions against Iran American company Nike stopped supplying Iran's FIFA World Cup squad members with football boots just days before their opening match in the World Cup due to the new United States sanctions against Iran. Iran's football coach Carlos Queiroz said: \\"They should come out and apologise because this arrogant conduct against 23 boys is absolutely ridiculous and unnecessary.\\" Use of Cossacks against protesters \\"The new Cossacks are part of a broader movement of armed Russian nationalism,\\" said Nikolay Mitrokhin, a senior research fellow at the University of Eastern Finland. \\"Most of them fought in the Donbass, and many of them took part in the occupation of Crimea. It would appear that the Kremlin is now thinking about using them in Moscow in the same way.\\" Don Cossacks, the volunteer paramilitary soldiers from Southern Russia who fought in Donbass, during the Ukrainian conflict were redeployed this time by the Kremlin to counter protesters and will be used to counter protesters of the World Cup. \\"The new Cossacks were figures of fun, with their strange paraphernalia and dubious claims of historical lineage. But in Vladimir Putin's third term, as the Kremlin looked to create a nationalist, conservative ideology, they became influential. They began to receive significant state funding and political support.\\" During the World Cup = Mexican homophobic chanting = Mexico's fans at 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia During the Germany versus Mexico group stage match, Mexican fans chanted \\"puto\\" at German goalkeeper Manuel Neuer; \\"puto\\" is a homophobic slang for a male sex worker that Mexicans and other Latin American countries have frequently used to taunt opposing teams. The origins of the insults against Neuer have been attributed to an incorrect Spanish translation of his statement \\"it would be good if a professional football player came out because it would help others to do the same\\". The FIFA disciplinary committee fined the Mexican Football Federation 10,000 Swiss francs ($10,400) for the homophobic chants. The Mexican Football Federation was earlier sanctioned 12 times including 10 fines for anti-gay slurs during its World Cup qualifying campaign. Mexico striker Javier Hern√°ndez posted on Instagram, \\"To all Mexican fans in the stadiums, don't shout 'pu--'. Let's not risk another sanction.\\" = Swiss celebrations against Serbia = In Switzerland's 2‚Äì1 win over Serbia, Swiss goalscorers Xherdan Shaqiri and Granit Xhaka both celebrated their goals with the double-headed eagle gesture with their hands. The gesture can be interpreted as a symbol of Albanian nationalism and sometimes as symbol of the Greater Albania irredentist concept, and both Shaqiri and Xhaka are of Kosovar Albanian heritage. Kosovo, the former Serbian province that unilaterally declared independence in 2008, is a partially recognized country claimed by Serbia. Both Kosovar President Hashim Tha√ßi and Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama shared their support for the celebration on social media, while it was called \\"a disgrace\\" by several Serbian newspapers. FIFA subsequently opened an investigation into the incident on 23 June. While some Serbian supporters booed the players, their general anger after the match was more directed at some debatable referee decisions rather than the goal celebrations. During the match some Serbian fans wore shirts with pictures of war criminal Ratko Mladiƒá, while some fans reportedly chanted anti-Albanian slogans. On 26 June 2018 Shaqiri and Xhaka were each fined 10,000 Swiss francs by FIFA for the celebrations, although a crowd funding start-up in Albania had already raised enough money to cover the fines. Reactions to the fines imposed were mixed, some Albanian and Kosovar fans said the fine would discourage players celebrating their identity, while some Serbian fans thought that the players in question should have been banned from playing. = Croatian celebrations against Russia = Dejan Lovren (right) and his teammates line-up for Croatia before the game with Russia, 7 July 2018 Croatian goalscorer Domagoj Vida and Croatian team's coaching staff assistant Ognjen Vukojeviƒá celebrated Croatia's World Cup victory over Russia by shouting \\"Glory to Ukraine!\\", a slogan adopted by Ukrainian nationalists. FIFA's disciplinary code prohibits political, nationalist and racist slogans in any form. Vida, celebrating the victory with former Croatian international and current assistant coach, Ivica Oliƒá, was also recorded saying \\"Belgrade is on fire!\\" in Croatian. However, Serbian media reported \\"Belgrade\\" refers to the name of a pub in Kiev that Vida had frequented, not the capital of Serbia, and that the phrase was used to encourage the pub to have a party. Aleksandar Holiga, editor of Croatian website Telesport, has largely downplayed the incident saying \\"I don't think Vida understood the full meaning and context of what he was saying. Both of them were just doing it because they are close to Dynamo Kiev. It's something that fans would chant\\" and that \\"politically, Croatia doesn't have a perfect relationship with Russia, but then who does in the rest of Europe?\\" BBC reported that \\"Ukrainians accused FIFA of siding with Russia and flooded the football body's Facebook page with declarations of \\"Glory to Ukraine\\".\\" After victory over England on July 11 in an interview to Russia 24 Vida said, speaking Russian, that \\"he was mistaken\\" and \\"apologized to Russian people\\". Domagoj Vida received an official warning by FIFA and Ognjen Vukojeviƒá has been fined 15,000 Swiss francs and expelled from Croatian team's coaching staff by the Croatian Football Federation. =Group H fair play controversy= Japan and Senegal finished Group H with the same number of points, the same goal difference, the same number of goals scored and a 2‚Äì2 draw as their head-to-head record. Japan beat Senegal into second place based on their fair play record, as they had fewer yellow cards (four against six). The last two matches were played simultaneously. When Colombia scored against Senegal to go 1‚Äì0 ahead in the 74th minute, Japan went into second ahead of Senegal on the fair play rule. During their last game against Poland, the Japanese team were made aware of their advantageous position with ten minutes left and decided to play a very conservative game. They passed to one another and kept the ball in their own box, seeking to avoid any bookings. They did not attempt to score, despite being one goal behind. Poland, for their part were happy to let them do this as they were already winning but had no chance of advancing into the next round. Some fans at the match booed the players.\\"news.com.au\\" - 'Japan lost more than just its match against Poland' After the match the Japanese manager, Akira Nishino, said in an interview \\"I am not too happy about this, but I forced my players to do what I said. It's the World Cup, and sometimes these things can't be avoided.\\" However, there was widespread criticism from football figures throughout the world. Comparisons were made to the 1982 'Disgrace of Gij√≥n'. \\"South China Morning Post\\" - Fifa World Cup fair play farce embarrasses Japan fans as social media users slam 'anti-football' tactics.] Japanese social media users also criticised their own team. However, others defended the Japanese team and FIFA said it had no plans to drop the fair play rule, despite calls for it to do so. =VAR controversies= FIFA officially approved the use of VAR for the 2018 FIFA World Cup during the FIFA Council meeting on 16 March 2018 in Bogot√°. This tournament became the first competition to use VAR in full (at all matches and in all venues). Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal) being shown a yellow card after a challenge with Iranian player that was reviewed by referee Enrique C√°ceres as a potential red card incident After the introduction of VAR in the 2018 World Cup, FIFA deemed it a success. Nevertheless, the use (or lack of use) of VAR has been criticised. Independent assessments note that while most decisions were made correctly as a result of VAR, some were wrong despite VAR review and some decisions which were called incorrectly were not even reviewed. The Guardian concludes that VAR has been most effective for factual decisions such as offsides and mistaken identities, while subjective decisions such as penalties or the disciplining of players have fared much worse. Lack of clarity and consistency are two main areas of weakness. A problem in consistency at the World Cup 2018 was for example the different rulings in similar game situations, which could be explained by unclear interpretation of VAR rules. For instance, in the game between Portugal and Iran in the group stage, Iran got a penalty kick after a handball by Cedric Soares, while in the game between Nigeria and Argentina, Nigeria did not get this chance after Marcos Rojo headed the ball onto his own arm, even after the referee checked the VAR. Another line of criticism has been targeted at the effectiveness of the system in achieving its goal. In the opinion of Scott Stinson from the National Post, VAR, like any other replay system, fails to correct human error and instead only adds to the controversies because human judgment is still necessary. Lack of transparency is another contentious point, as teams have no way to know which incidents were reviewed by the VAR team. At a press conference held after the group stage, FIFA referees committee chairman Pierluigi Collina showed footage of the decision-making process accompanied with audio of the conversations between VAR officials and the referees. Asked if this audio could be made publicly available, as it is in rugby and cricket, Collina answered enthusiastically but cautioned that it might still be too early. Others have pointed to the game-changing nature of VAR. Initial fears that using the system would lengthen the game considerably have not been confirmed, with every VAR review taking up an average of only 80 seconds. The dramatic increase in the number of penalties awarded at the 2018 World Cup has been attributed to VAR catching fouls which would otherwise have remained unpunished. Of the 169 goals scored in the tournament, 22 were from the spot (with 29 being awarded in total), beating the previous record of 17 set in the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Jonathan Liew of The Independent compares the situation to the introduction of the Decision Review System in cricket and notes the changes it had on that sport, and suggests that it might lead to changes of a similar nature in football. Some have also pointed out that only red cards, goals, offsides and mistaken identities can be checked by VAR, while other judgements that might potentially lead to a goal cannot be checked. For example, in the 2018 FIFA World Cup final, Antoine Griezmann fell to the ground after a challenge by Marcelo Brozoviƒá. The referee awarded a free kick to France despite Croatia players protesting that Griezmann had dived. The free kick led to an own goal by Mario Mand≈æukiƒá, accidentally diverting the ball into his own net. Later replays showed that Griezmann was already falling before Brozoviƒá made contact with him. Some users on social media called for the use of VAR, but VAR cannot check the incident due to the guidelines set for VAR. Many football fans also accuse VAR of favouring \\"big teams\\". During a 2-2 draw between Spain and Morocco, a challenge from Gerard Piqu√© did not result in a red card for the Spanish defender, nor did the referee check VAR on multiple possible penalty calls. Fans also claim that the corner kick that led to Iago Aspas's late equaliser was played on the wrong side. There was an uproar on social media after the Group B games, with many fans claiming that Iran and Morocco have been \\"robbed\\".https://www.101greatgoals.com/news/is-var-favouring-big-teams-fans- lash-out-following-group-b-controversy/ Moroccan midfielder Youn√®s Belhanda criticized VAR for only helping \\"big teams\\" as well. Goalkeeper Munir Mohand Mohamedi said Morocco also felt that Cristiano Ronaldo's winning goal in the second fixture should not be allowed as Pepe appeared to foul a defender. As he left the pitch, Morocco winger Nordin Amrabat also appeared to say that the VAR system was \\"bullshit.\\"http://www.espn.com/soccer/fifa-world- cup/story/3544860/var-system-just-helps-the-big-teams-moroccos-younes-belhanda Nigeria players were also furious at Rojo's \\"clear handball\\" not being called, despite the referee checking VAR. \\"I don't understand how that was not a penalty,\\" Mikel said. \\"It was a clear handball. If you look at this game yesterday against Portugal, this was even worse. He [Rojo] had the ball and it hit his hand and it was open. Maybe the referee didn't want to give a second penalty,\\" Mikel said. \\"For us, we've seen the replay, it was a clear handball. He looked at the VAR, the ball hit the hand. I asked him for explanation, did the ball hit the hand? He said \`Yes.' Why is it not a penalty? He did not know.\\"http://www.espn.com/soccer/nigeria/story/3546407/nigerias-john-obi- mikel-furious-after-marcos-rojos-clear-handball-not-called During the World Cup final, Croatia winger Ivan Peri≈°iƒá's arm appeared to make contact with the ball. Some experts claimed that Peri≈°iƒá's arm deliberately moved towards the ball, as shown in slow-motion. However, some argue that it was a natural movement, and Peri≈°iƒá did not have enough time to react after Blaise Matuidi failed to head the ball. Some fans and experts argue that due to the fact that VAR is in slow-motion, it made Peri≈°iƒá's handball look bad.https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-07-16/world-cup-final-france-two- controversial-goals-in-triumph/9997316 = Russian pension reform = On the opening day of the World Cup (14 June) the authorities of Russia announced the extremely unpopular pension reform presuming a substantial increase of the retirement age. Ordinary Russian citizens accused their government and president of trying to hide such information amid the euphoria of the tournament, i.e. to use the event as a cover. Alexei Navalny interpreted this reform as a ‚Äúrobbery of tens of millions of people‚Äù. =Sexism= Late in the tournament FIFA requested that television and photographic coverage of fans at matches should give less emphasis to attractive young women. One Russian fan shown several times in the telecast of the opening match turned out to be a glamour model. Getty Images apologised for publishing a gallery of \\"the hottest fans at the World Cup\\". There were reports of Russian women and female media personnel being harassed by male fans. A Brazilian reporter was commended for upbraiding a man who attempted to kiss her during a live broadcast. Patrice Evra was accused of patronising fellow player-turned-pundit Eni Aluko after applauding a point made by her during ITV's coverage.  Burger King social media campaign  Burger King issued an apology for an insensitive advertisement that was launched on the Russian social media outlet VK, promising a payment of $47,000 plus a lifetime supply of Whoppers, for any Russian woman if they were to become pregnant with a child fathered by a World Cup player. The ad claimed the women should get \\"the best football genes\\" and \\"ensure the success of the Russian team for generations to come\\", following the trend of playing on sexist stereotypes that are seen often in Russian ads. =Riots in France= Violence and riots erupted in Paris, Lyon, Marseille and across the country after the French World Cup victory. Two French football supporters have died while celebrating.

The M1910 was a drastic modification on Browning's part, modifying and adding many features that the M1909 was not equipped with. History On February 9, 1910, Browning demonstrated the new Model 1910 design to Col. John T. Thompson of the U.S. Army Ordnance Corps, as he had with the M1909 the previous year. While firing, the pistol developed ejecting problems, and Browning attempted to repair the malfunction by removing the ejector and filing it down. When this failed to resolve the issue, Browning was left with no choice but to send it back to Colt's Manufacturing Company for repairs.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnDATyF8FcI Design The Model 1910 differed in many ways from the previous M1909 design, that had been rejected by the War Department. The grip was changed from an 84 degree angle to 74 degree angle, which created a more natural grip when being fired from an outstretched hand.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnDATyF8FcI> The M1910 was not manufactured with a mechanical safety mechanism by Colt, which was one problem the War Department saw in the design. Browning developed a type of relatively simple safety that could be retrofitted on the outside of the pistol, that would keep the slide locked in the forward position, and could be easily disengaged with a movement of the thumb.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnDATyF8FcI Another improvement was that the extractor mechanism was redesigned to fit on the inside of the slide, unlike the exterior extractor from the M1909 and other early Browning automatics.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnDATyF8FcI Trials Performance At Springfield Armory in November 1910, the Colt Model 1910 was tested against the Savage Model 1907, a competing .45 caliber pistol design from the Savage Arms Company of Utica, New York.Colt Automatic Pistols 1896-1955 - Bady, Donald A .45 caliber Colt M1909 revolver was used as a control.http://www.sightm1911.com The M1910 had 12 malfunctions overall, while the Savage M1907 had 43. 6000 rounds were fired through each of the pistols, the Colt, although having a number of issues, performed far superior to the Savage, which had to have many various parts replaced during the duration of the trials. The board of officers present at the trials recommended that Browning's Model 1910 be adopted for use by the War Department. The Commanding Officer of the Springfield Armory, the Chief of Ordnance and the General Staff concurred, and by March 29, 1911, the Secretary of War Jacob M. Dickinson approved Browning's design as the new issued sidearm for the United States Army and, in 1913, the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Marine Corps.Colt Automatic Pistols 1896-1955 - Bady, Donald References Bibliography Bady, Donald Colt Automatic Pistols 1896-1955 External links *Colt Automatic Pistols *Colt's Manufacturing Company‚Äîmanufacturer's website Category:Colt semi- automatic pistols ","title":"Colt Model 1910"},{"id":"43378868","text":"The Hells Mouth Grits is a geologic formation in Wales.

After earning his Ph.D. at Columbia University, Voight worked as a professor of geology at several universities, including Pennsylvania State University, where he taught from 1964 until his retirement in 2005. He remains an emeritus professor there and still conducts research, focusing on rock mechanics, plate tectonics, disaster prevention, and geotechnical engineering. In April 1980, Voight's publications on landslides, avalanches, and other mass movements attracted the attention of Rocky Crandell of the United States Geological Survey (USGS), who asked him to look at a growing bulge on the Mount St. Helens volcano in the state of Washington. Voight foresaw the collapse of the mountain's north flank as well as a powerful eruption. His predictions came true when St. Helens erupted in May 1980; Voight was then hired by the USGS to investigate the debris avalanche that initiated the eruption. After his work at Mount St. Helens brought him international recognition, Voight continued researching and guiding monitoring efforts at several active volcanoes throughout his career, including Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia, Mount Merapi in Indonesia, and Soufri√®re Hills, a volcano on the Caribbean island of Montserrat. For his research, publications, and disaster prevention work as a volcanologist and engineer, Voight has been honored with numerous awards, appointments, and medals. Personal life and education Voight as high school student in 1955 Born in 1937, Voight grew up in Yonkers, New York. His brothers are actor Jon Voight and songwriter Chip Taylor, actress Angelina Jolie is his niece, and musician James Haven is his nephew. Barry and his wife Mary Anne (n√©e Verdisco) have two daughters, Lisa and Barbara. Voight's father was professional golf player Elmer \\"Elmo\\" Voight (1909-1973), a leader in the effort to break the color barrier in golf, and his mother Barbara (1910-1995) was a teacher and swim instructor. Voight and his brothers grew up playing golf, and Barry also developed an interest in swimming. Voight graduated from Archbishop Stepinac High School in 1955. After high school, Voight pursued a 5-year intensive dual-degree program at the University of Notre Dame, studying landslips along Lake Michigan and receiving undergraduate degrees in geology in 1959 and in civil engineering in 1960.Newsletter of the Engineering Geology Division of the Geological Society of America (2010), p. 4. He earned his master's degree in civil engineering from Notre Dame in 1961. Voight attributes his interest in science to his mentors at Notre Dame, professors Ray Gutschick and Erhard Winkler.Newsletter of the Engineering Geology Division of the Geological Society of America (2010), pp. 3‚Äì5. After spending one year studying at Cornell University, Voight transferred to Columbia University, where he graduated with a Ph.D. in geology in 1965, studying rock mechanics and structural geology under Fred Donath.Newsletter of the Engineering Geology Division of the Geological Society of America (2010), p. 2. While at Columbia, Voight was named a President's Fellow, and taught a lecture course called \\"Geology for Engineers\\". Teaching career Voight began teaching in 1961, serving as a teaching assistant at the University of Notre Dame while pursuing his master's degree in civil engineering. From 1961 to 1963, he served as a teaching assistant at Cornell and Columbia. In 1964, he joined the faculty at Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) as an assistant professor of geology, becoming a full professor of geology and geotechnical engineering in 1978. Voight taught at Penn State for more than four decades, retiring from teaching in June 2005 but continuing his research. While at Penn State, Voight had a joint affiliation with the school's Department of Mineral Engineering and taught courses in physical geology, mechanics of geological materials, and volcanology. During his career, he also lectured as a guest professor at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands in 1972, working under Jacques Dozy, and served as a visiting professor at the University of Toronto in 1973 and at the University of California, Santa Barbara, in 1981. Still an emeritus professor at Penn State, he initiated an endowment under his name to contribute to the education of volcanic hazard specialists from developing countries. Volcanological work and research =Early assignments= alt= A billowing cloud of volcanic gas erupts from the Mount St. Helens volcano on May 18, 1980. Voight performed work in 1971‚Äì1973 for the United States Bureau of Mines. In 1978, he published the first volume of a treatise on avalanches, titled Rockslides and Avalanches. After the second volume was released in 1980, the work became a benchmark in studying avalanches and other forms of mass movement. A month prior to the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, Voight was contacted by Rocky Crandell,Thompson, p. 76. a United States Geological Survey (USGS) employee working in the Vancouver office near the mountain.Thompson, p. 31. Crandell sought Voight's expertise in landslides, hoping Voight would opine on a growing bulge, long, which had emerged on the mountain's north face.Harris, p. 204.Olson, p. 71. In his reporting to Crandell and his associates, Voight said that the bulge could fail and collapse the volcano's entire north sector. He suggested they begin monitoring the rate of movement of the bulge, worried that the collapse could trigger an eruption. He also advised hiring a local surveyor to take measurements, offending several of the geologists.Thompson, p. 77. Shortly after, Voight left the mountain and returned to teaching classes at Penn State. Before the eruption, he had sent his full report to the USGS, summarizing his predictions, depicting the failure of the bulge and the collapse of the mountain's north side followed by a violent eruption.Thompson, p. 97.Olson, p. 72. After a magnitude 5.1 earthquake centered directly below the north slope caused that part of the volcano to slide,Harris, p. 205. Mount St. Helens erupted, causing $1.1 billion in damage and killing 57 people. After the eruption, Voight accepted a position as a consultant for the USGS. He led the investigation into the volcano debris avalanche which had occurred during the eruption, guiding other volcanologists including Harry Glicken,Thompson, p. 151. who built upon Voight's preliminary research to create his report \\"Rockslide-Debris Avalanche of May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens Volcano, Washington\\" (1996).Glicken, p. 9. Voight's work won him international renown, and he later cited his experiences there as \\"career-changing\\".Newsletter of the Engineering Geology Division of the Geological Society of America (2010), p. 6. Although Voight already had a burgeoning interest in volcanology, the eruption at Mount St. Helens propelled him to dedicate himself to the field. His work helped reinvigorate widespread interest in landslides and other phenomena at volcanoes that potentially pose a threat to life. After completing his research at Mount St. Helens, Voight began analyzing the volcanic hazards from several other active volcanoes. In 1985, Voight blamed human error for the Armero tragedy in Colombia, where more than 23,000 died from an eruption from the Nevado del Ruiz volcano. He stated that while categorically accurate predictions of volcanic eruptions were impossible, unpreparedness for the disaster exacerbated the death toll.Fisher, Heiken, and Hulen, pp. 273‚Äì74. In January 1986, Voight visited Nevado del Ruiz responding to concerns from the Colombian government that the northeastern section of the volcano might cave in, causing another eruption. He established a monitoring network of reflectors and used laser ranging to track how the distances to these reflectors changed over time. When one reflector indicated significant movement, and large cracks became visible from the air, Voight contemplated initiating an evacuation, but waited. By March 1986, he realized the widening cracks were caused by the creep, or gradual shifting, of one of the volcano's glaciers, rather than rock movement. After leaving Colombia, Voight compiled the 14-page report \\"Countdown to Catastrophe\\" (1988), which analyzed how volcanic hazard management had failed at Armero. = Later studies = When Voight began research at Mount Merapi in Java, Indonesia, in 1988, it was largely unknown to volcanologists. It had been omitted in the Smithsonian Institution's 1981 publication Volcanoes of the World, despite being densely populated, having close to a million people on its slopes as of 1996. Voight set up meters to record movement within the volcano, and educated local scientists on volcanic monitoring. In July 1989, he obtained a $250,000 grant from the National Science Foundation's Division of Natural and Manmade Hazard Mitigation for his proposal to predict eruptions at Merapi. After his funding ran out, he temporarily abandoned his research. An eruption from the volcano in 1994 produced pyroclastic flows that killed 63 people, including guests at a wedding ceremony. Returning to Merapi the following year, Voight compared data from the dead and survivors, including the extent of their burn areas, clothing worn, and lung damage. He concluded that protective, long-sleeved clothing and masks enhance chances of survival when exposed to eruptive activity. In April 1989, Voight returned to Colombia to the volcano Galeras after being contacted by the United Nations Disaster Relief Organization. People in Pasto, located at the foot of the volcano, had become alarmed by noises and shaking from Galeras. While Galeras proved far easier to climb than Nevado del Ruiz, land mines planted to hinder guerrilla forces dotted the slopes of the mountain. With USGS geologist Dick Janda, Voight drew a hazard map that included several populated areas within the danger zone. Before Voight left Galeras, the volcano underwent an unexpected phreatic eruption, which Voight and his team failed to predict. Although Pasto was unaffected, six scientists attending a United Nations workshop for natural disaster relief were killed. After reviewing deformation data from the day before the eruption, Voight discovered that no acceleration in the deformation process had occurred. He surmised that phreatic eruptions do not exhibit an acceleration in deformation before taking place and left after confirming that the volcano's monitoring system functioned properly. In the early 1990s, Voight performed volcanic hazard assessments at Cotopaxi in Ecuador and at Nevado del Huila in Colombia, where his research was impeded by guerrilla factions and drug cartel operations. He also assisted with assessment activity at Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, Mount Redoubt in the United States, Mount Bandai, Mount Unzen, and Mount Ontake in Japan, and Bezymianny and Shiveluch in the Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia. Voight's successful prediction that an avalanche at St. Helens could provoke a lateral eruption, an eruption from the volcano's flank rather than its summit, attracted the attention of the government of Montserrat in March 1996. Worried about an expanding lava dome at the Soufri√®re Hills volcano, the island's government asked Voight to assess its potential for an avalanche that could generate an eruption. Voight thought it was unlikely that the crater would collapse, but expressed concern over a possible pyroclastic flow that could reach the city of Plymouth in approximately three minutes. The city and a village on the mountain were evacuated, and within three years, pyroclastic flows overtook the abandoned sites. Following these eruptions, Voight served as a member of the Risk Assessment Panel that advised Montserrat's government, and he co-established the Caribbean Andesite Lava Island Precision Seismo-geodetic Observatory (CALIPSO) with a team of international scientists. He continued research at the island with Steven Sparks, a geoscientist at the University of Bristol, establishing the SEA-CALIPSO system to analyze Soufri√®re Hills by using seismic waves and explosions in the ocean. Among other findings, this effort detected a major fault trending north-to-west under Montserrat's western side. Voight still oversees hazard assessments at the volcano, providing his input during eruptive periods in 2006 and 2010. With his students, Voight has analyzed pyroclastic flows, volcanically induced seismicity, volcanic debris avalanches, and volcanic eruption prediction. Voight has also served as a consultant geotechnical engineer for dams, tunnels, and nuclear power plants, helping plan engineering projects in France, India, Ireland, Somalia, Papua New Guinea, Canada, and Turkey, as well as in the United States. Voight's research interests in lava dome collapses, stratovolcanoes, monitoring of active volcanoes, and pyroclastic flows have brought him to Iceland, Indonesia, the West Indies, Italy, and Chile. Combining his knowledge of engineering and geological concepts, Voight developed the widely used anelastic strain recovery (ASR) method for measuring stress on deep rock. With a team of geologists, he also derived the material failure forecast method (FFM), which predicts eruption times for volcanoes based on changes in the mountain's surrounding seismic and deformation data.Bickford, p. 129. He currently serves as a member of the United States Geological Survey's Volcano Hazards Response Team, and has responded to potentially eruptive volcanoes in Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Chile. Recognition and legacy Throughout his career, Voight has received multiple accolades and citations for his research as a professor and for his professional work as a geologist and volcanologist. In 1984, the Institution of Civil Engineers awarded him the George Stephenson Medal, recognizing one of his articles as among \\"the best work published in [their] journals\\". The same year, Voight earned an award for \\"significant original contribution to research in rock mechanics\\" from the United States National Committee on Rock Mechanics. For his help monitoring the Mayon Volcano in the Philippines in 1985, he was granted a key to Legazpi, Albay, which had been threatened by Mayon's impending eruption. 1989 saw another major year of honors for Voight, as he was named a MacQuarie Research Scholar and again garnered an award from the United States National Committee on Rock Mechanics for his original findings. Voight has appeared as a distinguished lecturer several times, including at the University of Utah's College of Mining Engineering (1990), the University of California, Santa Barbara (1992), and the Association of Environmental & Engineering Geologists (1992). For his service as a professor at Penn State, Voight has been given two awards, specifically for his research. In 1990, he received the Wilson Research Award from the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences for excellence in research. In 1991, he gained a Faculty Scholar Medal for \\"Outstanding Achievement in the Physical Sciences and Engineering\\". In 2008, Voight was appointed a Union Fellow of the American Geophysical Union for \\"fundamental contributions to the understanding of volcano deformation, assessment of volcano hazards, and forecasting\\", and the following year, he was awarded the Schuster Medal by the Canadian Geotechnical Society for \\"outstanding achievements in research on geologic hazards in North America\\". For \\"his research, teaching and consulting work\\", the Engineering Geology Division of the Geological Society of America presented him with their 2010 Distinguished Practice Award.Newsletter of the Engineering Geology Division of the Geological Society of America (2010), p. 3. Voight received the Thorarinsson Medal of the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior in 2013, granted to a \\"scientist of outstanding distinction who has made fundamental contributions to research in volcanology\\", and in 2017 he was elected as a Member of the National Academy of Engineering for \\"contributions to the understanding, management, and mitigation of geologic hazards.\\" Recalling a conference where Voight appeared, Bill McGuire, Emeritus Professor of Geophysical & Climate Hazards at University College London, described him as \\"an illustrious expert on volcano instability and landslides\\".McGuire, pp. 11‚Äì12. Citing Voight for his Distinguished Practice Award, colleague Richard Gray named him among his \\"profession's brightest and productive members\\". When Voight published his failure forecast prediction mechanism, USGS geologist Robert I. Tilling praised it as \\"a significant refinement in the interpretation of monitoring data\\".  Publications  According to Voight's curriculum vitae from Pennsylvania State University, he has published more than 400 papers or abstracts and edited 15 books, and his works have been cited more than 9,000 times. In addition to journal articles, Voight has written or helped write at least 21 books and monographs since 1965; his co-authors include R.S.J. Sparks, A. Neri, D. Elsworth, A. Belousov, and G. Mattioli. His most recent book, The Eruption of Soufri√®re Hills Volcano, Montserrat from 2000 to 2010, was published in 2014. He continues to publish articles, according to his Google Scholar profile.

It is named after Hunts Bay on the Gower peninsula, south-south west of Bishopston, where a significant amount of the limestone forms the cliffs there. Bracelet Bay, eastern Gower, showing beds of Hunts Bay oolite dipping northwards and eastwards. Steeply dipping beds of Hunts Bay oolite by Mumbles pier, eastern Gower. Hunts Bay Oolite is a sub- group of the Pembroke Limestone Group which itself is part of the Carboniferous Limestone Supergroup. Oolite means 'egg stone': very small grains (up to 2mm) form by accumulating precipitated minerals, usually calcium carbonate. These ooids, created in a warm, tropical environment, are the precursors to the limestone. The Hunts Bay Oolite extends from Pembroke in the West to Monmouth and Chepstow in the East and northwards into the Dowlais formation around Merthyr Tydfil. Fossils, such as brachiopods and crinoids associated with a shallow sea environment, can be found in the rock. East of the south Wales coalfield and in the south east the rock is increasingly dolomitised (where some calcium is replaced by magnesium). This subgroup lies in time largely in the (British geological) Holkerian substage of the Vis√©an stage of the stratigraphic column, from 337 to 333.5 million years ago.

There are two active chapters in Atlantic Canada to date; one in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and the other in Fredericton, New Brunswick. Between these two chapters their membership totals over 300 members. There are three different divisions of Iota Beta Chi: the active chapters which recruit and are run by undergraduate members; the alumnae chapters which are made of Iota Beta Chi alumnae; and the Headquarters, which is composed of volunteering members of Iota Beta Chi's alumnae.  History  = Founding (Alpha chapter) = Iota Beta Chi Sorority came to be after its founding mother Gwen (Butler) Butcher originally planned to join another sorority during her first semester at Dalhousie University. She decided that it was not the right fit for her and shortly afterward she had a conversation with a friend of hers, which ended with her deciding to start a sorority of her own. With the help of brothers from local fraternities (one from the local Sigma Chi chapter and another from the local Phi Kappa Pi chapter), as well as multiple female friends including Lorraine Wasson, Jessica Maddison and Kristy Childs, she created Iota Beta Chi. The official founding date of Iota Beta Chi Sorority is January 6, 1997. On this date, the founding sisters: Gwen, Lorraine, Jessica and Kristy; presented themselves to the Dalhousie University campus in hopes to recruit new members. While the winter of 1997 was not successful, these founding members did not give up and tried again in the fall of 1997, this time with seven new members. This chapter of Iota Beta Chi is known as the Alpha chapter, and has continued to thrive. = Beta chapter = Sarah Simons started her first year at University of New Brunswick in Fredericton, NB. She noticed a lack of Greek letter organizations for women and wanted to bring that experience there. Sarah reached out to the local Zeta Psi's chapter to find out where to start and eventually started researching different sororities. She happened to come across Iota Beta Chi and she saw the ideals and felt that they matched what she wanted in a sisterhood. Sarah approached the Alpha chapter with her interest in opening a Beta chapter and after talking with Lorraine, a founding member, she learned all about the sorority she wanted to be a part of. With Lorraine's help and the help of the Zeta Psi's, she organized and executed her first recruitment period in the winter semester of 2001. Sarah was successful with 6 initial members becoming founding sisters of the Beta chapter: Sarah Simons, Marge Atkinson, Amy Lister, Erin Sheridan, Lindsey Thompson and Brandy White.  Symbols  = Crest = The crest of the Sorority consists of three ribbons overlapping to create a circle. The three ribbons are burgundy, white and old gold respectively. The edges of the ribbons overlap the following way: the burgundy overlaps the white, the other end of the white ribbon overlaps one end of the old gold ribbon, and the other end of the old gold ribbon overlaps the lower end of the burgundy ribbon. When depicted, the old gold ribbon is always on the bottom, with the burgundy ribbon on the left side of the crest and the white ribbon on the right side (when viewing the crest). The outer edges of each of the ribbons curl back in to form much smaller circular shape. = Other Important Symbols = Colours: Burgundy, White, Old Gold Motto: Ducta per gratia Flower: Yellow Rose Jewel: Garnet Animal: Wolf  Philanthropy  In the past the Alpha chapter has worked closely with local food banks, women shelters, children's hospital, Relay for Life and Ronald McDonald House.

He governed the lordships of Hita and Guadalajara, and frequently attended the royal court under King Alfonso VI and Queen Urraca. Parentage \\"Fernando Garc√≠a de Hita\\" is a conventional name. Contemporary documents only record Fernando with his patronymic, which may also be spelled \\"Garc√©s\\" or \\"Garciaz\\" and indicates that his father's name was Garc√≠a. In one charter, Queen Urraca refers to Fernando as \\"our cousin, Sir Fernando Garc√≠a\\" (uobis annaia don Ferrando Garciez). In another, she refers to Fernando's second wife as \\"my cousin\\" (mea cogermana). The ancestries of both Urraca and Fernando's second wife are well known and they were not blood relations, the charters can only refer to a blood relation between Urraca and Fernando, simplest to explain by viewing Fernando as the son of Urraca's uncle, King Garc√≠a II of Galicia. Were this the case, Fernando would probably have been born to a mistress while Garc√≠a was in captivity. Other evidence points to Fernando being the son of Count Garc√≠a Ord√≥√±ez de N√°jera. The Muslim historian Ibn Abi Zar recorded that a \\"son of Count Garc√≠a\\" (Iben al-Zand Gars√≠s) held the towns of Guadalajara and Hita. Were Fernando legitimate son of Count Garc√≠a by his first wife, the royal princess Urraca Garc√©s of Navarre, he would likewise be a cousin of Queen Urraca. Career In twelfth-century Le√≥n and Castile, it was uncommon for the lords of the southern frontier‚Äîwhose primary responsibility was defence against the Almoravids‚Äîto frequently attend the itinerant royal court. Fernando seems to have done both. He was given charge of several frontier fiefs (tenencias) and still managed to witness to twelve royal charters during the reign of Urraca. He was the royal official (alcalde) in charge of Guadalajara and Medinaceli in 1107. According to the Anonymous Chronicles of Sahag√∫n, in 1111 Fernando convinced Count Henry of Portugal to break his alliance with King Alfonso I of Aragon and Navarre, and then negotiated a renewed alliance between Alfonso and Urraca after the latter distanced herself from Count Henry. The Historia Compostellana also refers to the aid a certain \\"Count Fernando\\" gave his relative, Queen Urraca, at this time, but historians are divided as to whether this is a reference to Fernando Garc√≠a de Hita, since there is no other evidence that he ever received the title of \\"count\\". Wives and children Fernando's first wife was Tegridia. Based on her son being called sobrinus of Count Rodrigo Mart√≠nez, historian Pascual Mart√≠nez Sopena concluded she was Tegridia Mart√≠nez, a sister of Count Rodrigo and daughter of Count Mart√≠n Fla√≠nez and his wife Sancha Fern√°ndez, while Jaime de Salazar y Acha concluded she was Tegridia Fern√°ndez, sister of Sancha and aunt of Count Rodrigo. Either would make her cousin of Eilo Alfonso, wife of powerful count Pedro Ans√∫rez. Jos√© Mar√≠a Canal S√°nchez-Pag√≠n simply calls her a member of the Ans√∫rez family. She died before her husband, leaving him two sons: Gutierre Fern√°ndez de Castro and Rodrigo Fern√°ndez de Castro. Fernando married his second wife, Stephanie (Estefan√≠a), daughter of Count Ermengol V of Urgell, probably in early 1119, while she was still quite young. On 12 November 1119 Fernando had a grant of bridewealth (carta de arras) drawn up for his second wife. He bestowed on her his half of properties at Castrojeriz and Cerrato, which he had acquired with his first wife and which had been divided between him and his children by Tegridia at her death. He also granted Stephanie the half he claimed of some properties at Cevico and Uceda, which he and Stephanie had previously acquired together. Earlier that year, in April or May, Queen Urraca had granted those lands at Uceda and some others at Hita to the betrothed or recently married couple. On 30 June she granted the lands at Cevico to Stephanie to be held independently of her husband or his existing children. Fernando disregarded this royal charter, placing greater stock in aristocratic custom based on Visigothic law, by which he acquired one half of all his wife's acquisitions during their marriage. Fernando and Stephanie had two daughters: Urraca Fern√°ndez and Sancha Fern√°ndez. Urraca, probably conceived shortly after their marriage, was betrothed to Count Rodrigo Mart√≠nez, who granted her a bridewealth on 29 November 1129, when she was probably only ten years old. Stephanie also bore Fernando two sons: Pedro Fern√°ndez de Castro, who became the first Grand Master of the Order of Santiago, and Mart√≠n Fern√°ndez de Castro. Fernando died about 1125. Stephanie, ten years a widow and still young, married Count Rodrigo Gonz√°lez de Lara in 1135.

Prior to that, he was the head coach at Division III Franklin & Marshall from 2001 to 2005. As a head coach, Boretti has led teams to four NCAA Tournaments, three of them in Division I. Playing career Boretti attended Davidson College, where he graduated from in 1994. He played football during his freshman year and baseball for all four years. A catcher, he was named First- Team All-Southern Conference as both a junior and a senior. He also spent time in the Cape Cod Baseball League in 1992 and 1993 with the Wareham Gatemen. He had a short career in professional baseball. He played for the Brainerd Bears in the short-lived North Central League in 1994; he hit .283 and drove in 31 runs and was named a league all-star. In the midst of the 1994‚Äì95 Major League Baseball strike, when owners threatened to play the 1995 season with replacement players, Boretti spent spring training with the Cleveland Indians. Coaching career =Assistant positions= Boretti's coaching career began at Endicott, a Division III school located in his hometown of Beverly, Massachusetts. After spending the 1995 season at Endicott, he was an assistant at Davidson from 1996 to 1998 and Brown from 1999 to 2000. =Franklin & Marshall= Boretti's first head coaching position came at Division III Franklin & Marshall, where he replaced Mark Cole ahead of the 2001 season.

Her body is arched and slightly twisted, creating a tension in her back, accentuated by the deep line of her backbone. One hand dries her neck with a towel, presumably after getting out of the tin bath in the corner of the room. The other arm leans out to hold onto the chair for support. The space is defined by the vertical and diagonal lines where the floor and walls meet. The drawing was made on several pieces of paper mounted on cardboard. Degas may have started with a smaller composition which he extended as he worked, requiring more paper.Hilaire-Germain-Edgar Degas  After the Bath, Woman drying herself  NG6295  The National Gallery, London The heavily worked pastel creates deep textures and blurred contours, emphasising the figure's movement. The artwork measures . History Edgar Degas often used photographs and sketches as a preliminary step, studying the light and the composition for his paintings. The work is part of a series of photographs, preliminary sketches and completed works in pastels and oils by Degas from this period. The series depict women dancing or bathing, some showing women in awkward unnatural positions.After the Bath, Woman Drying Her Back (Getty Museum) Degas, speaking about these works, said, he intended to create a feeling in the viewer: \\"as if you looked through a keyhole.\\" Degas included many works of female nudes bathing in the last Impressionist exhibition in 1886. Nine of Degas' pastel drawings of women at their bath were exhibited by Theo Van Gogh at Galerie Boussod et Valadon in 1888. The work was shown at the Lefevre Gallery in 1950 and was bought for the collection of the National Gallery, London in 1959.Francis Bacon: Back to Degas  Tate A less highly worked example of a similar subject is in the Courtauld Gallery,A&A;  After the bath ‚Äì woman drying herself and other works in the series are in many public museums.

Influences The work had a considerable influence on Francis Bacon, most noticeably on his triptychs Three Figures in a Room (1964, Centre Pompidou, Paris) and Three Studies of the Male Back (1970, Kunsthaus Z√ºrich). The Tate Gallery says \\"For Bacon [it] was indeed something of a talisman. It epitomised Degas's approach to a larger obsession the two artists shared with the plasticity of the body, its potential for the most varied forms of articulation, in movement and repose.\\" The work was one of three central nudes chosen by Bacon in his \\"The Artist's Choice\\" exhibition at the National Gallery in 1985, shown between Vel√°zquez's Rokeby Venus and Michelangelo's Entombment. Art historian and curator Michael Peppiatt quoted Bacon thus: \\"I love Degas. I think his pastels are among the greatest things ever made. I think they're far greater than his paintings.\\" Painting materials The analysis of the painting materials is described in the book by Bomford et al.Bomford D, Herring S, Kirby J, Riopelle C, Roy A.

The programs were organized between 1912 and 1927 largely by a group of Chinese anarchists who had come to Paris and wanted to introduce French science and social idealism to China. After organizing smaller-scale programs starting in 1908, in 1916, after the outbreak of First World War, the Chinese organizers worked with the Chinese and French governments to establish the Diligent Work-Frugal Study program, which brought less educated Chinese workers, and continued to bring students after the 1919 end of the war. In all, several thousand Chinese came to France as student- workers, though not all as formal members of a program. They included future leaders of the Chinese Communist Party such as Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping, as well as others who went on to prominent roles in China. Origins Well before Marxist socialism entered China, Chinese anarchists took up the cause of labor and educating the working class. The leaders of the Chinese Anarchist movement in Paris -- Li Shizeng, Wu Zhihui, Zhang Renjie. Wang Jingwei, Wu Yuzhang, and Cai Yuanpei‚Äîsupported Sun Yat-sen but urged him to add a social and cultural aspect to his program of political revolution. They argued that individuals could not liberate themselves, but that educated men had the responsibility as teachers to use moral education and personal rectitude to show others the way. At the time, most students who went abroad went on government scholarships to Japan, though the Chinese Educational Mission of 1872-1881 and the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program sent students to the United States. The Paris anarchists were eager to establish interchange with France, which they regarded as a progressive and secular society. Wu Zhihui, Zhang Renjie, and Li ShizengIn 1908 Li Shizeng planned the first Work-Study program as a way to bring young Chinese to France. He opened the Usine de la Cas√©o-Soja√Øne, which manufactured soy products for the French market. The workers' study would be financed by working in his factory and their character would be uplifted by his regimen of moral instruction. This first Work-Study program eventually brought 120 workers to France. Li aimed to take these worker-students, who he called \\"ignorant\\" and \\"superstitious,\\" and make them into knowledgeable and moral citizens who on their return home would become models for a new China. They received instruction in Chinese, French, and science and were required to abstain from tobacco, alcohol, and gambling. In April 1912, excited by the success of the Chinese revolution and the prospect of the new-born Republic of China, Li, Zhang Renjie, Wu Zhihui, and Cai Yuanpei, who had returned to Beijing, founded the Association for Frugal Study in France (), also known as the Society for Rational French Education (Societ√© Rationelle des Etudiants Chinois en France). Students traveled from China via the Siberian railway, a trip which took about eighteen days and cost approximately two hundred dollars. The Society prepared students for inexpensive study (¬•600 a year) in France and \\"by labor and a simple life to cultivate habits of diligence and hard work.\\" In contrast to his own experience when he came in 1902 as an \\"embassy scholar,\\" which involved only a handful of students from privileged families, Li hoped to welcome hundreds of working-class students into the program. Wu Zhihui, who came from a poor family himself, remarked that actually the program would be especially good for students from rich families: \\"even if they do not study anything, if at least they learn how to clean toilets it will be worth it.\\" The Association opened a preparatory school in Beijing which offered aspiring students a six- month course in French. When the first group of 30 student-workers for his factory reached France in January 1913, Li arranged for them to be admitted to the College at Montargis, south of Paris, where his warm relations with city officials made arrangements easier. The Association established a workers' school near the factory, in which Li and Wu taught the Chinese and French languages, and general scientific knowledge. In addition to making workers more knowledgeable, work-study would eliminate their \\"decadent habits\\" and transform them into morally upright and hard-working citizens. A strict regimen was imposed ‚Äî no smoking, gambling or alcohol ‚Äî and the workers were expected to devote their spare time to study. In all, this program brought more than 120 students to France before it was closed down in 1913 by Yuan Shikai, the new president of China, who regarded its leaders as associates of his rival, Sun Yat-sen. The Diligent Work-Frugal Study program The outbreak of war in 1914 led France to recruit Chinese workers for factory work and heavy manual labor. The Chinese Labor Corps in France eventually brought more than 130,000 workers, mostly from North China villages. In June 1915, Li and his Paris friends took this opportunity to provide schooling and training. The Work-Study program was renewed, though on a different basis, bringing less educated workers rather than students. By March 1916 their Paris group, the Soci√©t√© Franco-Chinoise d'Education () was directly involved in recruiting and training these workers. The Soci√©t√© had well-placed French backers, mostly on the political left, including Alphonse Aulard, the first president of the Soci√©t√©, a professor of French history at the Sorbonne; Marius Moutet, vice- president and a socialist member of the National Assembly from Lyon; and √âdouard Herriot, mayor of Lyon. They pressed the French government to give the Chinese workers technical education as well as factory work. Li wrote extensive articles in the Chinese Labor Journal (Huagong zazhi), which introduced readers to Western science, arts, fiction, and current events. Doufu Factory Nightschool 1916 By 1917, the Society had established feeder schools in Beijing, Baoding, and Changxingdian, in North China. Students in Hunan wanted to found a preparatory school, but the provincial government at Changsha refused to help. A delegation went to Beijing in February 1918 to consult with Li and Cai. The financial support they obtained from the Beijing government attracted even more students from Hunan, including Mao Zedong. Cai and Li told student leaders that the government had little money but would lend them transportation funds, in return, students would be expected to teach laborers in France. The first group of thirty students to go to France repaid the loan within five months, allowing two groups a year to follow. The new students came from a wide background. The Work-Study movement now offered overseas study to those whose education stopped at the middle-school level or below. The preparatory schools at Baoding and Changxingdian required only that applicants have basic Chinese and that they not possess \\"bad habits\\" such as smoking or gambling. The low tuition fees charged by the preparatory schools and the specially reduced boat fares Li Shizeng negotiated with French authorities also increased the numbers of students who could come on the program. In 1919 and 1920, even after the signing of the peace, the Sino- French Education Association sponsored 17 groups of Chinese students, totaling nearly 1,600, who were placed in factories and schools, including increased numbers of students from the poorer inland provinces of Hunan and Sichuan. Among these were the future leader of the Chinese Communist Party, Deng Xiaoping, then 16 years old, who had been recruited by Wu Yuzheng in Chongqing,\\" Wang Song, \\"Chinese Revolutionaries in France \\" (Society for Anglo-Chinese Understanding) and Xu Teli, then in his early 40s, the future commissar of education at Yan'an in 1937. Deng arrived in France on October 19, 1920, but within three months the Sichuan Association which sponsored his trip ran out of money. Deng then worked at Schneider & Co., France's largest ordnance manufacturer, in Creusot, a southern city. Deng was surprised to see white people treat Chinese like slaves in Shanghai and other ports along the way. Although he and many of his Chinese colleagues had considered themselves economically well off in China, they now worked long hours in poor conditions while they saw French families living in luxury unknown in China. Deng learned how to use an industrial welder, a skill which proved useful when he was deposed from power during the Cultural Revolution and sent to work in a factory. The Lyons incident and the decline of the program In 1921, word spread that Wu Zhihui was bringing one-hundred students from Guangdong and Guangxi provinces who were to be given first preference in enrolling at the Institute in Lyons. Worker-students already in France, unhappy with their miserable conditions and fearful that their stipends were about to be cut off, went to Lyons to protest. The protests escalated into riots which led to the expulsion of their leaders from France. The \\"Lyons Incident\\" turned the younger generation of students into angry critics who dismissed anarchism as a revolutionary doctrine and rejected older leaders such as Wu, Li, and Cai Yuanpei. The Institute survived but did not play the hope for central role in Sino-French relations. Legacy and impact The student-workers did not all learn the lessons in French civilization that the organizers hoped. One student, Wang Ruofei, a future Chinese communist leader, sounded satisfied when he wrote :Our laboring spirit convinced us and we felt that these clouds of black smoke were also important products of culture and that these rough and ready laborers were, after all, leading the true way of life and were the builders of civilization. Why should I reject such a way of life? However, Chen Yi, who later became a high ranking communist general, worked at a Michelin plant and complained that factory life had nothing to do with the ideals of equality, freedom and fraternity supposedly characteristic of French society. Rather, it had shown him the \\"evil nature\\" of European capitalism at first hand. Among the radical students who came to France in 1919 were Cai Hesen, Chen Yi, Li Fuchun, and Cai Chang, all friends of Mao Zedong from Hunan province. Mao himself remained in China. Cai Hesen wrote to Mao in August and September 1920 to share his experiences and expound on the concept of the dictatorship of the proletariat which he learned in France. He urged Mao to prepare for an \\"October 1917 style\\" revolution in China. A centralized vanguard party which would usher in a proletarian dictatorship was essential, Cai insisted, in order to combat anarchism on the one hand and bourgeois dictatorship on the other. France would not be China's ally and model, he concluded, but the Soviet Union. Student-workers in France who went on to leadership roles in the Chinese Communist Party included Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping, Cai Hesen, Chen Yi, Li Fuchun, Li Lisan, Li Weihan, Nie Rongzhen, Wang Ruofei, Xiang Jingyu, Xu Deheng, Xu Teli, Zhao Shiyan, and Zhu De. Participants in the program or those who worked with them who went on to prominent roles in other areas included Li Huang (), founder of the Chinese Youth Party. Program students were overwhelmingly male, though there were perhaps forty women. Those who went on to become prominent communists include Zhang Yibao, Cai Chang, and Xiang Jingyu. Others include Zheng Yuxiu (better known in France as Tcheng Yu-hiu or Soum√© Tcheng), who took a degree in law at the Sorbonne, married the diplomat Wei Daoming, and became an influential jurist and supported of the Chinese Nationalist Party.
