The eighth tropical storm in the western Pacific that year, Koni originated from a disturbance situated within the monsoon trough well east of the Philippines on July 15\\\\. Tracking westward, intensification was slow and the system remained a tropical depression as it moved across the central Philippines on July 17\\\\. Upon moving into the South China Sea, however, conditions allowed for quicker strengthening, and as such the cyclone reached tropical storm status on July 18 before reaching its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 110 km/h (70 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 975 mbar (hPa; 28.79 inHg), making it a severe tropical storm. However, atmospheric conditions began to deteriorate as Koni made landfall on Hainan on July 21, weakening the system. The tropical storm continued to weaken as it moved over the Gulf of Tonkin prior to a final landfall near Hanoi, Vietnam the following day. Tracking inland, the combination of land interaction and wind shear caused Koni to dissipate over Laos on July 23\\\\. Shortly after development Koni tracked through the Philippines, killing two people. After moving into the South China Sea, turbulence produced by the storm resulted in an aviation incident involving a commercial airliner off the western Philippines. Three of the plane's occupants received minor injuries. In Hainan, Koni caused heavy rainfall, peaking at 189 mm (7.44 in) at a station on Wuzhi Mountain. The rains resulted in the collapse of 1,400 homes and an estimated CN¬•140.27 million (US$16.9 million) in direct economic losses. Effects were worst in Vietnam, where three people were killed. Widespread power outages occurred, and strong winds resulted in agricultural and infrastructural damage, particularly in Vietnam's northern provinces. Meteorological history The precursor to Koni developed as an area of deep convection within an active monsoon trough well south of Guam on July 12\\\\. Though atmospheric conditions were favorable for tropical cyclogenesis, the tropical disturbance failed to maintain consistent shower activity. Late on July 14, however, the system developed organized rainbands. This prompted the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) to classify the system as a tropical depression at 0000 UTC on July 15, well north of Palau. Shortly after, the storm entered the area of responsibility of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), immediately classifying the system as a tropical depression and designating it with the name Gilas; the JTWC later classified the system as such at 1200 UTC that day. A subtropical ridge to the north steered the depression westward for much of its initial stages. On July 16, the JTWC upgraded the system to tropical storm strength, while the JMA maintained the system's tropical depression classification. Through July 17, the tropical cyclone began to track across the central Philippines and concurrently entered hostile atmospheric conditions as wind shear and a suppressed outflow pattern began to impact the storm. However, the cyclone was only a slightly weakened system by the time it emerged into the South China Sea the following day. At the same time, a shortwave trough began to force the storm northwestward towards China. At 0600 UTC on July 18, the JMA upgraded the cyclone to tropical storm status, designating it with the name Koni. Though conditions were more favorable over the South China Sea than over the Philippines, persistent, moderate wind shear prevented much strengthening. However, a brief period of favorable conditions allowed for Koni to strengthen, and at 0000 UTC on July 20 the tropical storm was upgraded to severe tropical storm status by the JMA. Meanwhile, the JTWC upgraded the system to typhoon intensity six hours later. Midday on July 20 Koni began to develop a partial eye. This indicated an increase in intensity, and as such Koni reached a peak in strength at 1800 UTC that day with maximum sustained winds of 110 km/h (70 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 975 mbar (hPa; 28.79 inHg). This intensity was maintained for roughly six hours, during which time Koni began to curve westward. However, moderate wind shear conditions returned the following day, weakening the tropical cyclone. At around 1200 UTC on July 21, Koni made landfall on the southeastern coast of Hainan with winds of 95 km/h (60 mph). Land interaction further weakened Koni, and the restrengthening of the subtropical ridge to the cyclone's north resulted in a more westerly path. After a brief reemergence into the Gulf of Tonkin, the system made another landfall, this time south of Hanoi, Vietnam at 0800 UTC on July 22\\\\. At this landfall Koni was only estimated to have winds of 85 km/h (50 mph). Upon tracking inland, the storm began to quickly weaken, and was downgraded to tropical depression intensity at 1800 UTC that day over northern Laos. Six hours later, the JMA declared Koni to have dissipated over the same general region. Preparations and impact Tropical Storm Koni approaching Vietnam on July 22 Four people were killed in the Philippines by Koni, and an additional person was injured. Damage reports from the Philippines remained scarce, though the PAGASA indicated that damage costs totaled 67.250 million Philippine pesos (US$1.26 million). On July 18, an Airbus A330-242 carrying 242 passengers bound for Hong Kong encountered Koni in the South China Sea and attempted to deviate from its planned trajectory in order to avoid severe weather. However, the plane inadvertently encountered an area of severe turbulence, resulting in three minor injuries on board. The plane was later able to exit the area of turbulence and land safely at Hong Kong International Airport. In Hong Kong, the nearby approach of Tropical Storm Koni forced the Hong Kong Observatory to issue the tropical cyclone warning signal No. 1, the signal of lowest urgency, for the special administrative region. Passing well south of Hong Kong, the strongest sustained wind associated with the storm in the region was an observation of winds in Tai Mo Shan. Ultimately effects in the Hong Kong area were limited to scattered squally weather producing isolated rainfall peaking at over 40 mm (1.6 in) in some locations. In Hainan, where the storm made landfall, 35 flights were delayed while 28 others were cancelled due to conditions onset by Koni. Ferry service across the Qiongzhou Strait was also halted, stranding 3,000 vehicles. As a result of Koni, heavy rainfall took place across Hainan, peaking at 189 mm (7.44 in) at a station on Wuzhi Mountain. In the province alone, at least 1,400 homes collapsed. Direct economic losses stemming from Koni in Hainan were estimated at CN¬•140.27 million (US$16.9 million). In order to counteract the flight suspensions and cancellations caused by Koni, 198 flights from Meilan Airport were scheduled after the storm's passage. Vietnam was the country with the worst impacts from Koni. Widespread power outages and telecomunnication failures were commonplace during the storm's passage. Offshore the northern coast of Vietnam, 19 fishing and passenger boats capsized due to strong waves produced by the tropical storm. One of these sinkings near Do Son resulted in the death of a fisherman. Another person was killed in Tam Diep after being hit by a prostrated tree. Eighteen others in four of Vietnam's northern provinces were injured by flying debris kicked up by Koni's strong winds. In Thanh H√≥a Province, strong winds uprooted trees and electricity poles. The roofs of 300 homes in Thanh H√≥a were torn apart. Koni also disrupted water supplies and telephone service in the city. Further north, in Th√°i B√¨nh, gusts reaching as high as 90 km/h (55 mph) damaged 250 residences as well as 300 ha (740 acres) of rice crops. Ten of the eighteen people injured country wide were injured there. In Hanoi, the winds blew trees down. Overall, 3 people were killed in Vietnam. Approximately 1,000 homes were destroyed by Koni, resulting in significant impacts to agriculture. Despite significant impacts in Vietnam, rains brought by Koni alleviated persistent drought conditions over Vietnam's northern colonies. Though the name Koni was not retired by the World Meteorological Organization, the name was corrected to Goni for its 2009 usage.

The Prow 2009. \\"Jens Hansen\\" was a Danish-born jeweller who settled in New Zealand and did most of his well-known work in Nelson, New Zealand. Hansen was one of a number of European-trained jewellers who came to New Zealand in the 1960s and transformed contemporary jewellery in the country, including Tanya Ashken, Kobi Bosshard and Gunter Taemmler. He was the designer and creator of the prop ring used as The One Ring in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit film trilogies.  Life  Born in Gram, Denmark, in 1940, Hansen moved to New Zealand with his parents and siblings in 1952. After undertaking a traditional jewellery apprenticeship at Sweeney's Jewellers in Auckland, he held his first solo exhibition at New Vision Gallery in 1960. He then returned to Europe and worked at A. Michelsen, the Court Jewellers, and the small Borup workshop in Copenhagen between 1962 and 1965.Bortnick, Michael. Wild Tomato Magazine 2009. \\"A Life Less Ordinary - Sweet Prince \\" He also attended night courses at the School of Applied Arts & Industrial design, Copenhagen. He married Gurli Winter in 1965 and they travelled to New Zealand together, and opened their first jewellery business in Glen Eden, Auckland before moving to Nelson in 1968. His first workshop in Nelson was initially in the couple's own home in Alton Street. He then moved to Hardy Street in 1970, and then to its current corner Selwyn Place and Trafalgar Square location three years later. In 1975 he received the Queen Elizabeth II Arts Council travel grant to work as a guest at the Goldsmiths High School, Copenhagen, and left New Zealand again for two years. Upon his return to Nelson with Gurli and his two sons Halfdan and Thorkild, he became instrumental, with Gavin Hitchings, in establishing jewellery classes at Nelson Polytechnic (now Nelson Marlborough Institute of Technology).Dover, Mic. Nelson Mail, 18 July 2009. \\"An artist's life among the elements\\" During the 1980s, he served as an advisor on the Queen Elizabeth II Arts Council of New Zealand, and was a founding member of Details, the Jewellers, Bone and Stone Carvers of New Zealand. In the early 1990s he served as the Artist in Residence at Otago Polytechnic in Dunedin. Across his lifetime he exhibited widely in over 30 solo exhibitions, and participated in a large number of group exhibitions in New Zealand, Australia, and Europe.  Notable works  Jens was known for his creative and contemporary take on traditional Scandinavian jewellery design.

R. R. Tolkien's story. Fifteen prototypes were submitted, all characterised by Jens' sculptural simplicity of design, and each of a different gauge, weight and finish. From this prototype collection, the final 'Movie Ring' design was chosen. Forty variations of The One Ring were needed for filming ‚Äì from solid gold versions for petite Hobbit fingers, to the spinning ring filmed for the prologue of the first film. The ring filmed for the films was not made with any Elvish inscription. The inscriptions that appear in a few special moments in the Lord of the Rings trilogy were computer generated in post-production. In The Hobbit films, no Elvish inscriptions are ever revealed. In 1999 he was diagnosed with cancer, and died in August of that year, before having the opportunity to see his rings in the films.Pearson, Anna.

Nelson Mail , 5 November 2008 Jens' work always had a constant undercurrent of Danish architectural simplicity, but he liked to continually push the design boundaries. To mark the 40th Anniversary of Jens Hansen in Nelson in 2008, specific designs were selected, whose form had endured and defied fashion, but that had not been made for decades. These were recreated as the Legacy Collection. Every year around the time of Jens' birthday, the collection expands.

Alien Rage was developed by Polish developer CI Games, then known as City Interactive, using Unreal Engine 3. The game has single-player and competitive multiplayer modes. In its single player campaign, players are put in control of an elite soldier named Jack which is sent to destroy a mining facility and its aliens after they turned against and killed the humans that they had shared the facility with. Announced as Alien Fear in April 2012, the game was renamed in May of the following year. It was released on 24 September 2013 for Windows, 18 October 2013 for the Xbox 360, and 21 October 2013 for the PlayStation 3. Alien Rage was met with mixed reviews upon release, with critics viewing the game as generic and prone to major glitches. Gameplay Alien Rage is a first-person shooter, in which players fight through several linear levels, killing a variety of aliens. At the end of every few levels, players fight a larger alien in a boss fight. Players score points by killing a large number of aliens in a short period of time, or by killing them in special ways, such as by using explosions or shooting them in the head. These points can be used to upgrade the player character, for example by boosting his resistance to damage or by increasing the amount of ammunition that he is able to carry. Players are able to carry two weapons at a time, and also have a pistol with unlimited ammunition. The player character can use both human- and alien-manufactured weapons in the game, and alien weapons use a cool-down period instead of having to reload. Weapons in the game include assault rifles, sniper rifles, shotguns, rocket launchers, and miniguns. The game is intentionally difficult; its easiest difficulty level is called \\"challenging\\", and the next easiest difficulty level is called \\"hard\\". The game also offers competitive multiplayer. There are two modes - deathmatch and team deathmatch - and a small number of maps. Cooperative gameplay, which was mentioned in the game's initial announcement, did not make it into the final game. Plot Alien Rage takes place on an asteroid which humans and an alien species known as Vorus were jointly mining for Promethium, a highly efficient source of energy. After the Vorus turn on the humans and wipe the miners out, Jack, the player character, is sent to the mining facility to kill the aliens and destroy the facility. Development Alien Rage was first announced in early April 2012, under the name Alien Fear. The game was to be developed using Unreal Engine 3 by City Interactive's Bydgoszcz Studio, and would have a cooperative gameplay (co-op) mode. The first screenshots from the game were released two months later, in June 2012. In May 2013 the game's name was changed to Alien Rage, and two months later it was announced that the game would be released on the personal computer, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 on 24 September 2013. The game was eventually released on 24 September 2013 for Windows, 18 October 2013 for the Xbox 360, and 21 October 2013 for the PlayStation 3, with and ESRB rating of Mature. Reception Alien Rage received average to poor reviews upon release. At Metacritic, a video game review aggregator, the Windows version of the game received an average score of 52 out of 100, based on 27 reviews, while the Xbox 360 version revived a score of 46, based on 10 reviews. The game was heavily criticized for its lack of originality. Daniel Shannon of GameSpot remarked that \\"If you have played a first-person shooter made in the last 10 years, then you have already experienced most of what Alien Rage has to offer.\\", and continued that \\"You've seen these weapons before, and you've shot these enemies before\\". Reviewers especially took issue with the lack of creativity in level design, which Destructoid's Jim Sterling called \\"tedious corridors full of identical, monotonous, brainless combat encounters\\". Hardcore Gamers Nikola Suprak commented that several of the levels he played through were visually indistinct from one another, before saying that \\"level after level of redundant action and repetitive encounters ultimately drag the game down\\". Critics also noted that the game had a number of technical issues. Sterling ran into two situations where glitches would not allow him to progress without restarting the level, while Sam Turner of The Digital Fix experienced dramatic drops in frame rate during gameplay, and crashed to desktop several times. The game's multiplayer experience was received better than its single player campaign. Writing for Gaming Nexus, Jeff Kintner said that the \\"multiplayer is fun, if a bit repetitive\\". While Kintner expressed a desire for additional, objective-based, types of multiplayer, he praised the team deathmatch mode's intensity. GameSpot's Daniel Shannon also commented on the limited number of multiplayer options, but went on to say that \\"For what it's worth, the action is fast-paced, and the maps are well designed for a balanced multiplayer experience.\\"  Notes  : GameRankings tracks ratings for each platform separately. This rating is based on only one review, and therefore is not an aggregate score. : Metacritic tracks ratings for each platform separately, and does not assign aggregate scores for a platform until it receives at least four reviews specific to that platform.

She taught monks as well as nuns, and helped to increase the participation of young people and men in Korean Buddhism. She made laypeople a particular focus of her efforts, and broke out of traditional models of spiritual practice, teaching so that anyone could practice, regardless of monastic status or gender. She was also a major force for the advancement of Bhikkunis (nuns), heavily supporting traditional nuns‚Äô colleges as well as the modern Bhikkuni Council of Korea. The temple she founded, Hanmaum Seon Center, grew to have 15 branches in Korea, with another 10 branches in other countries.  Life  Daehaeng Kun Sunim was born in Seoul, Korea, in 1927. Her family was originally quite wealthy, and owned large pieces of land stretching from what is now Itaewon down to the Han River. Her father was from an old Korean military family, and had continued to secretly support resistance to the Japanese Occupation of Korea. As a result, in 1932 or 1933, the Japanese secret police, the Kempeitai, came to arrest him. He was warned a few minutes before their arrival and escaped out the back of his home with his family. They fled south across the Han River, and lived in the mountains there in a dugout hut. Unable to safely contact friends or family, they lived in poverty, having to glean fields for leftover grains of rice or vegetables. Daehaeng Kun Sunim often slept outdoors in order to avoid her increasingly angry father. Obsessed with the question of why people suffer, she awakened when she was around eight years old. She was formally ordained by Hanam Kun Sunim in around 1948, and received Dharma transmission from him at the same time. She spent many of the years that followed wandering the mountains of Korea, wearing ragged clothes and eating only what was at hand. Later, she explained that she hadn't been pursuing some type of asceticism; rather, she was just completely absorbed in entrusting everything to her fundamental Buddha essence and observing how that affected her life. Around 1959, she settled in a hermitage below Sangwon Temple in the Chiak Mountains, and in the mid 1960s moved to the Wonju area. Later she moved to the Cheongnyangni area of Seoul, before eventually moving to Anyang, where she established the first Hanmaum Seon Center in 1972.(Daehaeng 1993, 19-141)Daehaeng, Sunim (1993). ÌïúÎßàÏùåÏöîÏ†Ñ (The Principles of Hanmaum) At the time of her passing on May 22, 2012, she was the guiding teacher of over one hundred nuns, and the Dharma teacher of over fifty monks. The center she founded has a lay membership of over one hundred fifty thousand people, and has grown to twenty five branches around the world.  Teaching Style  A Dharma talk by Daehaeng Kun Sunim at the Jinju, South Korea, Hanmaum Seon Center The goal of Daehaeng Kun Sunim teachings was to help people to discover the great potential with themselves. In this way, they would be able to make their own way forward, and use the abilities inherent within them to help themselves and others. To this end, she taught people to rely upon the great wisdom and energy inherent within each of us, often called \\"Buddha-nature,\\" through which she said each one of us is connected to every other being and thing. In her own life and practice, Daehaeng Kun Sunim had experienced for herself that each and every person has this infinite potential with themselves, which she said could be called \\"Buddha-nature,\\" \\"God,\\" \\"inherent Buddha,\\" \\"Father,\\" and so on. Thus, she was determined to teach such that spiritual practice was something everyone could participate in, and which wasn't limited to certain groups such as monks or nuns. It was important to her that people develop the strengths and tools to be able to practice and overcome whatever might confront them, without becoming dependent upon some outer teacher or guru. To this end, she taught people to rely directly upon this \\"inherent Buddha.\\" (She also frequently used the Korean expressions for \\"foundation,\\" \\"fundamental mind,\\" \\"Juingong\\"(the one that is truly doing things,\\" and \\"Hanmaum(one mind).) She did however say that an outer teacher may be necessary until people find their own, true inner teacher. She exhorted people to work on letting go of thoughts such as \\"I,\\" \\"mine,\\" and \\"I did,\\" as well as to be careful to interpret events positively. In addition, she warned about getting caught up in blaming others for the things one experiences. Instead, she said, understand that we've had a role in creating everything that we experience. So if we can handle them wisely, if we can entrust them to our foundation, even those will change and move in a more positive direction. She didn't emphasize fixed periods of sitting meditation, nor did she encourage the systematic study of hwadus(kong-an). She wanted people to get used to listening inwardly and discovering what they needed to do at any particular time to brighten their own hearts, as opposed to getting caught up in other's fixed forms and traditions. To this extent, she taught people to take the issues of their own daily life as the material of their spiritual practice, and to practice entrusting that to one's inherent Buddha-nature. About hwadus, she said that although they can still be effective, they don't work as well with modern people, and at any rate, each person has their own fundamatal hwadus that they were born with. \\"Why am I here?\\" \\"What am I supposed to be doing with my life?\\" and so on. She called these kinds of questions \\"naturally arising hwadus.\\" (See No River to Cross, 2007, Wake Up and Laugh, 2014)  Modern Versions of Traditional Buddhist Ceremonies  In the late 1970s, Daehaeng Kun Sunim began translating the traditional ceremonies used in Korean Buddhist temples. These were used at the temples she founded, Hanmaum Seon Centers, beginning in the early 1980s, with the first collection of these ceremonies being widely published in 1987,Hanmaum Seonwon(1987). Ïã†ÌñâÏöîÏ†Ñ(Ceremonies and Essentials) but it would not be until late 2011 when Korea's largest Buddhist order, the Jogye Order, would begin to introduce modern Korean translations of the traditional Chinese- character(hanmun) ceremonies. Daehaeng Kun Sunim had been concerned that laypeople were missing the benefits and help that understanding the ceremonies could provide, so she began translating them from the traditional Sino-Korean characters into modern, phonetic Korean(Hangul). These included: *The Thousand Hands Sutra(ÂçÉÊâãÁ∂ì), which includes the Great Compassion Dharani(Â§ßÊÇ≤Âíí) *The Heart Sutra(Ëà¨Ëã•ÂøÉÁ∂ì) *The Diamond Sutra(ÈáëÂâõÁ∂ì) In addition, she translated the Flower Ornament Sutra(ËèØÂö¥Á∂ì). Her Korean version of the Thousand Hands Sutra and the Great Compassion Dharani has been published in English as A Thousand Hands of Compassion  Hanmaum Seon Center  Hanmaum Seon Center(\\"Hanmaum Seonwon\\"), Anyang, South Korea, Hanmaum Seon Center(or Hanmaum Seonwon-ÌïúÎßàÏùå ÏÑ†Ïõê) is large Buddhist temple complex near Seoul, South Korea. Founded in 1972, in Anyang City, it is part of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism. It is run by Daehaeng Kun Sunim's Bhikkuni disciples, and has fifteen Korean branches and ten overseas branches. In addition to its role as a center for teaching the Dharma, it is well known for its choir and youth groups. The youth group is the driving force behind many award-winning lanterns and floats that take part in the Buddha's Birthday parades.

They primarily inhabit Kerala, and the Wayanad, Kozhikode, Kannur and Malappuram districts. The Paniya speak the Paniya language, which belongs to the Dravidian family. A scheduled tribe, they have a population of around 94,000 individuals. History Paniyas making fire (1909). The Paniya have historically worked as agricultural labourers. They are believed to have been brought to Wayanad by the king of Malabar, and thereafter tilled the land as serfs. Following the abolishment of the slave-holding system, the Paniya were resettled in different areas established by the government. Paniyas were also historically reputed for their boldness and recklessness. For this reason, they were often employed as thieves. The Paniya today are a scheduled tribe. One particular sub-group of theirs, the Kattupaniyar, inhabits the forest region of Nilambur in the Malappuram District. Here, members lead a traditional hunter-gatherer lifestyle. Demographics The Paniya mainly inhabit Kerala, and the Wayanad, Kozhikode, Kannur and Malappuram districts of India. Others reside in Tamil Nadu, the area west of the Nilgiris hills, as well as the Kodagu District of Karnataka. Paniyas have a total population of around 94,000 individuals (2003). Of those, around 67,948 live in the Kerala hills. Language The Paniya speak the Paniya language as a mother tongue. A member of the Dravidian family, it is most closely related to Malayalam, Kadar, Ravula and other Dravidian languages. Paniya is spoken both at home and during religious ceremonies. Some Paniyas also use other Dravidian languages such as Malayalam, Tamil or Kannada. Paniyas use different writing systems depending on where in India they reside. Those in Karnataka use the Kannada script, those in Kerala write in the Malayalam script, while the Paniya in Tamil Nadu use the Tamil script. Culture Paniya primarily inhabit Kerala, and the Wayanad, Kozhikode, Kannur and Malappuram districts. Paniyas typically live in villages (padis) consisting of a few huts (pire or chala) with courtyards. Each hut settlement contains 5 to 15 families. For attire, Paniya males wear a lengthy cloth wrapped around the waist, which is known as a mundu. A smaller mundu is also slung over the shoulders to cover the body. Paniya females or panichi don a long cloth, with a smaller one above the breast area and around the armpits. In addition, they wear a red or black aratti scarf around the waist. The Paniyas bury their dead in formal funeral rites. Typically, the place of burial is close to the padi. The interment is accompanied by a seven-day mourning period by family members. Religion The modern Paniya practice a variety of faiths. Among these are Hinduism, traditional religion, and Christianity. Genetics Commercial recent genetic studies are different to private recent genetic studies, and analysed differently. Commercial recent genetic studies would suggest that Paniyas are 100% Aboriginal South Asia, or AASI. A study by Yelmen et al (2019) identified the Paniya alongside the Irulas, as the best fit proxy for the Ancient Ancestral South Indian (AASI), one of the founder indigenous populations of South Asia.

The film was released to Cineplex Odeon theatres nationwide on 6 June 2014. It is the first film chosen for production from the CineCoup Film Accelerator. The plot concerns an alcoholic small town cop who transforms into a werewolf after being cursed; he still possesses his human intelligence in wolf form and continues his work as a police officer even in wolf form. WolfCop was released to UK DVD and Blu-ray on 13 October 2014.  Plot  Lou Garou, an alcoholic cop in the small community of Woodhaven, spends most of his day either asleep at work or at Jessica's bar. When his friend Willie Higgins phones in a complaint of occult activity in the area of his gun store, the police chief sends Garou to investigate. After meeting with Higgins, Garou dismisses his concerns as the actions of heavy metal fans. Higgins again reports a disturbance, and the chief forces Garou to investigate. When he arrives at the scene, Garou finds occultists in the middle of a ceremony to sacrifice an upstart politician who was running on a platform of reform and anti-corruption. Garou is knocked out and wakes up the next morning in his bed, not remembering how he got there, though he has a pentagram carved into his stomach. Garou's senses become extremely sharp, and his wounds heal near-instantly. As he investigates the case, he surprises Jessica and his coworkers, all of whom had written him off as lazy and incompetent. As he goes over his notes at Jessica's bar, she encourages him to drink more and invites him to join her privately. Before he can, two criminals part of a local gang sneak into the bar and attack him in the bathroom. Garou, who is in the middle of a transformation into a werewolf, easily kills one and drives off the other. Angry that they did not kidnap Garou, the gang leader stabs out the eye of the escaped gangster when he claims to have seen Garou transform into a monster. Meanwhile, Garou ends up in Higgins' house, handcuffed to the bed. Higgins explains that he captured Garou and restrained him for his own safety. Higgins later researches his condition, and they learn that occult ceremonies in which a werewolf is sacrificed can strengthen the magic of reptilian shapeshifters. Garou and his partner, Tina, investigate the deaths at the bar and a series of seemingly unrelated armed robberies by a gang who wear pig masks. Higgins convinces Garou that he must be restrained at night, and Garou submits to being locked in the town's jail. However, when the police station receives a call for help, Garou, who has since transformed into a werewolf but has retained his human intelligence, dons his policeman's uniform and heads to the local supermarket, where the pig-mask gang have taken hostages. Garou savagely kills all the pig- mask robbers and heads toward a meth lab. Higgins cowers in the car as Garou again savagely kills several gun-wielding gangsters. When they return to the police station, Jessica seduces Garou while he is in his werewolf form, only to reveal that she is a shapeshifter and also the town's elderly mayor. Higgins also reveals himself as a shapeshifter and theorizes that Garou's alcoholism has made him stronger than their previous victims, all of whom they were able to control. Garou is drugged and brought to a second ceremony, where he is to be sacrificed during an eclipse so that the town's ruling elite, all of whom are reptilian shapeshifters, can continue to hide their true identity and rule indefinitely. Tina arrives and confronts the police chief, who shapeshifts into the gang leader, and Higgins. Tina and Garou kill Higgins, Jessica, and the gang members, but the chief surprises them with a sneak attack. Weakened by the approaching eclipse, Garou is wounded when shot by the chief, but he realizes that alcohol is the source of his enhanced power. As Garou consumes a flask of alcohol, Tina impales the police chief on a sword. He uses it to also stab her, but before he can finish her, Garou shoots and kills the police chief. Garou and Tina limp off together, and Garou promises to drop her off at a hospital after he gets another drink.

Craig Anderson of Fangoria rated it 4/5 stars and wrote, \\"While Wolfcop does tend to overreach, and too-often falls back on its predictable buddy-cop formula splatstick shtick, it's still plenty fun\\". Andrew Mack of Twitch Film wrote, \\"It is a mix of horror and comedy that does not take off right away but builds momentum to a satisfying conclusion.\\" Scott Hallam of Dread Central rated it 3.5/5 stars and wrote, \\"If you enjoy a horror-comedy that's just out for a laugh and never takes itself too seriously, you'll enjoy WolfCop.\\"  Soundtrack  The soundtrack was composed by Saskatoon, Saskatchewan instrumental band Shooting Guns and Toby Bond, who joined the band shortly after.

The Joseph Floyd Manor is a retirement home in the upper peninsula area of Charleston, South Carolina. The building is located at the northwest corner of Mt. Pleasant St. and King St. The 12-story building was originally known as the Darlington Apartments and was designed by William G. Lyles, Bissett, Carlisle & Wolff of Columbia, South Carolina.  History  The apartments cost $1,626,000 when it was built, starting in 1950. The ground floor was supposed to have space for commercial spaces, and the second floor was to have professional offices such as lawyers or doctors along with 156 apartments. Rent for an apartment ranged from $75 per month for a one-bedroom efficiency to $175 a month for one of three three-bedroom penthouse apartments. The property had been bought by Mr. Leonard D. Long in 1933 when it housed a tent community and there were only two nearby houses. Immediately before the construction began in January 1950, the site was home to a World War II-era nightclub known as the Windmill which was being used as a grocery store. The apartments were meant to cater to single men and women and retirees. In 1979, the Charleston County Housing and Redevelopment Authority tried to rework the building into apartments for the elderly with the assistance of $2.5 million from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The lowest bid received for the work, however, was $3.6 million. At the time, the chairman of the Authority was Joseph H. Floyd. The work was eventually carried out, and the newly christened Joseph Floyd Manor reopened in March 1981 following a renovation. After the work, the first floor included a mix of uses; the second floor was for handicapped residents; and the upper floors were for the elderly. The building, named for chairman of the Authority board, reopened in March 1981. In May 2020, conditions of the building came under question by residents and local state officials. After a tour of the facilities, South Carolina state house representative Wendell Gilliard wrote to Congressman Jim Clyburn that the conditions at Joseph Floyd Manor were \\"most definitely subhuman and deplorable.\\" A meeting to discuss repair costs will be held for the Charleston County Council by the manor's housing board. Charleston County Council does not have direct oversight of the housing project, but Charleston County does name the commissioners of the Housing and Redevelopment Authority; on June 17, 2020, Charleston County Council removed George Dawson as a member of the Housing and Redevelopment Authority.

It is a continuation of Gust's Japan-only 2012 release Ciel Nosurge, and a prequel to their Ar tonelico trilogy of games. The game was released in North America on September 23, 2014, and in Europe on September 26, 2014, under the title Ar nosurge: Ode to an Unborn Star. A PlayStation Vita version, Ar Nosurge Plus, was released on October 2, 2014, in Japan, and July 2015 in North America and Europe. Gameplay=Field Exploration In the fields, the players can explore the areas and collect items in a way akin to that of Gust's Atelier series, as well as talking with other characters, interacting with some elements of the scenery and activating events. They can also talk with the other characters that form their party in order to get their viewpoints on the current area or the objective they have to accomplish. The player will have a bar that constantly changes colors, alerting them to the possibility of entering a battle the closer it gets to a red color and the faster it flashes. Battles During battles, the player will control two characters: the protagonist and his corresponding heroine, while they battle multiple enemy waves, so once an enemy group is defeated, other groups will take their place until the player defeats them all, they run away, are defeated, or the turn limit is reached. The protagonist has the purpose of actively attacking the enemies and protecting the heroine, while the heroine stands behind the protagonist singing a Song Magic chosen by the player. Turns are divided in Player's Turn and Enemy's Turn, of which the Player's Turn is used for the protagonist to attack the enemies a set number of times while the heroine charges up her Song Magic. For attacking, the player can use four attacks that are mapped to the four face buttons in the PlayStation 3's controller, as well as also being able to bring up a menu where they can use items, activate Friend Skills, run away from the battle or activate the Heroine's Song Magic whenever they wish to. The better the player battles, the faster their Harmo Level will rise, which in turn will speed up the Burst Gauge, which is the representation of the strength for the heroine's Song Magic. However, received attacks as well as the usage of the bonus actions triggered with the L1 and R1 buttons can reduce the Harmo Level, so the player must be careful. Additionally, the heroine may use weaker Song Magic blasts of variable intensity against the enemies to support the protagonist during the Player's Turn, which also depends on how high the player has the Harmo Level and the type of Song Magic she is charging. Once the player has used up all the attacks the protagonist can use during that turn, the battle will move over to the Enemy's Turn, during which the player will have to watch for the timing of the enemies' attacks and press the Circle button in order to block them and protect the heroine. Successful guards reduce damage taken and increase the Burst Gauge, while failed guards result in a loss of Burst and greater damage to the Heroine. It must be mentioned that the protagonist can't die, as he doesn't even have an HP bar, but the heroine does have an HP bar at the side of her portrait, and if she falls during battle, the game will count it as a defeat and it'll be a Game Over for the player. Battles have a time limit, as if they aren't finished in a certain number of turns, the game will consider the battle as finished and send the player to the results screen, where they will receive experience, Dive Points, money and dropped items depending on the types and number of enemies defeated. After this, they will be taken back to the field and the encounter gauge will be reduced depending on the number of encounters for the area and the number of waves the player managed to defeat. However, if the player manages to defeat all the waves before the turn limit expires, the encounter gauge will be emptied upon returning to the field, allowing the player to explore the field without worrying about enemies. This gives more importance to Song Magic due to the fact that once it has reached a certain Burst threshold, it can deal damage to all of the enemy waves currently present in battle at once, allowing the player to clear the area of enemies with a single attack. This is denoted in the wave indicator at the top of the screen by marking in red the waves that the currently charged Burst level can destroy at the moment, as well as indicating the percentage of damage the current Burst charge will deal to the wave that follows the leftmost one highlighted in red with a small notice below the wave indicator: when the percentage reaches 100% and begins blinking, that means that the Song Magic can annihilate all enemies in the field. Additionally, the player can gain additional turns by attacking the enemies marked with a ! enough to fill a yellow bar below their HP, which when it gets filled, it will Break that enemy and leave it stunned; as well as killing enemies that don't have the previously mentioned mark. Additionally, event and boss battles are exempt from the turn limit. When the player has reached the max Harmo Level (Lv. 4) and completed the Heroine's Genometrics up to the point of the Completion Ceremony, the option for activating the Song Magic is replaced by other called the HarmoBurst, in which the protagonist will be able to attack enemies continuously until the Harmo Level gauge gets completely emptied. Additionally, this will allow the protagonist and heroine to activate a more powerful attack, in which the protagonist launches a super move followed by the Song Magic of the Heroine with amplified power, after a while of using the HarmoBurst, though it should be mentioned that using the super move or letting the Harmo Level gauge run out will result in the automatic activation of the Song Magic and the end of the battle. The player can also call upon the characters that have established a friendship with the party in order to attack the enemies or provide support to the pair after certain conditions are met. However, only one of these skills can be used per battle. Both pairs have each four possible Friend Skills, all different from each other. Synthesis At shops, the player has the option of using the items and recipes they have collected to make newer items, always with the assistance of the shopkeeper of the place they are at. Aside of this allowing the player to gain items they wouldn't be able to in any other way, this also triggers scenes in which the characters involved in the creation of the item discuss it and give it a name the first time a specific item is made, as well as also having humorous sequences of dancing and singing at the end of the synthesis process. It's in this way that the items for strengthening specific parts of equipment of the party can be made: TxBIOS increase the power of Song Magic, Cathodes increase the power of weapons, and RNAs increase the power of armors. To acquire new recipes, the player must trigger events at the synthesis shops, which is done by talking to the shopkeeper and leaving the shop menu. Genometrics Carrying over the Dive system from the Ar tonelico series, the player can also Dive into the Soulspace (mental world) of the characters, which receives the name Genometrics here, and have adventures through them. During this time, the gameplay changes to be more like that of a visual novel, where the player only has to read through the events taking place, move the protagonist through the Genometrics map and take decisions when prompted. Entering each point in the map requires the player to spend a set amount of the DP they have gained from battles, as well as taking some of the decisions in the events, so if the player doesn't have enough DP, they will fail to complete the events and get expelled from the Genometrics they are exploring. Unlike the Ar tonelico series, however, this isn't limited to the heroines: the player can instead Dive into the Genometrics of several of the characters they meet, and the decisions taken in each individual Genometrics will have some impact in the other, by changing the friendly disposition of these characters towards the current party as well as their introverted, extroverted, masochistic and sadistic tendencies. This is also the only way in which the Heroines can gain new Song Magic for use in battle. Each of the events of the Genometrics can be repeated after they have been completed in order to make different choices, as obtaining Genometrica Crystals and CGs is entirely dependent on the choices the player makes, being possible to miss out on obtaining several of them if the appropriate options aren't chosen while advancing. Purification This gameplay element consists of the heroines and the protagonists taking a bath in a hot spring together. During this, they will change from their normal clothes to swimsuits and have conversations to know each other more deeply. Additionally, during the Purification, the player can Install Genometrica Crystals they have received from the Genometrics in order to increase their powers. It's possible to Install them into any one of the playable party members (Earthes, Ion, Cas, and Delta), and while there are five possible spots where the crystals can be Installed (legs, torso, abdomen, arms, and head), not all of these will be available from the beginning: the player will be allowed to Install on them when both the protagonist and the heroine have gotten a deep enough relationship.

After the rescue, they discover she had in her possession a powerful Song called Ciel N Protecta, but it was stolen and it supposedly is the cause for the ship's guardian robots attacking Felion, as their enemy, the Archbishop of the Genomirai Church, Zill is controlling them through it. During their searches for it, they are captured by the Genomirai Church, and as they escape from them, they discover Zill is planning to set up and sing a very dangerous kind of Song Magic called Class::CIEL_NOSURGE;. On the other hand, Ion is trapped in the sealed world through which the player interacted with her in Ciel Nosurge, and having recovered her memories and having Earthes as her helper, she decides to escape from it. After escaping from the sealed world, they both reach the city of Tenryosara, where they meet with Tattoria and Kanon. And from there, both pairs continue their journey in search of the truth about this world.

She was the daughter of ≈åh≈çri Yasumochi, a head priest of ≈åyamazumi Shrine on the island of ≈åmishima in Iyo Province. She went to battle several times whose claim to divine inspiration coupled with fighting skills has led to her being compared with Joan of Arc.  Life  Tsuruhime was born in 1526. At that time the island was under threat from the growing power of ≈åuchi Yoshitaka from Yamaguchi on the mainland of Honshu, and fighting took place between the ≈åuchi and the K≈çno (Ê≤≥Èáé) on Shikoku, under whose jurisdiction the shrine fell. Tsuruhime's two elder brothers were killed in one such conflict, and when Tsuruhime was 15 years old her father died of illness, so she inherited the position of chief priest. She had been trained since childhood in the martial arts, and when the ≈åuchi made further moves against ≈åmishima she took charge of the military resistance. She led an army into battle and drove the ≈åuchi samurai back into the open sea when they raided ≈åmishima in 1541. Four months later the invaders returned, and while an ≈åuchi general, Ohara Takakoto, was being entertained on his flagship he came under attack from Tsuruhime in a raid. At first he mocked her presumption, but Tsuruhime cut him down.

This pathogen if left untreated can destroy all yields; annually the pathogen can cause a yield loss of up to 1/3 and up to 10% of total trees can be lost completely. With the value of the cocoa industry throughout the world being so large there are much research and control efforts that go into these Phytophthora spp. pathogens. This pathogen can be located anywhere on the cocoa trees but is most noted for the black mummified look it will give to the fruit of the cocoa tree. Staying ahead of the pathogen is the best means of control, the pathogen can be greatly reduced if leaf litter is not allowed to stay on the ground and if the pathogen gets out of hand chemical control can be used. This pathogen is mostly found in tropical areas where the cocoa trees are located and need rainfall in order to spread its spores. __TOC__  Disease cycle, symptoms and signs  The symptom of black pod disease is the necrotic lesion on the cocoa pod with brown or black color, which eventually enlarged to cover the whole pod. White mycelia growth on lesions that appeared several days after infection is the sign for the causal pathogen of black pod disease, which is Phytophthora spp. Black pod disease starts when the infected pod shows some little yellow spots, which eventually turn brown and enlarge to a dark brown or black lesion within five days. The lesion is fast growing and covers the entire pod after eight days of infection. The infection does not only occur on the pod surface, but also invades inside the pod affecting the beans. The growth of white mycelia on black pod is visible after 11 days and the sporulation is initiated. The dispersal of sporangia or zoospores through water, ants and other insects occurs at this stage and will infect other healthy pods nearby. Direct contact of a black pod with healthy pods also leads to the spread of disease. In addition, the infected flower cushion and mummified pods are the locations for P. palmivora survival during dry season, where the pathogen will grow and continue to infect other developing pods The infection occurs on any stage of pod development, where it causes wilting and dying of young pods and destroyed the beans of mature pods. The fully infected pods (the mummified pod), which then become dehydrated, are capable of providing the inoculum of P. palmivora for at least 3 years. P. megakarya causes the same symptom as P. palmivora, but the occurrence is faster and generally produces greater amount of spores. Both P. palmivora and P. megakarya also caused canker on bark, flower cushion and chup√≥ns, and cankers on the base could extend to the main roots. Cankers were identified as one of inoculum sources for black pod disease. Furthermore, the pattern of infection caused by P. megakarya starts from the ground and moves up to the canopy, however there is no distinct pattern of disease infection caused by P. palmivora was reported. This pattern of infection could be due to P. megakarya and P. palmivora that were found to survive in soil and P. megakarya could be surviving in the roots of a few species of shade trees found in cocoa plantation.  Hosts  Black pod disease while its name indicates that it is found in Theobroma cacao more commonly known as cocoa trees also has different hosts, for example; P. megakarya has been detected in the roots of shade trees of Western Africa while these trees can also be affected by the pathogen it is because of the market value of the cocoa trees that all emphasis and research on the disease is done on cocoa trees.  Cocoa trees  In the cocoa trees, P. megakarya infects the bark, flower, and trees with cankers. These cankers will often exude a reddish gum reducing the life of the tree, in turn, reducing the yield of the plant. The most devastating place the pathogen attacks is in the flowers as from these flowers is where the cocoa fruit will set. An infected flower will have infected fruit, which will turn black and will be unable to be harvested and processed.  Pathogen  Seven different pathogens have been named to cause black pod disease all over the world. All of the pathogens are found in the genus Phytophthora (a plant-damaging Oomycetes). The seven species responsible for black pod disease are; P. capsici, P. citrophthora, P. megasperma, P. katsurae, P. palmivora, and P. megakarya. While all of these pathogens can cause black pod disease the two major pathogens are P. palmivora and P. megakarya. The black pod disease pathogens affect all cocoa trees all over the world P. capsici and P. citrophthora are found in Central and South America while others such as P. megakarya is found in Central and Western Africa. All of these pathogens can present themselves in all parts of the cocoa trees but are most devastating in the fruit itself where it will turn the fruit to a black mummified casing. This fruit is then useless and can no longer be used.  Environment  P. megakarya is found in Central and Western Africa. During the cooler wetter times of the year, there is a spike in the incidents of black pod disease as when compared to the hotter more dry times of the year. The disease has a spike shortly after a rainfall. The humid weather that is associated with this pathogen and all other black pod disease pathogens is needed as the sporangia forms and starts distributing spores through rainfall, splashing water, and running water. With this pathogen spreading behavior needing water is why there is almost always a spike in the prevalence of the disease shortly after the rainy season.  Inoculum dispersal = Soil and litter  The spread of infection to pods above bare soil was shown to be greater relative to pods above litter. The reason for this is due to the splash of rain from bare soil spreads the inoculum to pods. However, litter under the tree prevented water droplets from splashing the soil particles as well as the inoculum beneath the litter to the above pods. Further, it was also reported that pods near the ground showed greater infections compared to higher pods due to greater soil was splashed and stick on the lower pods, therefore causes more infections.  Air and water dispersal from sporulating pods  The spread of spores through air from infected pods was observed and some assumption regarding this mechanism of dispersion has been made in previous studies, however it is remained uncertain due to unconvincing results from an experiment that collected some spores in the air using the volumetric spore trap, where a small amount of spores were found in the trap. Conversely, the dispersal of inoculum via rain is considered an effective mechanism in spreading the inoculum. It was assumed that under close canopy, less water will reach the sporulating pods to spread the inoculum, however, rain drops from leaves and branches could also splash the inoculum to the surroundings. Infected pods laying on the ground or litter could also spread the inoculum, yet greater infection was observed on pods located under infected pods hanging on the tree compared to pods at the same level of infected pods. It was reported that splash of wind-blown droplets from the infected pods are also able to infect pods on different trees nearby  Invertebrate  The dispersal of the disease is also associated with the invertebrate vectors. Tent building ants such as Crematogaster striatula and Camponotus acvapimensis were reported as the primary vector in disseminating the spores of P. palmivora from infected pods to healthy pods in Ghana. C. striatula was thought to be the most important vector that is responsible for black pod losses due to its building tent behavior as well as its dominancy within the area under particular condition. In Ghana, C. striatula removes the outer layer of cocoa pod and uses this material to construct the tent. Therefore, this ant effectively spread the disease by transporting the spores from the infected pods on the ground or on trees to healthy pods. Several other ant species namely C. africana, C. clariventris and C. depressa were also responsible for the spread of the disease besides C. striatula In addition, Camponotus acvapimensis, another type of tent-building ant that uses soil as building materials for tent construction was identified as the most important agent to spread the inoculum in Nigeria. Soil was identified as the source of inoculum for P. megakarya and therefore, it was implied that this ant species might use the infected soil to build tents, which infects healthy pods on trees. Other invertebrates that were reported to be associated with spreading the disease are several species of beetle, snail, caterpillar and millipedes. Fecal samples from these organisms were found to contain viable spores of P. palmivora. It was reported that beetle of family Nitidulidae is the most common vector for black pod as it was found 50 to 60% of black pod occurrences. These invertebrates consume the outer layer of the infected pods and incidentally ingest the mycelium and spores of the pathogen, thus spread the pathogen to other healthy pods.  Disease management  There are several methods available in order to control black pod disease such as cultural, chemical and biological control. In addition, the cultivation of varieties that resistant to black pod is an alternative in order to reduce disease incidence.  Cultural control  Several cultural practices to manage black pod disease could be implemented in cocoa plantation. A spacing of 3.1 x 3.1m and pruning of trees are recommended for cocoa planting in order to allow more light and air flow around the trees. This will reduce the level of humidity that is causing black pod disease. The removal of pods with black pod symptom should also be done in favor to eliminate the source of inoculum. In another study, the utilization of litter mulch under cocoa plantation has been reported in Papua New Guinea, which has some negative effect on the population of P. palmivora, and therefore could reduce the pod infection especially at the beginning of raining season. Leaf litter showed rapid decline in pathogen recovery of colonized cocoa tissue after 18 weeks, relative to grass ground cover. An explanation for this is due to higher moisture content and microbial activity of other microbes under leaf litter that reduces the survival of Phytophthora cinnamomi as documented by Aryantha et al. (2000). More frequent ripe pod harvest (i.e. twice a week) and removal of infected pod on the ground was demonstrated to significantly reduced disease occurrence and improve pod yield compared to less frequent harvest and removal (i.e. once a month). In addition, scattered healthy pod on the ground should also be removed, as it will be infected and become the source of inoculum later. Sanitation is one cultural method to control for black pod disease. Sanitation practices include weed removal, pruning, thinning and removal of infected and mummified pods every two weeks in order to eliminate the source for inoculum. Phytosanitary pod removal was observed to significantly reduce disease occurrences by 9‚Äì11% to 22‚Äì31%, where this practice removes the source for secondary inoculum. However, increase in disease incidence after raining season was observed to be most likely due to the spread of inoculum from survival site by the rain. The application of fungicide following sanitation is commonly performed for an effective control of disease, as sanitation practice alone would not completely eliminate the source of inoculum and still causes greater black pod incident compared to sanitation followed by at least one fungicide application  Chemical control  The application of copper fungicide has been shown to significantly reduce a great number of black pod incidences in Nigeria. Metalaxyl (Ridomil) and cuprous oxide (Perenox) were identified to be successful in increasing the number of harvested healthy pod compared to the application of fosetyl aluminium (Aliete) and control treatment. On top of that, the timing of fungicide application has some positive effect on the final pod yield where this plot produced greater yield than the unsprayed plot. The application was done before August, which is before the main disease epidemic that usually occurs in September and October. The recommended standard for fungicide application to control black pod disease caused by P. megakarya for a season is 6 to 8 times of application in every 3‚Äì4 weeks. However, the adoption of recommended application was very low among farmers in Ghana. Therefore, an experiment with a reduced number of fungicide applications demonstrated that there was 25 to 45% reduction in disease incidence. In terms of disease control and yields, sanitation and three applications of Ridomil 72 plus (12% metalaxyl + 60% copper-1-oxide) fungicide showed a better control compared to sanitation alone and sanitation with one or two fungicide applications. However, reduced in fungicide application was shown to be significantly less effective than the recommended standard fungicide application. It was suggested that the understanding regarding the source of inoculum, the amount of infective inoculum production and how the disease is disseminated is important in order to identify the appropriate and economical method in fungicide application as well as for an effective control of the disease. For example, the application of fungicide on the trunk will help farmers to control the spread of the disease up in the canopy, as it is difficult to reach the canopy during fungicide application. This will eventually save more time, labor and cost for disease management.  Cultural and chemical control  In Ghana, a study that combined the sanitation and fungicide application showed a significant reduction in the percentage of disease incidence, where greater black pod incident were observed from pods on the trunk than the canopy in control treatment (no fungicide application). This suggested that the application of fungicide on the trunk would protect pods from infection, therefore reduce primary and secondary infection rate, both on the trunk and in the canopy. In addition, the application of systemic (potassium phosphonate) with one and double injection (20 ml and 40 ml of fungicide for each injection frequency), and semi-systemic (metalaxyl) fungicide showed better control compared to contact fungicides (copper based fungicide) in both locations that were used in the experiment.  Biological control  Chris Tonaldo applying chemical fungicide on cocoa Heavy application of chemical fungicide would eventually leads to resistant of pathogen and causing soil and water pollutions. Hence, more sustainable and environmental friendly method should be established and implemented, such as biological control. Several species of fungi from the genera of Trichoderma was identified to be a beneficial endophyte, to control black pod caused by Phytophthora spp. An isolate of Trichoderma asperellum from soil was observed as a potential mycoparasite for P. megakarya where this fungus has the potential to reduce black pod incident under field condition in Cameroon. It was reported that moderate black pod cases (47%) occurred in the T. asperellum treatment to control black pod disease compared to trees with untreated (71%) and chemical fungicide (1.73%). Another species, which is T. virens also has been documented to reduce some black pod incident in Peru. In Brazil, a new species known as Trichoderma martiale Samuels, sp. nov. was identified as an endophyte on cocoa, which has the ability to reduce black pod symptoms caused by P. megakarya. This endophyte species survives on cocoa pods, and has the ability to establish a long endophytic association with the host (about 3.5 months). Nevertheless, the protection against black pod via biological control is not as effective as the control using chemical fungicides  Resistant variety  There is no specific variety of cocoa that shows resistant to Phytophthora infections and the establishment and utilization of resistant variety will be most likely depends on the region. Numerous breeding programs have been established worldwide in order to screen and test for local hybrids for disease resistant of Phytophthora spp. For example, a study in Cameroon assessed the performance of local cocoa cultivars (the southern and northern Cameroon cultivar) compared to the local and international gene bank cultivars. The local genebank cultivar consisted of F1 hybrid of Upper Amazon X Trinidad, and an international cultivar from Papua New Guinea, and Latin America were provided through International Cocoa Genebank, Trinidad. Based on the information provided by farmers and leaf disc test to assess resistant variety, the local cultivars selected from farmers field showed some resistant to P. megakarya compared to other varieties. Thus, it was concluded that there are some potential resistant varieties available in this area. In addition, some molecular work on developing resistant varieties to black pod is being done by CEPLAC (Executive Plan of Cocoa Farming) agency in Brazil and hopefully more breeding program focusing on black pod resistant will be established and produced commercialized resistant varieties.  Importance  The United States chocolate industry consumes 1.4 billion dollars of cocoa and supplies 68,450 jobs throughout the United States. With this industry being so important not only in the US but also all over the world the black pod disease is of high importance. This pathogen if left untreated can destroy all yields; annually the pathogen causes 20-30% yield loss and kills about 10% of trees completely.

Same-sex sexual assault between males was made illegal in late 2015. Domestic and foreign victims of sex trafficking in China are raped. History During the Qing dynasty (1644‚Äì1912), rape was very difficult to prove. A woman who was sexually attacked had to prove that she had offered the utmost resistance and fought vigorously throughout the entire ordeal. Failure to do so would expose the woman herself to criminal prosecution for being complicit in \\"consensual illicit intercourse\\".  Prevalence, analysis and statistics Annual rape and all forms of sexual assaults per 100,000 people. Rape in China is not widely discussed in the media. Luo Tsun-yin, a social psychologist at Shih Hsin University in Taiwan, asserts that fewer than one in 10 rape cases in China are reported. The 2013 Multi-country Study on Men and Domestic Violence asked men in China if they had ever coerced a female partner into having sex (including alcohol facilitated rape). 22.2% said yes. 9.3% had done so in the past year. 19.4% raped their partner. 55% of the men who had raped had done so more than once and 9% had have so on four or more partners. 86% cited sexual entitlement as their motive (the highest percentage in the study) and 57% answered that they raped out of boredom. 72.4% experienced no legal consequences. 1.7% had raped another man. 25.1% who had raped reported first doing so as a teenager. 2.2% admitted to having committed gang rape. A report conducted by the All-China Women‚Äôs federation estimated that close to forty percent of Chinese women who are involved in a relationship or are married experience physical or sexual violence.De Silva de Alwis R, Klugman J. Freedom from violence and the law: a global perspective in light of the Chinese domestic violence law, 2015. University of Pennsylvania Journal of International Law. 2015 Nov;37(1):1-52 There are numerous cases of sexual assault are unrecorded. The survey of previous paragraph has updated some new information, it turns out that 22.7 percent of males acknowledged that they had raped a woman before. Further, only 24.9 percent of Chinese sexual culprits were in custody while other countries surveyed had average 32.5 percent. In addition, only 15.6 percent of Chinese criminals were sent to jail while other countries had average 22.9 percent. The data shows Chinese reports for sexual assault is lower than other countries in Asia Pacific region, but in fact it is not the truth. Recent research has found that there is no existing psychometric measure assessing attitudes toward rape in China. For example, researchers found that men endorse the view that revealing clothing conveys consent for sex.Xue J, Fang G, Huang H, Cui N, Rhodes KV, Gelles R. Rape myths and the cross-cultural adaptation of the Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale in China. Journal of Interpersonal Violence. 2016 5. [Epub ahead of print]. DOI: 10.1177/0886260516651315 Social stigma cast on victims of rape  Victims of rape in China often remain silent and do not report the crime because traditional culture holds that being raped is shameful and should be kept private. Popular activist Guo Jianmei told the story of a villager who raped over 100 women, and asserted that \\"not one of them spoke up.\\" In another incident, a girl and her mother tried to register a complaint against a rapist, but Zhong Xiancong, a police official, did not register it and suggested to the victim, \\"To protect your reputation, you should forget about the whole thing.\\" Rape is regarded as taboo in Chinese culture, and the victim is often rejected by society, as the culture views women as solely responsible for the rape. One American victim of rape in China stated that she felt she would have been prosecuted by the state if she had tried to speak out against the rape. Law The laws against rape in China have been criticized by some, including Guo Jianmei, who noted that weaknesses in the legal system make it possible for certain rapists to escape justice. Same-sex rape was not illegal until 2015 in China, and legal loopholes previously allowed child rapists to escape with light sentences. In 2011, a man who raped another man was convicted of \\"intentional injury\\" rather than rape, as non-consensual same-sex sexual conduct was not defined as a sexual offense. In November 2015 ChinaDaily reported another same-sex case which happened in Luzhou city, Sichuan province. In this case, a man robbed and raped another man, but did not face sanction for the crime of sexual assault. In November 2015 Xinhua reported that the criminal code was amended to include the sexual assault and rape of men, citing the above case. In addition, sex with underaged (defined as under 14 years of age) prostitutes was reclassified as rape. In recent years some additional legislation has been passed. The Draft Law was the first to define domestic violence in China, and its benefits include outlining how to obtain restraining orders, and providing guidelines to officials such as judges and police officers with how to handle cases of domestic violence in congruity with the law. However, there are weaknesses in this law as it only covers family members, and excludes protection for unmarried, divorced, dating, and LGBTQ partners. It also doesn‚Äôt attempt to combat economic abuse which is all too easily perpetrated illegally under China‚Äôs marriage law. The Draft Law falls significantly short of international standards, including those of surrounding Asian countries. The majority of the Asian region has progressed towards a ‚Äúsecond generation of lawmaking,‚Äù adopting a more comprehensive definition of violence consistent with the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women (DEVAW) definition. China‚Äôs current laws are significantly more restricted, seemingly with policies predating the Beijing Declaration.e Silva de Alwis R, Klugman J.

In 1809 he was honored by the Junta Suprema de Sevilla, for his heroic participation in the defense of Buenos Aires, during the English invasions in the R√≠o de la Plata.  Early years  Notice about private school He was born in Buenos Aires, the son of Juan Canaveris and Catalina Bernarda de Esparza, belonging to a distinguished family. He completed his primary and secondary studies in Buenos Aires, and possibly obtained his law degree in the National University of C√≥rdoba. He began his career as government official in the early of 1800s, being later appointed to the position of notary at the Tribunal Mayor de Cuentas in 1810. He took an active part during in the defense of the city during the British invasions of the R√≠o de la Plata, serving as assistant in the Cuerpo de Quinteros y Labradores, a cavalry unit under the command of Antonio Luciano Ballester and Juan Claver√≠a. The Corps of Quinteros was conformed in its majority by farmers and ranchers from the Province of Buenos Aires. The January 13, 1809 the Supreme Junta of Seville decided on behalf of the king Ferdinand VII, reward the officers of the various organs of the militia, giving the rank of Captain to Jos√© Canaveris. He had a long activity as a criminal lawyer of the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata. In 1825, he was legal representative of Colonel Francisco Montes Larrea, a respectable military man, who had suffered an assault in the Fonda de los Tres Reyes. Between 1826 and 1833 he served as procurador del n√∫mero (justice assistant) of the city. He also had an active participation in the beginnings of Argentine education, a pioneer in the application of the Lancasterian method in the R√≠o de la Plata. He had a school of first letters located a few meters from the Church of San Miguel de Arcangel.  Political life  Like all members of his family, Juan Jos√© Canaveris supported the emancipatory cause. Between 1815 and 1819 he served in the Junta de Observaci√≥n, in Comisar√≠a de Guerra, and in the Ministerio de Hacienda of Buenos Aires. He served in the Honorable Junta de Representantes in 1820, and was appointed to occupy the position of accountant of the Tribunal de Cuentas of Buenos Aires in 1821. He and his family were involved in political conflicts between federales and unitarios, occurred during the Argentine Civil War. He was present together with Miguel de Azcu√©naga and Gervasio Espinosa, at the house of Governor Juan Jos√© Viamonte, when his house was attacked with shots by bandits belonging to the Sociedad Popular Restauradora. The Viamonte meeting took place during his second term as governor of Buenos Aires, and it is mentioned in the personal correspondence of Encarnaci√≥n Ezcurra to her husband Juan Manuel de Rosas. In 1830, Canaveris served in the Inspecci√≥n and Comandancia General de Armas, taking an active part in the enrollment of volunteers to be incorporated into the Regiment of Patricians. The British Packet of August 1, 1835. He was also involved in the beginnings of the economic institutions of the R√≠o de la Plata, taking part in the National Bank meetings with distinguished figures of his time, like the journalist Pedro de √Ångelis, the English Thomas Gowland and Juan Zimmermann, a businessman belonging to the German community of Buenos Aires. In 1833, he was part of the jury charged with ensuring the freedom of the press in the Argentina. He belonged to the moderate sector of the Federal Party, known as \\"lomos negros\\". He suffered political persecution during the government of Juan Manuel de Rosas, being accused of Unitario in 1835. Retired from political activity Juan Jos√© Canaveris returned to practice his career as a lawyer and accountant towards the end of his life. In 1835, he posted a notice in the British Packet, and Argentine News, an english speaking newspaper, where he offered his services of lawyer and accountant to the Anglo-Argentine community of Buenos Aires.  Family  Paseo de Julio by 1867, located in the vicinity of the house of the Canaveris family Juan Joseph Canaveris was married to Agustina Denis, daughter of Juan Denis and Mar√≠a Silva, criollos, descendants of settlers from Ireland and Iberian Peninsula. He lived in the house he inherited from his parents located in Calle de la Piedad No. 21, neighborhood of San Nicol√°s. He was neighbor of Vicente Anastasio Echevarr√≠a (colonial period), and by a large number of Irish people installed in the neighborhood, including Edmundo Cranwell. Several members of his family including siblings, cousins, and nephews were divided over political issues. His son Juan Manuel Canaveris, had participated in the military escort the remains of Manuel Dorrego from Navarro to the La Recoleta Cemetery. He actively served in the early days of the Rosas government, later having to go into exile in Montevideo. His other son Feliciano Canaveris also military, was assassinated in January 1843 in the vicinity of Tacuaremb√≥, and his execution was attributed to General Manuel Oribe. The family of Jos√© Canaveris was related to Francisco Crespo y Denis, a patriot who took part in the Argentine War of Independence, and Francisco Pantale√≥n Luna, who served as Lieutenant Governor of La Rioja Province. His daughter, Patricia Canaveris Denis, born on March 17, 1811 (Saint Patrick's Day) received a state pension for the services rendered by his father to the National State. It is not clear if the legitimate father's last name was Canaveris or \\"Jugluns\\", a surname possibly of French or Irish origin (Juggins or Jungius), and completely unknown in the Piedmont region. His father came from an important family established in various regions of the Kingdom of Sardinia, probably related to the Spanish society of the time. The idiosyncrasy of his father and his descendants was not at all like the French or Italian community of the colonial and post-colonial period of Buenos Aires, and it is quite possible that their paternal ancestors were of noble or bourgeois origin. Historically they lived in places of Buenos Aires where English, Scottish and Irish communities were established.

Plot The boat Black Whale III sails into the Bermuda Triangle with the Marvin family aboard, intending to search for the remains of Atlantis. Along the way they discover a doll floating in the water, which Diana Marvin‚Äîthe family's youngest daughter‚Äîtakes as her own. Diana appears to become possessed by the doll, and starts saying that everyone will die, and telling people the order they will die in. She also locks the ship's cook in the freezer, who almost dies before he is freed. One night, the boat follows a Fresnel lens signaling an SOS even though nothing appears on the radar. They abandon the search after the signal identifies itself as a ship that was lost years ago. The Black Whale III reaches its destination, and the crew begins a scuba exploration of some underwater ruins. A submarine earthquake disturbs the ruins and crushes the legs of Michelle Marvin, the family's eldest daughter. The ship attempts to head for the nearby island of Bimini for help, but they become stuck in a storm, hit some rocks, and have their engines and helm damaged. During the storm the ship's cook dies in an apparent accident, and Diana's parents are swept overboard looking for her. The next day, the engineer dies trying to repair the helm when Diana turns on the engines while he is inspecting the propellers. With the ship stranded and Michelle in desperate need of medical attention, the ship's mate and Michelle's brother depart the ship with her in a motorboat to try to reach Bimini. Michelle perishes on the voyage, and the boat becomes lost and never reaches its destination. Diana's aunt and uncle perish next, apparently killed by the doll. Back on Black Whale III, the captain is attempting to signal for help. They hear distress calls from other ships, including their own being repeated. Finally they are able to contact Bimini and relate their situation. At Bimini, the radar operator says that their story is impossible, for the Black Whale III disappeared over ten years ago with a family named Marvin aboard. The ship disappears, and the doll is left floating in the water.

Co-produced by Vishal, the film stars himself in the leading role with Lakshmi Menon and Ineya in supporting roles, while G. V. Prakash Kumar composed the film's music. The film deals with narcolepsy. It was released on 11 April 2014. It is dubbed into Hindi as Pyaar Reloaded and also in Telugu as Indhrudu. The movie was remade in Odia in 2017 as Shiva Not Out. The movie was declared as commercial success. Plot In the middle of the night, Indhiran (Vishal), accompanied by his two friends Sathish (Jagan) and Karuna (Sunder Ramu), purchase a gun illegally from a local gangster. Back home, Indhiran stares at his wish list and recalls his past. Since childhood, Indhiran has been suffering from narcolepsy, a rare disorder, which makes him fall asleep whenever his emotions reach an extreme and hinders him from living an ordinary life. He needs to be accompanied all the time. Companies hesitate to hire him, although he has excelled in academics, and he cannot impregnate women since he would fall asleep during sex. However, he can still hear whatever is being said when he is sleeping. Indhiran creates a list with 10 goals that he wants to achieve on his own. One day, he ventures out alone, which was one of his goals. When he is almost hit by a vehicle while crossing the road, his fear mounts, and he falls asleep in the middle of the road. A passerby (Mayilsamy) makes him pose as an orphaned corpse and gathers money from onlookers for his burial. Meera (Lakshmi Menon), who passes by, takes pity and shells out almost five grands. She later meets Indhiran in a mall and falls unconscious upon seeing him alive. After clearing up the misunderstanding, they start dating and fall for each other. Meera makes one of Indhiran's dreams come true (i.e. getting a kiss from a beautiful woman by kissing him), but her father (Jayaprakash) opposes their marriage as Indhiran cannot give birth to a child. Meera urges Indhiran to find a way how he could stay awake. It dawns on Indhiran that he had never fallen asleep while taking a shower. Believing that her father will accept Indhiran only when his potency is proved, Meera and Indhiran have sex underwater in their pool, resulting in Meera becoming pregnant. On a late-night drive, Meera and Indhiran find themselves in an under-construction bridge. Their car is hit by another, and the shock makes Indhiran doze. Meera is brutally attacked and raped by four thugs. Indhiran can hear the entire incident but remains asleep, and sheds a tear for being helpless. Meera falls into a coma, and her baby gets aborted. A heartbroken Indhiran vows to exact revenge on the perpetrators. The narrative moves back to the present. Deciding to venge all by himself, Indhiran fails to testify to the police. Indhiran comes to know that the sound of the sudden obstacles make him sleep. To prevent this, he buys a portable audio player and uses it with full volume. Inquiring Meera's friends, Indhiran first suspects Karthik (Rishi), a rich but ill-mannered guy whose marriage proposal was rejected by Meera. Indhiran confronts him, but he feigns ignorance about the incident. Indhiran remembers that it was four people, with one of them named Sekhar, and Sekhar's ringtone, while the police finds out that the offenders rode a red car. Indhiran stumbles upon a red car in a petrol bunk and inquires the driver, who claims that the car was with a mechanic named Sekhar on the day the crime took place. At the workshop, he spots the mechanic who tries to abscond, recognizing Indhiran, and a chase ensues, leading them to a building under construction. Informed by Sathish, Karuna arrives there and kills Sekhar. He then slits himself and is admitted for treatment. Karuna then recollects. Married to Karuna for two years, Kavitha (Ineya) was dissatisfied with her drunkard husband; she begins an affair with Aravind (Chethan Cheenu), a rich friend of Karuna. He spends a lot of money on buying her expensive gifts. Indhiran gains knowledge of this and advises Kavitha against it. It turns out that Karuna, to realize his ambitions of running a business in US, had been using his wife to manipulate Aravind. Citing Indhiran's confrontation, Kavitha bluffed to Aravind that if Karuna gets to know about the affair, he would kill them both. She suggested that the only way to solve it once and for all is to arrange the amount of 20 million that Karuna needs to settle in the states. With him gone, they could enjoy being together. Aravind agreed to finance Karuna out of his lust for her. Later, when Karuna and Kavitha are celebrating their success, Indhiran drops by unexpectedly. They mess up; Indhiran suspects them and informs Aravind, who confronts the couple. When Aravind realizes that he had been cheated, he hits Kavitha in a fit of rage, and she dies. Infuriated, Karuna retaliates and kills Aravind. Karuna arranges for disposing them with the help of the thugs and lies to Indhiran that Kavitha has eloped with Aravind. Since he assumed that Indhiran was responsible for Kavitha's death, Karuna had planned to take revenge by making him suffer the same way and requested the thugs to rape Meera. The remaining thugs insist Karuna to bring Indhiran to the same place where Sekhar was killed. Finding out that it was Karuna who had killed Sekhar, they beat him up. The thugs then remove the audio player from Indhiran, who gets an adrenaline rush and dozes off. While the thugs are assaulting him, one of them breaks a water pump, which splashes water all over and awakens Indhiran. He kills them all, except Karuna. Indhiran tells that he had seen Karuna killing Sekhar. When Indhiran questions Karuna as to why he sent thugs to attack Meera, Karuna angrily tells him that it was revenge for Kavitha's death, which was caused by Indhiran telling Aravind the truth. Karuna angrily attacks Indhiran and Indhiran retaliates back, hitting Karuna violently. Despite feeling bad for his friend and hesitant to kill him due to their close friendship, he remembers Meera and kicks Karuna into a steel construction bar, killing him. With all his wishes fulfilled, Indhiran has a new wish that he would make Meera recover soon. The final scene shows Indhiran hugging Meera who is tearful hearing him, which shows that she is definitely recovering.

Critical reception The film opened to positive reviews from critics many praising Vishal's performance, screenplay, fast-paced narration while some criticized its second half which was apparently vulgar to them. Baradwaj Rangan of The Hindu wrote, \\"The hero is a narcoleptic, and this aspect is not just a cool marketing gimmick. It has been integrated into the very fibre of the film...The first half is strong..the director, Thiru, displays a lot of control in scenes that could have erupted into melodrama....And then we enter the second half, and the film goes haywire...Still, given the general state of hero-oriented Tamil cinema, where a hollow kind of masculinity is endlessly celebrated, it‚Äôs nice to root for a hero who isn‚Äôt a slacker but a brilliant student, and who sits down with his pals for a cup of tea, rather than booze, and who gets rejected by a girl his mother sets him up with\\".Naan Sigappu Manidhan: A doze of action The Hindu Sify stated, \\"Thiru is able to make an engrossing actor driven entertainer without any super hero gimmicks.

After graduating from Rhodes University with her M.Sc degree in 1931, she worked at the Bolus Herbarium until 1947. Her primary research interests were focused on monocots, and her work impacted the Ornithogalum and Agapanthus. Leighton married fellow botanist William Edwyn Isaac in 1936, and the couple had three children. In the 1950s, Leighton was politically active in the Black Sash movement, protesting against Apartheid. After moving to Nairobi in 1961, she studied sea grasses along the East African coast. Leighton and her husband eventually retired to Mornington Peninsula in Australia, where Leighton became involved with community environmental movements and was elected an honorary botanist by the 'Society for the Protection of Indigenous Flora and Fauna of Australia'. Plants named in Leighton's honour include Delosperma leightoniae Lavis, Mesembryanthemum leightoniae L.Bolus, Lampranthus francesiae H.E.K.Hartmann, Bergeranthus leightoniae L.Bolus. Biography Frances was born in King William's Town and educated at Rhodes University between 1927 and 1931. She graduated with an M.Sc., subsequently joining the staff of the Bolus Herbarium in 1931 and remaining until 1947. Her primary interest was the monocots, leading to a revision of Ornithogalum (1944-5) and Agapanthus, and monographs published on the two taxa. At the Bolus Herbarium she met William Edwyn Isaac, a young Welsh botanist, whom she married in 1936 - a union that lasted until his death in 1995. William, a marine botanist, published \\"Marine biological research and the South African fishing industry\\" in 1943, and delivered his inaugural lecture, \\"Plants of the Sea\\", before the University of Cape Town in April 1955. The couple had three children - Rhys and Glynn, twin sons born in 1937, and a daughter in 1948. Rhys won the 1983 Pulitzer Prize for History for his book \\"The Transformation of Virginia, 1740-1790\\". Frances Leighton also taught at a school in South Africa. By the late 1950s she had become politically active and joined the Black Sash movement, one of the first white organisations to protest against Apartheid. Prof. William Edwyn Isaac during his Kenya daysIn 1961 the couple moved to Nairobi. William became the foundation professor of botany at the University of Nairobi on the eve of Kenya's independence, and wrote \\"Marine botany of the Kenya coast\\" in 1967. Frances embarked on a study of seagrasses of the East African coast, and volunteered to manage an adult-literacy and life-skills program for women, involving teaching in a hostel housing prostitutes. On retirement, and with two of their three children living in Australia, William and Frances followed and settled in Blairgowrie on the Mornington Peninsula, their home for the next 35 years. Frances became closely involved in the welfare of people in the area, and was given to informal lectures on the seagrass ecology of Port Phillip Bay and the dangers of alien species invading the Australian coastal scrub. She soon sought out other retired but active people, joined the 'Friends of the Rosebud Library Society' in Rosebud, Victoria, and later became its president. With another activist she started a neighbourhood environmental group aimed at maintaining country roads and planting indigenous species along the verges. She was elected honorary botanist within the 'Society for the Protection of Indigenous Flora and Fauna of Australia'. With the founding of the University of the Third Age, she became one of its staunchest supporters. She died in Blairgowrie, Victoria, aged 96.

It was designed with features resembling those of smartphones, such as a full-color touchscreen display and the ability to expand functionality by means of downloadable applications. It claims to be the world's smallest and thinnest CAS-enabled calculator currently available. The functionality of the HP Prime is also available as emulation software for PCs and Macs, as well as for various smartphones.  Design and software  The HP Prime's graphical user interface features two separate home screens, one of which contains an integrated computer algebra system (CAS) based on the free and open-source Xcas/Giac 1.4.9 engine, which evolved from that of the HP 49G and its successors. Both the standard and CAS modes function independently of each other and the calculator can quickly switch between the two, unlike some of its competitors, such as the TI-Nspire series by Texas Instruments, which comes in either CAS-supported models or non-CAS models. The G1 model calculator has a 1500 mAh battery, which is expected to last up to 15 hours on a single charge. The G2 model comes with a battery with a capacity of 2000 mAh. Exam Mode The HP Prime has a feature called Exam Mode. This enables various features of the calculator (such as CAS functionality, user-created apps, notes, etc.) to be selectively disabled for a specific time, from 15 minutes to 8 hours. This can be done manually within the calculator's menus, or by using a computer with HP's connectivity software. LEDs on the top of the calculator blink to let the instructor see that the calculator is in this mode. Despite this feature, the Prime is still prohibited in many examinations, such as the US's ACT college-entry test. It is however starting to be accepted in other examinations, like those run by the Dutch CvTE, the Swiss IB, or Alberta (Canada) education authorities. Programming The HP Prime's non-CAS home-screen supports textbook, algebraic and 128-level RPN (aka Advanced RPN) entry logic. However, it uses a new operating system unrelated to HP's legacy Saturn and Saturn-emulated systems, which were used on HP's previous RPN/RPL graphing calculators; therefore, it is not compatible with any User RPL or System RPL, or with programming in Saturn or ARM assembler language. The calculator supports programming in a new, Pascal-like programming language now named HP PPL (for Prime Programming Language, but originally also referred to as HP Basic) that also supports creating apps. This is based on a language introduced on the HP 38G and built on in subsequent models. Hardware revisions and model variants The first production model (NW280AA) in 2013 reports its hardware revision as A. This model does not support wireless connectivity, unit-to-unit USB communication, or data streaming. The calculator is manufactured by Inventec Besta and utilizes a modified version of their Besta operating system. The second production model (G8X92AA) reports its hardware revision as C. It was introduced in May 2014. This model supports features lacking in the first production model, namely wireless connectivity (using the HP Prime Wireless Kit (FOK65AA)), unit-to-unit USB communication (through USB OTG), and data streaming (using the HP StreamSmart 410 (NW278AA) 4-port data streamer). The wireless kit includes a base station connected to a PC and wireless modules to connect to up to 30 HP Prime calculators for use in a classroom. The third production model, which was introduced in August 2016, has a revised color scheme with darker blue and orange colors for an improved readability of the keyboard. It still carries the model number G8X92AA and reports a hardware revision of C, but the package shows a 2016 copyright. Introduced in July 2018, HP introduced a new hardware generation with model number 2AP18AA and hardware revision D. This version features an NXP i.MX 6ULL MCIMX6Y2 processor with ARM Cortex A7 core and is about three times faster. It provides more RAM (256 MB instead of 32 MB) and flash ROM (512 MB instead of 256 MB)https://fccid.io/R-REM-bta-HSTNJ-BC02 and runs FreeRTOS.

As the father of a queen of Navarre, and therefore, ancestor of many royal houses, Fernando was a distinguished member of the highest ranks of the nobility of the Kingdom of Le√≥n.  Biographical sketch  The firstborn of count Bermudo N√∫√±ez, he inherited many properties from his father and also from his uncle Oveco N√∫√±ez, Bishop of Le√≥n, and appears as Fredenando Vermudiz in a donation made on 28 August 945 by the bishop to the Monastery of Sahag√∫n. The relationship is also confirmed in a charter dated 984 when it mentions that this monastery had acquired a certain property from count Fernando Berm√∫dez that had previously belonged to the bishop. He spent his first years in Asturias where he had vast holdings, some of which had been donated by Queen Urraca, the widow of King Fruela II of Asturias, and by the Infantes Ramiro and Ordo√±o Froilaz, as attested in an inventory of various properties in Naptavlio that were probably given as compensation for his support of King Fruela and for having participated in the rebellion in 932 against King Ramiro II who forced Fernando to return two churches to the Cathedral of Oviedo. His relations with the crown improved during the reign of King Ordo√±o III.

Early life In the Millbank Hospital during an Air Raid, patients being taken to the shelter (1940) (Art.IWM ART LD 1598) London Docks, Building Caissons for Mulberry (1944) (Art.IWM ART LD 4039) Frances Macdonald was born in Wallasey, Cheshire, the younger of the two daughters of Francis Macdonald, a bank manager, and his wife Jessie. She trained at Wallasey School of Art between 1930 and 1934, before studying at the Royal College of Art until 1938. Whilst at the RCA Macdonald met her future husband, the artist Leonard Appelbee. World War II At the start of the Second World War, Macdonald intended to volunteer for nursing duties but was surprised to receive a war artist commission, given how recently she had been a student. Throughout the War Macdonald received a number of short-term contracts and commissions for individual pictures from the War Artists' Advisory Committee (WAAC), and the Recording Britain project that kept her employed as an artist throughout the conflict. Macdonalds commissions included both nursing scenes, which WAAC often allocated to women artists, and heavy industrial production and repair work. The first picture Macdonald submitted to WAAC, showing people in a shelter at Queen Alexandra Military Hospital at Millbank during an air raid was deemed unacceptable due to the evident fear and apprehension portrayed. A second hospital painting was accepted in January 1941 and a new depiction of the Millbank air raid was accepted in November 1941. When the QAM Hospital was evacuated to Oxford, Macdonald followed and was permitted to paint at the nearby aircraft dump at Cowley. This resulted in three paintings, one of which was declined by WAAC. During the war, other paintings by Macdonald were accepted by the Committee but were then prohibited from going on public display by wartime censorship, if for example they showed structures built after 1939. In September 1941, she returned to London to paint a cityscape showing St Paul's Cathedral. A painting by Macdonald of the cathedral surrounded by bombed streets was shown in America during the war but was lost when the ship returning it to Britain was torpedoed and sunk. Later commissions included the London Docks, aircraft repair shops and Bailey bridges plus a portrait of their inventor Donald Bailey. In all, nineteen works by Macdonald were acquired by WAAC, including Building the Mulberry Harbour, London Docks (1944) which was requested by the Tate for its permanent collection at the end of the war. The Imperial War Museum also has a number of works by Macdonald. Later life 43 Repair Group Air Frame Repair Services, Lincoln, repairing Liberator aircraft (1945) (Art.IWM ART LD 5509) After the war, Macdonald had her first solo exhibition at the Wildenstein Gallery in 1947. She produced watercolours for Londoner's England in 1947, wrote an illustrated essay for Flowers of Cities in 1949, and made drawings of the South Bank for the London County Council prior to the Festival of Britain. In 1951, the Arts Council commissioned a large landscape painting from Macdonald for the exhibition 60 Paintings for '51, which was part of the Festival of Britain celebrations in London. Macdonald produced a painting of Penrhyn Quarry, entitled The Welsh Singer, whilst Leonard Appelbee contributed the painting One-man Band to the same exhibition. Macdonald taught at Goldsmiths College of Art between 1946 and 1948, took a weekly still life class at Beckenham from 1957 until 1969 and also taught at both the Byan Shaw School and the Ruskin School of Drawing. As well as teaching art, Macdonald also exhibited at the Alfred Brod Gallery in 1961. In 1989 Francis and Leonard moved from the West Country to Kincardine-on-Forth and then to Aberdeen, to be near their only daughter, Jane. Leonard died in 2000, two years before Francis.

As of July 2015, Port Bonython Fuels is under construction, the desalination plant has been deferred and the iron ore export wharf is yet to receive necessary state and federal environmental approvals. Industrialization plans near Point Lowly have been met with public opposition from several community groups based in nearby Whyalla. Groups include Save Point Lowly,Ooi, Esther \\"The Point Lowly desal plant that's got SA squabbling\\" Crikey, Australia (2011-05-23). Retrieved 2014-03-24. the Cuttlefish Coast Coalition and the Alternative Port Working Party.Moscaritolo, Maria \\"Port plan is compromised: Engineers\\" The Advertiser, South Australia (2011-09-20). Their concerns relate to the cumulative impacts of these developments which could displace or deter other users and degrade the peninsula's environmental and social value. Point Lowly was first made accessible by road from Whyalla in 1948. It was previously accessible by a rough track. Shack sites were made available in the late 1940s, with three applications received by 19 December 1947. Landforms  The Point Lowly peninsula is a low plateau, sloping NW - SE, in the Simmens quartzite member, of the Neoprotorozoic Tent Hill formation. The southern shore of the peninsula features 20 metre high bluffs over sloping shore platforms and small beaches. The bluffs and cliffs of the eastern side of the peninsula slope down to pebble beaches with some sand at high tide. To the north, Fitzgerald Bay acts as a sand trap, shown by the storage of Holocene sands in wide nearshore low tide sandflats. Small areas of sand ridges exist at the head of the bay, where Holocene sand grit has been mixed with the Pleistocene red sands from the Gulf floor. The beach here is narrow high tide reflective in morpho-dynamic terms. Volcanics are exposed in cliffs and platforms at Backy Point. Small areas of sand dune are found near Point Lowly and at Weeroona Bay. At the Weroona Bay dunes backshore low cobble ridges occur, possibly formerly covered by white Holocene sands that are now immediately inland. No dating is available for these deposits; however, further north in the Gulf similar deposits are Pleistocene in age.Eyre Peninsula Natural Resource Management Board \\"Eyre Peninsula Coastal Action Plan, Volume 2\\" Retrieved 2013-11-06.

The park was built by Tien Suharto, former first lady and wife of Suharto. Javanisation (Commonwealth spelling) or Javanization (North American and Oxford spelling) is the process in which Javanese culture dominates, assimilates, or influences other cultures in general (). The term \\"Javanise\\" means \\"to make or to become Javanese in form, idiom, style, or character.\\" This domination could take place in various aspects; such as cultural, language, politics and social. In its modern sense within Indonesian social, cultural and politics perspective; Javanisation simply means the spreading of rural Javanese population of densely populated Java to less populated parts of the archipelago.See Transmigration program of Indonesia, the government policy to resettles the poor Javanese to outer parts of Indonesia are generally not welcomed by native populations, especially when the newcomers threaten to become the majority there. While to others it could also mean the conscious or unconscious imposition of Javanese patterns of thought and behaviour throughout Indonesia, in the sense of cultural imperialism. In previous sense it is more focused on thinking and practice of those in power. The term \\"Javanise\\" or \\"Javanize\\" however, is not only to describe outward process, but also inward; it is also used to describes the adoption and assimilation of foreign social-cultural influences and elements into Javanese culture. These foreign influences are somehow are interpreted and adopted to suit Javanese frame of reference, style, needs and social-cultural conditions. The adoption of Indian Hindu epics and cultural elements in 5th to 15th-century Java and the adoption of Islam introduced by Wali Songo into Javanese culture in 15th-century are the notable examples. The promotion and expansion of Javanese cultural elements, such as Javanese language, architecture, cuisine, batik, wayang, gamelan and kris are also can be seen as the manifestation of Javanisation process. The Javanese migration to settle in places out of their traditional homeland in Central and East Java to other places in Indonesia (Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Papua, etc.), Malay peninsula (esp. Johor), to Suriname, is also a contributing factor of Javanisation process. Manifestation Javanese cultural expressions, such as wayang and gamelan are often used to promote Javanese culture. This Javanese cultural hegemony or domination could take form in various aspects. Such as physical through the expansions and settlements of Javanese diaspora outside their traditional homeland in Java. In spiritual and behavioural aspects, the Javanisation process includes the promotion of Javanese culture and values; such as obsession with elegance and refinements (Javanese: alus), subtleness, politeness, courtesy, indirectness, emotional restraint and consciousness to one's social stature. Javanese values harmony and social order highly, and abhorred direct conflicts and disagreements. These Javanese values were often promoted through Javanese cultural expressions, such as Javanese dance, gamelan, wayang and batik as national culture of Indonesia. It also being reinforced through adherence to Javanese adat (traditional rules) in ceremonies, such as Slametan, Satu Suro, Javanese wedding and Naloni Mitoni. In the language aspect, such as the using of Javanese terms, idioms, and vocabularies outside of traditional Javanese language realm. For example, today it is commons for Indonesians to use Javanese terms to address people across Indonesia, such as \\"Mas\\" (to address the same of age or slightly older male) or \\"Mbak\\" (for female counterparts). It is common in national capital Jakarta; however, this phenomenon has somewhat alarmed the Malay and Minangkabau-speaking realms in Sumatra that considered it as a form of Javanisation and cultural imperialism. In social and politics, the examples of perceived Javanisation such as numbers of Indonesian Presidents are always Javanese (even B. J. Habibie who is maternally Javanese ‚Äî and Javanese kinship is bilineal). Also the alleged Javanese political dominance in government administrations, civil service, military and police, as well as Javanese traits in Indonesian political culture. Early history The expansion of Majapahit empire circa 14th century The island of Java has been a centre stage of Indonesian history for centuries, and Javanese people as the largest ethnic groups in Indonesia have been dominating the politics and social landscapes in the past as well as modern Indonesia. In its early stages, Javanese culture was heavily influenced by Indian Hindu-Buddhist civilisation. The example of this process is the adoption of many Sanskrit loanwords into old Javanese, and the Javanisation of Indian Hindu epics such as Ramayana and Mahabharata into Javanese version, and incorporating local deities such as Semar and Punakawan into their Wayang Purwa stories. The process of adopting Hindu influences is described as the Sanskritisation of Java and the Javanisation of the Bharata. The blossoming of Javanese classical literature for example are the composing of Kakawin Ramayana and Arjunawiwaha. The early examples of Javanisation is the expansion of Javanese Sailendran arts ‚Äî developed in 8th to 9th-century Central Java ‚Äî that influences the aesthetics of Srivijayan Buddhist arts discovered in Sumatra and Southern Thailand Malay peninsula. Despite absorbing Indian influences from Gupta and Amaravati arts, to Southern India Pallava influences, Javanese Sailendran art in return influenced the art and aesthethic of the Southeast Asian region. The early classical period, during Eastern Java Medang kingdom in the 10th century, saw the expansion of Javanese influence to Bali. East Javanese princess Mahendradatta become the queen consort of King Udayana Warmadewa of Bali, signify the Javanese increasing influences upon Bali. During the reign of Airlangga, Bali pretty much become parts of East Javanese Hindu kingdom realm. The expansion of Singhasari kingdom in the 13th century during the reign of Kertanegara strengthened the Javanese influence in the region, especially upon Bali and Melayu Kingdom in Eastern coast of Sumatra, through Pamalayu expedition. In 1200 CE, Mpu Jatmika from Java established the Hindu Kingdom of Negara Dipa by the river of Tapin; this was the start of the Javanese-style courts in South Kalimantan. Followed by the expansion of Majapahit empire circa 14th-century, the archipelago saw again the Javanese expansion. It was probably during this period that some of Javanese cultural elements, such as gamelan and kris, being expanded and introduced to islands outside of Java; such as Sumatra, Malay peninsula and Borneo. It was during this era that the town Banjarmasin in South Kalimantan and Sukadana in West Kalimantan has been established as Javanese colony as the vassal of Majapahit. In 1400 CE, Negara Dipa was succeeded by the Hindu Kingdom of Negara Daha. The Javanese influences can be seen on Banjar people art, culture, and costumes that demonstrated Javanese styles. It was also during the last period of Majapahit in the 15th century that the native Austronesian elements of pre Hindu-Javanese style were revived, as demonstrated in Sukuh and Cetho temples. The stiffer wayang style figures of statues and bas reliefs, and the stepped pyramid temple structure replaced the classic towering Hindu temples. This reverse of Indianized process is also called the \\"Javanisation\\" of Hindu-Buddhist prototypes in Javanese art. Later history The Javanese diaspora such as those to Suriname in Dutch colonial period also contributed to the spread of Javanese culture. After the fall of Majapahit, Demak Sultanate replace its hegemony in Southern Sumatra by appointing Javanese regent to rule Palembang. In the early 17th century, the Sultanate of Palembang was established by Ki Gede ing Suro, a Javanese nobleman fleeing the Demak court intrique after the death of Trenggana Sultan of Demak. The Sultanate of Palembang are known as the combination of various cultures; Malay, Javanese, Islamic and Chinese. The Javanisation process of Palembang Sultanate court is evident in the adoption of Javanese words and vocabularies into local Malay Palembang dialect, such as wong (people) and banyu (water). During the ambitious Sultan Agung's reign of Mataram Sultanate in the first half of the 17th century, Javanese culture again expanded, much of Western and East Java region are being Javanised. Mataram's campaign on Eastern Javanese principalities such as Surabaya and Pasuruan expanded Mataraman influences on Java. Mataram expansion includes Sundanese principalities of Priangan highlands; from Galuh Ciamis, Sumedang, Bandung and Cianjur. It was during this period that Sundanese people were exposed and assimilated further into Javanese Kejawen culture. Wayang Golek are Sundanese taking on Javanese Wayang Kulit culture, similar shared culture such as gamelan and batik also flourished. It is probably during this times that Sundanese language began to adopt the stratified degree of term and vocabulary to denote politeness, as reflected in Javanese language. In addition, Javanese scripts also used to write Sundanese as cacarakan. Foreign influences and ideas such as religions and beliefs are sometimes consciously and deliberately undergone changes and adaptations, being \\"Javanised\\" to be accepted by popular Javanese audiences. The examples such as the process that took place in the 15th century dubbed as \\"the Islamisation of Java and the Javanisation of Islam.\\" The Wali Songos such as Sunan Kalijaga are known to use Javanese cultural expressions such as gamelan and wayang to promote and spread Islamic faith. Wayang sadat is a variant of wayang that used to in tabligh and da'wah to spread Islamic messages. Another example Javanisation of Islam in Java is the construction of tajug pyramidal multi-tiered roof of Javanese mosque. Javanese mosque did not applied dome, minaret, brick or stone masonry, but instead adopted wood carpentry of pendopo and meru-like roofs derived from previous pre-Islamic art and architecture of Java. The example of this kinds of mosque are Demak Great Mosque and Yogyakarta Grand Mosque. File:DSC00253 Java Bromo Temple Indou Laotian Pasir (6226529310).jpgA Hindu temple Pura Poten, Bromo.

File:Ganjuran Church, exterior 01.jpgGanjuran Church in Bantul, built in traditional Javanese architecture. Catholics faith for examples are also using Javanese vocabularies and frame of reference by using the term \\"Romo\\" (Javanese: father) for \\"father\\" to refer to Catholic priest. Catholic proselytising efforts also used traditional wayang art to spread their message; the wayang wahyu used to perform the biblical story and Christianity. In architecture, Catholicism also adopted Javanese style and architecture for their church, such as the Ganjuran Church in Bantul, Yogyakarta, that constructed the shrine of Jesus in ancient Javanese candi architecture. Another example includes Pohsarang Church in Kediri that built in traditional Javanese architecture. During colonial Dutch East Indies period, numbers of Javanese are migrated to Suriname as plantation workers. Within the archipelago, Javanese are also migrate to several places such as Sumatra, Kalimantan and Johor in Malay peninsula. Regions such as northern West Java, Lampung and South Kalimantan are known to have large numbers of Javanese settlers. Modern history Javanese cultural identity were reinforced through traditional ceremonies, such as Javanese wedding After the Indonesian revolution (1945-1949) and the independence of Indonesia, many of Indonesian national symbols are derived from its Majapahit legacy, an empire that centred in Java in 14th to 15th century. Indonesian flag displayed Majapahit colours, the national motto Bhinneka Tunggal Ika and the state ideology Pancasila also demonstrates its Majapahit legacy. Indonesian founding fathers, especially Sukarno did dig into Indonesian past of indigenous wisdom and philosophy to formulate the new nationhood of Indonesia. Naturally Javanese culture as one of the most influential major element in Indonesian culture contributed its share of influences. During Suharto's New Order regime (1966-1998), the political culture of Indonesia is somewhat perceived as being Javanised. The administration levels were also arranged in Javanese styles and idioms, such as Kabupaten and desa, the terms that originally not familiar in some of Indonesian provinces, such as West Sumatra and West Papua. In this post-independence Indonesia sense, the term \\"Javanisation\\" is used to describe the process whereby ethnic Javanese and Javanised individuals gradually became the overwhelming and disproportionate majority of the governing elite in the Indonesian post-independence era. Criticism Suharto and wife, Tien, in traditional Javanese attire. His authoritarian New Order regime has been criticised as \\"Javanising\\" Indonesian politics. The issue of Javanisation has been a sensitive and critical issues in Indonesian national building and national unity. The Javanese domination is regarded not only on the realm of culture, but also social, politics and economy. The Suharto's New Order regime is criticised as has Javanised Indonesian politics during decades of his rules. In politics, administration, authority and civil service perspective, this Javanisation is sometimes perceived negatively as it contains the worst elements of Javanese culture, such as rigidity of social hierarchy, authoritarianism and arbitrariness. A development that sometimes called as \\"Mataramisation\\" and \\"feudalisation\\", accompanied by fondness of status display and arrogance. A typical negative description of priyayi behaving like the member of Javanese upper class. The Transmigration program that relocate people from densely populated Java to other Indonesian islands, such as Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, and Indonesian New Guinea, is also criticised has accelerated and promoted the Javanisation process of Indonesia. The issue also fuels with development disparity issues, where other islands are dissatisfied with the development and social welfare in their region, in contrast with infrastructure development and wealth distribution that seems to be in favour and focused on Java. However today in the era of local autonomy, it is not relevant to connect the transmigration program to Javanisation issues, because the migration process is also conducted internally within Java, or within certain provinces. For example, in Eastern Indonesia such as in Maluku and Papua, the majority of the non-native settlers are from Sulawesi (Bugis-Makassar and Buton) and Maluku itself, and not from Java. The transmigration should carefully examine economic potential, as well as social and cultural impact of the area. It is also based on the fact that the provinces which open themselves to pluralism and accept inter-province settlers and migrations are usually developing more rapidly compared to those that isolate themselves. It is also important to note, that Java itself has attracted perantau (migrant settlers) and workers from all over the Indonesian archipelago, and subsequently the demographics of Java is not homogenous.

This is achieved through the use of one or more hormones. Methods to improve our ability to synchronize the reproductive process and result in the ‚Äòtimed insemination‚Äô without the detection of heat have been developed.

Safety of a progesterone-releasing intravaginal device as assessed from vaginal mucosal integrity and indicators of systemic inflammation in postpartum dairy cows. Canadian Journal of Veterinary Research, 72 (1), p. 43 The PRID is a sponge that is inserted into the vagina of a cow to stop the natural estrous cycle (for it acts as a corpus luteum), because progesterone is the hormone that signals the body to stop the cycle because fertilisation has occurred. When the sponge is removed the cycle restarts. This apparatus is useful in manipulating the cycle so that multiple cows can be ovulated around the same time. Other methods use injections of GnRH or PGF2a at certain points over the course of a few weeks to simulate the body‚Äôs natural production of these compounds. This is a more exact but time consuming way to manipulate the cycle of multiple cows to sync up the timing of A.I. Nebel, Ray; M. DeJarnette. Dairy Cow Synchronization Protocols (2017). Select Reproductive Solutions. Estrus synchronisation has major advantages in making artificial insemination more practical. Increasing the productivity of embryo transfer and artificial insemination is economically profitable as the costs associated with veterinarian and semen services are reduced. The reduction of costs occur because vets are required for less time to do the inseminating because the period of ovulation of the herd is decreased to 2-5 days. There are many different injection methods that have been put into practise in order to manipulate the estrous cycle. These involve injections into each cow with a measured amount of progesterone or progestin and waiting 5-7 days, or until heat signals occur, before moving onto different impregnating methods such as joining the cows or heifers with a bull. Agricultural applications Milk is a product of great demand all year round. As a result of this demand, farmers have been given an incentive to produce milk during winter months. In order to achieve this public demand for milk, dairy farmers needed to change their breeding routines. estrous synchronization enabled this change in the herd‚Äôs breeding routine to allow dairy farmers to produce milk for human consumption year round. Case studies for the productivity of these incentives on dairy farms have shown to have positive results.Dpi.vic.gov.au. 2013. Farmer Case Studies - Department of Environment and Primary Industries.

Oestrus synchronisation has proven to have many advantages in the dairy and beef industries. The application of estrous synchronisation enables the farmer to reduce costs involved in the hire of AI technicians and semen import.

However, there are also disadvantages with estrous synchronisation. It requires a high level of management and skills to be able to manage numerous calving operations at a synchronised time. Furthermore, maintaining nutrition and herd health are major factors when it comes to the achieving optimum reproductive performance through estrous synchronisation.Dejarnette, M. 2004.

From the junction of these two highways, the route was paved eastward into Almonte already, but remained a gravel road elsewhere. On November 9, 1965, the new Carp Bypass ‚Äì a portion of Highway 17 designed to replace the old meandering route (now known as Donald B. Munro Drive) through Carp, Marathon and Antrim ‚Äì opened. As a result, the eastern end of Highway 44 was truncated by approximately to the new bypass Highway 44 remained generally unchanged until March 31, 1997, when the entire route was decommissioned and transferred to Lanark County and the Regional Municipality of Ottawa‚ÄìCarleton, which later became the City of Ottawa. It has since been known as Lanark County Road 49 and Ottawa Road 49.

A set of similar patches to Busybox were also created. SMACK does not require user-space support. Criticism Smack has been criticized for being written as a new LSM module instead of an SELinux security policy which can provide equivalent functionality. Such SELinux policies have been proposed, but none had been demonstrated.

Plot Major Bulochkin, senior lieutenant Tucha and captain Kaisarov - three pilots, officers and best friends - vow not to fall in love until the war ends. But their plans are ruined after they encounter a female aviation squadron and a pretty journalist Valya Petrova. They start to give up one after another. At the same time, major Vasily Bulochkin - a flying ace - is trying to adapt to his \\"new\\" machine (an old-fashioned and very slow biplane U-2) given to him after a serious injury. Facts In 1944 Joseph Stalin ordered the production a lighthearted war comedy. The film was shot in 1944-1945 (while the war was still going on) and shown in theaters on April 1, 1946 to great success. It was the first Soviet post-war comedy. Filming began near Leningrad, right after the end of the Leningrad Blockade. At the start of the movie one can see the original Yelagin Palace ruined during bombing (it was later rebuilt). In the film Vasily Bulochkin (played by Nikolai Kryuchkov) falls in love with Valya Petrova (played by Alla Parfanyak). After the end of shooting the actor Nikolai Kryuchkov also divorced his first wife and married Alla Parfanyak. They lived together for 12 years. In the dance scene female parts are performed by professional dancers from the youth war ensemble headed by Arkady Obrant. The ensemble gave around 3000 performances during the war, both at the front line and in the cities, including Leningrad during the blockade. In 1970 the film was \\"restored\\". As with many other films of the Stalinist era, it was redubbed (mostly by the same actors, although Ranevskay's part was given to a different actress with a different voice) and censored. About 10 minutes were cut out from the original film, including the scene where Soviet newspaper Pionerskaya Pravda is compared to The Times. In 2012 the film went through colorization. It was also fully restored - this time with original scenes and voices.

Parallel trading in Hong Kong is the phenomenon of China parallel traders taking advantage of multiple entry visa policy to import goods from Hong Kong to Mainland China, causing shortages of household goods in various locations starting in the North District and expanding to Tuen Mun, Yuen Long, Tai Po and Shatin. Problems related to this include increasing congestion from day traders, overloading of infrastructure and disruption of the everyday lives of residents in northern districts of Hong Kong. Demand for significant volumes of daily necessities favoured by Shenzhen residents has progressively squeezed out those catering to local needs, and caused rent inflation and shortage of certain goods such as infant formula. Situation Visitors from mainland China have risen from 2.3 million in 1997, to nearly 41 million in 2012 and 53 million in 2013.https://www.bbc.com/news/business-28093730 Since 2012, the problem of parallel trading in Hong Kong became more serious. Media reported that 95% of multi-entrance travellers were Chinese parallel traders. The Shenzhen customs department reported in 2015 that of 33,000 arrests made for trafficking parallel goods across the border since 2010, 80 percent were Hong Kong residents.Lau, Kenneth (February 18, 2015). \\"Parallel trade-linked units shut down\\" . The Standard. Zhang Xiaoming, Director of the CGLO in Hong Kong, was satisfied overall with the implementation of the Individual Visit Scheme, and said the problem of parallel trading should not be exaggerated for political reasons. Zhang asserted that 60 percent of parallel traders were Hong Kong residents, and Shenzhen residents on multiple-entry permits accounted for the remainder.http://www.ejinsight.com/20150309-mainlanders- angry-at-lack-of-welcome-in-hk/ Through multi-entrancing within a day, separating goods into small boxes, exchanging goods in and out between the gates of the MTR station exporting goods to China, parallel traders earn 'transporting charges' by claiming themselves as travellers and their products are for self-use, saving the cost of tax. Traders mainly gather in Sheung Shui Station Exit C and the platform as trading centres to pass on goods to buyers in China. They linger thus causing serious blockage and crowding in the station. Targeting the problem, MTR hired hundreds of staff, erected barriers and gates in attempt to control the situation. Station staff claimed that traders behaved negatively towards them. Although the MTR and the police had enhanced the enforcement of law, traders persisted. Some of the traders break down washing machines into pieces in an attempt to pass the inspection of the staff and policemen. Others forcefully broke through the blockades of MTR staff and police. Causes There were several reasons behind the parallel trading in Hong Kong. First, the strength of the Renminbi against the Hong Kong dollar and the absence of taxes and duties in Hong Kong make goods and everyday commodities more attractive to China consumers. Secondly, the multiple entry visa policy allows visa holders crossing the Hong Kong-China border many times with one application, so that they can export goods from Hong Kong frequently. Due to the prevalence of counterfeiting in China, Hong Kong-sourced products and daily necessities are preferred for their perceived quality and demand for Hong Kong goods is insatiable. Parallel traders who profit by buying goods locally and reselling them in the China push up the local prices.Ma, Mary (10 February 2015). \\"Parallel lines of concern need fixing\\". The Standard Effects=Milk powder shortage Notice of restriction of powdered formula allowance at the Guangzhou-Kowloon Through Train departure concourse of Hung Hom Station in 2013. Despite the increasing importation of infant formula (powdered formula) from foreign countries, the milk powder shortage intensified greatly due to the intense parallel trading activity in Hong Kong. According to the Neo Democrats, during January 2013, parallel traders hired elderly persons and housewives, giving them $20‚Äì$50 per can of milk formula, to line up in front of stores at night to purchase many tins of milk powder and then transfer it to traders.HK Limits Milk Powder Purchases Furthermore, ringleader traders hired women with children and the elderly to help them to transport the milk powder across the border to avoid being inspected. According to a staff member in a chain pharmacy, although the store limited each customer to purchasing no more than four cans of milk formula at once, shopkeepers who wanted to meet sales targets often sold more than four cans to mainlanders. Also, there were stores that only sold formula to mainlanders, causing a serious shortage of milk formula for local consumers. Inflation Parallel trade activities have redistributed supplies of a lot of goods between Hong Kong and the mainland, increasing prices of the goods, for example, milk powder prices increased by 0.4 ‚Äì 12% from 2009 to 2011. Apart from milk powder, prices of daily necessities in the New Territories also increased. Due to the appreciation of Renminbi against Hong Kong dollar, branded goods sold in Hong Kong which are denominated in Hong Kong dollars gave rise to big discounts for mainlanders who settle bills in Renminbi. Also, the Hong Kong government does not levy any custom tariff on both imports and exports of most products. Therefore, Hong Kong goods are cheaper compared to those in China. Moreover, competition for shop space to open pharmacies, cosmetics and jewellery shops to support parallel trade in the New Territories has driven rent in the New Territories up by two to three times from 2010 to 2012. Small shops catering to local needs are forced to close down and residents have fewer choices. Regional prices rise and increase residents' cost of living. Social disturbance North District of Hong Kong is the hub for parallel trading activities. Crowding of smugglers together with the large amount of commodities and garbage blocked pedestrians, causing environmental problems and endangering the safety of children and the elderly, negatively affecting daily life of citizens in the community. According to a survey done by New Start () on 27 January 2013, among the 500 Northern District citizens interviewed, 100% of them were discontented with the Government on the issuance of multiple-entry permit. 57% and 72% of the interviewees believe the government was ignoring public grievance and were planning on moving away from gathering areas of parallel traders respectively. Intensification of Hong Kong-Mainland conflict Parallel trading problem marked the penetration of Hong Kong‚ÄìMainland conflict from cultural aspect to livelihood aspect. As parallel traders carried large quantities of products, treating Sheung Shui MTR Station as a transaction centre that disturbed the livelihood of residence nearby, discontent among Hong Kong citizens towards Mainland parallel traders surged. Furthermore, since parallel trading worsened inflation and caused serious milk powder shortage problems, Hong Kong citizens regard Mainlanders as resource marauders. Videos and songs portraying Mainlanders as locust were created to express the discontent of Hong Kong people. The conflict between the two regions was intensified. Citizens' response \\"Reclaim Sheung Shui\\" protest in 2012. Netizens formed 'North District Parallel Imports Concern Group' on Facebook to monitor the government on solving the problem of parallel trading and advocate law enforcements against the parallel trading problem. When government officers claim the problem has been relieved, members of the group upload photos to social network, contradicting the claim made by governmental officials. Besides, Hong Kong citizens started the \\"Reclaim Sheung Shui\\" campaign in September 2012 to expressing their discontent toward parallel trades in Sheung Shui. About 100 Northern District residents gathered outside Sheung Shui Station and protested with slogans and banners.Luk, Eddie (September 21, 2012). \\"Seeing red (white and blue)\\" .

Yahoo!News by NOW TV News, 15 September 2012. Some even bounded outside chained pharmacies to express their discontent as these shops stock up milk powder for sale to mainlanders at higher prices. On 1 February 2015, an arsonist targeted a warehouse that was used by suppliers to parallel traders in Sheung Shui.\\"Sheung Shui arson arrests\\" .

The Standard The protesters then adjourned to Tsim Sha Tsui at around 9 pm. A total of six individuals were arrested that day. Government's response Parallel traders inspected by Hong Kong police in Sheung Shui. Responding to the parallel trading activities, The Hong Kong Immigration Department and the Police had jointly mounted anti parallel trading and employment operations on 19 September 2012 and 22 January 2013, codenamed Windsand () and Realpower () respectively. Hong Kong had taken action against parallel trading activities together with Shenzhen. From September to November 2012, the Hong Kong Immigration Department, the Customs and Excise Department and the Police Force had arrested 406 people in total, within which 60 had been convicted.

It is part of the collection of the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, London. The work was commissioned by Joseph Banks and based on the inflated skin of an animal he had collected from the east coast of Australia in 1770 during Lieutenant James Cook's first voyage of discovery. It depicts the animal sitting on a rock and looking over its shoulder with a backdrop of trees and mountains. The two were the only two paintings that Stubbs did not draw from a live subject. It was first exhibited by the Society of Artists in London in 1773 together with his painting of the dingo, Portrait of a Large Dog. Subsequent exhibitions were held at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool in 1951 and the Whitechapel Art Gallery in 1957. The painting has also been on view in recent years at Parham House in Sussex during public openings.

It is part of the collection of the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, London. The painting and The Kongouro from New Holland were the first Western paintings of Australian mammals and, in fact, the first time most Europeans had ever seen these living creatures. The oil painting was commissioned by Joseph Banks based on his observations of dingoes on the east coast of Australia in 1770 during Lieutenant James Cook's first voyage of discovery. No specimen was collected for use as a subject, unlike its companion painting The Kongouro from New Holland, and it is seen as a fairly general depiction of a dingo, soon superseded by more accurate depictions in 1789. The two works were the only paintings that Stubbs, highly regarded in the genre, did not draw from a live subject, although it is one of the few oil paintings to present a scientific specimen.

It is found in the western Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea where it makes its home among floating mats of Sargassum seaweed. It was named in honour of the American naturalist Thomas Say. Description Portunus sayi grows to a length of about . Its smooth, shiny carapace is nearly twice as broad as it is long and has six frontal teeth on each side. The chelipeds (claws) are larger in males than in females and the spines they bear have orange margins. The carapace, claws and legs are usually pale brown with large white or flesh-coloured blotches but the brown colour may have a purplish or greenish tinge. This crab, like other members of its family, is specially adapted for swimming rather than walking as its fourth pair of legs are modified with flattened, paddle-like surfaces. It swims sideways rather than forwards and can move surprisingly swiftly. Distribution Portunus sayi occurs in the western Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. Its range extends from Nova Scotia and the Gulf of Maine to southern Florida, Bermuda, the Bahamas and the Gulf of Mexico. It is found at depths down to about . Behaviour Portunus sayi is a swimming crab that lives among the tangled masses of Sargassum, a type of brown seaweed that floats in the Sargasso Sea. It is part of a community inhabiting these floating masses which includes fish, nudibranchs, crustaceans, hydroids, bryozoans and polychaete worms. Its colouring provides camouflage among the fronds of seaweed through which it hunts or lies in wait to ambush small items of prey. It has been shown that the crab chooses Sargassum spp. over similar seaweeds such as Thalassia testudinum by detecting chemical cues in the water. This crab has also been found as an epibiont of loggerhead turtles along with the goose barnacles Lepas anatifera and Conchoderma virgatum, various other crabs, sea spiders, tunicates and hydroids. This is not surprising as young loggerhead turtles live among the floating mats of Sargassum algae feeding on the fauna found there.

Moment measures generalize the idea of factorial moments, which are useful for studying non-negative integer-valued random variables.D. J. Daley and D. Vere- Jones. An introduction to the theory of point processes. Vol. I. Probability and its Applications (New York). Springer, New York, second edition, 2003. The first factorial moment measure of a point process coincides with its first moment measure or intensity measure, which gives the expected or average number of points of the point process located in some region of space. In general, if the number of points in some region is considered as a random variable, then the moment factorial measure of this region is the factorial moment of this random variable.D. Stoyan, W. S. Kendall, J. Mecke, and L. Ruschendorf. Stochastic geometry and its applications, volume 2. Wiley Chichester, 1995. Factorial moment measures completely characterize a wide class of point processes, which means they can be used to uniquely identify a point process. If a factorial moment measure is absolutely continuous, then with respect to the Lebesgue measure it is said to have a density (which is a generalized form of a derivative), and this density is known by a number of names such as factorial moment density and product density, as well as coincidence density, joint intensity , correlation function or multivariate frequency spectrumK.

Probability and its Applications (New York). Springer, New York, second edition, 2008 as well as the related fields of stochastic geometry and spatial statistics, which are applied in various scientific and engineering disciplines such as biology, geology, physics, and telecommunications. Point process notation Point processes are mathematical objects that are defined on some underlying mathematical space. Since these processes are often used to represent collections of points randomly scattered in space, time or both, the underlying space is usually d-dimensional Euclidean space denoted here by Rd, but they can be defined on more abstract mathematical spaces. Point processes have a number of interpretations, which is reflected by the various types of point process notation.F. Baccelli and B. B≈Çaszczyszyn. Stochastic Geometry and Wireless Networks, Volume II ‚Äì Applications, volume 4, No 1‚Äì2 of Foundations and Trends in Networking. NoW Publishers, 2009. For example, if a point \\\\textstyle x belongs to or is a member of a point process, denoted by N, then this can be written as: : \\\\textstyle x\\\\in {N}, and represents the point process being interpreted as a random set. Alternatively, the number of points of N located in some Borel set B is often written as: : \\\\textstyle {N}(B), which reflects a random measure interpretation for point processes. These two notations are often used in parallel or interchangeably. Definitions=n th factorial power of a point process For some positive integer \\\\textstyle n=1,2,\\\\ldots, the \\\\textstyle n-th factorial power of a point process \\\\textstyle {N} on \\\\textstyle \\\\textbf{R}^d is defined as: : {N}^{(n)}(B_1\\\\times\\\\cdots\\\\times B_n)= \\\\sum_{(x_1 eq\\\\dots eq x_n)\\\\in {N} } \\\\prod_{i=1}^n \\\\mathbf{1}_{B_i}(x_i) where \\\\textstyle B_1,...,B_n is a collection of not necessarily disjoint Borel sets in \\\\textstyle \\\\textbf{R}^d, which form an \\\\textstyle n-fold Cartesian product of sets denoted by: : B_1\\\\times\\\\cdots\\\\times B_n. The symbol \\\\textstyle \\\\mathbf{1} denotes an indicator function such that \\\\textstyle \\\\mathbf{1}_{B_1} is a Dirac measure for the set \\\\textstyle B_n. The summation in the above expression is performed over all \\\\textstyle n-tuples of distinct points, including permutations, which can be contrasted with the definition of the n-th power of a point process. The symbol \\\\textstyle \\\\Pi denotes multiplication while the existence of various point process notation means that the n-th factorial power of a point process is sometimes defined using other notation. n th factorial moment measure The n th factorial moment measure or n th order factorial moment measure is defined as: : M^{(n)}(B_1\\\\times\\\\cdots\\\\times B_n)=E [{N}^{(n)}(B_1\\\\times\\\\cdots\\\\times B_n)], where the E denotes the expectation (operator) of the point process N. In other words, the n-th factorial moment measure is the expectation of the n th factorial power of some point process. The n th factorial moment measure of a point process N is equivalently defined by: : \\\\int_{\\\\textbf{R}^{n d}}f(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n) M^{(n)}(dx_1,\\\\ldots,dx_n)=E \\\\left[ \\\\sum_{(x_1 eq\\\\cdots eq x_n)\\\\in {N} } f(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n) \\\\right], where f is any non-negative measurable function on \\\\textbf{R}^{n d}, and the above summation is performed over all n tuples of distinct points, including permutations. Consequently, the factorial moment measure is defined such that there are no points repeating in the product set, as opposed to the moment measure. First factorial moment measure The first factorial moment measure \\\\textstyle M^1 coincides with the first moment measure: : M^{(1)}(B)=M^1(B)=E [{N}(B)], where \\\\textstyle M^1 is known, among other terms, as the intensity measure or mean measure,J. F. C. Kingman. Poisson processes, volume 3. Oxford university press, 1992. and is interpreted as the expected number of points of \\\\textstyle {N} found or located in the set \\\\textstyle B Second factorial moment measure The second factorial moment measure for two Borel sets \\\\textstyle A and \\\\textstyle B is: : M^{(2)}(A\\\\times B)=M^2(A\\\\times B)-M^1(A\\\\cap B). Name explanation For some Borel set \\\\textstyle B, the namesake of this measure is revealed when the \\\\textstyle n\\\\,th factorial moment measure reduces to: : M^{(n)}(B\\\\times\\\\cdots\\\\times B)=E [{N}(B)({N}(B)-1)\\\\cdots ({N}(B)-n+1)], which is the \\\\textstyle n\\\\,-th factorial moment of the random variable \\\\textstyle {N}(B). Factorial moment density If a factorial moment measure is absolutely continuous, then it has a density (or more precisely, a Radon‚ÄìNikodym derivative or density) with respect to the Lebesgue measure and this density is known as the factorial moment density or product density, joint intensity, correlation function, or multivariate frequency spectrum. Denoting the \\\\textstyle n-th factorial moment density by \\\\textstyle \\\\mu^{(n)}(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n), it is defined in respect to the equation: : M^{(n)}(B_1\\\\times\\\\ldots\\\\times B_n)=\\\\int_{B_1}\\\\cdots\\\\int_{B_n}\\\\mu^{(n)}(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n) dx_1\\\\cdots dx_n. Furthermore, this means the following expression : E \\\\left[ \\\\sum_{(x_1 eq\\\\cdots eq x_n)\\\\in {N} } f(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n) \\\\right]= \\\\int_{\\\\textbf{R}^{n d}} f(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n) \\\\mu^{(n)}(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n) dx_1\\\\cdots dx_n, where \\\\textstyle f is any non-negative bounded measurable function defined on \\\\textstyle \\\\textbf{R}^{ n}. Pair correlation function In spatial statistics and stochastic geometry, to measure the statistical correlation relationship between points of a point process, the pair correlation function of a point process {N} is defined as: : \\\\rho(x_1,x_2)=\\\\frac{\\\\mu^{(2)}(x_1,x_2)}{\\\\mu^{(1)}(x_1) \\\\mu^{(1)}(x_2) }, where the points x_1,x_2\\\\in R^d . In general, \\\\rho(x_1,x_2)\\\\geq 0 whereas \\\\rho(x_1,x_2)=1 corresponds to no correlation (between points) in the typical statistical sense. Examples=Poisson point process For a general Poisson point process with intensity measure \\\\textstyle \\\\Lambda the \\\\textstyle n-th factorial moment measure is given by the expression: : M^{(n)}(B_1\\\\times\\\\cdots\\\\times B_n)=\\\\prod_{i=1}^n[\\\\Lambda(B_i)], where \\\\textstyle \\\\Lambda is the intensity measure or first moment measure of \\\\textstyle {N}, which for some Borel set \\\\textstyle B is given by: : \\\\Lambda(B)=M^1(B)=E[{N}(B)]. For a homogeneous Poisson point process the \\\\textstyle n-th factorial moment measure is simply: : M^{(n)}(B_1\\\\times\\\\cdots\\\\times B_n)=\\\\lambda^n \\\\prod_{i=1}^n B_i, where \\\\textstyle B_i is the length, area, or volume (or more generally, the Lebesgue measure) of \\\\textstyle B_i. Furthermore, the \\\\textstyle n-th factorial moment density is: : \\\\mu^{(n)}(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n)=\\\\lambda^n. The pair- correlation function of the homogeneous Poisson point process is simply : \\\\rho(x_1,x_2)=1, which reflects the lack of interaction between points of this point process. Factorial moment expansion The expectations of general functionals of simple point processes, provided some certain mathematical conditions, have (possibly infinite) expansions or series consisting of the corresponding factorial moment measures.B. Blaszczyszyn. Factorial-moment expansion for stochastic systems. Stoch. Proc. Appl., 56:321‚Äì335, 1995. D. P. Kroese and V. Schmidt. Light-traffic analysis for queues with spatially distributed arrivals. Mathematics of Operations Research, 21(1):pp. 135‚Äì157, 1996. In comparison to the Taylor series, which consists of a series of derivatives of some function, the nth factorial moment measure plays the roll as that of the n th derivative the Taylor series. In other words, given a general functional f of some simple point process, then this Taylor-like theorem for non-Poisson point processes means an expansion exists for the expectation of the function E, provided some mathematical condition is satisfied, which ensures convergence of the expansion.

Specialising in educating and coaching women in how to control menopause symptoms without hormone replacement therapy (HRT), she is sometimes referred to as a pioneer of the \\"Natural Menopause Movement\\". In 2018, Stewart was awarded the British Empire Medal for services to drug education, having successfully campaigned to restrict the production, sale and supply of 'legal highs' in the UK. Her 27 self-help books have sold millions of copies worldwide (some reaching the bestsellers lists in Australia) and she has co-authored six published medical papers. In 2019, she launched Healthy, Wise and Well, a company providing menopause support and guidance in the workplace. Maryon frequently lectures both to the public and medical profession.  Early life  Stewart was born in Clapton, London and grew up in Clayhall. Her father was of Russian and Polish descent, her mother of English and Romanian descent. She took an interest in charity and fundraising work from a young age. In a 2012 interview in The Jewish Chronicle, she told Lynne Franks, \\"I always wanted to help people. That was my thing ‚Äì change things for people, make it better somehow.\\"  Early career  Stewart studied preventive dentistry and nutrition at Royal Dental Hospital in London and worked as a counsellor with nutritional doctors in England for four years. In 1984, she set up the PMT Advisory Service ‚Äì the first non-drug advisory for premenstrual tension in the world. In 1987, she launched the Women‚Äôs Nutritional Advisory Service and in 2003, the Natural Health Advisory Service. Research by the service claimed to have identified a link between low levels of important nutrients and female brain chemistry and hormone function. Using this data, Stewart and her team of medical professionals devised a non- drug method that they believed redressed nutritional and hormonal imbalances in women and helped them overcome PMT and restore wellbeing. Her first book Beat PMT Through Diet (later known as No More PMS!) was first published in 1987. Pioneer of the natural menopause In 1990, Stewart adopted the same non-drug method she'd used in her PMT work to focus on perimenopause, menopause and postmenopause. Stewart is currently partnered with Virgin Care to deliver menopause services in the workplace. She has just finished writing her 28th book (her first US book) entitled Manage your Menopause Naturally. It will be published on 27 October 2020 by New World Library. Books and TV appearances Since the 1990s, Stewart has been a regular contributor to the mainstream UK media. In 2001, she became the resident nutritionist on Channel 4's Model Behaviour and launched her own series, The Really Useful Health Show, on the Body in Balance channel on Sky TV. Stewart has written a series of self-help books, including:The Vitality Diet,Maryon Stewart's Zest for Life Plan,Beat Sugar Craving:The Revolutionary 4-Week Diet, The Model Plan: Eating Well, Looking Good, Feeling Great, Healthy Parents, Healthy Baby,The Real Life Diet,No More IBS!,No More PMS!,Beat PMT Through Diet,Cruising Through The Menopause: Managing Your Menopause Successfully Without HRT,The Natural Menopause Plan,The Natural Menopause Kit,Beat Menopause Naturally and The Phyto Factor. She has also co-authored the following publications: Every Woman's Health Guide: The Woman's Nutritional Advisory Service Handbook for Drug-free Health, The Natural Health Bible: An A-Z guide to drug-free health with Alan Stewart and Beat PMS Cookbook with Sarah Tooley. Charity work and campaigning In 2009, Stewart's daughter Hester ‚Äì a medical student at the University of Sussex ‚Äì died after taking the 'legal high' gamma butyrolactone (GBL). She was 21 years old. Stewart placed her women‚Äôs health work on hold to focus on fighting for a ban on the production, sale and supply of legal highs in the UK. In memory of her daughter, she established the Angelus Foundation. In 2012, the Angelus Foundation partnered with the Amy Winehouse Foundation to front a national campaign to make drug and alcohol education compulsory as part of the national curriculum. In 2016, the Angelus Foundation merged with Mentor UK. In 2018, Maryon was awarded the British Empire Medal for services to drug education. Honours and awards In November 1999, Maryon was voted by Good Housekeeping Magazine as the 51st most influential woman in Great Britain. In December 2009, she was voted one of the five most inspirational women in the UK by Fabulous Magazine, and in 2010, she won the Addidi Inspirational Award.

She discovered yoga in 1926 when she was eight years old in India and studied with, among others, Sri Aurobindo, B.K.S. Iyengar, K. Pattabhi Jois, Swami Prabhavananda, and Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. At age 101, she taught a weekly class in New York, and led programs across the globe. She was the author of two books, including her autobiography, Dancing Light: The Spiritual Side of Being Through the Eyes of a Modern Yoga Master,http://www.powerlivingmedia.com/products/copy-of-dancing-light-the- spiritual-side-of-being-through-the-eyes-of-a-modern-yoga- master?variant=998704569 which won a 2016 IPPY Award and three 2016 International Book Awards. In the front matter endorsement, Deepak Chopra said: \\"One of the most acclaimed yoga teachers of our century, Tao Porchon- Lynch... is a mentor to me who embodies the spirit of yoga and is an example of Ageless Body, Timeless Mind. Like yoga, she teaches us to let go and to have exquisite awareness in every moment.\\" She was the recipient of India's highly prestigious award Padma Shri in 2019 for her excellent work in the field of Yoga. Guinness World Records Listing and appearances In May 2012, Guinness World Records recognized Porchon-Lynch as the world's oldest yoga instructor at age 93; the previous record-holder was then-91-year-old Berniece Bates of Florida. Tao was also an activist, oenophile and competitive ballroom dancer. In 2015, she appeared on Season 10 of America's Got Talent. Over her 75-year professional life, she was a couture model, actress, film producer, international film distributor, television executive, publisher and a co- founder of the American Wine Society. In a November 2015 ABC World News interview Porchon-Lynch was called the \\"Real-Life Forrest Gump\\" since she participated in so many historic events over almost a century. In her autobiography Dancing Light, she describes personal encounters with many notables including Mahatma Gandhi, General Charles de Gaulle, Ernest Hemingway, Marcel Marceau, Marlene Dietrich, Elizabeth Taylor, Michael Wilding, Marilyn Monroe, Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, Fred Astaire, Burgess Meredith, Clark Gable, Spencer Tracy, Burt Lancaster, Lana Turner, Debbie Reynolds, Red Skelton, Vincent Price, Leslie Caron, Arlene Dahl, Richard Greene, Hugh O'Brian, David Sarnoff, Joan Crawford, Lucille Lortel, Duke Ellington, Katherine Dunham, Ilka Chase, Jean Dess√®s, Jeanne Lanvin, and Coco Chanel, among others. Early life Pondicherry, where Tao first saw yoga being practised Tao Porchon was born on August 13, 1918, on a ship in the middle of the English Channel, two months premature. Her father was from France, while her mother was Indian (Manipuri). Her mother died when Tao was seven months old and she was raised by her aunt and uncle. Her uncle, who designed railroads, often brought her along for trips around Asia, travelling as far as Singapore. The family owned vineyards in the wine region of the Rh√¥ne River Valley, located in Southern France. At age eight, Tao witnessed a group of youthful yoga practitioners exercising on a beach in then French India, Pondicherry. This encounter got Porchon interested in yoga, who stated in an interview with Guinness World Records, \\"I wanted to do the amazing things that they were doing with their bodies.\\" Going against the advice of her aunt, who remarked that yoga was meant predominantly for males, she started practising yoga, although she did not get involved in it professionally until much later in her life. In her youth, Porchon met the Indian nationalist Mahatma Gandhi, who was her uncle's close acquaintance, even marching with him on two separate occasions. She also participated in demonstrations with General Charles de Gaulle and Martin Luther King, Jr. Career=Entertainment In her early career, Porchon worked in the fashion industry. She found success as a model and won several titles, including \\"Best Legs in Europe\\". For a period of time she was signed under the Lever Brothers. She travelled around the globe modeling in such cities as Paris. During the Second World War, Porchon moved to London and became a cabaret performer under the mentorship of No√´l Coward. Notable journalist Quentin Reynolds took note of Porchon, writing that she made a \\"dark London brighter\\". After the war died down, she relocated to the United States, where she got a job as an actress under Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, appearing in various Hollywood motion pictures, including Show Boat (1951), also featuring Kathryn Grayson, and The Last Time I Saw Paris (1954. During her career as an actress, she frequently gave free yoga sessions to her fellow actors and actresses. She was also featured in the documentary If You‚Äôre Not In the Obit, Eat Breakfast, a television film which premiered in 2017. Professional yoga Later on, Porchon-Lynch, now a married woman, found herself becoming more serious in yoga. Having studied with yoga greats Sri Aurobindo and Indra Devi, she abandoned her acting job in 1967, deciding to become a full-time yogi. Jack LaLanne was the first to hire her to teach yoga. In 1976, she became one of the founders of the Yoga Teachers Alliance, now known as the Yoga Teachers Association. She based her operations in New York and set up the Westchester Institute of Yoga in 1982, which now has students from all over the world. In 1995, with Indra Devi, she flew to Israel to attend the Yoga for Peace International Peace Conference. Porchon-Lynch has also been one of B. K. S. Iyengar's disciples in yoga and reportedly the first \\"foreign\\" student of his. Porchon-Lynch has embraced her age and carried her yoga with her. She has mentioned, \\"I'm going to teach yoga until I can't breathe anymore.\\" She received the Guinness World Records title of world's oldest yoga teacher from Berniece Bates in May 2012. Porchon-Lynch was 93 when she broke the world record. In 2013, in collaboration with Tara Stiles, she released a DVD on yoga, titled Yoga with Tao Porchon-Lynch. In addition, she published a book about meditation, titled Reflections: The Yogic Journey of Life. Other endeavors Outside of yoga, Porchon-Lynch continued to involve herself in competitive dancing, particularly in ballroom tango. She had several hundred first-place titles in competitive dancing. Her youngest dance partners were Hayk Balasanyan, Vard Margaryan and Anton Bilozorov. In 1967, Porchon-Lynch assisted in the establishment of the American Wine Society (AWS) with her spouse. When it split into different branches across the United States, she was selected in 1970 to be the Vice-President of the AWS in Southern New York. She also frequently appeared as part of the judging panel in various wine competitions. She later became the publisher and editor-in-chief of the wine appreciation magazine, The Beverage Communicator, distributed by the AWS. With her fellow yoga practitioners, Porchon-Lynch organized annual wine appreciation trips to France. In 2016, Tao Porchon-Lynch received the Women's Entrepreneurship Day Pioneer Award at the United Nations in recognition of her achievements in the sports world. Personal life Porchon-Lynch grew up speaking French and Meiteilon. Thus, when she moved to North America, she experienced a language barrier, being unable to grasp the English language well, although she overcame the problem with sufficient practice. She was a close acquaintance of Hindi film actor Dev Anand. The duo were introduced to each other by Kamini Kaushal, who was also a friend of Porchon-Lynch's. Porchon-Lynch married Bill Lynch around 1962 but became widowed after her husband died in 1982. The couple had no children. She received four hip replacement surgeries. A vegetarian, she was a fan of high heel shoes and would even hike with them. In her spare time, Porchon-Lynch enjoyed meditating. In August 2014, she still drove her Smart car.

It consists of exposing the wood to fumes from a strong aqueous solution of ammonium hydroxide which reacts with the tannins in the wood. The process works best on white oak because of the high tannin content of this wood. Fumed oak is also called smoked oak. Other species may also be fumed, but usually will not darken as much as white oak. The introduction of the process is usually associated with the American furniture maker Gustav Stickley at the beginning of the 20th century, but fuming was certainly known in Europe before this. Process European white oak overnight fumed and oiled Unfumed European white oak. Left side is unfinished, right side is oiled. Chart showing the change in colour of oak with time spent in a fuming chamber The wood to be fumed is placed in a sealed chamber with all the surfaces to be fumed exposed to freely circulating air. A large shallow container of ammonium hydroxide solution is placed on the floor of the chamber and the chamber is sealed. If the chamber is large or the fuming is to be done for a long time, more than one container may be provided, or the ammonia may be replenished during the process. The fuming time depends on the amount of darkening required, the size of the chamber, and the strength of the ammonia used. It is usual to oil the wood after fuming to fully bring out the effect.Rodel, page 59; Hasluck, page 101 Advantages and disadvantages Fuming has an advantage over staining because it does not obscure the grain, it merely darkens it. Unlike staining, there is no possibility of blotches or runs. Fuming is also colourfast. Fuming has the disadvantage that it is not a precise process. Different batches of wood will react to fuming differently. For this reason, wood to be fumed for a project is often harvested from the same tree. Even so, boards from the same tree, and different regions of the same board, can still have a noticeably different colour. Where a consistent colour is important, staining or dyeing may be better options.Rodel, page 57 Fuming has some safety issues. The solution of ammonium hydroxide used is much stronger (26% to 30%) than in household ammonia and is corrosive. The fuming must be done in an enclosed sealed chamber. Ammonia splashes can burn skin and the fumes can cause burns to eyes and lungs.Ammonium Hydroxide, International Chemical Safety Card. Retrieved 7 November 2013 Operators need to wear gas masks, gloves and eye protection.Rodel, pages 57‚Äì59 The darkening of the colour relies on the ammonia reacting with tannins in the wood. The process is usually applied to white oak, as this wood has a high tannin content. Red oak may turn greenish rather than deep brown. Other species may not darken as noticeably as white oak, depending on the tannin content. The effect of fuming can be enhanced in non-tannic woods by applying a coat of tannic acid to the surface before fuming.Rodel, page 60 History Fuming was an accidental discovery in EnglandStickley, page 60 after it was noticed that oak boards stored in a stable had darkened. This was caused by the ammonia fumes from the horse urine reacting with the wood.Smith, page 67 At the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries fuming became popular with furniture makers in the Arts and Crafts movement. The technique was introduced to the US by Gustav Stickley in 1901Cathers, page 225 and a manufacturing technique was perfected in the mission style furniture line of the Stickley family business.Clark & Thomas-Clark, pages 117‚Äì119 Stickley also described a method of fuming the wooden architecture of an entire room by placing bowls of ammonia in the room and sealing it. This method was not very practical and quite dangerous for the person placing the ammonia without personal protective equipment available to modern workers.Smith, page 67 Stickley was quickly followed by other American Arts and Crafts furniture makers such as Charles Limbert and the Roycroft community.Rodel, page 57 ReferencesBibliography *David M.

He is known also as the leading British disciple of Giordano Bruno. He used the pseudonym Heius Scepsius. Life Dicsone was born in Perthshire, and studied at the University of St Andrews. He became a follower and personal friend of Bruno, who was in England during the years 1583 to 1585. It is considered probable that they met in this period, though not certain. Dicsone in any case was then in England, and became the outstanding disciple of Bruno in England and Scotland. He is mentioned in Bruno's dialogues, along with another British disciple (\\"Smith\\") who remains unidentified. Bruno and Dickson were part of the intellectual circle of Sir Philip Sidney.The Philological Museum; Alexander Dickson, De Umbra Rationis et Iudicii (1584), Introduction Dicsone opposed Ramism, and was attacked in the Antidicsonus by \\"G.P.\\" Now considered to be by William Perkins, it has also been attributed to Gerard Peeters. Walter Ong considered this dispute one of the major controversies over Ramism. Frances Yates argued that it should be considered as \\"over-lapping\\" with the debate of Bruno with the Aristotelians at Oxford, also in 1584. Perkins represented the Puritan view of mnemonic techniques based on images, which considered them tainted with idolatry, heresy, Catholicism and obscenity. With Bruno and Dicsone, Perkins mentioned in his dedicatory epistle Metrodorus of Scepsis and Cosma Rosselli. The memory technique taught by Dicsone was questioned by Hugh Plat in 1594. It has been suggested that Dicsone was led to Bruno's memory theory by the requirement for memorable textbooks. Dicsone was said to have worked for Philip Sidney.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (1936), p. 626. By 1588 Dicsone was working for Francis Hay, 9th Earl of Erroll. Hay was a Catholic and rebel, and Dicsone acted as a go-between for his master and the Scottish Kirk. He was mixture of spy and double agent, a position eventually untenable. Dicsone was in trouble with James VI of Scotland for carrying letters from Charles Neville, 6th Earl of Westmorland, an English Catholic in exile. He declared himself a Catholic by the same year, 1591. He went on further continental travels, in the Catholic interest, with Peter Lowe. In the later 1590s James VI recruited him, and Dicsone wrote in James's causes. He is last heard of trying to bring John Davidson to heel, in 1603. Dicsone had died by the time an elegy on him by Thomas Murray appeared in 1604. His hermetic interests are considered an influence on Scottish \\"mason craft\\" (the precursor of freemasonry).

The party feud led to fissures between Minority Leader James Oddo and Congressman Michael Grimm; the latter was supporting Giovinazzo.

He died in Dundee on 5 April 1895, aged 77. Life He was the son of the engineer James Carmichael (1776-1853) who operated an engineering company with David's uncle, Charles Carmichael (1782-1843).http://www.fdca.org.uk/1822_JamesCarmichael.html He was raised at his father's house at Fleuchar Craig but then lived independently at Cherryfield Cottage in Dundee.Dundee Post Office Directory 1856 As a mechanical engineer, he was linked to his father's firm of James Carmichael & Co (later renamed Ward Foundry), builders of one of the first railway locomotives in Scotland in 1833. This engine - the Earl of Airlie - was an 0-2-4 for the Dundee and Newtyle Railway and the first British locomotive to have a bogie (a wheeled wagon or truck attached to the railway engine). Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives, 0-2-4 represents the wheel arrangement of no leading wheels, two powered driving wheels on one axle, and four trailing wheels on two axles. This is a most unusual wheel arrangement, with the only known examples being three locomotives, all supplied to the Dundee and Newtyle Railway by J. Carmichael in 1833. Carmichael was the third son of Charles Carmichael, who developed and introduced a valve gear modification of a single fixed eccentric (the valve gear of a steam engine is the mechanism that operates the inlet and exhaust valves to admit steam into the cylinder at the correct point in the cycle) in 1818. He was apprenticed at his father's works before moving to Bristol as a draughtsman, and later to the dockyard at Woolwich. He returned to Dundee in 1849 to join his cousin George Carmichael at Ward Foundry. The Foundry closed in 1929. The Railwayman's Club at Guthrie Street, Dundee, is on the site of the former Ward Foundry offices and is now a listed building.

Usual sheep pastures. Glascwm () is a community in the upper Edw valley in Radnorshire, Powys, Wales. The main settlement is concentrated in the two centrally located small villages of Frank's Bridge, located on the eastern slope of the valley, and Hundred House, located on the river terrace on the western side of the Edw. The remainder of the population lives in scattered farms and dwellings and in the three rural settlements of Cregrina, Glascwm, Bettws Diserth and Llansantffraed-in-Elwel. The surrounding area has extensive uninhabited uplands of moorland at Carneddau, Gilwern Hill, Gwaunceste Hill, Little Hill and Glascwm Hill. The A481 passes through the area. In 2005 Powys county council recorded a population of 479, increasing to 551 at the 2011 Census. History A clas community (352 ad) was established in Glascwm within the cantref (medieval Welsh land division) of Elfael, (one of a number of Welsh kingdoms occupying the region between the River Wye and River Severn), possibly as early as the 6th century. St David's biographer, Rhygyfarch, claimed that St David founded the monastery, but this cannot be proved, even though the dedication is to the saint. Nevertheless, this is believed to have been one of the main churches in pre-Conquest Radnorshire. Glascwm was also the location of a miraculous hand-bell mentioned by Giraldus Cambrensis (Gerald of Wales) in the late 12th century. The earliest documentary record of the area is in the biography of St David which dates from c.1090, where the place name is recorded as Glascun. In the late 13th century, Glascwm was one of several places in the region for which Thomas, Bishop of St David's granted the right to the Lord of The Manor to hold a market or fair. John Leland in the mid-16th century recorded 'Glascumbe, wher[e] is a chirche but few houses'. But he also stated that Glascwm did lie on an important drovers' road through central Wales which functioned during the post-medieval era and probably had its origins in the later medieval era.

He played college football at Iowa and was drafted by Washington, then known as the Redskins, in the first round of the 2015 NFL Draft. Scherff is considered to be among the best guards in the NFL.  High school career  A native of Denison, Iowa, Scherff attended Denison-Schleswig High School, where he was a two-way lineman, earning first team all-state honors on offense as a senior after earning second team all-state on defense as a junior. As a sophomore, he played quarterback, passing for 1,200 yards on the season. He also played basketball, where he led the state in rebounds as a senior, and baseball, where he helped his team qualify for the state tournament as a junior. Scherff was also on the school's track & field team, where he was a standout shot putter and discus thrower, earning All-State recognition. He won two state titles in the shot put as a sophomore and a senior, placed third as a freshman and second as a junior. He won the shot put event at the 2010 Drake Relays, recording a career-best throw of 18.77 meters, setting a school record.http://ia.milesplit.com/meets/62036/results/120500 At the 2010 Iowa State T&F; Championships, he placed third in the discus throw, with a personal-best throw of 48.95 meters.http://www.athletic.net/TrackAndField/MeetResults.aspx?Meet=104174#17325 Regarded as a three-star recruit by Rivals.com, Scherff was ranked as the No. 44 offensive tackle prospect in 2010.https://sports.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/recruiting/rankings/rank-2395 He chose his home-state Iowa Hawkeyes over offers from Kansas State, Missouri, and Nebraska.  College career  Iowa Hawkeyes in 2013 After redshirting his initial year at Iowa, Scherff saw action at left guard in eleven games on the season, starting three. In his sophomore year, he replaced Riley Reiff as the starting left tackle. He started first seven games of season at left tackle before suffering a broken fibula and a dislocated ankle in game seven, and missed the remainder of the season due to injury. Despite being regarded one of the best offensive lineman prospects for the NFL draft after his junior year at Iowa, Scherff decided to return for his senior year. He received his B.A. degree in Leisure studies in December 2014. After the 2014 season, Scherff was awarded the Outland Trophy as the country's best interior lineman.  Professional career  Coming out of Iowa, Scherff was projected by the majority of analysts and scouts to be selected in the first round. He was ranked as the best offensive tackle in the draft by NFLDraftScout.com, the top interior lineman by Mike Mayock, the best offensive lineman and guard by Lance Zierlein, and top offensive tackle by Sports Illustrated. Scherff received an invitation to the NFL Combine and completed the bench press and 40, 20, and 10-yard dash. Due to a hamstring injury, he was not able to finish the entire combine. On March 23, 2015, he participated at Iowa's Pro Day and completed the drills he was unable to perform at the combine. Along with the bench, he did the vertical, broad, shuttle, and 3-cone drill. By the time the draft was approaching, he was considered a top 10 overall pick. Many scouts and analysts were conflicted over his future position in the NFL, split on whether he was better suited to play offensive tackle or guard. As one of the top prospects in the draft, Scherff had meetings or visited multiple teams, including the New England Patriots, Detroit Lions, Los Angeles Rams, Baltimore Ravens, New York Giants, Miami Dolphins, and Kansas City Chiefs. Scherff in a game during his rookie season in 2015 The Washington Redskins selected Scherff in the first round (fifth overall) of the 2015 NFL Draft. This made him the first player from Iowa drafted in the top ten since Robert Gallery was selected second overall in 2004. On May 12, 2015, the Scherff signed a fully guaranteed four-year, $21.21 million contract with the team. He entered training camp competing with Morgan Moses for the starting right tackle position but was moved to right guard prior to the beginning of the regular season. Since he was able to handle bull rushes well, he was thought to better suit the right guard position and be responsible for a smaller area where his power would be more useful. Offensive line coach Bill Callahan named him the Redskin's starting right guard to begin the season, after winning the job over Spencer Long in the preseason. Scherff made his professional debut in the Redskins' season-opening 17-10 loss to the Miami Dolphins. He started all 16 regular season games, played 752 snaps, and helped the Redskins finish first in the NFC East with a 9-7 record. In January 2016, he started his first career postseason game, as the Redskins were routed by the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Wildcard game 35-18. During his rookie season, he was graded negatively in pass blocking by PFF after he gave up 26 hurries, eight hits, and two sacks. Pro Football Focus ranked him as the 31st best offensive guard in the league. Scherff finished his second season starting in all 16 regular season games, and due to his highly regarded performance that year, he was voted to the 2017 Pro Bowl, his first such vote. He was also voted to the 2018 Pro Bowl the following year. Scherff (second from right) alongside his teammates in 2019 On April 16, 2018, the Redskins picked up the fifth-year option on Scherff's contract. On November 5, he was placed on injured reserve after suffering a torn pectoral in Week 9. For the 2019 season, Scherff was voted to his third Pro Bowl. The same day, the Redskins placed Scherff on injured reserve due to elbow and shoulder injuries. An impending free agent in 2020, the team placed the non-exclusive franchise tag on Scherff prior to the start of the new league year, with him agreeing to it on April 8, 2020. He was placed on injured reserve on September 22 following an MCL sprain he suffered during a Week 2 game against the Arizona Cardinals before being reactivated on October 16, 2020.

Working in a time of great decline in Makassan trepanging in Australasia, Using was sent by a fellow entrepreneur to sound out the Australian government on their new laws restricting the trade to Australian businesses in the 1890s. After two more wreckings, and in the climate of general decline in trepanging, he retired in 1907 after his final visit to the country, and lived the remainder of his life in Kampong Maloku.

History  The Melissenoi are one of the oldest known aristocratic Eastern Roman families of the middle Byzantine period. Genealogies from the 16th and 17th centuries trace the family to a patrikios Michael, relative of Michael I Rhangabe (reigned 811‚Äì813) and his son the magistros Leo, but the family stretches back another half-century to the general Michael Melissenos, a favourite of Emperor Constantine V (r. 741‚Äì775). This Michael married a sister of Constantine's wife, Eudokia, and their son, Theodore Kassiteras Melissenos, became Patriarch of Constantinople in 815‚Äì821. In the 9th‚Äì11th centuries, they were mostly active in Asia Minor, serving as generals and governors of the local themes. In the late 11th century, the family seems to have had ties particularly with the area of Dorylaion in Phrygia. The Melissenoi also appear to have maintained close ties to the other families comprising the military aristocracy (the dynatoi) of this period, which likewise mostly originated from Asia Minor. Thus, two of the Melissenoi, the doux of Antioch Leo and his brother Theognostos, supported the aristocratic revolt of Bardas Phokas the Younger in the early reign of Basil II (r. 976‚Äì1025). For the remainder of Basil's reign, the Melissenoi do not appear to have occupied high military posts, but they re-appear among the highest rungs of the aristocracy in the later 11th century, when a Theognostes Melissenos was katepano of Mesopotamia, while Maria Melissene was one of the few holders of the exalted title of zoste patrikia. General Alexey Melissino In the 1080s the general Nikephoros Melissenos, after launching a rebellion against Nikephoros III Botaneiates (r. 1078‚Äì1081), accommodated himself with Botaneiates' successor, Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081‚Äì1118), whose sister Eudokia he had married, in exchange for the title of Caesar and estates near Thessalonica. Under the Komnenian emperors, the Melissenoi were chiefly civil officials, but despite their family ties to the reigning dynasty, the family ceased occupying high state offices after ca. 1118. In the 13th century, a branch of the family are attested as landowners around Smyrna, while other branches of the family settled in the Morea and in Epirus, and a lady of the house even married Michael I Komnenos Doukas, the founder of the Despotate of Epirus. Later traditions also hold that an Andreas Melissenos moved to Crete during Alexios I's reign, founding there a local branch of the family. From this line the later Melissenoi descended, including Patriarch Gregory III of Constantinople (1443‚Äì1450). Another prominent descendant of the family was the 18th-century Russian general Pyotr Melissino, born in Cephalonia. His son, Aleksey, also became a general in the Imperial Russian Army, and served in the Patriotic War of 1812. He was killed at the Battle of Dresden in 1813. Coat of arms of the Russian branch of the family Sophia Antoniadis The 16th-century historian and metropolitan of Monemvasia, Makarios Melissenos, was not an actual member of the family, but adopted the surname during his exile at the court of Naples. The first female professor of the Humanities in the Netherlands, Sophia Antoniadis, was descended from the family.

Boardroom dispute Bright Packaging was embroiled in a high-profile boardroom dispute culminating in a call for an extraordinary general meeting and the replacement of four directors in a hostile takeover. The company dominated headlines for six months due to the hostile and public nature of the dispute in Malaysia ‚Äì a country where such corporate disputes are rarely disclosed publicly. In December 2012 a group of shareholders ‚Äì Ang Lay Chien, Datuk Seri Syed Ali Abbas Alhabshee, Tee Wee Keat and Lye Jun Fei ‚Äì with a collective 31.2% share requested an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) to remove the existing managing director, Wong See Yaw, as well as Executive Director Yap Kok Eng and independent non- executive directors Wong Siew Yoong and Yeap Cheng Chuan.

In North America, they are named for the Campeche region of Mexico‚Äôs Yucat√°n Peninsula, and were popular in the Americas during the early nineteenth-century. Similar versions of the form are found throughout Europe, such as the Schinkel writing chair at Schloss Charlottenburg in Berlin.‚ÄúSchinkel‚Äù upholstered armchair (Krankenstuhl) with writing arm, Hohenzollern Collection, Schloss Charlottenburg, Berlin. Other related forms include the ‚Äúplanter‚Äôs chair‚Äù or ‚Äúbootjack‚Äù (that bears folding arms that extend outward as leg rests) which is associated with equatorial climes and plantation-based societies. History This chair form, essentially an X-frame, is associated with the Americas where it is used most widely. Examples are embellished in keeping with regional tastes and carved or brass finials, tooled leather seats, and ornate inlay work are regular features. Decorative aspects such as guadamecil found on historic examples in Mexico directly relate to Ibero-Roman aesthetic development. The majority of scholarship on the Campeche chair is by Metropolitan Museum of Art historian Cyb√®le Gontar, documenting hundreds of examples, considering associated terminology, bringing to light the popularity of what were called ‚ÄúSpanish‚Äù chairs throughout the New Republic, and showing that they were not limited to the American South. Gontar traces the form to the Iberian peninsula and indicates that, while the butaca is a ‚Äúnew chair for a new world,‚Äù European precedents cannot be ignored.Gontar, Cyb√®le. ‚ÄúThe Campeche Chair in the Metropolitan Museum of Art,‚Äù Metropolitan Museum Journal, Volume 38 (2003), pp. 183-212Gontar, Cyb√®le. ‚ÄúSpanish Chairs in the New Republic,‚Äù Antiques, Vol. CLXXVII, No. 4, Summer 2010, pp. 78-82Gontar, Cyb√®le. ‚ÄúThe American Campeche Chair,‚Äù Antiques, Vol. CLXXV, No. 5, May 2009, 88-95. Campeche chairs were originally upholstered in embossed leather or cane, though also came to be padded with fabric. Thomas Jefferson, who received a pair of such chairs in August 1819 from Louisiana representative Thomas Bolling Robertson, referred to them in his correspondence as ‚ÄúCampeachy‚Äù or ‚ÄúSiesta‚Äù chairs, signifying his understanding of their Mexican origin and their informal use. At least one replica was made by the enslaved Monticello cabinetmaker John Hemings.

Gontar has emphasized the chair‚Äôs relation to the European curule (also ‚ÄúSavonorola‚Äù and sill√≥n de cadera) and has defined its cultural and artistic significance as follows: Gontar claims that Mies Van der Rohe‚Äôs famed MR90 Barcelona chair design for the Barcelona Pavilion may have been inspired by 20th century Mexican or Spanish examples, such as those by Luis Barrag√°n, who promoted the butaca.Gontar, Cyb√®le. ‚ÄúThe Campeche Chair in the Metropolitan Museum of Art,‚Äù Metropolitan Museum Journal, Volume 38 (2003).

Modern medicine from the 19th century to today has been based on evidence gathered using the scientific method. Evidence-based use of pharmaceutical drugs, often derived from medicinal plants, has largely replaced herbal treatments in modern health care. However, many people continue to employ various forms of traditional or alternative medicine. These systems often have a significant herbal component. The history of herbalism also overlaps with food history, as many of the herbs and spices historically used by humans to season food yield useful medicinal compounds, and use of spices with antimicrobial activity in cooking is part of an ancient response to the threat of food-borne pathogens. Prehistory The use of plants as medicines predates written human history. Archaeological evidence indicates that humans were using medicinal plants during the Paleolithic, approximately 60,000 years ago. (Furthermore, other non-human primates are also known to ingest medicinal plants to treat illness) Plant samples gathered from prehistoric burial sites have been thought to support the claim that Paleolithic people had knowledge of herbal medicine. For instance, a 60,000-year-old Neanderthal burial site, \\"Shanidar IV\\", in northern Iraq has yielded large amounts of pollen from 8 plant species, 7 of which are used now as herbal remedies.). More recently Paul B. Pettitt has written that \\"A recent examination of the microfauna from the strata into which the grave was cut suggests that the pollen was deposited by the burrowing rodent Meriones tersicus, which is common in the Shanidar microfauna and whose burrowing activity can be observed today\\". Medicinal herbs were found in the personal effects of √ñtzi the Iceman, whose body was frozen in the √ñtztal Alps for more than 5,000 years. These herbs appear to have been used to treat the parasites found in his intestines. Ancient history The Ebers Papyrus (c. 1550 BCE) from ancient Egypt has a prescription for Cannabis sativa (marijuana) applied topically for inflammation.  Mesopotamia  In Mesopotamia, the written study of herbs dates back over 5,000 years to the Sumerians, who created clay tablets with lists of hundreds of medicinal plants (such as myrrh and opium).  Ancient Egypt  Ancient Egyptian texts are of particular interest due to the language and translation controversies that accompany texts from this era and region. These differences in conclusions stem from the lack of complete knowledge of the Egyptian language: many translations are composed of mere approximations between Egyptian and modern ideas, and there can never be complete certainty of meaning or context. While physical documents are scarce, texts such as the Papyrus Ebers serve to illuminate and relieve some of the conjecture surrounding ancient herbal practices. The Papyrus consists of lists of ailments and their treatments, ranging from \\"disease of the limbs\\" to \\"diseases of the skin\\" and has information on over 850 plant medicines, including garlic, juniper, cannabis, castor bean, aloe, and mandrake. Treatments were mainly aimed at ridding the patient of the most prevalent symptoms because the symptoms were largely regarded as the disease itself. Knowledge of the collection and preparation of such remedies are mostly unknown, as many of the texts available for translation assume the physician already has some knowledge of how treatments are conducted and therefore such techniques would not need restating. Though modern understanding of Egyptian herbals stem form the translation of ancient texts, there is no doubt that trade and politics carried the Egyptian tradition to regions across the world, influencing and evolving many cultures medical practices and allowing for a glimpse into the world of ancient Egyptian medicine. Herbs used by Egyptian healers were mostly indigenous in origin, although some were imported from other regions like Lebanon. Other than papyri, evidence of herbal medicine has also been found in tomb illustrations or jars containing traces of herbs.  India  In India, Ayurveda medicine has used many herbs such as turmeric possibly as early as 4,000 BC. Earliest Sanskrit writings such as the Rig Veda, and Atharva Veda are some of the earliest available documents detailing the medical knowledge that formed the basis of the Ayurveda system. Many other herbs and minerals used in Ayurveda were later described by ancient Indian herbalists such as Charaka and Sushruta during the 1st millennium BC. The Sushruta Samhita attributed to Sushruta in the 6th century BC describes 700 medicinal plants, 64 preparations from mineral sources, and 57 preparations based on animal sources.  China  In China, seeds likely used for herbalism have been found in the archaeological sites of Bronze Age China dating from the Shang Dynasty. The mythological Chinese emperor Shennong is said to have written the first Chinese pharmacopoeia, the \\"Shennong Ben Cao Jing\\". The \\"Shennong Ben Cao Jing\\" lists 365 medicinal plants and their uses - including Ephedra (the shrub that introduced the drug ephedrine to modern medicine), hemp, and chaulmoogra (one of the first effective treatments for leprosy). Succeeding generations augmented on the Shennong Bencao Jing, as in the Yaoxing Lun (Treatise on the Nature of Medicinal Herbs), a 7th-century Tang Dynasty treatise on herbal medicine.  Ancient Greece and Rome  Hippocrates = The Hippocratic Corpus serves as a collection of texts that are associated with the 'Father of Western Medicine', Hippocrates of Kos. Though the actual authorship of some of these texts is disputed, each reflects the general ideals put forth by Hippocrates and his followers. The recipes and remedies included in parts of the Corpus no doubt reveal popular and prevalent treatments of the early ancient Greek period. Though any of the herbals included in the Corpus are similar to those practiced in the religious sectors of healing, they differ strikingly in the lack of rites, prayers, or chants used in the application of remedies. This distinction is truly indicative of the Hippocratic preference for logic and reason within the practices of medicine. The ingredients mentioned in the Corpus consist of a myriad of herbs, both local to Greece and imported from exotic locales such as Arabia. While many imported goods would have been too expensive for common household use, some of the suggested ingredients include the more common and cheaper elderberries and St. John's Wort. = Galen = Galen of Pergamon, a Greek physician practicing in Rome, was certainly prolific in his attempt to write down his knowledge on all things medical ‚Äì and in his pursuit, he wrote many texts regarding herbs and their properties, most notably his Works of Therapeutics. In this text, Galen outlines the merging of each discipline within medicine that combine to restore health and prevent disease. While the subject of therapeutics encompasses a wide array of topics, Galen's extensive work in the humors and four basic qualities helped pharmacists to better calibrate their remedies for the individual person and their unique symptoms. = Diocles of Carystus = The writings of Diocles of Carystus were also extensive and prolific in nature. With enough prestige to be referred to as \\"the second Hippocrates\\", his advice in herbalism and treatment was to be taken seriously. Though the original texts no longer exist, many medical scholars throughout the ages have quoted Diocles rather extensively, and it is in these fragments that we gain knowledge of his writings. It is purported that Diocles actually wrote the first comprehensive herbal- this work then cited numerous times by contemporaries such as Galen, Celsus, and Soranus. = Pliny = In what is one of the first encyclopedic texts, Pliny the Elder's Natural History serves as a comprehensive guide to nature and also presents an extensive catalog of herbs valuable in medicine. With over 900 drugs and plants listed, Pliny's writings provide a very large knowledge base upon which we may learn more about ancient herbalism and medical practices. Pliny himself referred to ailments as \\"the greatest of all the operations of nature,\\" and the act of treatment via drugs as impacting the \\"state of peace or of war which exists between the various departments of nature\\". = Dioscordes = Much like Pliny, Pedanius Dioscorides constructed a pharmacopeia, De Materia Medica, consisting of over 1000 medicines produced form herbs, minerals, and animals. The remedies that comprise this work were widely utilized throughout the ancient period and Dioscorides remained the greatest expert on drugs for over 1,600 years. Similarly important for herbalists and botanists of later centuries was Theophrastus' Historia Plantarum, written in the 4th century BC, which was the first systematization of the botanical world. Middle Ages While there are certainly texts from the medieval period that denote the uses of herbs, there has been a long- standing debate between scholars as to the actual motivations and understandings that underline the creation of herbal documents during the medieval period. The first point of view dictates that the information presented in these medieval texts were merely copied from their classical equivalents without much thought or understanding. The second viewpoint, which is gaining traction among modern scholars, states that herbals were copied for actual use and backed by genuine understanding. Some evidence for the suggestion that herbals were utilized with knowledgeable intent, was the addition of several chapters of plants, lists of symptoms, habitat information, and plant synonyms added to texts such as the Herbarium. Notable texts utilized in this time period include Bald's Leechbook, the Lacnunga, the peri didaxeon, Herbarium Apulei, Da Taxone, and Madicina de Quadrupedidus, while the most popular during this time period were the Ex Herbis Femininis, the Herbarius, and works by Dioscorides. Benedictine monasteries were the primary source of medical knowledge in Europe and England during the Early Middle Ages. However, most of these monastic scholars' efforts were focused on translating and copying ancient Greco-Roman and Arabic works, rather than creating substantial new information and practices. Many Greek and Roman writings on medicine, as on other subjects, were preserved by hand copying of manuscripts in monasteries. The monasteries thus tended to become local centers of medical knowledge, and their herb gardens provided the raw materials for simple treatment of common disorders. At the same time, folk medicine in the home and village continued uninterrupted, supporting numerous wandering and settled herbalists. Among these were the \\"wise-women\\" and \\"wise men\\", who prescribed herbal remedies often along with spells, enchantments, divination and advice. One of the most famous women in the herbal tradition was Hildegard of Bingen. A 12th-century Benedictine nun, she wrote a medical text called Causae et Curae. During this time, herbalism was mainly practiced by women, particularly among Germanic tribes. There were three major sources of information on healing at the time including the Arabian School, Anglo- Saxon leechcraft, and Salerno. A great scholar of the Arabian School was Avicenna, who wrote The Canon of Medicine which became the standard medical reference work of the Arab world. \\"The Canon of Medicine is known for its introduction of systematic experimentation and the study of physiology, the discovery of contagious diseases and sexually transmitted diseases, the introduction of quarantine to limit the spread of infectious diseases, the introduction of experimental medicine, clinical trials, and the idea of a syndrome in the diagnosis of specific diseases. ...The Canon includes a description of some 760 medicinal plants and the medicine that could be derived from them.\\" With Leechcraft, though bringing to mind part of their treatments, leech was the English term for medical practitioner. Salerno was a famous school in Italy centered around health and medicine. A student of the school was Constantine the African, credited with bringing Arab medicine to Europe. Translation of herbals Dioscorides‚Äô Materia Medica, c. 1334 copy in Arabic, describes medicinal features of cumin and dill. During the Middle Ages, the study of plants began to be based on critical observations. \\"In the 16th and 17th century an interest in botany revived in Europe and spread to America by way of European conquest and colonization.\\"Moore, R. (1998). Botany (2nd ed.). New York: WCB/McGraw-Hill Philosophers started to act as herbalists and academic professors studied plants with great depth. Herbalists began to explore the use of plants for both medicinal purposes and agricultural uses. Botanists in the Middle Ages were known as herbalists; they collected, grew, dried, stored, and sketched plants. Many became experts in identifying and describing plants according to their morphology and habitats, as well as their usefulness. These books, called herbals included beautiful drawings and paintings of plants as well as their uses. At that time both botany and the art of gardening stressed the utility of plants for man; the popular herbal, described the medical uses of plants. During the Middle Ages, there was an expansion of book culture that spread through the medieval world. The phenomenon of translation is well-documented, from its beginnings as a scholarly endeavor in Baghdad as early as the eighth century to its expansion throughout European Mediterranean centers of scholarship by the eleventh and twelfth centuries. The process of translation is collaborative effort, requiring a variety of people to translate and add to them. However, how the Middle Ages viewed nature seems to be a mystery. Translation of text and image has provided numerous versions and compilations of individual manuscripts from diverse sources, old and new. Translation is a dynamic process as well as a scholarly endeavor that contributed great to science in the Middle Ages; the process naturally entailed continuous revisions and additions. The Benedictine monasteries were known for their in-depth knowledge of herbals. These gardens grew the herbs which were considered to be useful for the treatment of the various human ills; the beginnings of modern medical education can be connected with monastic influence.Krebs R. Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions, And Discoveries Of The Middle Ages And The Renaissance [e-book]. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press; 2004. Available from: eBook Academic Collection (EBSCOhost), Ipswich, MA. Retrieved April 30, 2014. Monastic academies were developed and monks were taught how to translate Greek manuscripts into Latin. Knowledge of medieval botanicals was closely related to medicine because the plant's principal use was for remedies.Lindberg, D. C. (2007). The beginnings of Western science: the European scientific tradition in philosophical, religious, and institutional context, 600 B.C. to A.D. 1450. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. Herbals were structured by the names of the plants, identifying features, medicinal parts of plant, therapeutic properties, and some included instructions on how to prepare and use them. For medical use of herbals to be effective, a manual was developed. Dioscorides' De material medica was a significant herbal designed for practical purposes. Theophrastus wrote more than 200 papers describing the characteristics of over 500 plants. He developed a classification system for plants based on their morphology such as their form and structure. He described in detail pepper, cinnamon, bananas, asparagus, and cotton. Two of his best-known works, Enquiry into Plants and The Causes of Plants, have survived for many centuries and were translated into Latin. He has been referred to as the \\"grandfather of botany\\". Crateuas was the first to produce a pharmacological book for medicinal plants, and his book influenced medicine for many centuries. A Greek physician, Pedanius Dioscorides described over 600 different kinds of plants and describes their useful qualities for herbal medicine, and his illustrations were used for pharmacology and medicine as late as the Renaissance years. Monasteries established themselves as centers for medical care. Information on these herbals and how to use them was passed on from monks to monks, as well as their patients.Arsdall, A. (2002). Medieval herbal remedies: the Old English herbarium and Anglo-Saxon medicine. New York: Routledge. These illustrations were of no use to everyday individuals; they were intended to be complex and for people with prior knowledge and understanding of herbal. The usefulness of these herbals have been questioned because they appear to be unrealistic and several plants are depicted claiming to cure the same condition, as ‚Äúthe modern world does not like such impression.\\" When used by experienced healers, these plants can provide their many uses. For these medieval healers, no direction was needed their background allowed them to choose proper plants to use for a variety of medical conditions. The monk's purpose was to collect and organize text to make them useful in their monasteries. Medieval monks took many remedies from classical works and adapted them to their own needs as well as local needs. This may be why none of the collections of remedies we have presently agrees fully with another. Another form of translation was oral transmission; this was used to pass medical knowledge from generation to generation. A common misconception is that one can know early medieval medicine simply by identifying texts, but it is difficult to compose a clear understanding of herbals without prior knowledge. There are many factors that played in influenced in the translation of these herbals, the act of writing or illustrating was just a small piece of the puzzle, these remedies stems from many previous translations the incorporated knowledge from a variety of influences. Early modern era The 16th and 17th centuries were the great age of herbals, many of them available for the first time in English and other languages rather than Latin or Greek. The 18th and 19th centuries saw more incorporation of plants found in the Americas, but also the advance of modern medicine. 16th century The first herbal to be published in English was the anonymous Grete Herball of 1526. The two best-known herbals in English were The Herball or General History of Plants (1597) by John Gerard and The English Physician Enlarged (1653) by Nicholas Culpeper. Gerard's text was basically a pirated translation of a book by the Belgian herbalist Dodoens and his illustrations came from a German botanical work. The original edition contained many errors due to faulty matching of the two parts. Culpeper's blend of traditional medicine with astrology, magic, and folklore was ridiculed by the physicians of his day, yet his book - like Gerard's and other herbals - enjoyed phenomenal popularity. The Age of Exploration and the Columbian Exchange introduced new medicinal plants to Europe. The Badianus Manuscript was an illustrated Mexican herbal written in Nahuatl and Latin in the 16th century. 17th century The second millennium, however, also saw the beginning of a slow erosion of the pre-eminent position held by plants as sources of therapeutic effects. This began with the Black Death, which the then dominant Four Element medical system proved powerless to stop. A century later, Paracelsus introduced the use of active chemical drugs (like arsenic, copper sulfate, iron, mercury, and sulfur). 18th century In the Americas, herbals were relied upon for most medical knowledge with physicians being few and far between. These books included almanacs, Dodoens' New Herbal, Edinburgh New Dispensatory, Buchan's Domestic Medicine, and other works. Aside from European knowledge on American plants, Native Americans shared some of their knowledge with colonists, but most of these records were not written and compiled until the 19th century. John Bartram was a botanist that studied the remedies that Native Americans would share and often included bits of knowledge of these plants in printed almanacs. 19th century The formalization of pharmacology in the 19th century led to greater understanding of the specific actions drugs have on the body. At that time, Samuel Thompson was an uneducated but well respected herbalist who influenced professional opinions so much that Doctors and Herbalists would refer to themselves as Thompsonians. They distinguished themselves from \\"regular\\" doctors of the time who used calomel and bloodletting, and led to a brief renewal of the empirical method in herbal medicine.  Modern era  Traditional herbalism has been regarded as a method of alternative medicine in the United States since the Flexner Report of 1910 led to the closing of the eclectic medical schools where botanical medicine was exclusively practiced. In China, Mao Zedong reintroduced Traditional Chinese Medicine, which relied heavily on herbalism, into the health care system in 1949. Since then, schools have been training thousands of practitioners ‚Äì including Americans ‚Äì in the basics of Chinese medicines to be used in hospitals. While Britain in the 1930s was experiencing turbulence over the practice of herbalism, in the United States, government regulation began to prohibit the practice. \\"The World Health Organization estimated that 80% of people worldwide rely on herbal medicines for some part of their primary health care. In Germany, about 600 to 700 plant based medicines are available and are prescribed by some 70% of German physicians.\\" The practice of prescribing treatments and cures to patients requires a legal medical license in the United States of America, and the licensing of these professions occurs on a state level. \\"There is currently no licensing or certification for herbalists in any state that precludes the rights of anyone to use, dispense, or recommend herbs.\\" \\"Traditional medicine is a complex network of interaction of both ideas and practices, the study of which requires a multidisciplinary approach.\\" Many alternative physicians in the 21st century incorporate herbalism in traditional medicine due to the diverse abilities plants have and their low number of side effects.

A member of the Democratic Party, Futrell served a term in the Virginia House of Delegates, representing the second district. Biography Michael Futrell was an elected official in the Commonwealth of Virginia, a member of the House of Delegates in the General Assembly of Virginia. As a Delegate, Futrell represented the 2nd district of Virginia, which encompasses Prince William County and some of Stafford County. Michael Futrell is an activist for education, military and veteran families, and healthcare reform. In office, Delegate Futrell was an active supporter of the \\"Ban the Box\\" movement. This movement persuaded the Governor to ban the felony check box on applications in Virginia, helping to expand the job applicant pool. Former Delegate Futrell and his wife, Bernadine, reside in Woodbridge, Virginia, where he is an active member of the Prince William County Chamber of Commerce. A devout Christian, Delegate Futrell and his wife also serve as Ministers at Harvest Life Church. He and Dr. Futrell have two children, Michael II and Melanie.  Early life  Born in Ohio and raised by a single father, Futrell came from humble beginnings. He has been known to tell his story of \\"living next to a drug house and growing up to be the first ever African American elected to represent Stafford County in the Virginia House of Delegates in their 350 years of existence.\\" Taking after his father, who was a high school and college Hall of Fame basketball player, Futrell was a highly sought-after athlete. He had also become known for his public speaking skills, winning the State of Ohio Optimist International Oratorical Contest Scholarship for his speech, \\"My vision of tomorrow's world,\\" and other oratorical contests throughout the area. Futrell went on to accept a full athletic scholarship to Lindsey Wilson College, where he was co-captain his senior year. Futrell graduated with a degree in secondary education in 2007.  Political career  Michael Futrell is a dedicated public servant who represented the Second District in Virginia's House of Delegates. In 2013 Futrell ran unopposed in the June 11 Democratic primary and defeated incumbent Mark Dudenhefer (R) in the general election on November 5, 2013. In 2015, Futrell served on the following House committees: Finance, Privileges and Elections, and Science and Technology. Futrell sought the Democratic nomination in the 29th District of the Senate of Virginia in the June 2015 primary. After failing to win the senatorial nomination, Futrell announced that he would not seek reelection to the House of Delegates but planned to focus on making an impact in his community in other ways. While in the House of Delegates, Futrell supported numerous bills. In January 2015, Futrell teamed up with Senator Donald McEachin to introduce the Community Policing Act (Body Camera Bill) in the Senate of Virginia and in the House of Delegates. The bill included establishing and updating a number of minimum training standards for law enforcement agencies across the Commonwealth and developing a comprehensive, statewide, long-range plan for strengthening and improving law enforcement and the administration of criminal justice throughout the Commonwealth with periodic updates to the plan. The bill also included a focus on improving community police relations. While in the House of Delegates Futrell was also a patron of the Ban the Box movement in Virginia. This new practice eliminates from job applications a requirement that applicants disclose felony convictions through marking a checkbox, in order to give each person with a previous felony a better chance to follow a law-abiding life through gainful employment. Futrell also sponsored bills focusing on the state infrastructure fund, various veteran's issues, and reforming healthcare in Virginia.  Private career and community service  Former delegate Futrell began a private career as an educator teaching middle school math and science to children many of whom were from families with low incomes. After making a career change to become a pharmaceutical representative in Northern Virginia, Futrell began volunteering as a basketball coach with the Hylton Boys and Girls Club in Woodbridge, Virginia. In 2010 Futrell and his wife, Dr. Bernadine Futrell, founded Make the Future. A nonprofit organization, Make the Future provides underprivileged and at-risk youth in the Northern Virginia region tools needed to \\"create positive habits from preschool to college.\\" Make the Future became a pillar in the community. Former delegate Futrell has always had a vested interest in the political well-being of his community, having served as past president of the Prince William County Young Democrats and Vice Chairperson of the Prince William County Elections Task Force.  Make the Future  Founded by the Futrells in 2010, Make the Future began with a summer basketball camp. After launching the basketball camp, the Futrells realized that they could make learning and athletics an enjoyable experience that could prepare future leaders for tomorrow. The overarching goal of the summer camps was to provide opportunity for youth to develop positive and constructive life choices. The camps included a curriculum designed to support scholastic, moral, and athletic development of its campers. The curriculum incorporated character development, nutrition training, and physical education into each lesson to develop children in the core areas needed for success on and off the court. Since the non-profit's start, the Futrell couple have gone on to spread their message by working with NBA Hall of Fame member Dominique Wilkins; Boys and Girls Club of Greater Washington; R&B; sensation Ne -Yo and his non-profit organization, The Compound Foundation; Wilberforce University; and the Prince William County Schools. In 2014 the Futrells were honored by the Prince William County Minority Business Network. Make the Future has created several programs, working with individuals, groups, and organizations to meet its mission. At the top of the Make the Future agenda for 2015 was expansion of its gender-based generational mentoring programs, the Legacy Lectures and the Wisdom Brunches, as well as increasing the number of adults who will commit to becoming mentors in the Commonwealth of Virginia.

David McGinty and Richard Ferguson were originally part of the four-piece indie rock band Endor. Fake Major released their debut EP \\"Have Plenty of Fun\\" on 1 March 2013 and have played at several mainstream events and festivals such as T in the Park and the Tartan Heart Festival as well as many popular music venues over Scotland.  Formation  Fake Major was formed by David McGinty and Richard Ferguson in 2013. They were former members of the band Endor (2001‚Äì2012), which split up after 10 years. Endor consisted of four members, David McGinty (Vocals/Guitar), Richard Ferguson (Drums/Vocals), Calum Johnston (Bass) and Mark Church (Guitar/Vocals). Endor released an EP \\"Without the Help of Sparks\\" and a self-titled album which featured music played with drums, guitars, glockenspiel, harmonica, melodica, organ and rhodes. A second Endor record was considered but Richard Ferguson and David McGinty, being the main songwriters of Endor, decided to start their own project as a duo. McGinty and Ferguson prepared their Fake Major EP before officially announcing the disbandment of Endor.  Endor  The original group, Endor, was named after the 'second moon of Endor' from the movie Star Wars. The band formed in 2001 and lasted 10 years. David McGinty and Richard Ferguson were the two main songwriters for Endor and began writing songs for Fake Major before Endor had officially split. Endor released their debut album on 5 July 2010. In an interview at the time, David McGinty, now a member of Fake Major claimed that > Having the CDs in our hands feels really strange. All the work you put in is > suddenly just a massive box sitting on the doorstep, with a delivery man > asking you to sign for it and you definitely can't then say \\"No, I‚Äôm not > signing for these, I want to record an alternative guitar part\\". But the > physical copies look great. The album was recorded in The Diving Bell Lounge in Glasgow, with Marcus Mackay. The band released the album themselves. One of Endor's biggest appearances was on the T-Break stage at T in the Park, 2006, a stage in which Fake Major would become familiar with again in 2013. The band were well known for having sung in a choir for the recording of Snow Patrol's album Eye's Open.  Music  Fake Major's music features heavy harmonies, dual vocals and guitars. Their EP songs have several other instruments but when played live, friends from other bands play these instruments as an expanded quintet which was featured at T in the Park 2013 and King Tut's Wah Wah Hut. The songs are written so they can be played as a duo with synchronized vocals and guitars but can have more instruments brought in for recording, all while being able to play live as a duo just as effectively while providing a new experience for fans instead of replicating their EP. > The whole point of Fake Major is that the songs would be good enough to just > be played by the two of us and a guitar, and that would be as good as coming > to see it as a full live band. We'll probably still do gigs with friends > playing drums, guitar and bass. And we'll play gigs with just the two of us > and one guitar, but it'll be a different experience for each. The group is currently working on a second EP and playing gigs as both a duo and as an expanded quintet. Fake Major are represented by the Glasgow-based record label Comets & Cartwheels, founded by music promoter Paul Downie. They also represent acts such as Blood Relatives and There Will Be Fireworks. Comets & Cartwheels focus mainly on indie and folk music.  Have Plenty of Fun  Have Plenty of Fun is Fake Majors' first EP, released on 1 March 2013. It featured the four tracks \\"Little Researcher\\", \\"Fiction\\", \\"Cotton and Ink\\" and \\"Love in Mundane\\". \\"Little Researcher\\" was released as a single.  Live performances = T in the Park 2013  Fake Major appeared at T in the Park 2013, the biggest musical festival in Scotland, on the T break stage on Saturday 13 July 2013. When selected to play at the festival Richard Ferguson claimed ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been lucky enough to see some of our favourite bands at T in the Park in the past and know how strong the line-up is each year. Playing the T Break Stage will be a great honour for us both.‚Äù Fake Major, along with hundreds of unsigned acts submitted their demos to be considered by T in the Park bosses, there were only 16 places available for unsigned artists to perform at the festival, one of which went to Fake Major. Richard Ferguson said that \\"Playing the T Break Stage will be a great honour for us both.\\"  The Wickerman Festival  Fake Major appeared at The Wickerman Festival on 26 and 27 July 2013. A festival which they also played as Endor. Tenement TV released backstage sessions of Fake Major, where the duo played two of their songs \\"Seventeen\\" and \\"Fiction\\" which featured their dual vocals and guitars.  Tartan Heart Festival  Fake Major played at the Tartan Heart Festival, founded in 2004, which is held on the Belladrum Estate near Inverness on 2‚Äì3 August 2013. They played a selection of songs from their EP \\"Have Plenty of Fun\\" and were interviewed by netsounds unsigned on Episode 14, Season 6 of their podcast which featured Fatherson, PAWS, The LaFontaines, Brown Bear & The Bandits and Meursault.

He arrived in New South Wales in 1807 on the back of sound references from the British Secretary of State and in 1810 presented himself to Major-General Lachlan Macquarie, Governor of New South Wales following the usurping of William Bligh earlier in the year, as an expert merchant. Macquarie commissioned Underwood to visit foreign markets and increase economic imports, starting with Calcutta, India where he imported spirits. By owning the ships privately, but mortgaged to a nominal owner, Underwood could evade taxes imposed by the East India Trading Company. His journeys took him to London, India and South Africa's Cape of Good Hope, where his ship was wrecked in 1812, during the period when Richard Siddins, employed by him, was the captain of the ship. Moving into seal hunting, despite the decline of the industry, Underwood purchased a 186-ton hunting vessel and partook in whaling and acquiring seal oil. He expanded his fleet, importing pork from Tahiti and cedar and coal from Hunter River, sold seal skin in China, and imported tea from Bengal. On the return journey from Bengal he came across a derelict, Seringapatam. The United States Navy had captured Seringapatam during the War of 1812, but mutineers and prisoners of war had recaptured her. Underwood acted as the crew's agent in claiming salvage from the Court of Vice-Admiralty at Sydney, but the court referred the matter to London.Dunabin, T. \\"A Raider of 1813-14: Retaking of the Seringapatam\\", The Argus (Melbourne , Victoria), 10 July 1920, p.5. Macquarie eventually requested Captain Eber Bunker to sail Seringapatam to England, where she was returned to her owner. Underwood's other vessels continued to range across vast trading routes, reaching Batavia and Mauritius by the early 1820s. By 1821 Underwood retired from personally undertaking these voyages. Instead, he purchased land in the City of Newcastle and Ashfield, New South Wales, to retire to. He also bought up various tracts of land and took up dairy farming. He was widowed in 1818, though with several children; his second wife, Elizabeth Underwood, survived him.

Chartering vessels from different companies, the most important being the British White Star Line, the company quickly became financially successful, against the expectations of its founders. Having succeeded in its primary objective, the O&O; proved a serious competitor to the Pacific Mail, to the point that in 1900, the vice president of the latter became its president. In the following years, Pacific Mail having commissioned more powerful ships, the O&O; gradually ended its chartering contracts. On October 30, 1906, the made the company's last crossing, which nevertheless continued to advertise sailings until July 1908. History=A creation that proved to be a winning bet The Oceanic, of the White Star Line, was the flagship of the O&O; for over twenty years. The Occidental and Oriental Steamship Company was founded in late 1874, at the initiative of George Bradbury, former president of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company. This company had signed agreements with several US railroads, ensuring that its passengers from Asia would use the transcontinental railway lines to travel from the West Coast to the East Coast once landed in San Francisco. The agreement, set up at the completion of the railway line in 1869, had proved effective until 1873, when Pacific Mail, after commissioning new vessels, decided that their passengers could travel more profitably by the ithsmus of Panama rather than take the transcontinental train. In order to threaten the place of the Pacific Mail on the route from Hong Kong to San Francisco, and thus force it to respect its agreements, the Central Pacific and the Union Pacific united to form the O&O; with an equity capital of ten million dollars shared between them. Bradbury becoming the president of the new company. Bradbury immediately travelled to London in search of charter contracts. He had a meeting in October 1874 with the chairman of the White Star Line, Thomas Henry Ismay, which lead to a two-year charter agreement for three vessels: two cargo-liners, the and the ; also the , the first luxury liner of the company, which had become redundant on the North Atlantic route. This last ship providing the Occidental and Oriental Steamship Company with a prestige vessel for its service. With great pomp, the Oceanic left Liverpool for Hong Kong, to commence operations on its new route with a stop in Yokohama en route to San Francisco. It set a Pacific crossing record of 16 days and 10 hours, 8 days less than the ships of the Pacific Mail. In 1876 it reduced that to 14 days and 15 hours. This success laid the foundations of a long collaboration between the two companies, White Star supplying British officers while O&O; provided the Chinese crews. The success of the first voyage of the Oceanic was enough to allow the company to achieve its goal even before the ship had docked in San Francisco, Pacific Mail recognized defeat and sign a contract with the O&O; to operate a joint service on the route. In the following years, however, the managers of Pacific Mail expressed discontent with the contract and threatened to break it so O&O; remained active as a precaution. The agreement with White Star continued and four more ships were chartered: the and in 1881 and the new and in 1885. Contracts were also placed with other British and US companies, but White Star was still predominant and Oceanic remained the most prestigious ship of the company until her retirement in 1896. Reconciliation with Pacific Mail SS Coptic operated the last service for the company. Transporting passengers and goods, the Occidental and Oriental Steamship Company proved to be profitable. Its founders had expected a loss of around $100,000 per year, accepting it as the price to pay to compete with the Pacific Mail, but the company exceeded their expectations and finally proved beneficial. In the 1890s, Pacific Mail, despite their joint service, protested that the O&O; carried three times more passengers and cargo than itself. Pacific Mail, for their part, diversified by adding a stop in Honolulu, then others in Kobe, Nagasaki and Shanghai. It also made agreements with the Japanese company Toyo Kisen Kaisha. In 1900, the links between O&O; and its rival became closer as the general manager and vice president of Pacific Mail, Schwerin, was appointed president of the Occidental and Oriental Navigation Company. At the same time, it was faced with competition from the ever-larger ships of Pacific Mail and began to divest itself of its charter contracts, curtailing that of Gaelic in 1904. The service of O&O; was then operated by the and Coptic. It was the latter that undertook, on 30 October 1906, the last voyage for the company. Both remaining ships were sold to Pacific Mail which renamed them Asia and Persia respectively. Despite this, advertisements for the O&O; continued to be published in San Francisco until 1908. Two days before the publication of the last advert, on 23 July 1908, the last formal board meeting of the company was held.

Metadoxine accelerates alcohol clearance from the blood. Metadoxine is an ion pair salt of pyridoxine and pyrrolidone carboxylate (PCA). Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) is a precursor of coenzymes including pyridoxal 5‚Äô-phosphate (PLP), which accelerates the metabolic degradation of ethanol and prevents adenosine triphosphate (ATP) inactivation by acetaldehyde. Pyridoxal phosphate dependent enzymes also play a role in the biosynthesis of four important neurotransmitters: serotonin (5-HT), epinephrine, norepinephrine and GABA: see vitamin B6 functions. L-PGA is present in the diet and is produced endogenously by enzymatic conversion of gamma-glutamyl amino acids to L-PGA and free amino acids. In the central nervous system (CNS), L-PGA was found to have a role in composition of neuro- active molecules. Its production has been linked to hepatic gamma-glutamyl transferase activity and levels of reduced glutathione (GSH). Lastly, it was shown that L-PGA facilitates ATP synthesis by stimulating de novo synthesis of purines. Medical uses As a treatment for alcohol intoxication and liver disease, metadoxine is typically given intravenously as immediate release formulation. Acute alcohol intoxication In clinical studies, metadoxine has been reported to reduce half-life of ethanol in healthy volunteers and in acutely intoxicated patients; to accelerate the metabolism of alcohol and acetaldehyde into less toxic higher ketones and to improve their urinary clearance; to restore laboratory variables such as alcohol, ammonia, Œ≥-GT, and alanine aminotransferase; and to improve clinical symptoms of alcohol intoxication, including psychomotor agitation, depression, aggressiveness, and equilibrium disorders. There is also evidence that metadoxine has an effect on reducing craving for alcohol. Data from clinical studies also support an effect of metadoxine on reducing indices of liver cell necrosis and fat accumulation in alcoholic fatty liver. Liver disease Metadoxine may block the differentiation step of preadipocytes by inhibiting CREB phosphorylation and binding to the cAMP response element, thereby repressing CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein b during hormone-induced adipogenesis. Metadoxine, when given in an immediate release form in doses from 300 mg twice a day to 500 mg three times a day of up to 3 months, has been shown to improve biochemical indices of liver function as well as reduce ultrasonic evidence of fatty liver disease. Pharmacology=Mechanism of action Metadoxine is a selective antagonist of the serotonin receptor subtype 5-HT2B and displays high affinity to the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter. In vitro enzymatic assay revealed that metadoxine reduced the activity of the GABA transaminase enzyme, responsible for the degradation of GABA. Electrophysiological studies also showed that metadoxine increased inhibitory GABAergic synaptic transmission via a presynaptic effect. As it does not affect dopamine, norepinephrine or serotonin levels, metadoxine displays a novel mechanism of action as a monoamine-independent GABA modulator. In animal studies, metadoxine increased the activity of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme, prevented the decrease in alcohol dehydrogenase activity in chronic ethanol-fed rats, accelerated plasma and urinary clearance of ethanol, inhibited the increase of fatty acid esters in the liver of ethanol-treated rats, prevented the formation of fatty liver in rats exposed to a dose of ethanol sufficient to induce fatty liver, increased glutathione levels in the hepatocytes of acutely and chronically alcohol-intoxicated rats, prevented glutathione depletion, lipid peroxidation damage, collagen deposition, and TNF-Œ± secretions induced by alcohol and acetaldehyde in hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells. History Metadoxine is predominantly used as metadoxine immediate release formulation in developing nations for acute alcohol intoxication and chronic alcoholic liver disease.

The core symptoms of ADHD include inattention, difficulty staying focused, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Metadoxine exhibited cognition enhancing effect in the rat social recognition animal model. An extended release formulation of metadoxine (MDX), combining immediate and slow release formulations of metadoxine into a single oral dose, was developed to extend the half-life of the drug and to allow for the use of MDX in indications that require a longer therapeutic window, such as cognitive impairment-related disorders. MDX has demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful improvements in multiple measures of cognition, ADHD symptoms, and quality of life, across multiple studies of adults with ADHD. Several Phase II ADHD studies demonstrated a consistent signal of efficacy reaching statistical significance, as measured by neuropsychological testing (such as the computerized Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA) in acute settings) and clinical scales (in chronic administration studies), with no treatment-related serious adverse events or major differences in adverse events profiles between drug and placebo groups. The most common adverse events were nausea, fatigue, and headache. A phase 3 study in 300 adults with ADHD was completed in 2014. Alcobra Ltd., which was conducting the Phase III trial announced on January 17, 2017 that the drug had failed the trial. The failure announcement came a week after Alcobra won FDA agreement to review data collected to date in the MEASURE study and consider it in a future NDA submission of MDX for ADHD. The FDA also agreed to change a full clinical hold for the trial to a partial clinical hold pending review and approval of the company's proposed protocol for a 6-month, Phase I study to assess the potential relevance of adverse findings observed in long-term animal studies of metadoxine in relation to human exposure, Alcobra said. Fragile X syndrome Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a genetic disorder that is the most common single gene cause of intellectual disability and autism. Individuals with FXS often have a number of behavioral symptoms, including cognitive impairment, inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, autistic symptoms, shyness, aggression, anxiety, hand flapping, hand biting, and a high sensitivity to being touched. Autism spectrum disorder is seen in approximately 30% of males and 20% of females with FXS, and an additional 30% of FXS individuals display autistic symptoms without having the autism diagnosis. ADHD is commonly diagnosed in FXS and has been reported to occur in 59-80% of individuals with FXS. In a FXS animal model (Fmr1 knockout mouse model), metadoxine treatment improved behavioral impairments of learning, memory, and social interaction and reversed the overactivation of the biomarkers Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in blood and brain of juvenile and adult mice. Metadoxine also demonstrated restoration of abnormal neuronal morphology as well as reduced the exaggerated basal protein production, both implicated in the pathophysiology of FXS and presumed to be responsible for impaired learning and memory. The safety and efficacy of MDX in adolescents and adults with FXS has been evaluated in a Phase II study, which was completed in 2015.

Shell morphology The shell in the Discosoridae is conical, expanding variably with respect to genus. Curvature tends to be slight with the ventral or siphuncular side slightly concave in profile (the endogastric condition), and the opposite dorsal side arched or convex in profile (another endogastric condition). The siphuncle is composed of broadly rounded segments the increase rapidly in size toward the aperture, with growth. Expansion is commonly greater than that of the shell itself, and lies ventral of the center. Septal necks are short, brims long and recumbent. Connecting rings are thin and poorly known. Bullettes at the apical end of the connecting rings, which grasp the periphery of the previous septal foramina and connect to the inside of the previous septal necks, are never swollen. Endocones are formed by overlapping parietal deposits that line in inner side of the siphuncle in the apical part of the shell. The internal contour is wavy, in contrast to the straight conical contours of the endocerid endocones, following the general configuration of the siphuncle. The narrow endosiphotube, left within the adapical portion, may contain diaphragms. Complete shells are rare. Most of the information regarding comes from isolated siphuncles Origin The Discosoridae are thought to be derived from the Lowoceratidae, a small family of variably exograstric discosorids, probably from Lowoceras the straighter of the two. Genera Genera belonging to the Discosoridae include: :Discosorus, type :Alpeboceras :Endodiscosorus :Kayoceras :Stokesovers : and possibly Konglungenoceras unless Cyrtogomphoceratidae.

She succeeded Scott Rudder to become the first Republican Hispanic woman to be elected to the New Jersey Legislature. Early life and career Rodriguez-Gregg is of Puerto Rican descent. She grew up in Willingboro Township and Burlington, New Jersey. Both of her parents served in the military. Rodriguez-Gregg served as president of the Burlington County Young Republicans. She worked in the dental field as a dental assistant, and then became an instructor, training dentists in new practices, and managed dental offices. In addition, she serves on the board of trustees for Burlington County College, was on the board of directors for Habitat for Humanity of Burlington County for two years, and is a member of the Civil Air Patrol. In 2013, she graduated from Rutgers University-Camden with a bachelor's degree in economics. The Burlington County Republicans suggested to Rodriguez-Gregg that she should run for the Assembly in the 2013 elections, to succeed Scott Rudder, who was retiring. She and incumbent Christopher J. Brown were endorsed by the Republican Party and defeated two challengers affiliated with the Tea Party movement in the June primary election. Rodriguez-Gregg and Brown both won in the general election in November, and she became the first Republican Hispanic woman to serve in the New Jersey Legislature. In the 2016 United States Presidential election, Rodriguez-Gregg, then New Jersey's only Republican Hispanic state lawmaker, declined to endorse Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump, stating, \\"I think it's my whole life experience that leads me to not being able to support him.\\" Arrest and aftermath On April 28, 2017, Rodriguez-Gregg was arrested following a traffic accident in which her car, while stopped at a traffic light, was struck in the rear bumper by another vehicle. Rodriguez-Gregg was charged with driving while intoxicated (marijuana and/or alcohol), obstruction of justice (for refusing a field sobriety test), reckless driving, and a marked lanes violation. The other driver was charged with careless driving. Both drivers were treated for minor injuries. Four months after her arrest, Rodriguez-Gregg withdrew from her campaign seeking re-election in the upcoming November 2017 New Jersey election. The following month, local media outlets obtained and released body camera video footage of the arrest. Rodriguez-Gregg has maintained her innocence. No marijuana or alcohol was found by police in her vehicle. According to her attorney, Rodriguez-Gregg's blood test showed \\"some indication of alcohol\\", or a \\"minimal\\" presence of alcohol, but no marijuana. In December 2017, the court denied Rodriguez-Gregg's motions to suppress evidence collected by the police and dismiss the charges against her. In January 2018, Rodriguez-Gregg claimed that she was a survivor of domestic abuse that had been occurring at the time of her arrest. In a Facebook post and several media interviews, Rodriguez-Gregg shared details of her alleged abuse and photographs of her face with multiple bruises, and urged support for pending legislation that strengthened penalties for domestic violence. In response, some local media outlets described Rodriguez-Gregg as \\"courageous\\" for publicly discussing her domestic violence abuse. Personal Life Rodriguez-Gregg lives in Evesham Township, New Jersey. She is a player for a roller derby team, called the \\"Dishonor Roll\\" and She-Devils Travel Team, in the Penn Jersey Roller Derby league, where she goes by the name \\"Honeybee\\".

The theorem is named after Robert Dorfman and Peter O. Steiner who developed the approach in their widely cited 1954 article in the American Economic Review. Firms can increase their sales by either decreasing the price of the good or persuading consumers to buy more by increasing advertising expenditure. The optimal level of advertising for a firm is found where the ratio of advertising to sales equals the price-cost margin times the advertising elasticity of demand. The obvious result is that the greater the degree of sensitivity of quantity demanded to advertising and the greater the margin on the extra output then the higher the level of advertising. Dorfman, Robert, and Peter O. Steiner. (1954) Optimal Advertising and Optimal Quality. American Economic Review 44, 826-36.

Despite Russian support, Saxon army lost several battles, and soon afterwards, forces of the Swedish Empire controlled most of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In June 1703, Augustus II convened the Extraordinary Sejm in Lublin, where he faced widespread criticism. His opponent were led by Primate of Poland, Micha≈Ç Radziejowski, and sons of late King Jan III Sobieski, Jakub and Konstanty. Opponents of Augustus II formed the Warsaw Confederation, and on February 16, 1704 in Warsaw, they dethroned him. In April of the same year, young Voivode of Pozna≈Ñ, Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski, met with King Charles XII of Sweden in Lidzbark Warmi≈Ñski. The Swedish monarch, aware of Leszczynski‚Äôs influences in Greater Poland, declared that he should be new King of Poland-Lithuania. Leszczy≈Ñski initially pledged that he would temporarily control the crown, to hand it over to James Louis Sobieski, but never kept his promise. On July 12, 1704, a small group of szlachta, gathered in a Swedish army camp near Warsaw, declared Leszczynski the new King. The election was not confirmed by Primate Radziejowski, but by Bishop of Pozna≈Ñ Miko≈Çaj ≈öwiƒôcicki, which was against the rules. On October 4, 1704, Leszczy≈Ñski was crowned by Archbishop of Lw√≥w, Konstanty J√≥zef Zieli≈Ñski. The coronation took place at Warsaw‚Äôs St. John's Archcathedral. Augustus II, however, did not give up Polish crown and did not abdicate. In May 1704, he formed the anti-Swedish Sandomierz Confederation, called for the levee en masse, and on August 30, signed the Treaty of Narva, establishing the Polish - Russian alliance, and officially declaring war between the Commonwealth and Sweden. This decision resulted in a civil war in Poland - Lithuania, between supporters of Augustus and Leszczynski. Initially, Augustus managed to recapture Warsaw, and win the support of most senators, during a council in Grodno. On February 13, 1706, however, Augustus lost the Battle of Fraustadt, and, facing Swedish occupation of Saxony, gave up his claim to Polish crown in the Treaty of Altranstadt (1706). Augustus retook Polish throne in 1709, after Swedish defeat in the Battle of Poltava. In revenge, Russian troops, stationed in Poland, burned and ransacked the city of Leszno, which was property of the Leszczy≈Ñski family.  Sources  * U.

They formed Arcade Fire, with Deu and Butler initially sneaking into a practice space at McGill University to write and rehearse.

M. Pei and Araldo Cossutta. The project was part of a city initiative to revitalize residential development in Hyde Park just north of the University of Chicago. Within the Hyde Park neighborhood, they are colloquially known as \\"Monoxide Island.\\" History=Rise and fall of Hyde Park Hyde Park Township was the first suburb of Chicago, Illinois and became one of the area's most desirable communities. Following the opening of the University of Chicago in 1892 and the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893, the neighborhood became known as a retreat for the wealthy intellectual community. Hyde Park, which was annexed in 1889, maintained this reputation until the 1920s. The area around 55th Street and Lake Park Avenue, near where the University Apartments stand today, became a haven for taverns and gambling houses, who were banned from operating near the former fairgrounds. Furthermore, the South Side of Chicago experienced an overall decline in residential construction in the 1920s that continued through the Great Depression. The older buildings that remained in Hyde Park became dilapidated from poor upkeep. Wealthy and middle class communities fled the area as it became blighted and increasingly African-American. By the early 1950s, the Hyde Park community had become so poor and neglected that the University of Chicago allegedly began to make plans to move their campus. Thomas Wright, the Head of the Chicago Commission on Human Relations, and the Social Order Committee of the 57th Street Meeting of Friends met to discuss ways to reverse the changes. Although the university at first refused to engage in any community-building activities, the promotion of chancellor Lawrence A. Kimpton prompted a change in philosophy. The three groups decided to form the South East Chicago Commission in 1952 with the goals of increasing police protection, promoting residential stability, and enforce building codes. They also sought to commission a plan for the redevelopment of Hyde Park's worst neighborhoods. The organization was able to convince state and federal legislators to provide funding for urban renewal projects. Project Hyde Park A The Chicago Land Clearance Commission was created to acquire real estate and begin land clearance for blighted areas in Hyde Park. One of these areas was Project Hyde Park A, a area of Hyde Park between 57th Street, Kimbark Avenue, 54th Place, and the Illinois Central Railroad right-of-way. A redevelopment plan for this area was approved in January 1955, and funding was secured the next month. Most of Hyde Park A was designated for row houses and single-family houses. Over 15,000 residents of Hyde Park were relocated when the substandard buildings were demolished. New construction began in August 1958, led by the University Apartments. William Zeckendorf of Webb and Knapp commissioned architect I. M. Pei to design two ten-story apartment buildings for the project; Araldo Cossutta was the design associate within Pei's firm. The project was designed in collaboration with Loewenberg & Loewenberg. Zeckendorf and Pei had worked together since 1948 and had previously designed other large-scale housing developments, including the Kips Bay Towers in New York City. Pei applied several of his specialized techniques and ideas to the building. The University Apartments followed the Kips Bay idea of using two rectangular slabs to protect and enclose a park. Pei's Denver Hilton project in 1958 proved that frame windows could be made strong enough to support a building. Pei developed a special lightweight concrete for this purpose. This eliminated the need for steel framing; this freed funds for interior projects such as improved lighting and increased interior space. Pei worked with Harry Weese, who had been commissioned to design row houses for the same project, so that their buildings would relate to each other. The apartment complex was converted to condominiums in 1978. To enhance security, a wrought iron security fence and two security lobbies were added in the ensuing decade. This closed off the central court, which had been used as a public pedestrian walkway. On December 22, 2005, the buildings were recognized by the National Park Service with a listing on the National Register of Historic Places, citing their contributions to the redevelopment of Hyde Park and their significant architecture. It is a non-contributing property to the Hyde Park ‚Äì Kenwood Historic District, as it was only eighteen years old at the time of the designation. Architecture The University Apartments are on a traffic island on 55th Street stretching two-and-a-half blocks between Harper Avenue on the east and Ridgewood Court on the West. The towers are designed with a load-bearing exterior concrete screen wall. Windows are deeply inset. The buildings are designed so that it looks shorter than its actual length. The University Apartments are in a high density residential community; most of the buildings immediately surrounding the complex were part of Weese's rowhouse project and were built around the same time. Trees line the outer perimeter of the site. The towers, each , are separated by an wide central garden court. The garden court has a large pool with a fountain and two rectangular planter beds. The design is consistent with the International Style and is heavily influenced by Le Corbusier. Each of the towers has a one- floor lobby and nine residential floors; each has 270 apartments. The towers are stabilized with large rectangular pillars rising from subterranean concrete platforms. A 220 car parking garage, four coin laundries, storage, and utility areas are in the basement. Each floor has twelve windows on the east and west and 108 on the north and south ends. Windows measure across including a narrow aluminum frame and are separated by columns. Windows are high and have a arch at the top. Each level extends from floor to ceiling. Seventy-two studio apartments are each roughly , 102 one-bedroom units are either or , and 90 two-bedroom units are , , or . Each tower has two pairs of elevators. The lobbies are accessed by foyers on the north and south ends of the buildings. Each bank of elevators are located near the entrances. In 1988, security stations were installed on the north entrance of the 1451 building and the south entrance on the 1400 building.

The movement uses hip hop music as a means of expression for the disabled, providing them an opportunity to share their experiences. History Krip Hop was founded by Leroy F. Moore Jr., an African American writer, poet, community activist and feminist who was diagnosed with cerebral palsy. Moore was born in New York in 1967 to an activist father loosely connected to the Black Panthers. His upbringing sensitized Moore to the challenges faced by African Americans and the disabled. As a youth, Moore discovered that most people had little knowledge of the historical impact of disabled African Americans. This led him to begin research, initially in the music industry. Moore first spotlighted disabled hip hop artists in the early 2000s. He co-produced and co-hosted a three-part series on what he called \\"Krip Hop\\" for a Berkeley, California radio station. The \\"Krip Hop\\" series appeared on KPFA's Pushing Limits, which focuses on news, arts, and culture for the disabled community. The series' popularity inspired Moore to create Krip Hop Nation for disabled musicians, since little cultural work or music by people with disabilities had been recognized. \\"The Krip-Hop movement really makes the pain of the people feel visible\\", Moore said. \\"It goes a lot deeper than what people can see.\\" Krip Hop Nation The primary goal of Krip Hop Nation is to increase awareness in music and media outlets of the talents, history and rights of people with disabilities in the hip-hop industry. In an interview, Moore expressed the hope that by listening to his music the audience would understand the need to question authority and the information provided to them. He said he wanted his listeners to learn about their community and to become open to all people. Issues such as racism and sexism are commonly discussed, and Moore hoped that people would examine possible ableism in their attitudes. According to Moore, Krip Hop Nation goes beyond producing music and the bling-bling associated with hip hop; the movement is about advocacy, education and overcoming oppression. For Moore the movement has sought to reclaim negative terms associated with the disabled (such as \\"crazy\\", \\"lame\\", \\"retarded\\" and \\"cripple\\"), using them to shock people into understanding and respecting the disabled African American community. Krip Hop Nation addresses discrimination against disabled artists in hip hop by publishing articles and hosting events, lectures and workshops. It has over 300 members worldwide. Moore has explained that \\"Krip Hop\\" is a play on \\"Hip Hop.\\" Although the \\"Krip\\" part of the name refers to \\"crippled\\", it is spelled with a \\"k\\" to avoid association with the Crips. Accomplishments Krip Hop Nation has released two mixtape CDs, held conferences with the PeaceOut HomoHop organization at UC Berkeley and New York University, organized and hosted a six-artist performance in Sacramento, California,2011 End of the Year Accomplishments. Accessed 31 August 2011. staged a show at Disability and Deaf Arts (DADA) in Liverpool and hosted a Krip Hop Nation conference in Atlanta, Georgia for Black History Month in 2011 featuring musicians, writers and activists. In February 2012, DJ Quad of 5th Battalion joined Krip Hop Nation to co-produce a CD with 17 disabled artists from the UK, the US and Germany on police brutality and profiling. Among the collaborators was Emmitt Thrower of Artist Magnet. The documentary was scheduled for release in 2014. Notable musicians Krip Hop Nation includes artists such as Counterclockwise, Preach-man, Wheelchair Sports Camp, Miss Money and Fezo. Kalyn Heffernan is a rapper from Denver, Colorado. With brittle bone disease, Heffernan is tall and uses a wheelchair. She heads Wheelchair Sports Camp, an experimental hip-hop group with jazz and avant- garde influences. Her raps are political, with many discussing the difficulties she faces as a disabled person in America. Heffernan created beats for Haitian rappers in the area dealing with extreme poverty after the 2010 earthquake. In July 2017 she was arrested after a 3-day sitdown protest at her GOP Senator's office, remarking \\"I'd rather go to jail than to die without Medicaid\\" in regards to Trumpcare.

As per then prevailing laws, a petition could be filed only by a victim or a relative. Kapila and her husband Nirmal Hingorani wanted to represent the undertrial prisoners in Bihar. The couple acting on a novel idea, filed a habeas corpus petition on the prisoners‚Äô behalf before the Supreme Court of India. Two weeks after Kapila argued the case in court, the Supreme Court issued a notice to the Bihar government, which led to the release of all the victims in the case, and eventually about 40,000 undertrials across the country. The landmark case came to be known as the Hussainara Khatoon case 1979. Hussainara was one of the six women prisoners. This earned her the title the \\"Mother of PILs\\". This case gave rise to a revolution in the Indian legal system. She also revealed the Bhagalpur Blindings, resulting in the Supreme Court directing that the policemen who tortured 33 criminals be prosecuted and the victims released with medical aid and pension for life. She is the first Indian woman to have studied at Cardiff Law School. A plaque has been erected in her honour at Aberdare Hall. Kapila also undertook the petition where police had blinded 33 suspected criminals using needles and acid, after a lawyer from Bihar wrote to her about the atrocities. Eventually, the Supreme Court ordered medical aid, compensation and pension for life to all the victims. Kapila died on 31 December 2013 at the age of 86. In 2017, she became the first female lawyer with a portrait in India's Supreme Court library.

She is also a prolific writer and journalist. Her films cover subjects from corporate greed in America to transsexual prostitution and born- again Christianity. Her work has been commissioned and broadcast by the BBC, Channel Four, ITV and CNN. She has made films in Africa on cultural practices such as female genital mutilation, child marriage and marriage by rape and abduction or Raptio. Her film about William Hague, Just William...and Ffion, was said to break the mould of political documentary. Metcalf's documentary \\"Schoolgirl Killer\\", made for BBC Television in 1999, exposed the story of Aberash Bekele, a 14-year-old girl abducted and raped into marriage. Aberash escaped and shot her abductor when he gave chase. She was arrested for murder and put on trial, defended by the newly formed Women Lawyers Association. Metcalf managed to get into the courtroom to film, and Aberash was eventually acquitted. The documentary also included Aberash's older sister, Mestawet, who was on the point of leaving Ethiopia and taking her place as a runner in the Olympic Games, when she was abducted into marriage. Metcalf filmed Mestawet in her hut, living with three children and her husband, serving home-brewed liquor for a living. BBC audiences were deeply affected by the film and sent in ample funds to give Aberash a safe, boarding-school education. An indefatigable lawyer on the case, Meaza Ashenafi, is one of the characters in a story based on a similar tragic theme, which was made into a drama feature in 2014, called DIFRET and executive produced by Angelina Jolie Metcalf has also made many films for the United Nations and for clients including Tesco, Unilever, the Labour Party, the International Olympic Committee and art galleries such as Robilant + Voena. She made the first party political broadcasts for Tony Blair and New Labour, including Clause Four.

It was made by Jarvis Cocker and filmmaker Martin Wallace for the 20th annual Sheffield Doc/Fest in 2013, to celebrate the centenary of the steel industry. The film was made using footage from the BFI National Archive. The film was commissioned by BBC Storyville and BBC North in association with the BFI, using public funding from the National Lottery through Arts Council England.  The film  The Big Melt followed From the Sea to the Land Beyond, a similar commission by Doc/Fest in 2012. Cocker was initially reluctant to be involved because he felt that Sheffield's Steel City image was a clich√©. He agreed to take part after seeing footage of a boy putting two fingers up to the camera in the early 1900s, which reminded him of Kes, the film by Ken Loach. The Big Melt was billed as 'a brand new kind of heavy metal music', and as 'a music and film journey into the soul of a nation, bringing to life the ghosts of our past, taking us into the belly of the furnaces and showing how our souls have been stamped from the mighty presses of our industrial heritage'. The restoration and screening of the archive footage was done as part of the BFI's This Working Life: Steel project. The film shows the manufacturing processes and the social history of the people behind it, going as far back as 1900. There is no narration. It includes both colour and black-and-white film. Footage includes a girl making shells in a munitions factory during the First World War, men working on the Tyne Bridge, and a propagandist cartoon imagining a world without steel. The Guardian described the effect of the film as like \\"a really trippy educational video\\" and Wallace said he intended the film to be \\"fantastical, playful and challenging\\". The Observer called it \\"one of the best films ever to appear in the Storyville documentary strand\\".  The soundtrack  The soundtrack was performed live by Cocker accompanied by over 50 musicians, including many Sheffield artists. Some tracks were re-recorded for the official release of the documentary, while some were recorded live. Musicians included: * Cocker's Pulp bandmates Candida Doyle, Steve Mackey and Nick Banks. * Richard Hawley * Members of The Verve. * Members of The Human League. * Unite the Union (City of Sheffield) Band, who played the acid house track ‚ÄòVoodoo Ray‚Äô. * Sheffield Youth Choir * The Forgemasters, a Sheffield DJ duo. * Serafina Steer The music played includes versions of: * The Human League's 'Being Boiled' arranged for strings. * A Guy Called Gerald‚Äôs 'Voodoo Ray' arranged for brass. * The opening titles from Kes. * Several Pulp songs including 'This Is Hardcore and 'Sheffield: Sex City'. * Compositions by Carl Orff, The Forgemasters, Richard Hawley, All Seeing I, BBC Radiophonic Workshop, Serafina Steer and Max de Wardener.  Screenings  The world premiere was on 12 June 2013 at the Crucible Theatre to an audience of nearly 1000 people. The film with accompanying soundtrack was screened at the Curzon Chelsea on 8 January 2014, and broadcast on the BBC's Storyville on 26 January 2014 under the title The Big Melt ‚Äì How Steel Made Us Hard.

It was one of San Diego's first skyscrapers; when it opened in 1927 it was the tallest building in San Diego. It is San Diego Historical Site # 135 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. History The location, 233 A Street on the southwest corner of 3rd Avenue and A Street, was originally the site of a second home and carriage house for Alonzo Horton, the father of Downtown San Diego. The Sisters of St. Joseph purchased the property from Horton in the 1880s and established a girls' school, the Academy of Our Lady of Peace, in the large home, using the carriage house as a convent and offices. The Academy moved to its current location, a larger property in Normal Heights, in 1925. The Horton structures were then razed to build the Medico-Dental Building, which opened in 1927. As its name suggests, the building was designed to house medical and dental offices, with a ground-floor pharmacy and a medical library on the 14th floor. Its purpose was to cluster medical and dental services in one place, improving San Diego's medical scene as well as providing a profitable business venture; a similar business model had succeeded in a dozen cities across the country. The original owners were a group of professional men headed by Charles Lineaweaver. Tenancy was restricted to licensed physicians and dentists; the rule was enforced by a Board of Directors and Officers. As time went on the focus of San Diego's medical community shifted uptown toward Hillcrest, where Mercy Hospital and the UCSD Hospital were located. The building was no longer restricted to doctors and dentists but was used more and more for general office tenants, including at various times government offices, the public defender's office, and the San Diego Chamber of Commerce. During the 1980s the name was changed to the Centre City Building. Description The building is 14 stories high with a foundation that encloses a concrete subterranean basement. It has a reinforced concrete frame structure, also known as \\"ductile frame\\" construction. The exterior walls are concrete clad, faced with granite on the lowest three stories and with brick on the remainder of the building. It is built in an \\"L\\" configuration, with the two wings fronting A Street and 3rd Avenue. Its design is neoclassical revival with a decorative facade of brick, quarried granite, and ornamental cast iron trim. It has a gabled rooftop finished with Spanish tile, a gravel-covered lower observation roof over a rolled mineral surface, and rosette-style windows.http://lamden.com/centre- city-building-downtown-san-diego-ca/ Interior features include a marble lobby floor and staircase with a restored coffered ceiling. It has of office space and of ground floor retail space. The building is owned by the Lamden Family Trust. Recognition The building and its architect, Frank W. Stevenson, received the 1933 A.I.A. award in the Commercial/Industrial category.

Glasgow will host the Women's European Cup Event in 2014 shortly after the Commonwealth Games. Commonwealth Games 2014 Popularity for the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow is growing exponentially as the day of the opening ceremony quickly approaches. Approximately 92% of the total number of tickets available - for the 11 days of sporting events - have already sold out; with judo and athletics, as well as various other sporting disciplines proving popular amongst supporters of the host and commonwealth nations. The popularity of judo amongst the host-nation supporters is due to the Glasgow European Open, which took place in October 2013. The event was the largest judo tournament held in Scotland to date, however, this was not the main aim of the event; it was to increase the popularity of judo with the Glasgow‚Äôs citizens, in the hope of increasing the number of people getting involved in the sport as well as to gain more supporters in the run-up to the Commonwealth Games. European Championships 2015 On 27 June 2013 the British Judo Association announced that Glasgow is to host the 2015 European Judo Championships. It will be the first time in 20 years the European Judo Union's biggest event of the Judo year will be hosted in the United Kingdom, and is set to be held at the Emirates Arena. Sport Minister Shona Robison said: \\"Securing the 2015 European Judo Championships is a fantastic achievement. Judo is going from strength to strength, with JudoScotland continuing to grow its membership and the National Training Centre at Ratho supporting more athletes and development programmes. Scotland is the perfect stage for events - judokas and spectators coming to Glasgow will receive a great welcome and an experience that will surprise and delight. The European Judo Championships now join other major championships, such as world gymnastics and orienteering events, coming to Scotland after next year's Commonwealth Games and the Ryder Cup.\\" Kerrith Brown, British Judo's current Chairman, hopes the Glasgow events will help further boost the sport's profile, with Gemma Gibbons (who now train's at JudoScotland's training centre in ratho) and Karina Bryant having won Olympic medals at London 2012. He said: \\"It is an honour to have been selected by the EJU to host their flagship event and I am extremely proud of what our bid team and partners have achieved. We are confident that this event will be something special and provide a showcase for European judo to the world, creating a legacy for Great Britain sitting on a par in judo terms with London 2012 and the 2014 Commonwealth Games.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Judo Scotland website *Glasgow Commonwealth Games *British Judo Category:Sports organizations established in 1988 Category:1988 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:1988 establishments in Scotland Category:Judo organizations Category:Sports governing bodies in Scotland Category:National members of the International Judo Federation ","title":"JudoScotland"},{"id":"40995216","text":"In physics and mathematics, the spacetime triangle diagram (STTD) technique, also known as the Smirnov method of incomplete separation of variables, is the direct space-time domain method for electromagnetic and scalar wave motion.  Basic stages  # (Electromagnetics) The system of Maxwell's equations is reduced to a second-order PDE for the field components, or potentials, or their derivatives. # The spatial variables are separated using convenient expansions into series and/or integral transforms‚Äîexcept one that remains bounded with the time variable, resulting in a PDE of hyperbolic type. # The resulting hyperbolic PDE and the simultaneously transformed initial conditions compose a problem, which is solved using the Riemann‚ÄìVolterra integral formula. This yields the generic solution expressed via a double integral over a triangle domain in the bounded-coordinate‚Äîtime space. Then this domain is replaced by a more complicated but smaller one, in which the integrant is essentially nonzero, found using a strictly formalized procedure involving specific spacetime triangle diagrams (see, e.g., Refs. A.B. Utkin, Localized Waves Emanated by Pulsed Sources: The Riemann‚ÄìVolterra Approach. In: Hugo E. Hern√°ndez-Figueroa, Erasmo Recami, and Michel Zamboni-Rached (eds.) Non- diffracting Waves.

In many cases, however, more explicit solutions can be found summing up the expansions or doing the inverse integral transform.  STTD versus Green's function technique  The STTD technique belongs to the second among the two principal ans√§tze for theoretical treatment of waves -- the frequency domain and the direct spacetime domain. The most well-established method for the inhomogeneous (source-related) descriptive equations of wave motion is one based on the Green's function technique.J. D. Jackson, Classical Electrodynamics, 3rd ed., Wiley, New York (1999) For the circumstances described in Section 6.4 and Chapter 14 of Jackson's Classical Electrodynamics, it can be reduced to calculation of the wave field via retarded potentials (in particular, the Li√©nard‚ÄìWiechert potentials). Despite certain similarity between Green's and Riemann‚ÄìVolterra methods (in some literature the Riemann function is called the Riemann‚ÄìGreen function see, e.g., G. A. Korn and T. M. Korn, Mathematical Handbook for Scientists and Engineers, Courier Dover Publications, New York (2000) ), their application to the problems of wave motion results in distinct situations: * The definitions of both Green's function and corresponding Green's solution are not unique as they leave room for addition of arbitrary solution of the homogeneous equation; in some circumstances the particular choice of Green's function and the final solution are defined by boundary condition(s) or plausibility and physical admissibility of the constructed wavefunctions. A comprehensive discussion of this subject can found in H. Kleinert, Path Integrals in Quantum Mechanics, Statistics, Polymer Physics, and Financial Markets, 5th ed., World Scientific, Singapore (2009) The Riemann function is a solution of the homogeneous equation that additionally must take a certain value at the characteristics and thus is defined in a unique way. * In contrast to Green's method that provides a particular solution of the inhomogeneous equation, the Riemann‚ÄìVolterra method is related to the corresponding problem, comprising the PDE and initial conditions, R. Courant and D. Hilbert, Methods of Mathematical Physics, Vol. 2, Wiley, New York (1989) V.I. Smirnov, A Course of Higher Mathematics, Vol. 4: Integral Equations and Partial Differential Equations, Pergamon Press, Oxford (1964) and it was the Riemann‚ÄìVolterra representation that Smirnov used in his Course of Higher Mathematics to prove the uniqueness of the solution to the above problem (see, item 143). * In the general case, Green's formula implies integration over the entire domain of variation of coordinates and time, while integration in the Riemann‚ÄìVolterra solution is carried out within a limited triangle region, assuring the boundness of the solution support. * Causality of the (unique) Riemann‚ÄìVolterra solution is provided automatically, without need to recur to additional considerations, such as the retarded nature of the argument, wave propagation in certain direction, specific choice of the integration path, etc. (Usually the descriptive equations, such as the classical scalar wave equation, possess the T-symmetry. It is the time- asymmetric initial conditions that define the arrow of time through the limitation of the integration domain in the Riemann formula to t > 0, see more in and a particular example given below.) * Green's function can be readily derived from the Li√©nard‚ÄìWiechert potential of a moving point source, but concrete calculation of the wavefunction, inevitably involving the analysis of the retarded argument, may develop in a rather complicated task unless some special techniques, like the parametric method, C.J. Chapman, The spiral Green function in acoustics and electromagnetism, Proc. Roy. Soc. A 431(1881), 157‚Äì167 (1990), doi: 10.1098/rspa.1990.0124 are invoked. The Riemann-Volterra approach presents the same or even more serious difficulties, especially when one deals with the bounded-support sources: here the actual limits of integration must be defined from the system of inequalities involving the space-time variables and parameters of the source term. However, this definition can be strictly formalized using the spacetime triangle diagrams. Playing the same role as the Feynman diagrams in particle physics, STTDs provide a strict and illustrative procedure for definition of areas with the same analytic representation of the integration domain in the 2D space spanned by the non-separated spatial variable and time.  Drawbacks of the method  * The method can only be applied to problems possessing known Riemann function. * Application of the method and analysis of the results obtained require more profound knowledge of the special functions of mathematical physics (e.g., operating with the generalized functions, Mathieu functions of different kinds and Lommel's functions of two variables) than Green's function method. * In some cases the final integrals require special consideration in the domains of rapid oscillation of the Riemann function.  Most important concretizations = General considerations  Several efficient methods for scalarizing electromagnetic problems in the orthogonal coordinates x_1, x_2, x_3 were discussed by Borisov in Ref. V.V. Borisov, Electromagnetic Fields of Transient Currents. Leningrad State University Press: Leningrad (1996, in Russian) The most important conditions of their applicability are h_3 = 1 and \\\\partial_3(h_1/h_2) = 0, where h_i, i= 1,2,3 are the metric (Lam√©) coefficients (so that the squared length element is ds^2 = h_1^2 dx_1^2+h_2^2 dx_2^2+h_3^2 dx_3^2). Remarkably, this condition is met for the majority of practically important coordinate systems, including the Cartesian, general- type cylindrical and spherical ones. For the problems of wave motion is free space, the basic method of separating spatial variables is the application of integral transforms, while for the problems of wave generation and propagation in the guiding systems the variables are usually separated using expansions in terms of the basic functions (modes) meeting the required boundary conditions at the surface of the guiding system.  Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates  In the Cartesian \\\\left{ x_1=x, \\\\; x_2=y, \\\\; x_3=z \\\\right} and general-type cylindrical coordinates \\\\left{ x_1=x_1(x,y), \\\\; x_2=x_2(x,y), \\\\; x_3=z \\\\right} separation of the spatial variables result in the initial value problem for a hyperbolic PDE known as the 1D Klein‚ÄìGordon equation (KGE) : \\\\begin{align} & \\\\left( \\\\partial_\\\\tau ^2 - \\\\partial_z^2 + k^2 \\\\right)\\\\psi(\\\\tau,z) = f(\\\\tau,z) \\\\ & \\\\psi (\\\\tau ,z) = 0 \\\\text{ for } \\\\tau < 0 \\\\end{align} Here \\\\tau is the time variable expressed in units of length using some characteristic velocity (e.g., speed of light or sound), k is a constant originated from the separation of variables, and f(\\\\tau ,z) represents a part of the source term in the initial wave equation that remains after application of the variable-separation procedures (a series coefficient or a result of an integral transform). The above problem possesses known Riemann function : R_k(\\\\tau ,z;\\\\tau ',z') = J_0\\\\left( k\\\\sqrt {(\\\\tau - \\\\tau')^2 - (z - z')^2} \\\\right), where J_0(\\\\cdot) is the Bessel function of the first kind of order zero. Passing to the canonical variables z, \\\\tau \\\\to \\\\xi, \\\\eta one gets the simplest STTD diagram reflecting straightforward application of the Riemann‚ÄìVolterra method, with the fundamental integration domain represented by spacetime triangle MPQ (in dark grey). Rotation of the STTD 45¬∞ counter clockwise yields more common form of the STTD in the conventional spacetime z, \\\\tau. For the homogeneous initial conditions the (unique) solution of the problem is given by the Riemann formula : \\\\psi(\\\\tau ,z) = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\iint\\\\limits_{\\\\triangle MPQ} \\\\, d\\\\tau' \\\\, dz'R(\\\\tau ,z;\\\\tau',z')f(\\\\tau',z'). Evolution of the wave process can be traced using a fixed observation point (z = \\\\text{const}) successively increasing the triangle height (\\\\tau) or, alternatively, taking \\"momentary picture\\" of the wavefunction \\\\psi by shifting the spacetime triangle along the z axis (\\\\tau = \\\\text{const}). More useful and sophisticated STTDs correspond to pulsed sources whose support is limited in spacetime. Each limitation produce specific modifications in the STTD, resulting to smaller and more complicated integration domains in which the integrand is essentially non-zero. Examples of most common modifications and their combined actions are illustrated below. {{multiple image  align = left  direction = horizontal  width = 300  image1 = F140910a_STTDmethod_F_zTau_z0.gif  width1 =  alt1 =  caption1 = STTD for a source limited from left by plane z = 0, i.e. f(\\\\tau ,z) = 0 \\\\text{ for } z < 0, which is the case, e.g., for a travelling source propagating along a semi- infinite radiator l.  image2 = F140910a_STTDmethod_F_zTau_l.gif  width2 =  alt2 =  caption2 = STTD for a source limited from right by plane z = l, i.e. f(\\\\tau,z) = 0 \\\\text{ for } z > l.  image3 = F140911a_STTDmethod_F_zTau_z0l.gif  width3 =  alt3 =  caption3 = STTD for a source limited from both sides, i.e. f(\\\\tau ,z) = 0 \\\\text{ for } z otin [0,l], which is the case, e.g., for a travelling source propagating along a radiator of finite length l.  header = Static limitations to the source area  header_align =  header_background =  footer =  footer_align =  footer_background =  background color = }} {{multiple image  align = left  direction = vertical  width = 910  image1 = F140913a_STTDmethod_F_zTau_z0lT_S_all.gif  width1 =  alt1 =  caption1 = A sequence of generic STTDs for a \\"short\\", finite source pulse of duration T propagating along a finite radiator z \\\\isin [0,l] with a constant velocity \\\\beta.

Equivalence of the STTD (Riemann) and Green's function solutions  The STTD technique represents an alternative to the classical Green's function method. Due to uniqueness of the solution to the initial value problem in question, in the particular case of zero initial conditions the Riemann solution provided by the STTD technique must coincide with the convolution of the causal Green's function and the source term. The two methods provide apparently different descriptions of the wavefunction: e.g., the Riemann function to the Klein‚ÄìGordon problem is a Bessel function (which must be integrated, together with the source term, over the restricted area represented by the fundamental triangle MPQ) while the retarded Green's function to the Klein‚ÄìGordon equation is a Fourier transform of the imaginary exponential term (to be integrated over the entire plane z',\\\\tau', see, for example, Sec. 3.1. of Ref.W. Geyi, A time-domain theory of waveguide, Progress in Electromagnetics Research 59, 267‚Äì297 (2006), doi: 10.2528/PIER05102102 ) reducible to : G_k(\\\\tau,z;\\\\tau',z') = \\\\- \\\\frac{1}{(2\\\\pi)^2} \\\\int\\\\limits_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty dp \\\\, {\\\\rm e}^{ip(z - z')} \\\\int\\\\limits_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty d\\\\Omega \\\\, \\\\frac{{\\\\rm e}^{i\\\\Omega(\\\\tau -\\\\tau')}}{\\\\Omega^2 - p^2 - k^2}.

Life and career He was a member of the gens (clan) √Åkos as the son of Matthew.Zsoldos 2011, p. 281. He had two brothers, Philip, who served as isp√°n of G√∂m√∂r (1244), then Veszpr√©m Counties (1247), and Derek, who governed Gy≈ër County in 1257. Possibly √Åkos, who entered ecclesiastical career, was the youngest brother among three of them.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Genus √Åkos 1., Bebek branch, Marjai) It is possible that √Åkos raised in the court of Coloman of Galicia-Lodomeria, a younger son of Andrew II of Hungary.M√°lyusz 1971, p. 118. Probably he studied abroad as his work proves that he had an excellent knowledge of the canon law of the Catholic Church and its reference method. Raymond of Penyafort compiled the Decretals of Gregory IX by September 1234, the Pope announced the new publication in a Bull directed to the doctors and students of Paris and Bologna, commanding that the work of Raymond alone should be considered authoritative, and should alone be used in the schools. √Åkos was already referred to as magister in 1240, confirming that he studied arts and canon law in youth and not at peek of his ecclesiastical career.M√°lyusz 1971, p. 12. √Åkos was present at the coronation of B√©la IV on 14 October 1235, as he gave a detailed account of the event in his gesta. According to his report, Duke Coloman carried the royal sword, while Daniel of Galicia led the king's horse at the head of the procession.M√°lyusz 1971, p. 118. √Åkos was a vicar in Pest between 1235 and 1244, later became royal chaplain for King B√©la. He was one of the crown guards from 1246 to 1251, after that he served as canon of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r between 1248 and 1251. Besides that he functioned as chancellor for Queen Maria Laskarina, the wife of B√©la IV from 1248 until 1261. He was also provost of Buda.Zsoldos 2011, p. 115. For the last decade of his life, √Åkos functioned as caretaker and patron of the Dominican monastery in the Margaret Island. Following the death of B√©la IV, he retired from public life and resided in the provost's palace at √ìbuda. He wrote his gesta there.M√°lyusz 1971, p. 26. In 1270, after Stephen V's accession to the throne, √Åkos was among the members of the Hungarian delegation sent to Naples which escorted the c. twelve-year-old princess Mary to marry Charles the Lame. According to historian Elem√©r M√°lyusz, √Åkos was the leader of the Hungarian delegation to Naples.M√°lyusz 1971, p. 28. Even after the sudden death of Stephen V in August 1272, √Åkos has retained his influence and remained head of the royal chapel during the reign of the minor Ladislaus IV.M√°lyusz 1971, p. 124. √Åkos died after 24 August 1273, when he was last mentioned by contemporary sources. Benedict, his successor in the position of provost of Buda already appeared in a document in late 1273, suggesting that √Åkos died in that year.M√°lyusz 1971, p. 71. His gesta He was the author of the gesta which later revised by Simon of K√©za in his work, the Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum. In historiography, √Åkos was first identified as the author of the gesta from King Stephen V's age by medievalist Gy√∂rgy Gy√∂rffy in 1948, while previously Gyula Pauler had already referred to an unidentified chronicler between the ages of Anonymus and Simon of K√©za, whose works were preserved by the 14th-century chronicle composition.M√°lyusz 1971, p. 8. √Åkos' chronicle was mostly based on the so-called \\"ancient gesta\\" () which had lost by today.M√°lyusz 1971, p. 85. √Åkos preserved several legends such as Lehel's horn myth, later also transcribed by the Illuminated Chronicle,M√°lyusz 1971, p. 97. and the Saint Eustace legend with Hungarian motifs and persons, Dukes G√©za and Ladislaus. Accordingly, they hunting a stag in V√°c, where saw a vision of a burning candle lodged between the stag's antlers. Following that King G√©za built the first cathedral in that place.M√°lyusz 1971, p. 110. √Åkos' work was aristocratic in its tone, as himself was also a member of a powerful kindred which rose by the 13th century; he prepared the story of seven chieftains of the Magyars which can be found in the 14th century chronicle collection (as Anonymus' Gesta Hungarorum was lost until the 18th century).Krist√≥ 1990, p. 439. However, √Åkos also emphasized that the ancestors of the kindreds of his age actively participated too in the conquest of the Carpathian Basin in late 9th century, and contrary to Anonymus, he did not identify the seven chieftains with the whole Hungarian nation.M√°lyusz 1971, p. 54. √Åkos even emphasized that √Årp√°d was the first \\"first among equals\\" who had right to march in front during the conquest ‚Äì referring duty of monarchs preserved from the \\"Scythian heritage\\", he argued.M√°lyusz 1971, p. 62. In his work, √Åkos called the group of aristocracy of his time as communitas, suggesting equal rights and duties among them, and preventing the emergence of certain clans in their ranks (called barons, which term was refused by √Åkos, who used the \\"nobilis\\" phrase). Historian M√°lyusz argued the chronicler's idea of communitas marked an argument for oligarchic form of society, while later Simon of K√©za has extended it to the whole lesser nobility.M√°lyusz 1971, p. 57. √Åkos sought to link genealogically the prominent kindreds of his age with 9th‚Äì10th century individuals who participated in the Hungarian conquest or took a major role in the foundation of the Christian state. For instance, by the usage of incorrectly dated historical events, he claimed chieftain Szabolcs was the forefather of the Cs√°k clan, while he connected the gyulas to the K√°n kindred and its first prominent member, Julius I (Gyula).M√°lyusz 1971, p. 59. By comparison to Simon of K√©za, magister √Åkos did not attach much importance to the xenophobic phenomenon. According to his gesta, he preferred the social status against ethnicity.Krist√≥ 1990, p. 442. √Åkos considered the advena (\\"newcomer\\", foreign-origin) kindreds as equals to the ancient ones. In this spirit, he highlighted that the German knights from whom the Hont-P√°zm√°ny kindred originated, had already fought for Christ when the Hungarians were still pagans. Rejecting Hont and P√°zm√°ny's mercenary role and commoner status, √Åkos even claimed that Grand Prince Stephen sought assistance personally in his fight against Kopp√°ny from them, claiming members of European \\"royal dynasties\\".M√°lyusz 1971, p. 62. √Åkos also suggested the Hah√≥ts were descendants of the Counts of Weimar-Orlam√ºnde, increasing their importance.M√°lyusz 1971, p. 81. Proving the chronicler's ability of historiographical invention, √Åkos linked the contemporary isp√°n Keled's kinship to a fictional 12th century German royal family, the Counts of Hersfeld, even refused by the K√≥r√≥gyis, later 14th-century members of the family.M√°lyusz 1971, p. 65. √Åkos possibly intentionally placed the arrival of H√©der, forefather of the contemporary Henry K≈ëszegi and his powerful family, to the age of Grand Prince G√©za (r. 972‚Äì997), while in fact, the German knight came to Hungary during the reign of G√©za II in the 1140s.M√°lyusz 1971, p. 70. In other aspects, the magister correctly named the places of the origins of the Herm√°n, Smaragd and Gutkeled kindreds.M√°lyusz 1971, p. 68. Summarizing, √Åkos only considered the importance of the assimilation process of advena kindreds, stressing the marriage and relation ties with the ancient Hungarian clans.M√°lyusz 1971, p. 63. Direct borrowings from Godfrey of Viterbo's Pantheon, Roger of Torre Maggiore's Carmen Miserabile and Thomas the Archdeacon's Historia Salonitana prove that √Åkos used these works beside the \\"ancient gesta\\".M√°lyusz 1971, p. 139.

History Buckley Broadcasting Radio was founded in 1954 as Buckley-Jaeger Broadcasting. Richard D. Buckley Sr and John Jaeger were the original founding partners. It began as an independently owned radio broadcasting company. WNEW in New York City was the station's first acquisition, but the company resold that station to Metromedia in 1955. In 1957, the station bought its first long-term asset, WHIM in Providence, Rhode Island. In 1959, it bought WDRC in Hartford, Connecticut, and soon after launched its flagship station WDRC-FM. Following the death of his father in 1972, Richard D. Buckley Jr. became the president and chairman of the company, a position he held until his death in 2011. Buckley acquired WOR in New York City in 1989. Buckley began divesting its stations shortly before Buckley Jr.'s death. WSEN & WSEN-FM and WFBL in Syracuse, New York were divested to local owners in 2008, eventually landing in the hands of Craig L. Fox. WOR was sold to Clear Channel Communications in 2012. WDRC & WDRC-FM were sold in early 2014 to Connoisseur Media of Bloomfield. Stations KSEQ in Fresno and KWAV in Monterey were then sold soon after that year, and its stations in Bakersfield, California (KLLY, KKBB and KNZR) and Merced, California (KUBB/KHTN) were sold to Alpha Media in October 2014. People Richard D. Buckley: President, 1972-2011 Richard D. Buckley was born in Bronxville, New York. After the death of his father in 1972, Richard D. Buckley became the president of the company. He began his broadcasting career as a page in 1960 at the National Broadcasting Company. He has served in the broadcasting company for over 50 years, until his death in August 2011. During his time as chairman of the company, he refused to sell his independent and family owned business. In early 2011 he was inducted into the Hall of Fame of the New York State Broadcasters‚Äô Association. Buckley was the past chairman of the Board of Radio Advertising Bureau and of the Board of the Southern California Broadcasters‚Äô Association. Richard D. Buckley died on July 31, 2011. Joe Bilotta: President & Chief Operating Officer, 2011-Current Joe Bilotta has served Buckley Radio for over 40 years prior to his appointment of President following the death of Richard D. Buckley. Lynne Berke, et al. v. Buckley Broadcasting Corporation WOR Radio On April 30, 2003, the Superior Court of New Jersey decided the case Lynne Berke, et al. v. Buckley Broadcasting Corporation WOR Radio. The plaintiffs, Lynne Berke et al. were around 300 investors in a cable television security that was advertised on WOR Radio, owned by Buckley Broadcasting. Talk show host, Harry I. ‚ÄúSonny‚Äù Bloch advertised this cable television security on WOR Radio. The plaintiffs commenced action in Federal Court against Bloch, who died during the pendency of the action. However, since the advertising ceased in 1994 and the appeal was made 2001, the court dismissed the appeal as untimely under the statute of limitations.

Among his influences are Hermann Huppen, a Belgian comics artist for whom Syaf has expressed admiration. He embarked upon a career as a professional comics artist in 2003, deciding that leaving his interest in drawing comics and working in a conventional job was not something he was willing to do. Career Syaf started his career in 2007 with Dabel Brothers Publishing, illustrating The Dresden Files for 11 issues.

His earliest work for DC Comics was \\"The Origin of Congorilla\\" a backup story written by Len Wein that appeared in Justice League: Cry for Justice #1 (September 2009).

Easter egg references and X-Men Gold controversy Syaf is known to engage in the practice of hiding Easter egg references to political figures in the backgrounds of his artwork. In Batgirl (Vol 4) #9 (July 2012), for example, Syaf included a storefront sign that referenced the President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, although the text that accompanies the image of Widodo in Syaf's penciled artwork is covered by a caption in the final, published issue.Johnston, Rich (April 8, 2017). \\"Marvel Artist Ardian Syaf Hid Anti- Christian And Jewish Messages In This Week's X-Men Comic\\".

In April 2017, Syaf was at the center of controversy for including multiple Easter eggs in X-Men Gold #1 (June 2017) that referenced the November 2016 Jakarta protests against Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, the governor of Jakarta, which were viewed by readers as anti-Semitic and anti-Christian. Being both ethnically Chinese and Christian in the Muslim-dominated Indonesia, where Christians and Chinese are still targets of racism and discrimination, and only the second Chinese Christian governor of Jakarta since 1965,Harfenist, Ethan (August 17, 2014). \\"Jakarta Could Be Getting Its First Ethnically Chinese Governor\\". Vice News. Basuki had been the target of racism by Islamist hardliners. In a 27 September 2016 speech Basuki stated that some citizens were being discouraged from voting for him by politicians citing Verse 51 of the fifth chapter of the Quran out of context for political reasons. The verse, Quran Surah 5:51, or QS 5:51, is commonly translated in Indonesian as \\"Muslims should not appoint the Jews and Christians as their leader.\\" The quran.com translation reads, \\"O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are [in fact] allies of one another. And whoever is an ally to them among you‚Äîthen indeed, he is [one] of them. Indeed, Allah guides not the wrongdoing people.\\"\\"Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:51)\\". quran.com. Retrieved April 9, 2017. Citizens and pundits reacted to Basuki's statement as an insult to the Quran, in part because one of the videos of the speech uploaded to the Internet was edited in a way that changed the meaning of his words.La Batu, Safrin (14 December 2016). \\"Accompanying text of Ahok video not intended as transcript: Buni Yani\\".

On the double-page spread of Pages 10 and 11 of X-Men Gold #1, in which the Jewish X-Man Kitty Pryde appeals to a crowd of people for tolerance, Syaf's art places Kitty's head next to the word \\"Jewelry\\" on a storefront awning in the background, such that the last letters of the word are partially obstructed. The number \\"212\\", a reference to the 2 December protest, is prominently placed on another store's awning. The number \\"51\\" is seen on the baseball cap of one of the people in the crowd, and on the shirt of another, a reference to the Quranic verse 5:51 at the center of the Indonesia protests.Lovett, Jamie (April 8, 2017). \\"Marvel Releases Statement On Controversial X-Men Gold Art\\".

The third panel on that spread features a male bystander with a shirt reading \\"AL M\\", which may be a reference to Al-Maidah 51, another way to designate the controversial verse.Riseman, Abraham (10 April 2017). \\"Marvel Was Rocked by a Weird Hidden Koranic Message This Weekend\\". Vulture. In the second panel of Page 12, the X-Man Colossus wears a shirt prominently displaying the text \\"QS 5:51\\". This led to an outcry on social media on Saturday, April 8, three days after the book's publication, by readers who viewed the verse as support of intolerance towards other religions. Syaf was also angrily denounced by Marvel writer G. Willow Wilson, a Muslim herself, who wrote an essay elucidating the verse and warning of the danger of the conservative Indonesian interpretation of it. The Easter eggs also drew negative reaction from Syaf's fellow Indonesian comics creators. The perceived inappropriateness of these messages stemmed in part from the fact X-Men storylines have traditionally served as allegories warning of the dangers of bigotry since their creation in 1963 by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby (both of whom were Jewish themselves), with the characters themselves (including the Jewish Kitty Pryde and Catholic Nightcrawler, a former priest) serving as stand-ins for oppressed minority groups.Ching, Albert (April 9, 2017). \\"Marvel Responds to X-Men Gold Artist Controversy\\".

He eventually acknowledged the political nature of the hidden messages, though he denied that they were an expression of intolerance on his part, stating, \\"I don't hate Jews and Christians... I have a many good friends [among them] too.\\" Syaf, who had previously posted a detail of the pencils for the double page spread on his Facebook page, removed them following the criticism leveled at him.Tan, Yvette (April 10, 2017). \\"Marvel will punish 'X-men' artist who snuck political references into the latest comic\\". Mashable. Marvel Comics released the following statement in response to the controversy: On April 11, Syaf's contract with Marvel was terminated. Marvel's statement is notable for both the swiftness in which Marvel issued it‚Äîon a Saturday, hours after the X-Men Gold art became a point of discussion on social media‚Äîand the definitive condemnation of the implied statements in the issue. The writer of the series, Marc Guggenheim, who is himself Jewish, responded to the situation on Saturday by referring readers to Marvel's statement, and tweeting, \\"The support has been amazing. From fans and pros alike.\\" Syaf reacted to this development by removing his Facebook fan page, and stating on his personal Facebook page, \\"My career is over now. It's the consequence what I did, and I take it. Please no more mockery, [debate], no more hate. I hope all in peace.\\" Syaf explained that the Quran verse and protest reference that he hid in the comic was intended as a message of \\"justice\\" and \\"love.\\"Ching, Albert (10 October 2017). \\"X-Men Gold Artist Addresses Controversy: ‚ÄòMy Career is Over Now'\\".

The following day, in an interview with the Indonesian newspaper Jawa Pos, Syaf explained why he thought Marvel did not accept his explanation for including the Easter egg references, saying, \\"But Marvel is owned by Disney. When Jews are offended, there is no mercy\\". After making this remark, he reiterated that he was not anti-Semitic or anti-Christian stating that if he was, he would not have worked for a foreign publisher.

Foster's brigade during Burnside's North Carolina Expedition.Warner p.380 In the wake of the Union occupation of the North Carolina coast, Potter was authorized to recruit the 1st North Carolina Infantry from loyal Union citizens around Washington, North Carolina.Warner p.380 Potter was appointed lieutenant colonel on October 1, 1862 and was soon promoted to brigadier general of U.S. Volunteers dating from November 29, 1862.Eicher p.436 When John G. Foster took command of the XVIII Corps Potter became his chief-of-staff. During the siege of Washington, General Foster personally arrived in Washington to assume command of the defenses and was accompanied by General Potter. After several failed relief attempts, Foster escaped the city to lead the relief effort himself. Foster left Potter in immediate command of the city's defenses. Potter maintained the defense until the Confederates were compelled to withdraw. Potter was afterward in command of the defenses of Norfolk and Portsmouth, but once again became chief of staff to General Foster when the latter was appointed to command of the Army of the Ohio. Potter's time in Tennessee was brief as he returned to the Atlantic coast in command of the District of Hilton Head four months later. In November 1864 he led a brigade into action at the Battle of Honey Hill and in 1865 organized raids into the interior of South Carolina and North Carolina. In 1865 he received a brevet promotion to major general of U.S. Volunteers dated 13 March.Warner p.380 See also *List of American Civil War generals (Union) NotesReferences * Eicher, John H., and David J.

Four more were constructed from his plans. Development The Sant' Ambrogio, named after the patron saint of Milan, was designed and built in 1938 by the 19-year-old Gian Luigi Della Torre, whose previous experience was limited to model building. It was a cantilever mid wing monoplane, its wing built with some dihedral around a single spar and having a rectangular plan ending in rounded tips. Ailerons occupied about half the span, which was in all only just over . The Sant' Ambrogio had a hexagonal cross section, plywood skinned fuselage. At the nose the two upper panels were curved rather than flat; in elevation the nose was rounded and the fuselage tapered aft. The cockpit was centred over the spar and enclosed by a long, teardrop shaped canopy. All the tail surfaces were only slightly tapered, with straight leading edges and blunt tips. The tailplane was attached to the upper fuselage with three bolts and was far enough forward that the rudder hinge was aft of the elevators. Its fin was much smaller than the rudder in area and the whole vertical tail was about as broad as high, though the rudder extended below the keel protected by a short skid or tail bumper. The main undercarriage was a simple ash skid running from just aft of the nose almost to the trailing edge of the wing, attached to the bottom of the fuselage with rubber shock absorbers. After flight testing the Sant' Ambrogio in 1938, Adriano Mantelli flew it successfully in the Second Italian National Gliding Competition, held in Asiago that year. Immediately after World War II and until 1948 a Sant' Ambrogio was flown by the Leonardo da Vinci Gliding Club at Pisa.

Occupying approximately 3,800 square metres, the bazaar is operated and managed by the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals (TWGHs), a non-profit non-governmental organisation (NGO). Construction began in January 2013 and the bazaar officially began operations on 8 February 2013. History On 1 September 2012, the Chief Secretary for Administration Carrie Lam announced that the Hong Kong government had agreed to allocate a piece of vacant 3,800-square- metre land for the purpose of setting up a flea market in Tin Shui Wai. The government would provide funding of HK$10 million to support the establishment of a bazaar there. The bazaar would comprise around 200 stationary stalls. The government started a consultation procedure the same month and expected the bazaar would service the public after half a year. On 21 October 2012, the representatives of Tin Shui Wai Hawkers Concern Group expressed that the proposals delivered by the TWGHs failed to take care of the needs of the local community, hoping the government to set up a bazaar management committee to allow the participation of experienced hawkers. As for the TWGHs, the spokesperson replied that they would continue mutual communication by launching an estate-wide consultation. On 1 November 2012, the government opened a nearly one-month application for the license of operation. According to the relevant documents submitted by the Home Affairs Department, over 3,800 applicants applied‚Äî24 applicants competing for one stall on averageTin Shui Wai Bazaar competed by 24 people on average, Oriental Daily 2012, 12, 08‚Äîmeaning the competition for the license was stiff.

This makes it hard to earn a living, and some suffer losses. Some vendors complained that the government did not give enough support. The arising problems of Tin Sau Bazaar include the following. Location Few shops are open. Tin Sau Bazaar is on a plot of land on Tin Sau Road, near Tin Fu Court and Tin Yat Estate, that had lain unused for many years. Tin Sau Road is in Tin Shui Wai North, very far from the Tin Shui Wai town centre. The bazaar is mainly convenient to those living in Tin Yat Estate or Tin Fu Court. Citizens living in other public housing estates may find it difficult to find the bazaar, and it is inconvenient for them to buy daily necessities. This may lower the accessibility of Tin Sau Bazaar and this is why not many people are attracted by the bazaar.Legislative Council Press Releases ‚Äì Tin Sau Bazaar 2013, 6, 5 Transport For people living in Tin Shui Wai, the public transport that can reach Tin Sau Bazaar are Light Rail and bus. No shuttle bus is provided. After getting off the bus or Light Rail, it is a five-minute walk to Tin Sau Bazaar. Therefore, not many Tin Shui Wai residents are willing to go there and purchase items. For residents from other districts, West Rail is the fastest transport to get to Tin Shui Wai. After alighting from the West Rail, there is a 15-minute ride from Light Rail or bus to Tin Sau Bazaar. It is not very convenient for visitors.New way to help Tin Shui Wai, China Daily Clips 2013, 4, 11 Design It is behind the housing. The design of Tin Sau Bazaar has many problems. Firstly, the entrance does not face the housing. The nearby facilities are some basketball courts and parks. If residents want to enter the bazaar, they have to walk for a long way to find the entrance, which is troublesome. Residents may prefer to patronize local supermarkets or markets instead. On the other side of the bazaar, there is a long, tall wire netting encircling the area. That means everyone should enter the bazaar only by that entrance. Secondly, the facilities are far from enough. Tin Sau Bazaar has poor covering, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems. When it rains, few are willing to go there and purchase goods. When it is summertime, the high temperature and scorching sunshine make buyers feel uncomfortable. The design of the bazaar is inconvenient and that deters consumers.Universal Suffrage; Occupy Central; Land Use Controversies; Tin Sau Bazaar [15:26-21:05], RTHK, 2013, 3,15 Promotion and publicity Difficult to see some banners The government is mostly responsible for the funding of setting up the stalls and construction procedures, rather than the promotional issues. In other words, the TWGHs is responsible for the publicity efforts and the related expenditure. There are not many promotional activities especially around the few months after the opening up of Tin Sau Bazaar. Another inadequacy is about the issue of banners. The banners are far from enough, and they are difficult to be noticed. Business strategies The hawkers are largely low-skilled grassroots; most of them lack business acumen. Although some of their goods sold are generally a bit cheaper than those sold in local supermarkets, their products (which include clothing, footwear, foodstuffs and grocery items) lack distinguishable and distinctive features. This discourages local consumers and consumers outside Tin Shui Wai District from purchasing in the bazaar as they find the items unattractive.Tin Shui Wai market forces stall, SCMP 2013, 2, 2Tin Sau Bazaar: Milestone for City of Sadness, 2013, 4, 26 Transport The market is roughly 250 metres from the Tin Sau Stop and Tin Yat Stop of the Light Rail.

In the 1850s Schwartzburg began to sell some of his land holding to others, and a railroad depot was established in the area.

The method's advantages are that it is easy to understand and implement, at least for simple material relations; and that its convergence rate is faster than some other finite differencing methods, such as forward and backward differencing. The right side of the convection-diffusion equation, which basically highlights the diffusion terms, can be represented using central difference approximation. To simplify the solution and analysis, linear interpolation can be used logically to compute the cell face values for the left side of this equation, which is nothing but the convective terms. Therefore, cell face values of property for a uniform grid can be written as:An introduction to computational fluid dynamics by HK VERSTEEG and W.MALALASEKERA, : \\\\Phi_e =(\\\\Phi_P + \\\\Phi_E)/2 : \\\\Phi_w =(\\\\Phi_W + \\\\Phi_P)/2 Steady-state convection diffusion equation The convection‚Äìdiffusion equation is a collective representation of diffusion and convection equations, and describes or explains every physical phenomenon involving convection and diffusion in the transference of particles, energy and other physical quantities inside a physical system:An introduction to computational fluid dynamics by HK VERSTEEG and W.MALALASEKERA, : \\\\operatorname{div}(\\\\rho u\\\\varphi)=\\\\operatorname{div}(\\\\Gamma abla\\\\varphi)+S_\\\\varphi; \\\\, ...where –ì is diffusion coefficient and Œ¶ is the property.

For a uniform grid, we can write cell face values of property Œ¶ as : \\\\varphi_e = (\\\\varphi_E + \\\\varphi_P)/2, \\\\quad \\\\varphi_w = (\\\\varphi_P + \\\\varphi_W)/2 On substituting this into integrated convection-diffusion equation, we obtain: : F_e\\\\frac{\\\\varphi_E + \\\\varphi_P}2 - F_w\\\\frac{\\\\varphi_W + \\\\varphi_P}2 = D_e(\\\\varphi_E - \\\\varphi_P) - D_w(\\\\varphi_P - \\\\varphi_W) And on rearranging: : \\\\left[\\\\left(D_w + \\\\frac{F_w}2\\\\right) + \\\\left(D_e - \\\\frac{F_e}2\\\\right) + (F_e - F_w)\\\\right]\\\\varphi_P = \\\\left(D_w + \\\\frac{F_w}2 \\\\right)\\\\varphi_W + \\\\left(D_e - \\\\frac{F_e}2 \\\\right)\\\\varphi_E a_P \\\\varphi_P = a_W \\\\varphi_W + a_E\\\\varphi_E Different aspects of central differencing scheme= Conservativeness  Conservation is ensured in central differencing scheme since overall flux balance is obtained by summing the net flux through each control volume taking into account the boundary fluxes for the control volumes around nodes 1 and 4. Figure 3.Typical illustration Boundary flux for control volume around node 1 and 4 : \\\\begin{align} & \\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\Gamma_{e_1} (\\\\varphi_2 - \\\\varphi_1)}{ \\\\delta x} - q_A\\\\right] + \\\\left[ \\\\frac {\\\\Gamma_{e_2} (\\\\varphi_3 - \\\\varphi_2)}{ \\\\delta x} - \\\\frac{ \\\\Gamma_{w_2} (\\\\varphi_2 - \\\\varphi_1)}{ \\\\delta x}\\\\right] [10pt] \\\\+ {} & \\\\left[ \\\\frac{ \\\\Gamma_{e_3} (\\\\varphi_4 - \\\\varphi_3)}{\\\\delta x} - \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma_{w_3} (\\\\varphi_3 - \\\\varphi_2)}{\\\\delta x}\\\\right] + \\\\left[q_B - \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma_{w_4} (\\\\varphi_4 - \\\\varphi_3)}{\\\\delta x}\\\\right] = q_B - q_A \\\\end{align} because \\\\Gamma_{e_1} = \\\\Gamma_{w_2} , \\\\Gamma_{e_2} = \\\\Gamma_{w_3} , \\\\Gamma_{e_3} = \\\\Gamma_{w_4}  Boundedness  Central differencing scheme satisfies first condition of boundedness. Since F_e - F_w = 0 from continuity equation, therefore; a_P \\\\varphi_P = a_W \\\\varphi_W + a_E\\\\varphi_E Another essential requirement for boundedness is that all coefficients of the discretised equations should have the same sign (usually all positive). But this is only satisfied when (peclet number) F_e/D_e < 2 because for a unidirectional flow(F_e >0, F_w > 0) a_E = (D_e - F_e/2) is always positive if D_e > F_e/2  Transportiveness  It requires that transportiveness changes according to magnitude of peclet number i.e. when pe is zero \\\\varphi is spread in all directions equally and as Pe increases (convection > diffusion) \\\\varphi at a point largely depends on upstream value and less on downstream value. But central differencing scheme does not possess transportiveness at higher pe since Œ¶ at a point is average of neighbouring nodes for all Pe.  Accuracy  The Taylor series truncation error of the central differencing scheme is second order. Central differencing scheme will be accurate only if Pe < 2\\\\. Owing to this limitation, central differencing is not a suitable discretisation practice for general purpose flow calculations. Applications of central differencing schemes *They are currently used on a regular basis in the solution of the Euler equations and Navier‚ÄìStokes equations. *Results using central differencing approximation have shown noticeable improvements in accuracy in smooth regions. *Shock wave representation and boundary-layer definition can be improved on coarse meshes. Advantages *Simpler to program, requires less computer time per step, and works well with multigrid acceleration techniques *Has a free parameter in conjunction with the fourth- difference dissipation, which is needed to approach a steady state. *More accurate than the first-order upwind scheme if the Peclet number is less than 2. Disadvantages * Somewhat more dissipative * Leads to oscillations in the solution or divergence if the local Peclet number is larger than 2.http://www.bakker.org/dartmouth06/engs150/05-solv.ppt See also *Finite difference method *Finite difference *Taylor series *Taylor theorem *Convection‚Äìdiffusion equation *Diffusion *Convection *Peclet number *Linear interpolation *Symmetric derivative *Upwind differencing scheme for convection  References Further reading * Computational Fluid Dynamics: The Basics with Applications ‚Äì John D.

Biography He was born on 6 February 1710 in Castle Yard, Holborn in London where his father was a prosperous tailor. He may have attended a school at Hitchin; he was apprenticed to a mercer in the city but, showing little disposition for business, he may have taken chambers in the Temple as a law student.\\"His name cannot now be traced in the records of any of the inns of court, nor can any early squibs be identified, but he was apprenticed in 1724 to John Wheatly, a painter‚Äìstainer\\" . However, he spent a number of years in Fleet Prison for backing a bill which Charles Fleetwood (theatre manager) failed to pay. While in prison Whitehead is said to have made his first literary efforts in the shape of political squibs. His first more elaborate production, \\"State Dunces\\", a satire in heroic couplets, was published in 1733. It was inscribed to Pope, the first of whose 'Imitations of Horace' dates from the same year, and whose Dunciad had appeared in 1728. Pope's rhythm, together with certain other characteristics of his satirical verse, is perhaps as successfully reproduced by Whitehead as by any contemporary writer; but he is altogether lacking in concentration and in anything like seriousness of purpose. The chief \\"State Dunce\\" is Walpole (Appius); others are Francis Hare, bishop of Chichester, and the Whig historian James Ralph. The poem, which provoked an answer under the title of A Friendly Epistle, was sold to Robert Dodsley for ¬£10. cites Boswell in Life, ed. Birkbeck Hill, i. 124‚Äì5. records Johnson's refusal to accept a smaller sum for his London in 1738, on the ground that he \\"would not take less than Paul Whitehead\\", and adds an absurd apology for Johnson's \\"prejudice\\" against him. In 1735 Whitehead married Anna, only daughter of Sir Swinnerton Dyer, bart., of Spains Hall, Essex, by which time he was either out of the Fleet, or his marriage provided him with the means to do so. In 1739 he published \\"Manners\\", the satirical poem so highly thought of by Boswell, but considered by Johnson a \\"poor performance\\". cites Boswell, Life, v. 116. The manuscript is preserved in British Museum Additional MS. 25277, ff. 117‚Äì20. It cannot be said to exhibit any advance upon its predecessor, nor can its clamorous vituperation: Shall Pope alone the plenteous harvest have, And I not glean one straggling fool or knave? be held to be dignified by its pretence of proceeding from a patriot whose hopes are centred in Frederick, Prince of Wales. The personalities in this satire led to the author being summoned, with his publisher, before the bar of the House of Lords; but Whitehead absconded. notes see Robert Dodsley Whether or not the action of the Lords had been intended as a warning to Pope, whose two \\"Dialogues\\", 1738 (Epilogue to the Satires), had done their utmost to make the existing political tension unbearable, it at least sufficed to muzzle Whitehead for the moment. He continued, however, to make himself generally useful to the opposition. Thus in 1741 Horace Walpole mentions him as ordering a supper for eight patriots who had tried in vain to beat up a mob on the occasion of Admiral Vernon's birthday. cites Letters, ed. Cunningham, i. 92. His next publication, \\"The Gymnasiad\\" (1744), is a harmless mock heroic in three short books or cantos, with \\"Prolegomena\\" by Scriblerus Tertius, and \\"Notes Variorum\\", in ridicule of the pugilistic fancy of the day, and dedicated to John Broughton, one of the most celebrated Sons of Hockley and fierce Brickstreet breed. In 1747 he published his last would-be political satire, Honour, in which Liberty is introduced as prepared to follow Virtue in quitting these shores, unless specially detained by \\"Stanhope\\" (Chesterfield). About the same time he is stated to have edited the Apology for the Conduct of Mrs. Teresia Constantia Phillips first published in 3 vols. in 1748. Whitehead had now become a paid hanger-on of the Prince's Friends, and in the Westminster election of 1749 was engaged to compose advertisements, handbills, and the like for their candidate, Sir George Vandeput. When Alexander Murray, a supporter of the opposition candidate, was sent to Newgate Prison and detained there for a considerable period on the charge of having headed a riot, Whitehead composed a pamphlet on his case, which appealed to the indignation of the people of Great Britain as well as of the electors of Westminster. notes: see extracts ap. E. Thompson; and cf. Lord Orford's Memoirs of the Reign of George II, ed. Lord Holland, s.d. 28 June 1751. In 1751 the prince died, and in 1755 Whitehead published his Epistle to Dr. Thompson, a physician of dissolute habits, who had quarrelled with the treatment adopted by the prince's physicians in his last illness, and whom Whitehead, from whatever motive, strives to justify by indiscriminate abuse of the \\"college\\". A pamphlet published by him in defence of Admiral Byng (1757) is said by Hawkins to be written in a defiant strain, as if an acquittal were certain. During this period or immediately following Whitehead was to suffer the deepest degradation of his life. His political intimacy with Sir Francis Dashwood, 11th Baron le Despencer and other politicians, and his literary talents, made him an acceptable member of the dissipated circle calling themselves the \\"monks of Medmenham Abbey\\", and he was appointed secretary and steward of the Hellfire Club. This made him an easy target of the scalp-hunting satirist Charles Churchill, who found in him a ready victim. In three of Churchill's satires he was branded as a \\"disgrace on manhood\\" (The Conference, 1763), as \\"the aged Paul\\" who chalks the score of the blasphemous revellers behind the door (The Candidate, 1764), and as the type of the \\"kept bard\\" (Independence, 1764). The times were not squeamish, and Churchill's testimony was not respected; but the charges were unanswerable, and Whitehead is remembered for little else. Whitehead had, however, at the time, been rewarded for his services by being appointed, through Sir Francis Dashwood, probably during his chancellorship of the exchequer in Lord Bute's ministry (1762‚Äì3), to a Deputy Treasurership of the Chamber, as one of his biographers calls it, worth ¬£800 a year. This enabled him to enlarge the cottage on Twickenham Common where he had for some years resided. notes that in 1755 Horace Walpole mentions him as one of the celebrities of the locality; see Walpole Letters, ii. 447. In his Epistle to Dr. Thompson he describes, quite in Pope's Horatian vein, the modest comforts of his retirement, and he appears to have been popular both in the country, where he was known for his kindliness, and in London society, where among his friends were Hogarth and Hayman, and the actor and dramatist William Havard. Sir John Hawkins, however, says that \\"in his conversation there was little to praise; it was desultory, vociferous, and profane. He had contracted a habit of swearing in his younger years, which he retained to his latest\\". Whitehead published very little in his later years‚Äîa pamphlet on Covent Garden stage disputes is mentioned in 1768‚Äîbut he wrote a few songs for his friend the actor Beard and others. On 20 December 1774 he died in his lodgings in Henrietta Street, Covent Garden, having during the course of a protracted illness burnt all his manuscripts within his reach. In his will he left his heart to his patron, Lord Le Despenser, by whose orders it was buried in the mausoleum at High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire, amid solemnities which under the circumstances might, like the bequest itself, have been omitted. A collection of his Poems and Miscellaneous Compositions, with a life by Captain Edward Thompson, which is dedicated to Lord Le Despenser, and written in a strain of turgid and senseless flattery, appeared at London in 1777 (4to).His portrait, painted by Gainsborough, was engraved by Collyer in 1776, and prefixed to the 1777 edition of Whitehead's Poems ( cites Bromley, p. 896).

The only known specimen was discovered in Utah in the Wahweap Formation of the Grand Staircase‚ÄìEscalante National Monument in 2009, and it consists of a partial skull and skeleton. In 2013, it became the basis of the new genus and species Lythronax argestes; the generic name Lythronax means \\"gore king\\", and the specific name argestes originates from the Greek poet Homer's name for the wind from the southwest, in reference to the specimen's geographic provenance in North America. Size estimates for Lythronax have ranged between in length, and between in weight. It was a heavily built tyrannosaurid, and as a member of that group, it would have had small, two-fingered forelimbs, strong hindlimbs, and a very robust skull. The rear part of the skull of Lythronax appears to have been very broad, with eye sockets that faced forwards to a similar degree as seen in Tyrannosaurus. Lythronax had 11 tooth sockets in the of the upper jaw; most tyrannosaurids had more. The frontmost teeth were the largest, the longest being almost long. Other details of the skull and skeleton which distinguished Lythronax from other tyrannosaurids included the s-shaped outer margin of the maxilla and a process of the of the ankle, a projection that expanded further upwards compared to its relatives. The holotype was found in the middle member of the Wahweap Formation, which dates to the Campanian stage of the Cretaceous. Lythronax is thus the oldest known member of the family Tyrannosauridae, and it is thought to have been more basal than Tyrannosaurus. Due to its age, Lythronax is important for understanding the evolutionary origins of tyrannosaurids, including the development of their anatomical specializations. The forward-facing eyes of Lythronax gave it depth perception, which may have been useful during pursuit or ambush predation. Discovery and naming Map showing the Nipple Butte area (‚òÖ) of Grand Staircase‚ÄìEscalante National Monument, where Lythronax was found in the Wahweap Formation In 2009, Scott Richardson of the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) was searching for fossils with a co-worker in the Wahweap Formation of the Grand Staircase‚ÄìEscalante National Monument, southern Utah, when they came across a leg and of a theropod dinosaur in the Nipple Butte area. Richardson contacted a team of paleontologists at the University of Utah, who were excited but initially skeptical, since theropod fossils had not been discovered in the area before. They were sent a photo of the nasal bone from which they identified it as belonging to a tyrannosaur, which was likely a new species because it came from an age with no known members of that group. The fossil remains were carefully excavated over a year by a joint team from the BLM and the Natural History Museum of Utah (UMNH). The locality, which is public land, was designated as UMNH VP 1501. Prior to the dinosaur's formal description, it had been referred to as the \\"Nipple Butte Tyrannosaur\\" or \\"Wahweap tyrannosaurid\\". The specimen, UMNH VP 20200 (with the prefix denoting its storage in the UMNH), was made the holotype of the new genus and species Lythronax argestes by paleontologist Mark A. Loewen and colleagues in 2013. The generic name is derived from the Greek words lythron (ŒªœçŒ∏œÅŒøŒΩ), meaning \\"gore\\", and anax (·ºÑŒΩŒ±Œæ), meaning \\"king\\". The specific name argestes (·ºÄœÅŒ≥ŒµœÉœÑŒÆœÇ) is a Greek name used by the poet Homer for the wind from the southwest, in reference to where the specimen was found within North America. In full, the scientific name can be translated as \\"gore king (or \\"king of gore\\") from the southwest\\". Loewen stated that the suffix meaning \\"king\\" in the name of Lythronax was intended to allude to its later, similar relative Tyrannosaurus rex. The prefix meaning \\"gore\\" was chosen to exemplify \\"its presumed lifestyle as a predator with its head covered in the blood of a dead animal\\". Skeletal diagrams showing holotype remains of Lythronax (A) and a Teratophoneus specimen (B). N‚ÄìP show selected bones of the former The holotype and single known specimen of Lythronax consists of a partial skull and skeleton, which includes the right , both nasals, the right , the left , the left , the right , the right , the left , the left , the left , the left , a , a caudal , both , the left and , and left second and fourth . In the paper that named Lythronax, the authors also described a new specimen of the geologically younger tyrannosaur Teratophoneus (which had been named in 2011); this genus is known from the Kaiparowits Formation of Grand Staircase‚ÄìEscalante, and the two tyrannosaurs were used to investigate the evolutionary and geographical origins of the family Tyrannosauridae. Based on the paper's conclusions, the UMNH referred to Lythronax as a \\"great-uncle\\" of Tyrannosaurus on their website. In 2017, the US government announced plans to shrink the Grand Staircase‚ÄìEscalante (to little over half its size) and Bears Ears monuments to enable coal mining and other energy development on the land; this was the largest reduction of US national monuments in history. Lythronax itself was one of two dinosaurs from the former monument mentioned in the presidential proclamation, along with Diabloceratops. American paleontologist Scott D. Sampson (a co-describer of Lythronax), who had overseen much of the early research at the monument, expressed fear that such a move would threaten further discoveries. Media outlets stressed the importance of the area's fossil discoveries‚Äîincluding more than 25 new taxa‚Äîwhile some highlighted Lythronax as one of the significant finds. The US government was subsequently sued by a group of scientists, environmentalists, and Native Americans; the lawsuit is ongoing. Description Size compared to a human At the time Lythronax was announced, news sites reported size estimates of about in length and around in weight, based on comparisons to the much larger relative Tyrannosaurus; Loewen stated that it may have grown even larger. American paleontologist Gregory S. Paul gave a lower estimate of in length and a weight of only in 2016. Lythronax was a relatively robust tyrannosaurid. Like other members of the group, it would have possessed small, two-fingered forelimbs, large and strong hindlimbs, broad jaws, and a very robustly constructed skull. Although earlier small-bodied members of the superfamily Tyrannosauroidea possessed protofeathers, their presence could have varied between species or the age of an individual. Holotype skull reconstructed from 3D scans shown in multiple views Lythronax had a relatively short snout and a broad skull (width over 40% of the length), as in other tyrannosaurids. The nasal bones along the top of the snout were much wider at the front than the middle, unlike in other tyrannosaurids. Viewed from above, the outer margins of the skull (formed by the maxilla and jugal bones) were strongly sigmoid-shaped (or s-shaped). Along with the width of the frontal bone (a bone at the top of the skull), this appeared to have made the rear part of Lythronaxs skull very broad, with orbits (eye sockets) that faced nearly forwards. These features are otherwise only known in Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus; earlier-diverging tyrannosaurids had less forward-facing orbits, and the rears of their skulls were narrower. Lythronax was also distinct in that the surfaces of the frontal bone that contacted the prefrontal and postorbital bones at its front and rear sides were separated by only a narrow groove. The maxillae of Lythronax were robust and strongly convex along their outer margins, as in all other known tyrannosaurids, but differed in their sigmoid-shaped margins. Lythronax had 11 (tooth sockets) in each maxilla, a trait shared with no tyrannosaurs other than Teratophoneus and Bistahieversor (other tyrannosaurs had 12 or more maxillary alveoli). The maxillary teeth were heterodont (differentiated), the first five being much larger than those following. Some of the frontmost teeth were almost long. The teeth were similar to bananas in shape, robust, and serrated. As in Tyrannosaurus, the shelf of the palate was well developed. The jugal bone (or \\"cheek\\" bone) was robust, and had a broad postorbital process (which projected upwards from the jugal to contact the postorbital bone), unlike other tyrannosaurs except Bistahieversor, Tyrannosaurus and Tarbosaurus. The front border of the postorbital process had a strong process which indicates that Lythronax had a large subocular flange (a projection into the lower part of the orbit), dissimilar to the smaller ones of other tyrannosaurids. Each ramus of the dentary (half of the tooth-bearing portion of the lower jaw) was strongly concave towards the outer side (bowing inwards along the length of the skull). This mirrored the contours of the maxilla of the upper jaw, and the strong expansion of the rear skull; this was similar to Bistahieversor, Tyrannosaurus, and Tarbosaurus, but unlike other tyrannosauroids. The dentary was also deep at the rear end, indicating that the following part of the mandible was comparable to Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus in depth, but not to other tyrannosaurids. Like other tyrannosaurids, the behind the dentary had a deep and well-developed shelf just in front of where the jaw articulated with the skull, and Lythronax was similar to Tyrannosaurus in that this shelf had a concave upper surface. Life restoration showing hypothetical feathers Though the postcranial skeleton of Lythronax is poorly known, the known remains of the pubis (part of the pelvis) and the hindlimb show features typical within Tyrannosauridae. The pubic boot, an expansion on the lower end of the pubis, had a large forward-directed process as in all tyrannosaurids. In Lythronax, the pubic boot was large and comparatively deep, most similar to those of Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, but dissimilar to the less expanded pubic boots of Teratophoneus, Albertosaurus, Gorgosaurus, and Daspletosaurus. The fibula, a bone of the lower leg, had a deep midline depression on its upper end, as in other tyrannosaurids. In Lythronax, the of the ankle had an ascending process above its articulation with the foot which was expanded further upwards compared to its relatives. Classification Lythronax argestes belongs to the family Tyrannosauridae, a family of large-bodied coelurosaurs; most tyrannosaurid genera are known from North America and Asia. Based on its stratigraphic position, Lythronax is the oldest tyrannosaurid discovered so far. Prior to Lythronax being formally named, Zanno and colleagues noted in 2013 that the holotype specimen was likely distinct from Teratophoneus and Bistahieversor, both likewise from southern Utah. This would mean there were at least three tyrannosaurid genera present in the Western Interior Basin during the Campanian stage. A phylogenetic analysis conducted by Zanno and colleagues placed all three taxa within a single group of Tyrannosauridae to the exclusion of all other members of the group. A detailed phylogenetic analysis, conducted by Loewen and colleagues to accompany their 2013 description of Lythronax, based on 303 cranial and 198 postcranial features, placed it and Teratophoneus within the subfamily Tyrannosaurinae. Lythronax was a sister taxon of a group consisting of the Maastrichtian taxa Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus and the late Campanian Zhuchengtyrannus. It was more closely related to this group than other taxa such as Daspletosaurus and Teratophoneus, which were younger than Lythronax but older than the group. In 2017, American paleontologists Stephen Brusatte and Thomas D. Carr published a new phylogenetic analysis of Tyrannosauroidea, including a more comprehensive suite of anatomical characteristics and taxa, that disagreed with the results of Loewen and colleagues. While the tribe Alioramini was outside Tyrannosauridae in the analysis by Loewen and colleagues, Brusatte and Carr placed that group as the most basal (early-diverging or \\"primitive\\") group within Tyrannosaurinae. Conversely, Loewen and colleagues found Bistahieversor to be a derived (\\"advanced\\") tyrannosaurine closely related to the likewise derived Teratophoneus and Lythronax, while Brusatte and Carr placed it in a more basal position directly outside Tyrannosauridae, with both Teratophoneus and Lythronax as basal tyrannosaurines. It was suggested that both of these results stemmed from an over-weighting of some features by Loewen and colleagues, which resulted in the long-snouted alioramin forms being excluded from the short-snouted tyrannosaurines, and the placement of Bistahieversor and Lythronax closer to Tyrannosaurus than otherwise. The results of the two contrasting analyses are shown in the cladograms below: Skull reconstruction (A), known skull bones (B), and selected skull bones of the holotype (C‚ÄìJ) Topology 1: Loewen and colleagues, 2013 Topology 2: Brusatte and Carr, 2017 In a popular book published in 2016, Paul suggested that Lythronax argestes may be a member of the genus Tyrannosaurus, and remarked that derived tyrannosaurids \\"are being badly oversplit at the genus level\\". Subsequent publications‚Äîincluding both taxonomic and phylogenetic analyses‚Äîhave retained the species in the separate genus Lythronax. Paleobiogeography Paleomap of North America during the Campanian age; Lythronax lived in southern Laramidia (lower left). During the Late Cretaceous period (around 95 million years ago), the Western Interior Seaway isolated western North America (Laramidia) from eastern North America (Appalachia), and occasionally isolated depositional basins from each other. This led to the development of highly endemic ecosystems in Laramidia; these ecosystems have also roughly been divided into a northern province and a southern province, but such a clean division is contested. Like many Laramidian dinosaur lineages, the evolutionary history of tyrannosaurids‚Äîwhich are limited in distribution to Asia and Laramidia‚Äîis characterized by faunal interchange between the two continents. The sequence of interchange events which occurred among Laramidian tyrannosaurids is unclear, and the diverse tyrannosauroids which have been discovered in southern Laramidia (including Lythronax, Teratophoneus, and Bistahieversor) have complicated their evolutionary history further. In particular, an unresolved question is whether Tyrannosaurus originated from Asian tyrannosaurids or from south Laramidian tyrannosaurids. Based on their phylogenetic results, Zanno and colleagues proposed that the then-unnamed Lythronax displayed features that united tyrannosaurids from southern Laramidia to the exclusion of other genera. While Loewen and colleagues did not recover a unique group of southern taxa, they did resolve all three as being closely related to each other and basal to a group of larger, later forms. From these results, Loewen and colleagues suggested that there was significant biogeographic division between northern Laramidian and southern Laramidian forms with limited interchange. Also, because they found Alioramini to be placed outside Tyrannosauridae, and the Asian genera Tarbosaurus and Zhuchengtyrannus in a group excluding all other tyrannosaurids, Loewen and colleagues proposed that there was only a single interchange of tyrannosaurids from North America to Asia. They suggested the interchange took place during the late Campanian, when global sea levels fell, Tyrannosaurus being descended from North American forms from before such migration took place. Correlation between sea level change and evolutionary diversification of Tyrannosauroidea as hypothesized by Loewen and colleagues in 2013 Due to their differing phylogenetic results, the biogeographic conclusions of Loewen and colleagues were disputed by Brusatte and Carr. Since Bistahieversor from southern Laramidia was placed outside Tyrannosauridae, and Teratophoneus from Utah nested closest to the Alaskan Nanuqsaurus, Brusatte and Carr instead suggested that there were dynamic and recurrent interchanges of tyrannosaurid fauna between northern and southern Laramidia, and rejected the presence of endemic provinces. The Asian taxa Tarbosaurus, Zhuchengtyrannus, Qianzhousaurus, and Alioramus were also placed within Tyrannosaurinae, among North American genera. Brusatte and Carr proposed that at least two continental interchanges occurred, where Tyrannosaurinae originated in Asia and migrated to North America after the divergence of alioramins, and then returned to Asia again with Tarbosaurus and Zhuchengtyrannus. Another possible scenario suggested by Brusatte and Carr was that two separate migrations to Asia occurred, which separately gave rise to alioramins and larger, later forms. In both scenarios, Tyrannosaurus, nested among Asian taxa, was an \\"invasive migrant species that spread across Laramidia\\" from Asia in the Maastrichtian. The hypotheses of Asian-North American migration of Brusatte and Carr were supported by a later run of their analysis by Canadian paleontologist Jared Voris and colleagues in 2020. However, Voris and colleagues amended the original analysis through the additions of the new genera Dynamoterror from southern Laramidia (New Mexico) and Thanatotheristes from northern Laramidia (Alberta), and they were able to replicate the north‚Äìsouth divisions of tyrannosaurids suggested by Loewen and colleagues. The southern taxa Teratophoneus, Dynamoterror, and Lythronax formed an exclusive group (to the exclusion of Nanuqsaurus, contrary to Brusatte and Carr) of short- and deep-snouted taxa outside a group of more derived northern Laramidian forms, and the southern Laramidian forms also had a separate skeletal morphotype. Voris and colleagues suggested these morphological differences arose for ecological reasons, possibly including prey composition or feeding strategies. As the major prey groups were the same between northern and southern Laramidia when tyrannosaurids lived in those regions, Voris and colleagues concluded the differences in cranial anatomy arose from differences in feeding strategies. Paleobiology Lythronax differed from most other tyrannosaurids due to its shortened skull with a broadened rear, as well as its forward-directed orbits (which were a direct consequence of its skull morphology). No other tyrannosauroids had such forward-directed orbits except for Tyrannosaurus and Tarbosaurus, although more derived tyrannosauroids generally had larger and more forward-directed orbits than basal tyrannosauroids. The discovery of Lythronax suggests that these characters had appeared by at least 80 million years ago. The forward- directed orbits of Lythronax would have enhanced the field of view of its binocular vision by increasing the separation between the orbits and making their lines of sight more parallel to each other (i.e. reducing the optic axis divergence), which would have given Lythronax depth perception. In 2006, paleontologist Kent Stevens suggested that the similar orbits of Tyrannosaurus would have aided either pursuit predation by the observation of distant prey and the three-dimensional detection of obstacles, or ambush predation by the ability to judge the timing and direction of lunges. As a tyrannosaurid, Lythronax would likely have shared the group's other specializations to predatory lifestyles, including large body size; a large skull with powerful jaw muscles and robust teeth; reinforced sutures holding the skull bones together; and relatively small forelimbs. The teeth and jaw muscles of Lythronax would have contributed to strong bite forces, for not just carving out chunks of flesh but also crushing bone. The stresses and loads of these bites would have been effectively absorbed by the fused, arched nasal bones and the reinforced sutures. Paleoenvironment Reconstructed skeleton in front view, UMNH Lythronax was found in terrestrial sedimentary rocks belonging to the lower part of the middle member of the Wahweap Formation. These rocks have been radioisotopically dated to 79.6 to 80.75 million years ago, meaning that Lythronax lived approximately 80 million years ago, and thus dates to the Campanian. The overall Wahweap Formation has been radiometrically dated as being between 81 and 76 million years old. During the time Lythronax lived, the Western Interior Seaway was at its widest extent, almost completely isolating southern Laramidia from the rest of North America. The area where dinosaurs existed included lakes, floodplains, and rivers, which flowed east. The Wahweap Formation is part of the Grand Staircase region, an immense sequence of sedimentary rock layers that stretch south from Bryce Canyon National Park through Zion National Park and into the Grand Canyon. Among other lines of evidence, the presence of rapidly deposited sediments suggests a wet, seasonal climate. Lythronax was likely the largest predator of its ecosystem. It shared its paleoenvironment with other dinosaurs, such as the hadrosaurs Acristavus and Adelolophus, the ceratopsian Diabloceratops, and unnamed ankylosaurs and pachycephalosaurs. Vertebrates present in the Wahweap Formation at the time included freshwater fish, bowfins, abundant rays and sharks, turtles such as Compsemys, crocodilians, and lungfish. Numerous mammals lived in this region, which included several genera of multituberculates, cladotherians, marsupials, and placental insectivores. The mammals were more primitive than those that lived in the younger Kaiparowits Formation. Trace fossils are relatively abundant in the Wahweap Formation, and suggest the presence of crocodylomorphs, as well as ornithischian and theropod dinosaurs. Evidence of invertebrate activity in this formation ranged from fossilized insect burrows in petrified logs to fossils of mollusks, large crabs, and a wide diversity of gastropods and ostracods.

The mountain extends from east to west and has a length of 85 km, a width of 15 km, and an area of 84,050 hectares. Jabal Abdulaziz consists of a series of hills and valleys whose altitudes ranges between 350 and 920 meters. The mountain has taken its name after Abdul Aziz, a descendant of Abdul-Qadir Gilani, a military commander in Saladin's army, who had once taken the mountain as a fortified place. The former name of the mountain was  æAl-·∏§iyƒÅl ÿßŸÑÿ≠ŸäÿßŸÑ. The mount is currently under the control of Kurdish YPG forces. Population In the Ottoman era, the area was transiently populated by nomadic Arab herders who wandered the arid plains between the ridge and the area of Mardin (now in Turkey). With the post-Ottoman establishment of the Syro-Turkish border and the increasing promotion of sedentary agriculture by colonial and state authorities, these tribes began to be forced to permanently settle during the French Mandate, with the first permanent settlement established in the 1950s. As of 2007, there are around twenty villages and thirty smaller farming settlements scattered around the foot of the ridge with a total population of between 13,000 and 15,000 individuals. All of the inhabitants of the area are Arabs of the Baqqarat al-Jabal tribe, save for one village of the Sayyad tribe (which has integrated with the former). It is one of the poorest areas in Syria, largely due to arid conditions and exacerbated by land use restrictions in place around the nature reserve established on the mountain. Many inhabitants have migrated to Hasakah city and the nearby town of Tall Tamer to seek better conditions.

MorisonNew York Times obituary of Elting E. Morison was an American historian of technology, military biographer, author of nonfiction books, and essayist. He was an MIT professor and the founder of MIT's Science, Technology, and Society (STS) program.  Biography  Morison, a grand-nephew of the engineer George S. Morison, was born in Milwaukee. He studied at Harvard University, earning an BA degree in 1932 and an MA in 1934, returning in 1935‚Äì1937 as assistant dean. In 1935 he married Anne Hitchcock Sims, daughter of U.S. Admiral William Sims, whose biography he published in 1942 a few months after the Pearl Harbor Attack; it became the standard scholarly biography. During World War II, Morison served in the U.S. Naval Reserve. Morison first came to MIT in 1946 as an assistant professor of humanities in the Sloan School of Industrial Management. In 1948 the Roosevelt Memorial Association hired Morison as director of the Theodore Roosevelt Research Project, which resulted in the 8-volume standard work The Letters of Theodore Roosevelt (1951‚Äì1954) (including his autobiography), of which he was the editor. Fellow MIT professor John Morton Blum was co-editor. In 1966 Morison joined Yale University as master of Timothy Dwight College and as a professor of history and American studies. In 1972 Morison rejoined MIT as the holder of the Killian Chair of the Humanities, playing a major role in conceiving and planning the interdisciplinary program that would later be known as Science, Technology, and Society (STS), which is designed to reveal the sweep of technological change as recorded in the history of science, technology, and industrial development, with an accent on the U.S, focusing on the interaction between scientific, technological, and social factors. In 1974 Morison published From Know-How to Nowhere: The Development of American Technology, \\"in which he tried to explain the development of American technology from 1800, when the nation was not able to build a 26-mile canal between the Charles and Merrimack Rivers in Massachusetts, to the late 1960s, when men flung themselves to the moon.\\" He died in 1995 in Peterborough, New Hampshire.

Currently it is occupied by Kelmƒó Regional Museum. Of the nine buildings on the 15.2 hectare estate, three are used for the display of museum artifacts. History The Kelmƒó Estate dates back to the 15th century, when it was owned by the Grand Duke of Lithuania. It was passed to Jonas Kontautas at the end of the century, then to the Polish Gruzewski family in 1591. They actively supported the Reformation, establishing a Protestant parish in Kelmƒó in 1596, and they built the Protestant church in 1622 and founded the first school in Kelmƒó. They also established an extensive library and archive of Reformation history, which includes about 5000 rare volumes, as well as numismatic collections including Greek and Roman coins. The manor was built about 1780 and was owned for many years by the Gruzewski family. In 1831, Kelmƒó Estate was at the centre of an unsuccessful rebellion against Czarist Russia. Work was done on the manor in 1892 by architect F. Lehmann, and a project to establish a park was prepared in 1898, and in 1892 Bronislavas Gruzewski established a butter manufacturing company Biruta. In 1940 the estate was taken over, and the owners, Gabriele Gruzewska and her daughters Sofia and Adolfina, were expelled and eventually exiled to Siberia. Baron von Haren occupied the estate during the German occupation, and in 1941 the archive was moved to the Au≈°ros museum in ≈†iauliai, from which it was transferred to the Library of the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences in 1952. After the war the manor was used as a school, the Centre of Soviet Economy of Aviculture. A historic barn on the estate was restored and renovated as part of the museum and opened in January 2010, funded by ‚Ç¨289,877 from the Norwegian Financial Mechanism in Lithuania.

These boundary conditions include inlet boundary conditions, outlet boundary conditions, wall boundary conditions, constant pressure boundary conditions, axisymmetric boundary conditions, symmetric boundary conditions, and periodic or cyclic boundary conditions. Transient problems require one more thing i.e., initial conditions where initial values of flow variables are specified at nodes in the flow domain. Various types of boundary conditions are used in CFD for different conditions and purposes and are discussed as follows. Inlet boundary conditions  200px In inlet boundary conditions, the distribution of all flow variables needs to be specified at inlet boundaries mainly flow velocity. This type of boundary conditions are common and specified mostly where inlet flow velocity is known. Outlet boundary condition 200px In outlet boundary conditions, the distribution of all flow variables needs to be specified, mainly flow velocity. This can be thought as a conjunction to inlet boundary condition. This type of boundary conditions is common and specified mostly where outlet velocity is known. The flow attains a fully developed state where no change occurs in the flow direction when the outlet is selected far away from the geometrical disturbances. In such region, an outlet could be outlined and the gradient of all variables could be equated to zero in the flow direction except pressure. No-slip boundary condition 200px The most common boundary that comes upon in confined fluid flow problems is the wall of the conduit. The appropriate requirement is called the no-slip boundary condition, wherein the normal component of velocity is fixed at zero, and the tangential component is set equal to the velocity of the wall. It may run counter to intuition, but the no-slip condition has been firmly established in both experiment and theory, though only after decades of controversy and debate. V_\\\\textrm{normal}=0 V_\\\\textrm{tangential}=V_\\\\textrm{wall} Heat transfer through the wall can be specified or if the walls are considered adiabatic, then heat transfer across the wall is set to zero. Q_\\\\textrm{Adiabatic Walls}=0 Constant pressure boundary conditions 200px This type of boundary condition is used where boundary values of pressure are known and the exact details of the flow distribution are unknown. This includes pressure inlet and outlet conditions mainly. Typical examples that utilize this boundary condition include buoyancy driven flows, internal flows with multiple outlets, free surface flows and external flows around objects. An example is flow outlet into atmosphere where pressure is atmospheric. Axisymmetric boundary conditions 200px In this boundary condition, the model is axisymmetric with respect to the main axis such that at a particular r = R, all Œ∏s and each z = Z-slice, each flow variable has the same value. A good example is the flow in a circular pipe where the flow and pipe axes coincide. V_r(R, \\\\theta, Z) = Constant (r=R, \\\\theta, Z) Symmetric boundary condition 200px In this boundary condition, it is assumed that on the two sides of the boundary, same physical processes exist. All the variables have same value and gradients at the same distance from the boundary. It acts as a mirror that reflects all the flow distribution to the other side. The conditions at symmetric boundary are no flow across boundary and no scalar flux across boundary. A good example is of a pipe flow with a symmetric obstacle in the flow. The obstacle divides the upper flow and lower flow as mirrored flow. Periodic or cyclic boundary condition 200px A periodic or cyclic boundary condition arises from a different type of symmetry in a problem. If a component has a repeated pattern in flow distribution more than twice, thus violating the mirror image requirements required for symmetric boundary condition. A good example would be swept vane pump (Fig.), where the marked area is repeated four times in r-theta coordinates. The cyclic-symmetric areas should have the same flow variables and distribution and should satisfy that in every Z-slice.

Prior to assuming his current role, he was the executive director of Amnesty International USA. He was previously the Executive Vice President and Chief Program Officer of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). He also held position as executive director of the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, as senior program manager at Justice, Equality, Human Dignity and Tolerance Foundation, and as program executive at Atlantic Philanthropies and as an attorney for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. Hawkins is known for bringing litigation that led to the release of three teenagers wrongfully convicted and sentenced to death row in Tennessee.  Life and education = Early life  Hawkins was born in Peekskill, New York and raised in Ossining, New York, which was home to Sing Sing Correctional Facility. In high school Hawkins attended a field trip to Sing Sing where he met with inmates who opened his eyes and inspired his lifelong commitment to social justice advocacy. Hawkins grew up with reminders of the injustices of a U.S. criminal justice system that disproportionately targets minorities and the economically disadvantaged. Many of the inmates were Black Panthers or inmates from Attica who fought inhumane prison conditions.  Education  Hawkins graduated from Harvard College, B.S., Economics, 1984. In 1985, Hawkins spent a year at the University of Zimbabwe during the turmoil, repression and massacre of civilians at the hands of rebels during the country's first post-independence election. He also attended New York University School of Law as a Root Tilden scholar. It was during Hawkins legal studies where he encountered his first glimpse of injustice on a global scale. After graduating in 1988, he clerked for Judge A. Leon Higginbotham of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In 2003, Hawkins was the recipient of the Law School's Public Interest Service Award.  Career  As an attorney with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, Hawkins represented African American men facing the death penalty throughout the Deep South. He continued his work in social justice focused on abolishing the death penalty. He led a powerful partnership of organizations as executive director of the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty in Washington, D.C. that successfully campaigned to abolish the death penalty for juvenile crimes. Following his tenure at the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, Hawkins moved into philanthropy to advocate for human rights and social justice causes at the JEHT Foundation and later at Atlantic Philanthropies. Returning to the NAACP as Executive Vice President and Chief Program Officer, Hawkins continued at the forefront of social justice often working in coalition with Amnesty International USA on abolishing the death penalty and national security issues.  Career at NAACP  During his six years at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, represented African American men facing the death penalty throughout the Deep South. He investigated and brought litigation that saved the lives and led to the release of three black teens on death row wrongfully convicted in Tennessee.

The siege began on 19 May 1591 after a clever ruse by the besiegers. The city was then besieged for eleven days, after which the Spanish garrison surrendered.van Nimwegen pg. 155 Background Zutphen was a Hanseatic city on the east bank of the River IJssel. In 1572, with the resurgence of the Dutch rebellion against Philip II of Spain, Zutphen was first conquered by State troops led by Willem IV van den Bergh. The city was later recaptured by the Spaniards led by Don Frederick, and the population was punished and then slaughtered for the surrender earlier that year.Motley, p. 60 In 1586, the English under the Earl of Leicester took Zutphen's important outlying sconce, but soon English turncoat Rowland York handed the sconce over to the Spaniards, leaving Zutphen in their complete control. York died there of smallpox a year later, although he may have been poisoned by the Spanish to keep him from betraying again.Bertie, Five Generations of a Loyal House, p. 120; but cf. Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1581‚Äì90, p. 466, where he is said to have died of the smallpox. As a consequence, William Stanley handed over the nearby town of Deventer to the Spaniards.Randall, pp. 790‚Äì791 In 1590, Maurice had taken Breda by hiding soldiers within a peat barge and was thus able to use Breda as a base for further operations. The Dutch army could then launch an offensive at three points: to the South, to the East, and to the North. Maurice headed towards Nijmegen to the East along the River IJssel. By the beginning of 1591, Maurice's first goal was to take back Zutphen. With the parallel waterways, he could then move the troops and artillery as quickly as possible and also keep the Spanish from reinforcing the besieged towns. The garrison of Zutphen itself consisted of nearly 1,000 Spaniards and Walloons, and on the west bank of the river lay the important sconce. Siege Maurice's army consisted of 9000 soldiers and 1600 horsemen which marched to Zutphen, along with 100 ships. (1998): Duizend jaar weer, wind en water in de Lage Landen. Deel 4: 1575-1675 Franeker: Van Wijnen (Dutch) The rapid march in five days meant that Maurice could then prepare his artillery, which was stored on the ships; a far easier method of transportation than trying to haul them overland over boggy ground. (2002): Vuur in beweging: 325 jaar veldartillerie, 1677-2002 Uitgeverij Boom. (Dutch) In order to take Zutphen, the sconce on the west bank had to be taken, as it controlled the main bridge to the town. Once this had been taken, the town could be besieged proper once all the heavy guns from the barges had disembarked. Maurice hoped to use another ruse similar to the one he had used at Breda with the peat barge. Francis Vere, in charge of the English troops, wanted the 'dirt' removed from the 1587 treachery and thus wanted to lead the assault. Vere got his wish and Maurice ordered him to take the sconce on the Veluwe opposite Zutphen by sending no more than a dozen men and disguise them as farmers, some even dressed as women. It was hoped that the Spanish would think they were refugees escaping the Dutch army and would let them in. Once the sconce was captured Zutphen would have no hope of holding out.Robinson pg. 97 Vere led the English troops to Doesburg and set the plan in motion. The disguised soldiers ran towards the fort, \\"pursued\\" by a fake cavalry charge. The garrison opened the gates and let the disguised soldiers in; the English then went as far as selling the guards butter, cheese, and eggs. When the order was given the English cut down the guard quickly enough to allow the Dutch cavalry to rush in, followed by the rest of the troops as they had been hidden by a large mound nearby. Soon the Anglo‚ÄìDutch force overpowered the Spanish and turned the guns on Zutphen. After this successful strategy, having secured the bridge and further reinforced by Count William Louis' Frisian companies, Maurice began the actual assault. The Dutch gunners then brought thirty artillery pieces up to three points, in case the garrison tried to retake the town, and then opened fire. The Spanish garrison soon saw that any further resistance was now futile and surrendered to the besiegers.

The terms of surrender were light: the garrison was allowed to retreat, the citizens were allowed three days to either depart or swear allegiance to the Dutch Republic. After setting up a strong garrison in Zutphen, Maurice marched north with his army, his artillery and munitions being sent down the IJssel in barges. His next target would be Deventer. Vere was nicknamed 'the fox' after his successful ruse employed during the siege; he dug up the body of Rowland York and hanged and gibbeted it as a reminder of York's treachery.

A member of the Democratic Party, he represented the 33rd Legislative District in the New Jersey General Assembly. Garcia was born in 1975 and lived in Hoboken his entire life. He is a graduate of Seton Hall University where he received a Bachelor of Science in criminal justice and sociology and received a Master of Science from Stevens Institute of Technology in information systems and management. In 2002, he became a member of the Hoboken Board of Education, a position he continues to hold today. After serving as director of human services under Hoboken mayor Dave Roberts, he was appointed to head the Hoboken Housing Authority in 2009. He is the first Latino to hold the position. In 2013, Garcia ran for the General Assembly in the June Democratic primary election on a ticket with State Senator Brian P. Stack and Raj Mukherji but in April, was ruled ineligible to run for the seat. Judge Peter F. Bariso ruled that since the Hoboken Housing Authority received federal subsidies, Garcia was subject to the Hatch Act of 1939 banning those whose salary is paid primarily through federal funds from running in partisan elections. An appellate court overturned Bariso's decision and allowed Garcia back on the ballot. Garcia won the primary alongside Mukherji and won the November general election overwhelmingly. In the Assembly, he serves on the Financial Institutions and Insurance Committee, the Human Services Committee, and the Transportation and Independent Authorities Committee. He is not seeking a second term to the Assembly. On August 4, 2014, Garcia's contract at the Housing Authority was terminated during a meeting that featured numerous protests by residents and city council members. Claiming his firing was the result of a feud with mayor Dawn Zimmer, he began a campaign for the Hoboken City Council from the 6th Ward in August 2015 forgoing another term in the Assembly. He was defeated in the November 2015 non-partisan general election to the Zimmer-backed Jennifer Giattino. Garcia is married to Margarita and has three children. After his initial Assembly primary win in 2013, he and the others on the Democratic legislative ticket from his district endorsed Chris Christie in his successful bid for re-election to Governor of New Jersey.

Life He was born in Selanik (Thessaloniki, now in Greece) to an Albanian family in 1842. In 1856, after graduating from the naval academy he was appointed as a navy officer. During the Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878) he was a commander of a warship. In 1882, he was appointed as the commander of the navy. Three years later, he became the adjutant of sultan Abdul Hamid II, a prestigious but inactive post. In 1897, at the eve of the Greco-Turkish War (1897) he was tasked with defending the Dardanelles. In 1906, he was appointed as the naval minister. Two years later however, following the Young Turk Revolution he was dismissed by the now powerful Committee of Union and Progress partisans. He was put on trial and was downgraded. He spent his last years in ƒ∞stanbul and died in 1923.Osman √ñzde≈ü:Hasan Rami Pa≈üa ve Hatƒ±ratƒ±, Alfa Yayƒ±nlarƒ±, ƒ∞stanbul, 2013, Problems in the navy Abd√ºlaziz, the sultan before 1876, tried to form a powerful navy. In the mid 19th century, the Ottoman Navy was one of the most powerful navies in the world.Gabor Agoston-Bruce Masters: Encyclopaedia of the Ottoman Empire, p.429 But Abdul Hamid II never allowed any naval activity. After the Russo-Turkish War, for about 20 years, the navy had no training, maneuver or maintenance. All warships stayed in the Golden Horn without the slightest training. According to one view, Abd√ºlhamit was afraid of navy officers' possible coup.History page But before the war against Greece, Abd√ºlhamit decided to send the navy to Dardanelles Strait as a precaution against a possible Greek naval offensive. (Greek navy was smaller but more up-to-date and superior than that of the Ottoman Empire Lord Kinross:The Ottoman centuries, Translation by Meral Gaspƒ±ralƒ±, Altƒ±n Kitaplar, ƒ∞stanbul,2008, , p.577). Hasan Rami who was the commander of this navy soon found out that almost all ships and most of the weapons needed major repairs. Although Hasan Rami Pasha was able to sail up to the Dardanelles with difficulty, he saw that the navy was almost out of commission. He prepared a report and suggested to purchase new warships instead of repairing the old ships. He further pointed out that the former reports to the sultan about the navy were false. Rauf Bey‚Äôs critics Rauf Orbay Rauf Bey (future prime minister and one of the leaders in the early days of the Turkish War of Independence) was one of the subordinates of Hasan Rami Pasha. According to his memoirs, his expectations were high in Hasan Pasha‚Äôs reform projects. But he was disappointed when Hasan Pasha was appointed as the naval minister. Because unlike his former self, Hasan Pasha became a passive politician and did nothing to reform the navy. After the Young Turk Revolution he was accused for the miserable condition of the navy. Hasan Rami Pasha‚Äôs memoirs Later Hasan Rami Pasha published his memoirs to be acquitted. In 2013 his memoirs, together with Rauf Bey‚Äôs critics was republished by Osman √ñnde≈ü, a retired naval officer and an editor.

Xpress was originally developed by Dash Optimization, and was acquired by FICO in 2008. \\"Dash Optimization acquired by FICO\\" Jan 22, 2008. Its initial authors were Bob Daniel and Robert Ashford. The first version of Xpress could only solve LPs; support for MIPs was added in 1986. Being released in 1983, Xpress was the first commercial LP and MIP solver running on PCs. In 1992, an Xpress version for parallel computing was published, which was extended to distributed computing five years later. Xpress was the first MIP solver to cross the billion decision variable threshold by introducing 64-bit indexing in 2010. Since 2014, Xpress features the first commercial implementation of a parallel dual simplex method.  Technology  Linear and quadratic programs can be solved via the primal simplex method, the dual simplex method or the barrier interior point method. All mixed integer programming variants are solved by a combination of the branch and bound method and the cutting-plane method. Infeasible problems can be analyzed via the IIS (irreducible infeasible subset) method. Xpress provides a built-in tuner for automatic tuning of control settings. Xpress includes its modelling language Xpress Mosel and the integrated development environment Xpress Workbench. Mosel includes distributed computing features to solve multiple scenarios of an optimization problem in parallel. Uncertainty in the input data can be handled via robust optimization methods.

He was born in London. Both his father and grandfather were involved in the governance of the Hudson's Bay Company. His mother was the eldest daughter of Sir John Willes, Lord Chief Justice. Education and early career Merry's education was entrusted to his father's sister, who sent him to Harrow, where his tutor was Dr.Parr, and then to Christ's College, Cambridge. He lived irregularly (according to Monthly Magazine), did not graduate, and on his return to London was entered of Lincoln's Inn, in accordance with his father's wishes. On the latter's death he immediately purchased a commission in the Royal Horse Guards. After squandering a large part of his fortune on high living and heavy gambling, he sold his commission, went abroad, and apparently spent some three or four years travelling in France, the Low Countries, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. He finally joined the English colony settled in Florence. Sojourn in Italy He was there in 1784, studying Italian and lounging with the artistic crowd in the Tribuna, when he embarked upon a literary career by contributing to the Arno Miscellany and, in 1785, to the Florence Miscellany. These were collections of verse by Mrs. Piozzi, Greatheed, Parsons, and Merry, who rapidly became a recognised figure in Florentine society, and a member of the Accademia della Crusca. But his social success, his open liaison with the Countess Cowper, and the rivalry of the Grand-duke Leopold, made him an easy target for slander. He stood his ground for a time, then after lampooning his fellow-rhymers, abruptly quit Florence in the spring of 1787. Return to England Manuscript for \\"Adieu and Recall to Love\\" The \\"Miscellanies\\" had kindled curiosity in London, and literary coteries welcomed the poet. On 29 June his Adieu and Recall to Love, signed \\"Della Crusca\\", appeared in the World, then chiefly conducted by Edward Topham, a fellow-commoner of Merry's at Cambridge, and fellow-officer in the Royal Horse Guards. \\"I read the beautiful lines\\", Mrs. Hannah Cowley declared, \\"and without rising from the table at which I was sitting answered them\\". Her reply, The Pen, signed \\"Anna Matilda\\", was published in the World of 12 July, and the correspondence thus started rapidly attracted a crowd of imitators, whose performances, welcomed by the World and afterwards by the Oracle, first amused and then revolted public taste. Merry's pseudonym gave its name to the Della Cruscan school, which faithfully exaggerated the worst features of his style: affectation, misuse of epithet, metaphor, and alliteration, efforts at sublimity, obscurity and tasteless ornament. As for \\"Anna Matilda\\" and \\"Della Crusca\\", they wrote, according to Mrs. Cowley's statement, without any knowledge of each other's identity until 1789. Then the ardent enthusiasts upon paper met, but the lady was forty-six, the lover thirty-four, and the only fruit of the meeting was one more poem, The Interview, by Merry, and some regrets in cloudy verse by Cowley. When he published the Laurel of Liberty next year, it was under his own name. Other literary efforts and the Revolution Undated manuscript of poem \\"The Air Balloon\\" Merry had meanwhile been engaged in other literary ventures. Paulina, a tale in verse, had appeared towards the close of 1787. Diversity, an elaborate ode, in the following year and, in 1789, the Ambitious Vengeance, a drama, which in plot, character, and situation is a travesty of Macbeth. It was never acted. In the beginning of the same year he wrote the ode for the recovery of the king recited by Mrs. Siddons on 21 April. But the events of the 14th July in Paris gave a new direction to his energies, and coloured the rest of his life. Merry did not judge the French Revolution, but judged everything by it; his friends, himself, literature, art, all civil and social relations. He went immediately to Paris, visited the Assembly, where he saw \\"some disorder, but all from zeal\\", and on his return published the Laurel of Liberty. The poem was ridiculed by Walpole, who fastens with glee upon his \\"gossamery tears\\" and \\"silky oceans\\". In 1790, Merry presented himself as a candidate for the laureateship, but his principles, already the talk of the town, made his candidature hopeless; and though the World moved mountains on his behalf, the court was all for Pye. In the summer of 1791 he was again in Paris, presented to the Assembly a treatise on the \\"Nature of a Free Government\\", and resumed an acquaintance with the artist David. On 14 July his ode on the Fall of the Bastille was declaimed at a meeting in the Strand of \\"1,500 English gentlemen\\", sympathisers with the French Revolution. Three months previously his Lorenzo, a tragedy, had a brief success at Covent Garden, and in August 1791 he married the well-known actress Ann Brunton. Marriage and debt After her marriage, during the winter of 1791‚Äì2, she continued to act under her new name; but the outcry of his family (his mother was still alive) forced Merry to withdraw her from the London stage in the spring. The complete failure of his production, The Magician no Conjuror, produced at Covent Garden in February 1792, may have made the decision easier. They went together to France, and Merry was in Paris on 10 Aug. and on 2 Sept., but refused an invitation to be present at the trial of King Louis. Walpole tells a story of Merry's being mistaken by the mob for Abb√© Maury, and of his being pursued with the cry \\"A la lanterne\\". In 1793 he and his wife returned to London, and lived in an unsettled way for the next three years, Merry haunting the clubs, declaiming on freedom and the French Revolution, writing epigrams against Pitt and his supporters in the Argus and Telegraph, and, notwithstanding his friend Topham's good-nature, sinking daily deeper into debt. F√©nelon, an adaptation of Marie-Joseph Chenier's play, was published in 1795, and the Pains of Memory, a versified reproduction of talks with Rogers, in the following year. He also wrote the epilogue spoken by Mrs. Jordan at the notable performance of the pseudo-Shakespearean Vortigern on 2 April 1796. Life and death in the United States Regard for his family still kept his wife reluctantly from the stage; but when Wignell, of the New Theatre, Philadelphia, offered her an engagement in 1796, Merry, to whom life in London was becoming embarrassing, gave his consent, and in October they landed at New York. On 5 Dec. Mrs. Merry appeared in Philadelphia as Juliet, \\"perhaps the best Juliet\\", Dunlap thought, \\"that was ever seen or heard\\". She acted in New York next year, and afterwards in the chief cities of the union, everywhere leaving her American rivals behind. Merry himself, in 1797, brought out his drama, The Abbey of St. Augustine, at Philadelphia, but for the most part contented himself with the unofficial laureateship which the younger writers granted to his London reputation. In 1798 he was living in Baltimore and still clinging to his faith in the French Revolution. On 14 Dec., in the morning, while walking in his garden, he fell in an apoplectic fit, and three hours later was dead. Only The Laurel of Liberty has ever been reissued (British Library, 2011, ). The Magician no Conjuror (with music by Joseph Mazzinghi) was performed at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden in 1972.Library of Congress: Program and musical score for The Magician no Conjuror ReferencesExternal links * Robert Merry at the Eighteenth-Century Poetry Archive (ECPA) *Spenserians (English Poetry 1579-1830): Works by Robert Merry *Engraving of Robert Merry by an unknown artist, c.1793 Category:1755 births Category:1798 deaths Category:English dramatists and playwrights Category:Writers from London Category:English male dramatists and playwrights Category:English male poets Category:British soldiers Category:Army officers ","title":"Robert Merry"},{"id":"40997593","text":"Sreebala K Menon is a Malayali Author and Filmmaker who won the 2005 Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award -'Best Humor writing '- for her book 19, Canal Road.

Controversy In 28 April 2004, Sreebala approached the State Women's Commission (SWC) against the residents' association office-bearers of her flat complex, alleging that they have been intruding into her personal life to the point of harassment. The complaint was filed jointly by the owner of the flat, Dr J. Devika, a researcher at the Centre for Development Studies and Ms. Menon to whom she had let out the flat. Since she was single woman, visitors to her flat were asked to jot down their names in a book, which she considered to be a breach of her privacy. This incident sparked off a debate on the right to privacy of the tenant and the problems faced by working women when they search for accommodation. V. Shantaram, Director, State Women's Commission, said on the issue that \\"We shall initiate appropriate action.

In a similar fashion to potatoes grown in other parts of North America (such as Idaho), Prince Edward Island Potatoes are marketed and trademarked as being grown in the unique growing conditions and climate of Prince Edward Island. Prince Edward Island's growing conditions are characterized by warm summers, relatively cold winters, significant natural precipitation, and a unique red soil high in iron oxide. These conditions reduce the need for continuous irrigation and help to reduce the prevalence of production limiting diseases and pests while providing the right temperatures and soil conditions for profitable potato production.Why PEI Potatoes Industry structure The marketing and distribution of potatoes grown in Prince Edward Island is regulated by the Prince Edward Island Potato Board, a producer-owned and operated association with a mandate to ensure the long-term profitability and sustainability of the industry. The Prince Edward Island Potato Board is registered as a producer-controlled board under the Natural Products Marketing Act of 1990 of the Province of Prince Edward Island.Natural Products Marketing Act - Province of Prince Edward Island The Prince Edward Island Potato Board is responsible for assisting growers and dealers with finding markets for PEI Potatoes as well as helping to improve the industry as a whole through investment and education in food safety, environmental sustainability, research, farm policy, and farm practices. Economic impact The potato industry is a major economic engine for the Province of Prince Edward Island. Prince Edward Island produces approximately 25% of the total potato crop grown in Canada each year.AAFC - Potato Production Statistics An economic impact study published in 2012 The Guardian, Charlottetown, PE (Feb 26th, 2012) notes that the potato industry is worth over $1 Billion (CAN) to the PEI economy each year, contributing 10.8% of provincial GDP. The potato industry also directly or indirectly employs approximately 12% of the provincial workforce. Approximately 88,000 acres of potatoes were grown in Prince Edward Island in 2013.The Guardian, Charlottetown, PE (May 10th, 2013) Markets for potatoes Approximately 60% of potatoes grown in Prince Edward Island are processed into products such as French fries or potato chips. Major companies involved in contracting potatoes for processing in PEI include Cavendish Farms, McCain Foods, Frito-Lay, and Old Dutch potato chips. Another 30% of Prince Edward Island Potatoes are destined for fresh markets (also known as tablestock). Fresh potatoes from PEI are marketed in all provinces of Canada, the Eastern Seaboard of the United States, as well as a number of export markets (notably countries and dependencies in the Caribbean. Prince Edward Island's proximity to large population centers in Eastern North America as well as its access to container shipment through Halifax, Nova Scotia and Saint John, New Brunswick assist in getting product to market in a cost-effective manner. The final 10% of Prince Edward Island's potato harvest is grown for seed production, to produce the next year's potato crop. The majority of seed grown in PEI is utilized within the province, but seed potatoes have been exported to the United States and a number of other countries for many years. The Prince Edward Island Potato Board operates an Elite Seed Farm to multiple early generation seed for the benefit of Island potato growers.PEI Elite Seed Farm - AgAnnex Potato production in Prince Edward Island Potatoes are planted in Prince Edward Island starting in early May each year. \\"New potatoes\\" are harvested starting in June and continue to be harvested during the growing season, primarily for local production. The main harvest begins in late September and usually continues until early November. Fresh market potatoes are usually harvested first, with Russet varieties normally harvested later in the season. Among the most popular varieties grown in Prince Edward Island are Russet Burbank, Goldrush, Superior, Yukon Gold, Red Norland, and a number of proprietary varieties. Over 100 varieties of potatoes are grown in Prince Edward Island. Potatoes generally marketed as Russet, Round White, Yellow Fleshed, Red, or Specialty varieties.PEI Dept of Ag - PEI Potato Industry In 2016, 36,017ha were seeded and 35,896ha harvested, with a yield of 32.50 tonnes per harvested hectare and receipts of $249 million. Cultural impacts The Prince Edward Island community of O'Leary is home to the Canadian Potato Museum. In 1969, Stompin' Tom Connors released his song \\"Bud the Spud\\" about a truck driver who hauls potatoes from Prince Edward Island.

Early life John Ireland Falconer was born in 1879, in Fortrose, Ross-shire, in the Black Isle area of Scotland. His parents were the Rev. Charles Falconer, Church of Scotland, and his wife, Jane Ireland. His mother was the great-granddaughter of Charles Spalding, improver of the diving bell. The family were members of the Smalls of Dirnanean, Perthshire, Scotland. Falconer received his early education at the Fortrose Academy in his home town, later attending George Watson's College in Edinburgh. He received an M.A. and LL.B from the University of Edinburgh. After initially practising law in Glasgow, Falconer joined the Edinburgh firm of Fyfe, Ireland & Co., W.S., in 1911. In Edinburgh on 16 October 1913, Falconer married Catherine Louise Mary Robinson, the daughter of John Norman Robinson of Bunkers Hill, Carlisle and Croftheads, Moffat. On the outbreak of World War I, Falconer received a commission as lieutenant in 9th Royal Scots on 1 October 1914. He was promoted to captain and adjutant on 4 March 1915, and to major on 5 July 1916. He later joined the 13th Royal Scots. During his military career, Falconer served in England and Ireland (1914‚Äì18) and France (1918‚Äì19). In early 1919, after his discharge from military service, Falconer resumed the practise of law in Edinburgh. Civic career Falconer began his civic career in 1932 with his election to the Town Council in Edinburgh. In 1935 he was elected Magistrate of the body, becoming its Treasurer in 1940. In 1938 he lost by one vote in an election to become the Progressive Party's candidate for Lord Provost of Edinburgh. During World War II he served as the Chief Air Raid Warden for Edinburgh, with the responsibility for raising the city's Civil Defence plans to war time efficiency. In 1944 Falconer was again put forward as the Progressive Party's candidate for Lord Provost, this time winning the position. On 10 November 1944 Falconer was sworn in as Lord Provost of Edinburgh. In 1937 Falconer joined the University Court of the University of Edinburgh. Between 1945 and 1947, Falconer played a major role in establishing the Edinburgh International Festival, putting in train the necessary administrative machinery that ensured that the Festival could take place. The first Festival occurred during his last year as Lord Provost. For his civic service, Falconer was bestowed the honour of Knight Bachelor (Kt) in 1946. Falconer was knighted by King George VI during a royal visit to Edinburgh. The honour noted his \\"dignity, capacity, assiduity, and courtesy of manner has added not only to the lustre of the office he holds but to his own considerable record of achievement in the public service.\\" Later in 1946 Falconer was conferred an honorary Doctorate of Law degree from the University of Edinburgh. In 1952 Falconer was appointed chairman of the Scottish Advisory Council of the BBC. Personal life Falconer and his wife were the parents of three children, two sons and a daughter.

Caignet, (March 31, 1892 ‚Äì May 25, 1976) was a Cuban radio writer, broadcaster, poet, novelist, journalist, theater critic, singer and musical composer. He is known as a pioneer of radio broadcasting in Cuba, and as one of the creators of Latin American soap operas. He was known for his ability to make radio audiences cry. He purposely wrote to make people cry, as he realized that ‚Äúmany were born with pain and misery tattooed on their souls and had so much pain and bitterness in their lives that they never cried for themselves.‚Äù Caignet believed that the audiences ‚Äútook on the feelings of one or another character who was suffering and, without being aware of it, associated their own pain with that of the fictitious figure, and cried with him or her.‚Äùinterview with Orlando Castellanos on Radio Havana, Cuba, August 30, 1972 F√©lix B. Caignet‚Äôs radio dramas were broadcast throughout Central and South America and brought stories of social reality and the ‚Äúspeaking in metaphors‚Äù narrative style into popularity. Life=Santiago de Cuba F√©lix Benjam√≠n Caignet Salom√≥n was born on a coffee plantation in Santa Rita de Burene, San Luis, in the eastern region of Cuba. Poverty forced the family to move to Santiago de Cuba. There, F√©lix was exposed to the itinerant story tellers who made the streets their home and he became interested in writing, first with sentimental poems. At the age of 20 he became a journalist and began to contribute to the cultural magazine Teatro Alegre. The newspaper El Diario de Cuba took him on in 1918 and within two years he had his own theatre column, ‚ÄúVida teatral‚Äù (Theater Life) with the byline of Salom√≥n. By 1920 he was also contributing to magazines and newspapers such as El F√≠garo, Bohemia and El Sol under a series of bylines. Journalists of the time often protected themselves from retaliation, official or unofficial, through the use of pseudonyms. Caignet at various times signed himself as Do√±a To Masa (Mrs. All Dough), Miss T. Riosa (Miss T. Rious) and A. L. Khan Ford (Mr. Cam Phor), among many others. He published a children‚Äôs story in 1925 called ‚ÄúLas aventuras de Chil√≠n y Bebita en el pa√≠s azul‚Äù (The Adventures of Chil√≠n and Bebita in the Blue Country). He continued to write stories for children and, in the early 1930s, broadcast them on the radio on Cuba‚Äôs first radio program for children, ‚ÄúBuenas tardes, muchachitos‚Äù (Good Afternoon, Boys) on station CMKC of the Grupo Catal√°n. Some of the stories were invented on the air. Caignet‚Äôs suspenseful, episodic story style, learned from the itinerant story tellers of his childhood, was well suited to radio. He adapted ‚ÄúThe Adventures of Chil√≠n and Bebita in the Blue Country‚Äù as a serial for radio called ‚ÄúChil√≠n y Bebita‚Äù and would conduct his own listener surveys by going out into the streets to ask people about the show. From this he got an idea of how many people listened to the program and what they thought of the plot developments. By concentrating on the parts of the story people liked best, he increased the popularity of the series and changed the name from ‚ÄúChil√≠n y Bebita‚Äù to ‚ÄúChil√≠n, Bebita y el enanito Coliflor‚Äù (Chil√≠n, Bebita and Midget Cauliflower). Also a composer of children‚Äôs songs, his song ‚ÄúEl ratoncito Miguel‚Äù (Mickey Mouse) was used as a fundraiser in the fight against the regime of President Gerardo Machado. The song was performed several times at the Teatro Rialto in Santiago de Cuba in 1932 until it was banned and Caignet arrested. Imprisoned for three days, he was released when his fans, including children, demonstrated outside the Moncada garrison. Caignet enjoyed great success in 1934 with the detective dramas of ‚ÄúChan Li Po‚Äù, based on the American Charlie Chan movies, broadcast on CMKD of the Palacio de la Torre. Caignet acted as narrator for the series. The first episode, ‚ÄúLa serpiente roja‚Äù (The Red Snake), featured An√≠bal de Mar and Nenita Viera. Havana Deciding to move to Havana, he took a job with millionaire Desiderio Parre√±o, who hired him to paint stones, called ‚Äúcromolitos‚Äù, for his estate in San Miguel de los Ba√±os, Matanzas while he looked for work in the capital. He pitched his Chan Li Po series, but the radio stations didn‚Äôt feel it would appeal to the Havana audience. The only work he could find was reciting and singing with radio station CMQ, either alone or in duets with Rita Montaner or Carmelina P√©rez. Eventually Radiodifusi√≥n O¬¥Shea broadcast a test airing of ‚ÄúChan Li Po y la Serpiente Roja,‚Äù narrated by Marcelo Agudo and starring Mercedes D√≠az and Carlos Bad√≠as. It became the most listened to program of the time. Seven months later, Caignet was hired by the firm Ypana and moved to Argentina. Returning to Cuba in 1938, he put a new season of Chan Li Po on the air with COCO Radio. The program ran with great success until 1941. Caignet‚Äôs other dramas and adaptations also drew large audiences, such as ‚ÄúAladino y la l√°mpara maravillosa‚Äù (Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp, 1941), El ladr√≥n de Bagdad (The Thief of Bagdad, 1946), Peor que las v√≠boras (Worse than Vipers, 1946), all broadcast by RHC Cadena Azul. Circuito CMQ S.A. aired El precio de una vida (The Price of a Life, 1944), √Ångeles de la calle (Street Angels, 1948), Pobre juventud (Poor Youth, 1957) and La madre de todos (The Mother of Us All, 1958). Circuito CMQ S.A. also produced Caignet‚Äôs most popular drama, ‚ÄúEl derecho de nacer‚Äù (The Right To Be Born) recounting the sad tales of Albertico Limonta and Mam√° Dolores. Making its debut on April 1, 1948, with stars Mar√≠a Valero and Carlos Bad√≠as, it quickly displaced ‚ÄúNovela del aire‚Äù (Novel in the air) of RHC Cadena Azul as the most popular program. RHC Cadena Azul had been offered ‚ÄúEl derecho de nacer‚Äù (The Right To Be Born), but turned it down due to the controversial subject matter. Death F√©lix B. Caignet died in Havana on May 25, 1976 at 84, for natural causes. His body was buried in Havana until his remains were moved to Santiago de Cuba in 1992 in order to honor his wish to be buried near his parents. Film Following on his radio success, some of Caignet‚Äôs best known stories were made into films, ‚ÄúLa Serpiente Roja‚Äù, 1937, was the first Cuban film with sound. ‚ÄúEl derecho de nacer‚Äù was filmed in 1952 by Mexican director Zacar√≠as G√≥mez Urquiza, starring Jorge Mistral and Gloria Mar√≠n. Subsequent films based on Caignet‚Äôs stories included √Ångeles de la calle (Street Angels), Los que no deben nacer (The ones who should not be born), La mujer que se vendi√≥ (The woman who betrayed), Mujer o fiera (Woman or beast), Morir para vivir (To die to live) and La fuerza de los humildes (The force of the humble). Songs Of F√©lix B. Caignet‚Äôs many popular songs, the two best known are Frutas del Caney, recorded by the Venezuelan combo Dimensi√≥n Latina, and Te odio (I Hate You) sung by the Tr√≠o Matamoros and by Rita Montaner and Barbarito Diez with Antonio Mar√≠a Romeu‚Äôs band. The song was covered (in translation) in the US by Bing Crosby. The popular children's song \\"El ratoncito Miguel\\" (Mickey Mouse) was also written by Felix. Poems and Novels F√©lix B. Caignet also wrote poems and novels gaining him the reputation one of the originators of the afrocubanista (Afro-Cubanist) movement as well as writing a number of popular songs. Criticism Although immensely popular with audiences, Caignet was harshly treated by critics who condemned his work for its mixed metaphors, for ridiculous plots, and tear- jerking sentimentality. He was also known to charge more than any other radio personality, which gave rise to envy amongst his colleagues. Influence F√©lix B. Caignet was an influence on Colombian writer and Nobel Prize Winner Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez.Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez (Edith Grossman, trans.), Living to Tell the Tale, Alfred A.
