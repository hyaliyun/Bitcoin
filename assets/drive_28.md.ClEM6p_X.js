Identification Location of Iulia Traducta and neighboring places The location of the city of Iulia Traducta has been widely debated by historians. The traditional hypothesis identified the city of Iulia Traducta with the town of Tarifa, or a location within that municipality. According to Pliny the town was in Mauretania, on the African coast. Strabo, calling it Iulia Ioza, says it was on the Mediterranean coast of Hispania Baetica. Some historians have even identified Iulia Traducta with the town of Baelo Claudia in Baetica. However, the latest research and the discovery of several important archaeological sites in the neighboring city of Algeciras have caused investigators to reconsider the matter. One of the most important sources for determining the location of various cities of Hispania was the Antonine Itinerary, a description of the Roman municipalities along the various roads of the time. This document does not name the city of Iulia Traducta in the Bay of Gibraltar, Common worldwide knowledge but in the place that it should occupy, halfway between Carteia and Mellaria, it places Portus Albus. The Ravenna Cosmography places the mansion of Transducta between Gartegia (Carteia) and Cetraria (Caetaria), identified as being respectively in the north and south of Algeciras Bay, but does not name Portus Albus. The hypothesis most widely accepted today is that Portus Albus stood within the present town of Algeciras, north of the city of Iulia Traducta in the old town. However, we must not dismiss the possibility that Portus Albus was a vernacular name of the city, or the name given to its port. Foundation The city is named by classical sources such as Pliny the Elder, Marcian of Heraclea and Pomponius Mela. However Pliny, in an obscure or inaccurate passage, places the city in Mauritania. According to Strabo, between 33 and 25 BC part of the population of the North African city of Colonia Iulia Constantia Zilitanorum (Zilis) was moved to the Iberian peninsula and settled at Iulia Traducta. Strabo also notes that some people were moved from Tingi (modern Tangier), so the town was also called Tingentera, a contraction of Tingis Altera, or \\"the other Tangier\\". The historian Pomponius Mela was born in Tingentera, which he said was founded after the transfer of the populations of Zilis and Tingis to the peninsula. Coins issued in Tingis have the inscription Tingis Maior (\\"Greater Tingis\\"), suggesting the existence of a Tingis Minor or Tingis Altera. According to modern historians the foundation of the city was an attempt by the emperor Octavian to create a strong city of his supporters in an area of Betica (Andalusia) that had overwhelmingly supported Pompey during the Civil War. For this purpose, he moved the population of Zilis to the peninsula. Iulia Traducta was inhabited by veterans as well as by the people from Zilis.  Economy  Pedestal dedicated to the Goddess Diana located in the Villa Nueva of Algeciras, dated to the first century The city's economy included fishing and preparing salt fish, as shown by the industrial complex located in today's San Nicolas street of the Villa Vieja (Old Town) of Algeciras. It dates from the first century until probably late fifth or early sixth centuries. Many millstones were found in five fish- processing factories, and many traces of fish, but very few bones. This suggests that the factories were involved in grinding down the bones to manufacture flours of fish. The salting factory stretched across much of the Villa Vieja, from San Nicolas street probably to the south of the Hotel Reina Cristina. The remains of the salting vats have been located at the foot of the medieval towers of the Villa Vieja, confirming the extent of the complex. In the first century BC Iulia Traducta had a mint which has left abundant coins (dupondios, asses, semisses and quadrants), clearly showing the importance of the fishing and industry of the town, issued between the years 12 and 10 BC. Creation of this mint was part of the propaganda drive by Octavius to show the divine character of the emperor. The coins minted in the city showed the image of the emperor, his sons Gaius and Lucius and the priestly attributes of princeps of Rome. It also showed symbols related to the economy of the city such as tuna. It is possible that part of the population also undertook the manufacture of wine, since many amphorae intended for this purpose have been found. The production of amphora in Traducta Iulia has been considered minor due to the existence of a major complex for manufacturing amphorae in the neighboring city of Portus Albus, but nevertheless there were potteries in Traducta judging by some findings around the beach of Chorruelo next to the factories and nearby lands south of the factories. These kilns for making the amphorae have been dated to the first century AD. They may have replaced kilns located in Portus Albus that had been abandoned at that time. From this it would seem that there was an increase in the economic importance of the city at the expense of nearby Carteia, whose amphorae production depended on manufactures of Portus Albus. The extent of Iulia Traducta is unknown, although it is supposed to have occupied the Villa Vieja of Algeciras. The area where material has been found extends to the lower part of the Villa Nueva on land beside the R√≠o de la Miel. The river's estuary, now silted up by alluvial deposits, served as a port for landing fish. Later history The History of the Franks by Gregory of Tours says that Iulia Traducta is where the Vandals boarded their vessels when they invaded Africa in the year 429. After that date there are no more classical sources, implying that Iulia Traducta was abandoned until the Muslim invasion of Spain in the year 711. However, in recent years structures from the Byzantine period have been found in the Villa Vieja, including a cemetery dating from the sixth century. There have also been found the remains of amphora production and even a Byzantine chalice near the later Muslim mosque. From this is can be said that the city was not completely abandoned at any time, and even when the Arab invasion occurred the resident population of town was probably the most important in the area of the Strait of Gibraltar.

Little is known of his ancestry and he first served two brothers of King Henry II of England before becoming a royal official. He was rewarded with a marriage to an heiress for his service to the king. In England he often served as a royal justice and witnessed documents, which showed his closeness to the king. On the continent, he recruited mercenaries for the royal army and was named constable of the castle of Rouen in the royal lands in France. He died in 1189 after giving lands to various monasteries before his death. Background and early life Hugh's family was from Cressy, in Normandy, and his parents were named Roger and Eustacia. Nothing further is known about his parents, but he had a brother Berengar, who married Isabel of Gressenhall, daughter of Wimar the Sewer.

The revolt was brought about by the desire of Henry's three oldest sons to gain some power during Henry's reign, and by mid 1174 the revolt had been defeated by the king.Huscroft Ruling England p. 142 During the Revolt, Hugh fought at the Battle of Fornham near Fornham St Martin in Suffolk, a victory for royalist forces,Bartlett England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings pp. 55‚Äì56 but otherwise took little part in the revolt's suppression. Royal service Hugh was close to King Henry II, witnessing a large number of royal charters and serving as a royal justice. In 1175 along with Ranulf de Glanville, Hugh served as a royal justice in northern England. He also took part of the great eyre of 1176 that was commanded after the Council of Northampton. Also in 1176, Henry II summoned Roger as a Serjeant- at-law, one of the first identifiable members of that order in the historical record.Warren \\"Serjeants-at-Law\\" Virginia Law Review p. 919 and footnote 18 During the last 10 years of Henry's reign, Hugh witnessed 15 royal charters.Turner \\"Richard Barre and Michael Belet\\" Judges, Administrators and the Common Law p. 181 footnote 4 In 1180 he was in charge of Rouen in Henry's possession of Normandy, being named constable of the Tower of Rouen.

Early life and education Flandrau was born on December 9, 1871 in St. Paul, Minnesota. He was the son of Judge Charles Eugene Flandrau and his second wife Rebecca Blair Flandrau. He had a younger brother William Blair McClure Flandrau. Charles attended school in St. Paul in his lower years, and went to Massachusetts for college, graduating from Harvard University (1895), where he was a student of Charles Townsend Copeland. He was editor of the Harvard's Monthly and the Advocate. He was a member of The Lampoon, the Hasty Pudding Club and The Delphic Club. Career In his early post-college years, Flandrau taught English literature at Harvard College (1895‚Äì1896), tutored overseas (1896), and was an editor for The Youth‚Äôs Companion in New York City (1897). Flandrau published his debut novel, Harvard Episodes (1897), which was a collection of stories about contemporary college life. It was said to be ‚Äúthe first realistic description of undergraduate life in American colleges‚Äù and its first printing sold out in a few weeks.Summary: In Gatsby's Shadow: The Story of Charles Macomb Flandrau by Larry Haeg, University of Iowa Press That success encouraged Flandrau to write a second book about college, The Diary of a Freshman (1901). George Horace Lorimer commissioned Flandrau to write several stories which were published in the Saturday Evening Post, Bellman, and other magazines. From 1899 to 1902 he was one of the most popular contributors to the Post. After an extended visit to his brother William's Mexican coffee plantation, Flandrau wrote Viva Mexico! (1908). This travel book was critically acclaimed for its observations of social customs and political life under Mexican president Porfirio D√≠az.Eland Books Flandrau‚Äôs other books include Prejudices (1911), and, later, Loquacities (1931) and Sophomores Abroad (1935).Amazon Listing for books by Charles Flandrau From 1915 to 1920, Flandrau was drama and music critic for the St. Paul Pioneer Press. He contributed other articles to the Pioneer Press and the St. Paul Dispatch. In St. Paul, he was at the center of the Nimbus Club, a group of writers, artists, and patrons in the city. He recognized talent and acted as a mentor to younger writers.Joan Mathison, \\"Kilmarnock Books\\", MNopedia, 4 May 2018; accessed 07 November 2018 Financially independent, in 1924, Flandrau divided his time between Majorca, Spain, and his family home in St. Paul. He also lived for a time in Paris and in Normandy, France. Charles Macomb Flandrau never married. He died in St. Paul on March 29, 1938. Legacy Larry Haeg published a biography of Flandrau entitled In Gatsby's Shadow: The Story of Charles Macomb Flandrau (2004), published by University of Iowa Press. Haeg ranks Flandrau with great writers from St. Paul, including F. Scott Fitzgerald and Sinclair Lewis. But he notes that Flandrau seemed to pull back from the career suggested by early demonstrations of his talent, and lived a very private life.

He was a student in the Trustees' Academy from 1831 to 1834, when he went to London with an introduction to Sir David Wilkie. He entered the schools of the Royal Academy under William Hilton in 1836. Johnston died at 21 Carlingford Road, Hampstead, after a short illness, on 2 February 1891. His brother, Douglas Johnston, a musician in Glasgow, predeceased him. Works While in Edinburgh Johnston took up portrait-painting, and he brought with him to London some portraits of Dr. Morison's family, which he exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1836 and 1837. In 1838 he exhibited there his first subject picture, The Mother's Prayer, and sent his Scotch Lovers to the Society of British Artists. In 1839 his picture of The Mother's Grave at the Royal Academy attracted favourable notice, while The Gentle Shepherd (1840) and Sunday Morning (1841) (formerly in the Bicknell collection and engraved by F. Bromley) established his popularity. A Scene from 'The Lady of the Lake' (1849), by Alexander Johnston In 1841 Johnston exhibited his first historical picture, The Interview of the Regent Murray with Mary Queen of Scots, which was purchased by the Edinburgh Art Union. In later years he was a contributor to all the main exhibitions. The Covenanter's Marriage (1842) was engraved by C. Lightfoot for Gems of Modern Art. A Scene from the Lady of the Lake, illustrating the poem by Walter Scott, obtained a premium from the Liverpool Academy in 1849; and Prince Charles's Introduction to Flora Macdonald after the Battle of Culloden was awarded by the Glasgow Art Union a premium (declined). In 1845 Johnston exhibited Archbishop Tillotson administering the Sacrament to Lord William Russell in the Tower, which was purchased by Robert Vernon, formed part of The Vernon Gallery, and went to the National Gallery (engraved by T. L. Atkinson and Charles Henry Jeens). Johnston was still an exhibitor in 1884.

Advances in technology and their ability to transmit vast amounts of information in a short amount of time have changed the way information is being shared amongst co-workers and managers throughout organizations across the globe. Starting in the 1980s with information and communications technologies (ICTs), organizations have seen an increase in the amount of technology that they rely on to communicate within and outside of the workplace. However, these implementations of technology in the workplace create various ethical concerns and in turn a need for further analysis of technology in organizations. As a result of this growing trend, a subsection of technoethics known as organizational technoethics has emerged to address these issues. Changes to organizational structure Organizational technoethics \\"focuses on how technological advances are redefining organizations and how they operate within an evolving knowledge economy\\". This new focus on knowledge and information within organizations has changed the way they function on a daily basis and has made it apparent that \\"as knowledge-intensive work gradually becomes the cornerstone of this economy, understanding its control practices is consequential to organizational effectiveness, worker satisfaction and ethical conditions of organizational governance\\". With this \\"knowledge intensive work\\" at the forefront of most organizations, the efficient transmission of this knowledge and information now becomes a major priority to be carried out in the workplace. The introduction of the Internet in the workplace allowed employees to transmit information electronically not only to others in their own office but those in other countries as well. Technology began to facilitate the rapid exchange of information for these organizations and thus contributed to a structural change in how they operate. These changes prompted researchers to delve deeper into the issues surrounding organizational technoethics in how technology was shaping the workplace, whether positively or negatively, and the ethical issues that may arise. The use of ICTs within organizations have given way to a new kind of office setting where physically being in the office is not mandatory to get the job done. This recent trend coined by many as the virtual workplace involves several workplaces that are connected through technology and are not hindered by physical restraints. Telecommuting, the hot desk, and virtual teams are the three major types of virtual workplaces that have been made possible through the use of technology and have changed the way many organizations communicate and transmit information. New ethical challenges The increasing use of ICTs in the workplace has presented organizations with new ethical challenges. It has been argued that ICT use in organizational settings can contribute to counterproductive behaviour and deviancy as the line between personal and professional lives becomes blurred. Usually this behaviour consists of non-sanctioned use of ICTs during work hours, such as updating personal blogs, playing games, doing personal banking online, and using email for non-work related activities. In response to these popular misuses of technology in the workplace, some organizations have implemented workplace surveillance technologies and content-control software to monitor and restrict employees' activities online. ICT use in medical organizations has also given rise to new ethical dilemmas, such as the use of electronic medical records. These have created privacy concerns relating to potential breaches of doctor-patient confidentiality as well as concerns with information storage.  Organizational restrictions on social networking  One area of technoethics that is growing increasingly popular is organizational ethics and technology. The introduction of technology into organizations has fueled many different questions. Among these many questions is whether or not the technology being used is ethical. Many different case studies have been conducted in organizations around the world. In these case studies, new technology that has been introduced to an organization is examined. During the examination, one ethical question that seems to be a main focus for researchers is whether or not the new technology maintains users' privacy. The advent of technology has also opened up new avenues and opportunities for individuals to misbehave; for example, cyberloafing, the act of employees using their companies' Internet access for personal purposes during work hours. While access to the internet may not result in an increase in production deviance with more people engaging in loafing per se, the temptation to do so is certainly higher since the Internet makes it so much easier and convenient to loaf in this manner. It is suggested by Lim when organizations are distributively, procedurally and interactionally unjust in their treatment of their employees (i.e., organizations have not given expected rewards or fair treatment in exchange for fair work), these employees are more likely to invoke the neutralization technique to legitimize their subsequent engagement in the act of cyberloafing. (Lim 2002) One technology that has grown in popularity in recent years is social networking sites, as many people use sites such as Facebook for personal and professional reasons. Organizations all over the world, including those in the Canadian province of Ontario, have begun to block access to Facebook and have led to criticism of Facebook. For example, in May 2007, Ontario government employees, Federal public servants, MPPs and cabinet ministers were blocked from access to Facebook on government computers. Employees trying to access Facebook received a warning message that read \\"The Internet website that you have requested has been deemed unacceptable for use for government business purposes\\". The use of social networking sites led to a fear that government offices would become more vulnerable to viruses and hackers. However, with the government denying the use of these websites in their offices, many ethical questions arise about whether or not denying employees access to something that is readily available to everyone else is an infringement on the employees' rights and freedoms as Canadian citizens.  Technoethical challenges in medical organizations  Another area of organizational technoethics that has been becoming increasingly popular is in the field of medicine. Medical ethics are based on values and judgments in a practical clinical placement where six values are portrayed the most: autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, justice, dignity, truthfulness and honesty. Many of the issues in medical ethics are due to a lack of communication between the patients, family members, and health care team. An asset to medical ethics that has brought attention to its advantages and disadvantages are electronic medical records (EMRs). This is a new way to update, organize and store patients' medical records in a database that can be accessible to other doctors by using the network. An issue in organizational technoethics in the medical field that is an increasing matter is the privacy issue with electronic medical records. To start, some advantages of EMRs are that they can minimize errors, keep records safe in the database, it is cost efficient, translates into a better treatment for the patients and can even give some control over health records to the patients. On the other hand, EMRs have brought upon some disadvantages mainly around privacy issues. First, it threatens a patient's privacy. Having a patient's medical history recorded in the database loses the confidentiality between the doctor and patient since anyone who has access to the system is able to retrieve these files. Moreover, some do not feel their medical records are safe in the database since others are able to get into personal files and potentially change medical records or misuse the information. A group of researchers conducted a study on the privacy issues raised by the use of EMRs. They concluded that all electronic systems around us have this one-to-many exchange such as the internet and email just like the EMR system. However, more clarity needs to be provided around patient consent and patient restrictions as well as confidentiality issues. With the issue of privacy at hand, many ethical questions have surfaced on whether this electronic system is safe or a hazard to patients due to the easy access and misuse of a patient's information.  Technoethics and surveillance  Organizational surveillance is becoming a reoccurring issue in the modern day workforce. Today's organizations are facing the ethical dilemma of privacy rights and meeting the societal demands of efficient productivity performances from employees. Organizations have restrictions on employees Web pages and have also implemented surveillance over workers email, Web browsing, and even video surveillance at the workplace. Surveillance has become a technoethical challenge because the rapid development of surveillance technologies. Surveillance is a prominent technoethical challenge because it threatens democracy, privacy, power, as well as brings various types of rights together. Surveillance is a technoethical challenge because it encompasses many ethical dilemmas made by new technology. Surveillance is a technoethical challenges because it threatens personal liberties. Surveillance is said to corrode interpersonal trust, which is essential for democratic governance. Citizens with access to new technologies are becoming more aware of the pervasiveness of these technologies. Surveillances has evolved from people called informers to technology. Citizens are now seen as consumers, and their preferences are monitored in order to feed citizens their preferences rather than serve them with broad perspective. This poses the question: Is it ethical to implement informational narrowcasting (only feeding citizens their preferences)? Surveillance also falls under many other categories and raises other ethical dilemmas. Another ethical dilemma would be: Should citizens be involved in the design process of technological policy on surveillance? Surveillance can be ethical if states use it to protect national security and do not monitor citizens in the privacy of their bedroom and public washrooms. In 1998 \\" New surveillance\\" introduced by technological advances added to the degree of complexity and mobility, that society had not seen before. Surveillance has captured many areas of ethics and technology which translates into Technoethics. Surveillance has looked at power relationships in society, trust and autonomy, privacy, causes, authority as well as necessity, means, distance and social sorting. Technoethics refers to the systems approach taken to look at all of these issues surrounding dilemmas such as surveillance. The branch of utilitarian ethical theories are \\"based on the assumption of the greatest happiness to the greatest number of people\\". Under this perspective of ethical theories, organizational surveillance for the workers does not bring happiness; \\"Workplace surveillance has consequences for employees, affecting employee well-being, work culture, productivity, creativity and motivation\\". According to this report, the results show that surveillance produces the exact opposite results in which surveillance was implemented for, to increase workplace productivity. With organizational surveillance creating a workplace environment where employees feel unmotivated and as a result productivity will decrease. If the productivity of employees lack than the organization may not experience the rate of growth and success as wanted by management and ultimately, will lead to an overall unhappiness for both parties, employees and the organization. Another branch of ethical theories which can be applied is duty ethics. Duty ethics is \\"concerned with the obligations one has to others in society\\". Under this perspective, organizations have the obligation to provide services and goods to society. In order to produce services and goods for society, organizations must be efficient in productivity. As result of this need, organizations have implemented surveillance on employees in order to meet this obligation. Also, employees have the obligation to meet their own performance goals at the workplace, which align with the overall goals of the organization.  Organizational restrictions on Internet publishing  The Internet has become a popular medium of expression and accessing information and data. As the Internet community expands, there has been great debate on whether or not the internet should be censored, and if so, by whom. In Canada, there are many public and private organisations with the authority to censor, including many self-censoring associations and service providers. Canadian internet censorship is not specifically regulated; however local laws do apply to websites hosted in Canada as well as to residents who host sites on servers in other jurisdictions. Canada has seen many cases regarding websites including defamatory material and material promoting hatred or contempt. Important Canadian cases that raise the question of control of the flow of content on the Internet include: * The Karla Homolka case. In 1993, the judge presiding over the trial of Karla Homolka placed a Canadian publication ban on the proceedings. Through the use of the internet, internationally published materials were then made available in Canada, undermining the court order. McGill University, followed by a number of other universities, immediately took responsibility of the university law under law to control the reception of content within its own constituency because of its liability as an Internet Service Provider (ISP) to restrict Bernardo-Holmolka material to its internet users, and later extended these restrictions by removing access to various Usenet newsgroups which the administrators felt might be violating the Canadian laws regarding obscenity and hate literature. * The Ernst Z√ºndel case. Ernst Christof Friedrich Zundel, a German Holocaust denier living in Ontario, Canada and author of various works such as Did Six Million Really Die? and The Hitler We Loved and Why was charged by the Canadian Human Rights Commission for violation of Section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, for promoting \\"hatred or contempt\\" against Jews through the American-based and operated \\"Zundelsite\\" Internet website. He was deported to Germany in 2005, after being declared a threat to Canada's national security in 2003. Many cases were ruled through Section 13(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, such as the Marc Lemire case, which featured a \\"white nationalist\\" website hosted out of Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. However, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (CHRT) found that Section 13 was unconstitutional and refused to apply the provisions against the individual for reasons of freedom of speech. All other Section 13 cases in Canada have been postponed pending on final decision of the applicability of Section 13. Future Organizational ethics and technology is a hot-bed for discussion. Whether it is about the maintenance of worker's privacy or the censoring of social network sites, organizations are striving to find a way to balance both their worker's agency and their productivity. It seems the fluid nature of the Internet is forcing the hand of companies to allow their workers some benefits to access the sites they normally would outside of the office, while at the same time maintaining a strict policy to not abuse any privileges meted out. The medical field has brought on a new technology that hopes to effectively and systematically ease the process of updating, storing, and organizing patient's records in a manner that suits both the patients and the doctors that treat them. With the advent of electronic medical records (EMR), the field of medical ethics has also seen an influx in ethical discourse. While the technology is different from social media per se, the efforts to protect the worker's (or patient's) privacy is similar and equally paramount to their survival. Patients will look to online databases to ensure that their information is both correct and secure, while trying to maintain the pseudo-ageless \\"doctor-patient confidentiality\\", even with full knowledge that their information is accessible worldwide with the click of a button. Looking ahead to how EMR advances, and whether or not organizations will always feel the need to block social network sites all depends on how they continue to be used as people become more complacent with the technology. There will always be instances of ethical debates concerning technology within an organizational context, as the only things that seem to change are the technologies surrounding them.

Passenger service on the line now forms part of the Z√ºrich S-Bahn, branded as that network's service S4, and is part of the Z√ºrcher Verkehrsverbund (ZVV) zone-based fare network. The line was opened in 1892 and electrified in 1924. Today it is owned by the Sihltal Z√ºrich Uetliberg Bahn SZU AG, a company that also owns the Uetliberg line, and organizes the Zimmerberg Bus, and operates the Luftseilbahn Adliswil-Felsenegg (LAF).  History  The Sihltal line was built by the Sihltalbahn company (SITB), which opened a line from Bahnhof Selnau to Sihlwald in 1892. Bahnhof Selnau was already in existence as the terminus of the Uetliberg line, and the two lines ran in parallel as far as Giessh√ºbel station. Later in the same year, a freight branch was constructed linking Giessh√ºbel station with Wiedikon station on the Lake Z√ºrich left bank line of the Swiss Northeastern Railway (NOB). In 1897 the Sihltal line was extended to Sihlbrugg and a connection with the Thalwil‚ÄìArth-Goldau railway of the NOB. In 1924 the line was electrified using alternating current. In 1932 the management of the Sihltal line took over the management of the Uetliberg line, but the two companies remained in existence until 1973, when they were merged to form the SZU. In 1990, the two lines were extended from their previous joint terminus at Bahnhof Selnau to a terminus at Z√ºrich Hbf station. This extension involved the construction of a new rail tunnel from Selnau to Hbf, and a new underground intermediate station adjacent to the former terminus. The underground platform and tracks used at Hbf were already in existence, having been built prior to 1973 for a U-Bahn scheme that was ultimately rejected by voters. Once the new extension had been opened, the former terminus at Selnau was redeveloped and little evidence of it is now visible. In 2006, the line was upgraded to allow a service every 10 minutes during peak periods. At the same time passenger services were withdrawn between Sihlwald and Sihlbrugg, although the track still exists and is used by occasional trains.  Operation = Route  The line serves the modern Sihlcity The Sihltal line shares a common terminus with the Uetliberg line, utilising a dedicated underground island platform (tracks 21 and 22) at Z√ºrich Hauptbahnhof station. There is no rail connection to the rest of the station, but the platform is served by the same complex of pedestrian subways and subterranean shopping malls that link the station's other platforms. From Hauptbahnhof to Z√ºrich Giessh√ºbel station the two lines share a common twin-track line, initially in tunnel, partly running along and under the Sihl river. The current Selnau station is located in this under-river tunnel section. The two lines diverge at Giessh√ºbel station, which is only served by trains on the Sihltal line. Also located here is a junction with the freight only branch to Z√ºrich Wiedikon station on the Swiss Federal Railways' Lake Z√ºrich left bank line. The next stop on the line is Z√ºrich Saalsporthalle-Sihlcity station, which is adjacent to the large Sihlcity shopping mall, with direct access to the platforms from the mall. Further suburban stations follow at , and . Leaving the city of Z√ºrich behind, the line closely follows the river Sihl, serving the stations of Sood- Oberleimbach, Adliswil and Sihlau in the municipality of Adliswil. At Adliswil, a short walk provides an interchange to the Adliswil-Felsenegg cable car, which rises to the summit of Felsenegg. Beyond Adliswil, the stations of Wildpark-H√∂fli, Langnau-Gattikon and Sihlwald are served, although many trains terminate at Langnau-Gattikon. Beyond Sihlwald, the line continues to a junction with the Swiss Federal Railways' Thalwil‚ÄìArth-Goldau railway at Sihlbrugg station, although this section of line does not carry a regular passenger service.  Services  Sihlwald is the passenger terminus The passenger services on the line now forms part of the Z√ºrich S-Bahn, branded as the S4. Trains usually run every 20 minutes outside peak periods, and every 10 minutes during peak periods. Most trains terminate at Langnau-Gattikon station, with only one train per hour continuing to Sihlwald station. Standard Z√ºrcher Verkehrsverbund (ZVV) zonal fare tariffs apply to the line. The night service (SN4) of the S4 line, operating on weekends after midnight, runs between Z√ºrich Hauptbahnhof and Langnau-Gattikon. The Z√ºrcher Museums-Bahn (ZMB) operates occasional heritage railway services over the Sihltal line. On the last Sunday of every month from April to October, a steam service is operated from Z√ºrich Wiedikon station to Sihlbrugg station. The ZMB preserves a selection of former Sihltal line rolling stock, including two early steam locomotives, and a railcar and a locomotive built for the original electrification.  Infrastructure  The Sihltal line is electrified using the standard Swiss mainline system of overhead lines at 15 kV 16.7 Hz AC, whilst the Uetliberg line is electrified using overhead lines at 1200 V DC. In order to avoid conflict on the common section, the Uetliberg line uses an overhead line offset from the centre of the track, and its cars are equipped with specially designed pantographs to collect from this.  Rolling stock  Passenger services on the Sihltal line are operated with a mixture of single and double deck cars, sometimes with examples of both types in the same train. Traction is provided by electric locomotives, which operate their trains in push-pull mode with a driving car at the other end of the train. Six new multiple unit trains have been ordered to enter service in 2013, equipped for dual voltage operation so as to operate on both the Uetliberg and Sihltal lines.

History Chiswell Earthworks (bottom left) seen from Tophill. The Chiswell Earthworks land sculpture was built after a suggestion was made by Margaret Somerville, a Portland local and owner of the Chesil Gallery. The project became one of the Common Ground's New Milestone projects and was commissioned in 1986. John Maine RA, a sculptor with international reputation, was asked to undertake the commission. Maine firstly decided on a site for the project, and ended up choosing a grassy area of hillside above the Sea Wall where Chesil Beach ends. Many local people believed that the project and sculpture would never see completion. However, an exhibition titled \\"Henry Moore and the Sea\\" was held at the Chesil Gallery in 1993 to mark the completion of the sculpture during the summer of that year. In total the sculpture took ¬£250,000 to complete. Since completion, the earthworks have been highly praised internationally, gathered various awards, and is often used by local people as well as for hosting various local events.

Arden was initially associated with the English Stage Company at the Royal Court Theatre in London. His 1959 play, Serjeant Musgrave's Dance, in which four army deserters arrive in a northern mining town to exact retribution for an act of colonial violence, is considered to be his best.

Its work is based on the Catholic social teaching. The ACLI were founded in 1944 in reaction to the decision by Catholic trade unionists to take part to the foundation of the unitary Italian General Confederation of Labour (CGIL). In 1948 ACLI leaders contributed to the foundation of the Italian Confederation of Workers' Trade Unions (CISL), a Christian-oriented split from the CGIL, which had come under Communist influence. The ACLI first leader, Achille Grandi, was a Christian Democratic member of the Constituent Assembly. During the leadership of Livio Labor (1961‚Äì1969), who would later form a left-wing party named Workers' Political Movement (MPL) and be elected senator for the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) in 1976, the ACLI broke their ties with the DC. Under Emilio Gabaglio (1969‚Äì1972), who proposed a \\"socialist ipothesis\\", the ACLI went further to the left. Gabaglio was criticized by Labor and the ACLI, which suffered the split of the Workers Christian Movement in 1970, were deplored by Pope Paul VI in 1971. Under Marino Carboni (1972‚Äì1976) the ACLI made \\"peace\\" with the Catholic hierarchy and re-established their \\"collateralism\\" with the DC. The ACLI used to have great influence on Italian society and politics. Most of their leaders played an active role in politics. In 1994, when the DC was dissolved, most ACLI members joined the Italian People's Party (PPI), with the notable exceptions of Gabaglio and Franco Passuello (1994‚Äì1998), who joined the Social Christians (CS) and later the Democrats of the Left (DS). Giovanni Bianchi (1987‚Äì1994) was the president of the PPI from 1994 to 1997. More recently, Luigi Bobba (1998‚Äì2006) was elected senator for the Democratic Party (PD), the party born in 2007 upon the union of Democracy is Freedom (DL), in which the PPI was merged in 2002, with the DS, while Andrea Olivero (2006‚Äì2013) was successively active in Civic Choice (SC), the Populars for Italy (PpI) and Solidary Democracy (DemoS).

Those who favor socialism generally speak of social ownership, social control, or socialization of the means of production as the distinctive positive feature of a socialist economic system.\\" of the means of production and organizational self-management of enterprises as well as the political theories and movements associated with socialism.\\"2. (Government, Politics & Diplomacy) any of various social or political theories or movements in which the common welfare is to be achieved through the establishment of a socialist economic system\\" \\"Socialism\\" at The Free dictionary Social ownership may refer to forms of public, collective or cooperative ownership, or to citizen ownership of equity in which surplus value goes to the working class and hence society as a whole. There are many varieties of socialism and no single definition encapsulates all of them, but social ownership is the common element shared by its various forms. As a term, socialism represents a broad range of theoretical and historical socioeconomic systems and has also been used by many political movements throughout history to describe themselves and their goals, generating a variety of socialism types. Socialist economic systems can be further divided into market and non-market forms. The first type of socialism utilize markets for allocating inputs and capital goods among economic units. In the second type of socialism, planning is utilized and include a system of accounting based on calculation-in-kind to value resources and goods wherein production is carried out directly for use.Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel; Ollman, Bertell (1998). Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists. \\"The Difference Between Marxism and Market Socialism\\". Routledge. pp. 61‚Äì63. \\"More fundamentally, a socialist society must be one in which the economy is run on the principle of the direct satisfaction of human needs. [...] Exchange-value, prices and so money are goals in themselves in a capitalist society or in any market. There is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital or sums of money and human welfare. Under conditions of backwardness, the spur of money and the accumulation of wealth has led to a massive growth in industry and technology. [...] It seems an odd argument to say that a capitalist will only be efficient in producing use-value of a good quality when trying to make more money than the next capitalist. It would seem easier to rely on the planning of use-values in a rational way, which because there is no duplication, would be produced more cheaply and be of a higher quality. [...] Although money, and so monetary calculation, will disappear in socialism this does not mean that there will no longer be any need to make choices, evaluations and calculations. [...] Wealth will be produced and distributed in its natural form of useful things, of objects that can serve to satisfy some human need or other. Not being produced for sale on a market, items of wealth will not acquire an exchange-value in addition to their use-value. In socialism their value, in the normal non-economic sense of the word, will not be their selling price nor the time needed to produce them but their usefulness. It is for this that they will be appreciated, evaluated, wanted and produced.\\" There have been numerous political movements whose members called themselves socialist under some definition of the term‚Äîsome of these interpretations are mutually exclusive and all of them have generated debates over the true meaning of socialism. Different self-described socialists have used the term socialism to refer to different things such as an economic system, a type of society, a philosophical outlook, a collection of moral values and ideals, or even a certain kind of human character.Boyle, James. \\"What is Socialism?\\", The Shakespeare Press, 1912. pp. 35. Boyle quotes Pierrerismo Joseph Proudhon as stating that socialism is \\"every aspiration towards the amelioration of society\\", and then admitting that, under this definition, \\"we are all socialists.\\" Some definitions of socialism are very vague while others are so specific that they only include a small minority of the things that have been described as socialism in the past such as a mode of production, state socialism or the abolition of wage labour.  Early interpretations  The term socialism was coined in the 1830s and it was first used to refer to philosophical or moral beliefs rather than any specific political views. Alexandre Vinet, who claimed to have been the first person to use the term, defined socialism simply as \\"the opposite of individualism\\".Cort, John C. \\"Christian socialism\\". Orbis Books, New York, 1988. pp. 355. Robert Owen also viewed socialism as a matter of ethics, although he used it with a slightly more specific meaning to refer to the view that human society can and should be improved for the benefit of all. In a similar vein, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon claimed that socialism is \\"every aspiration towards the amelioration of society\\".Boyle, James. \\"What is Socialism?\\", The Shakespeare Press, 1912. pp. 35. In the first half of the 19th century, many writers who described themselves as socialists‚Äîand who would be later called utopian socialists‚Äîwrote down descriptions of what they believed to be the ideal human society. Some of them also created small communities that put their ideals into practice. A constant feature of these ideal societies was social and economic equality. Because the people who proposed the creation of such societies called themselves socialists, the term socialism came to refer not only to a certain moral doctrine, but also to a type of egalitarian society based on such a doctrine. Other early advocates of socialism took a more scientific approach by favouring social leveling to create a meritocratic society based upon freedom for individual talent to prosper. One of those was Count Henri de Saint-Simon, who was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology and believed a socialist society would eliminate the disorderly aspects of capitalism. He advocated the creation of a society in which each person was ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work. The key focus of this early socialism was on administrative efficiency and industrialism and a belief that science was the key to progress.Newman, Michael. (2005) Socialism: A Very Short Introduction, Oxford University Press, Simon's ideas provided a foundation for scientific economic planning and technocratic administration of society. Other early socialist thinkers such as Charles Hall and Thomas Hodgskin based their ideas on David Ricardo's economic theories. They reasoned that the equilibrium value of commodities approximated to prices charged by the producer when those commodities were in elastic supply and that these producer prices corresponded to the embodied labor, i.e. the cost of the labor (essentially the wages paid) that was required to produce the commodities. The Ricardian socialists viewed profit, interest and rent as deductions from this exchange-value. These ideas embodied early conceptions of market socialism. After the advent of Karl Marx's theory of capitalism and scientific socialism, socialism came to refer to ownership and administration of the means of production by the working class, either through the state apparatus or through independent cooperatives. In Marxist theory, socialism refers to a specific stage of social and economic development that will displace capitalism, characterized by coordinated production, public or cooperative ownership of capital, diminishing class conflict and inequalities that spawn from such and the end of wage-labor with a method of compensation based on the principle of \\"From each according to his ability, to each according to his contribution\\".  Differences between various schools  Although they share a common root (as elaborated upon in the above sections), schools of socialism are divided on many issues and sometimes there is a split within a school. The following is a brief overview of the major issues which have generated or are generating significant controversy amongst socialists in general.  Theory  Some branches of socialism arose largely as a philosophical construct (e.g. utopian socialism)‚Äîothers in the heat of a revolution (e.g. early Marxism or Leninism). A few arose merely as the product of a ruling party (e.g. Stalinism), other as a product or various worker movements (e.g. anarcho- syndicalism), or a party or other group contending for political power in a democratic society (e.g. social democracy). Some are in favour of a socialist revolution (e.g. Maoism, Marxism‚ÄìLeninism, revolutionary socialism, social anarchism and Trotskyism) whilst others tend to support reform instead (e.g. Fabianism and individualist anarchism). Others believe both are possible (e.g. syndicalism or various forms of Marxism). The first utopian socialists even failed to address the question of how a socialist society would be achieved, upholding the belief that technology was a necessity for a socialist society and that they themselves had no comprehension of the technology of the future. Socialists are also divided on which rights and liberties are desirable such as the bourgeois liberties (like those guaranteed by the United States First Amendment or the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union). Some hold that they are to be preserved (or even enhanced) in a socialist society (e.g. anarchism or left communism) whilst others believe them to be undesirable (e.g. Marxism‚ÄìLeninism‚ÄìMaoism). Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels even held different opinions at different times and some schools are divided on this issue (e.g. different strains of Trotskyism). All socialists criticize the current system in some way. Some criticisms center on the ownership of the means of production (e.g. Marxism) whereas others tend to focus on the nature of mass and equitable distribution (e.g. most forms of utopian socialism). Most are opposed to unchecked industrialism as well as capitalism (e.g. green left) and believe that under socialism the environment must be protected. Utopian socialists like Robert Owen and Henri de Saint-Simon argued, although not from exactly the same perspective, that the injustice and widespread poverty of the societies they lived in were a problem of distribution of the goods created. On the other hand, Marxian socialists determined that the root of the injustice is based not in the function of distribution of goods already created, but rather in the fact that the ownership of the means of production is in the hands of the upper class. Marxian socialists also maintain in contrast to the utopian socialists that the root of injustice is not in how goods (commodities) are distributed, but for whose economic benefit are they produced and sold.  Practice  Most forms and derivatives of Marxism and anarchism advocated total or near-total socialization of the economy. Less radical schools (e.g. Bernsteinism, reformism and reformist Marxism) proposed a mixed market economy instead. Mixed economies can in turn range anywhere from those developed by the social democratic governments that have periodically governed Northern and Western European countries, to the inclusion of small cooperatives in the planned economy of Yugoslavia under Josip Broz Tito. A related issue is whether it is better to reform capitalism to create a fairer society (e.g. most social democrats) or to totally overthrow the capitalist system (all Marxists). Some schools advocate centralized state control of the socialized sectors of the economy (e.g. Leninism), whilst others argue for control of those sectors by workers' councils (e.g. anarcho-communism, council communism, left communism, Marxism or syndicalism). This question is usually referred to by socialists in terms of \\"ownership of the means of production\\". None of the social democratic parties of Europe advocate total state ownership of the means of production in their contemporary demands and popular press. Another issue socialists are divided on is what legal and political apparatus the workers would maintain and further develop the socialization of the means of production. Some advocate that the power of the workers' councils should itself constitute the basis of a socialist state (coupled with direct democracy and the widespread use of referendums), but others hold that socialism entails the existence of a legislative body administered by people who would be elected in a representative democracy. Different ideologies support different governments. During the era of the Soviet Union, Western socialists were bitterly divided as to whether the Soviet Union was actually socialist, moving toward socialism, or inherently unsocialist and in fact inimical to true socialism. Similarly, today the government of the People's Republic of China claims to be socialist and refers to its own approach as socialism with Chinese characteristics, but most other socialists consider China to be essentially capitalist. The Chinese leadership concurs with most of the usual critiques against a command economy and many of their actions to manage what they call a socialist economy have been determined by this opinion.  Socialist planned economy  This form of socialism combines public ownership and management of the means of production with centralized state planning and can refer to a broad range of economic systems from the centralized Soviet-style command economy to participatory planning via workplace democracy. In a centrally- planned economy decisions regarding the quantity of goods and services to be produced as well as the allocation of output (distribution of goods and services) are planned in advanced by a planning agency. This type of economic system was often combined with a one-party political system and is associated with the Communist states of the 20th century.  State-directed economy  A state-directed economy is a system where either the state or worker cooperatives own the means of production, but economic activity is directed to some degree by a government agency or planning ministry through mechanisms such as indicative planning or dirigisme. This differs from a centralized planned economy, or a command economy, in that micro-economic decision making, such as quantity to be produced and output requirements, is left to managers and workers in state enterprises or cooperative enterprises rather than being mandated by a comprehensive economic plan from a centralized planning board. However, the state will plan long-term strategic investment and some aspect of production. It is possible for a state-directed economy to have elements of both a market and planned economy. For example, production and investment decisions may be semi-planned by the state, but distribution of output may be determined by the market mechanism. State-directed socialism can also refer to technocratic socialism‚Äîeconomic systems that rely on technocratic management and technocratic planning mechanisms, along with public ownership of the means of production. A forerunner of this concept was Henri de Saint-Simon, who understood the state would undergo a transformation in a socialist system and change its role from one of \\"political administration of men, to the administration of things\\". Elements of state-directed socialist economies include dirigisme, economic planning, state socialism and technocracy.  Decentralized planned economy  A decentralized planned economy is one where ownership of enterprises is accomplished through various forms of self- management and worker cooperatives in which planning of production and distribution is done from the bottom-up by local worker councils in a democratic manner. This form of socialist economy is related to the political philosophies of libertarian socialism, syndicalism and various forms of communal utopian socialism. Examples of decentralized democratic planning include council communism, individualist anarchism, industrial democracy, participatory economics, Soviet democracy and syndicalism.  Market socialism  Market socialism refers to various economic systems that involve either public ownership and management or worker cooperative ownership over the means of production, or a combination of both, and the market mechanism for allocating economic output, deciding what to produce and in what quantity. In state-oriented forms of market socialism where state enterprises attempt to maximize profit, the profits can fund government programs and services eliminating or greatly diminishing the need for various forms of taxation that exist in capitalist systems. Some forms of market socialism are based on neoclassical economic theory, with the aim of attaining pareto efficiency by setting price to equal marginal cost in public enterprises. This form of socialism was promoted by Oskar Lange, Abba Lerner and Fredrick Taylor. Other forms of market socialism are based on classical economics, such as those advocated by Thomas Hodgskin, who viewed interest accumulation, rent and profit as deductions from exchange-value, so that eliminating the capitalist element from the economy would lead to a free market and socialism. The term market socialism has also been applied to planned economic systems that try to organize themselves partially along market-lines while retaining centralized state ownership of capital. Examples of market socialism include economic democracy, the Lange model, liberal socialism, market-oriented left- libertarianism, mutualism the New Economic Mechanism and Ricardian socialism. Other types of market socialist systems such as mutualism are related to the political philosophy of libertarian socialism.  Socialist market economy  A socialist market economy refers to the economic systems adopted by the People's Republic of China and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. Although there is dispute as to whether or not these models actually constitute state capitalism, the decisive means of production remain under state-ownership. State enterprises are organized into corporations (corporatization) and operate like private capitalist enterprises. A substantial private sector exists alongside the state sector of the economy, but it plays a secondary role usually relegated to the service sector and production of consumer goods. Examples of socialist market economies include the socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics and the socialist-oriented market economy.  Socialist ideologies = Utopian socialism  Charles Fourier, influential French early socialist Utopian socialism is a term used to define the first currents of modern socialist thought as exemplified by the work of Henri de Saint-Simon, Charles Fourier and Robert Owen, which inspired Karl Marx and other early socialists. However, visions of imaginary ideal societies, which competed with revolutionary social democratic movements, were viewed as not being grounded in the material conditions of society and as \\"reactionary\\". Although it is technically possible for any set of ideas or any person living at any time in history to be a utopian socialist, the term is most often applied to those socialists who lived in the first quarter of the 19th century who were ascribed the label \\"utopian\\" by later socialists as a negative term, in order to imply naivete and dismiss their ideas as fanciful or unrealistic. Forms of socialism which existed in traditional societies, including pre- Marxist communism are referred to as primitive communism by Marxists. As a socialist-positivist politic view created by Auguste Comte, sociocracy is based on Saint-Simon's aristocratic, utopian socialism heritage, prioritizing social justice and a central government with direct democracy without parliament. Religious sects whose members live communally, such as the Hutterites, for example, are not usually called \\"utopian socialists\\", although their way of living is a prime example. They have been categorized as religious socialists by some. Similarly, modern intentional communities based on socialist ideas could also be categorized as \\"utopian socialist\\". While Marxism had a significant impact on socialist thought, pre-Marxist thinkers (before Marx wrote on the subject) have advocated socialism in forms both similar and in stark contrast to Marx and Friedrich Engels' conception of socialism, advocating some form of collective ownership over large-scale production, worker-management within the workplace, or in some cases a form of planned economy. Early socialist philosophers and political theorists included Gerrard Winstanley, who founded the Diggers movement in the United Kingdom; Charles Fourier, French philosopher who propounded principles very similar to that of Marx; Louis Blanqui, French socialist and writer; Marcus Thrane, Norwegian socialist; Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Genevan philosopher, writer and composer whose works influenced the French Revolution; and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, French politician writer. Pre-Marx socialists also included Ricardian socialist economists such as Thomas Hodgskin, English Ricardian socialist and free-market anarchist; Charles Hall; John Francis Bray; John Gray; William Thompson; Percy Ravenstone; James Mill; and John Stuart Mill, classical political economist who came to advocate worker-cooperative socialism. Utopian socialist thinkers included Henri de Saint-Simon, Wilhelm Weitling, Robert Owen, Charles Fourier and √âtienne Cabet.

Communism is usually distinguished from socialism since the 1840s. The modern definition and usage of socialism settled by the 1860s, becoming the predominant term among the group of words associationist, co-operative and mutualist which had previously been used as synonyms. Instead, communism fell out of use during this period. An early distinction between communism and socialism was that the latter aimed to only socialise production while the former aimed to socialise both production and consumption (in the form of free access to final goods). However, Marxists employed socialism in place of communism by 1888 which had come to be considered an old-fashion synonym for socialism. It was not until 1917 after the Bolshevik Revolution that socialism came to refer to a distinct stage between capitalism and communism, introduced by Vladimir Lenin as a means to defend the Bolshevik seizure of power against traditional Marxist criticism that Russia's productive forces were not sufficiently developed for socialist revolution. A distinction between communist and socialist as descriptors of political ideologies arose in 1918 after the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party renamed itself to the All-Russian Communist Party, where communist came to specifically mean socialists who supported the politics and theories of Bolshevism, Leninism and later Marxism‚ÄìLeninism, although communist parties continued to describe themselves as socialists dedicated to socialism. Both communism and socialism eventually accorded with the adherents' and opponents' cultural attitude towards religion. In Christian Europe, communism was believed to be the atheist way of life. In Protestant England, communism was too culturally and aurally close to the Roman Catholic communion rite, hence English atheists denoted themselves socialists. Friedrich Engels argued that in 1848, at the time when The Communist Manifesto was first published, \\"socialism was respectable on the continent, while communism was not\\". The Owenites in England and the Fourierists in France were considered respectable socialists while working-class movements that \\"proclaimed the necessity of total social change\\" denoted themselves communists. This latter branch of socialism produced the communist work of √âtienne Cabet in France and Wilhelm Weitling in Germany.Engels, Friedrich (2002) [1888]. Preface to the 1888 English Edition of the Communist Manifesto. Penguin. p. 202. While democrats looked to the Revolutions of 1848 as a democratic revolution which in the long run ensured liberty, equality and fraternity, Marxists denounced 1848 as a betrayal of working-class ideals by a bourgeoisie indifferent to the legitimate demands of the proletariat.Gildea, Robert (2000). \\"1848 in European Collective Memory\\". In Evans, Robert John Westonm, ed. The Revolutions in Europe, 1848‚Äì1849. pp. 207‚Äì235. The dominant forms of communism are based on Marxism, but non-Marxist versions of communism such as anarcho-communism and Christian communism also exist. According to The Oxford Handbook of Karl Marx, \\"Marx used many terms to refer to a post-capitalist society‚Äîpositive humanism, socialism, Communism, realm of free individuality, free association of producers, etc. He used these terms completely interchangeably. The notion that \\"socialism\\" and \\"Communism\\" are distinct historical stages is alien to his work and only entered the lexicon of Marxism after his death\\".Hudis, Peter; Vidal, Matt, Smith, Tony; Rotta, Tom√°s; Prew, Paul, eds. (September 2018‚ÄìJune 2019). The Oxford Handbook of Karl Marx. \\"Marx's Concept of Socialism\\". Oxford University Press. . .  Marxism  Karl Marx, influential German socialist Marxism, or Marxist communism, refers to classless, stateless social organization based upon common ownership of the means of production and to a variety of movements acting in the name of this goal which are influenced by the thought of Karl Marx. In general, the classless forms of social organisation are not capitalised while movements associated with official communist parties and communist states usually are. In the classic Marxist definition (pure communism), a communist economy refers to a system that has achieved a superabundance of goods and services due to an increase in technological capability and advances in the productive forces and therefore has transcended socialism such as a post-scarcity economy. This is a hypothetical stage of social and economic development with few speculative details known about it. The actual goal of communism has never been attained in practice from a Marxist position, though anarchist societies have provided a glimpse of what a communist world would look like. The real idea behind it is to abolish all leadership, and govern with a commune. That is, the people themselves make all decisions, and everyone contributing to the wellbeing of the commune. Communist state is used by Western historians, political scientists and media to refer to these countries and distinguish them from other socialist states. In practice, most governments that have claimed to be communists have not described themselves as a communist state nor they claimed to have achieved communism or communist society. Those states have referred to themselves as socialist states (i.e. states that are constitutionally socialist) that are in the process of constructing socialism. The modern political marxist communist movement was created when the social democratic parties of Europe split between their rightist and leftist tendencies during World War I. The leftists, led internationally by Vladimir Lenin, Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, to distinguish their brand of socialism from the \\"reformist\\" social democrats, were called \\"communists\\". However, after Luxemburg's and Liebknecht's murders the term communist became generally associated solely with the parties and organisations following Lenin, along with their various derivations, such as Stalinism or Maoism. There is a considerable variety of views among self-identified communists. However, Marxism and Leninism, schools of communism associated with Karl Marx and of Vladimir Lenin respectively, have the distinction of having been a major force in world politics since the early 20th century. Class struggle plays a central role in Marxism. This theory views the formation of communism as the culmination of the class struggle between the capitalist class, the owners of most of the capital and the working class. Marx held that society could not be transformed from the capitalist mode of production to the communist mode of production all at once, but required a transitional state which Marx described as the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat. Some forms of the communist society that Marx envisioned, as emerging from capitalism, have been claimed to be achieved for limited periods during certain historical moments and under certain circumstances. For example, the Paris Commune in fact let Marx reinforce and implement his theories by adapting them to a real experience he could draw from. Another similar case, though disputed by anarcho-syndicalism or even anarchism, was the Spanish Revolution of 1936 (often missed or unmentioned by official historiography), during which much of Spain's economy in most of Republican areas, some of which enjoyed a practical absence of state, was put under workers' direct collective control. In addition to this, the term communism (as well as socialism) is often used to refer to those political and economic systems and states dominated by a political, bureaucratic class, typically attached to one single Communist party that follow Marxist-Leninist doctrines and often claim to represent the dictatorship of the proletariat in a non-democratic fashion, described by critics as in a totalitarian and bureaucratic. These systems are also often called Stalinism, state capitalism, state communism or state socialism. With the Soviet Union's creation after the end of Russian Civil War that followed to initial success of Red October Revolution in Russia, other socialist parties in other countries and the Bolshevik party itself became Communist parties, owing allegiance of varying degrees to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (see Communist International). After World War II, regimes calling themselves Communist took power in Eastern Europe. In 1949, the Communists in China, supported by Soviet Union and led by Mao Zedong, came to power and established the People's Republic of China. Among the other countries in the Third World that adopted a bureaucratic Communist state as form of government at some point were Cuba, North Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Angola and Mozambique. By the early 1980s, almost one third of the world's population lived under Communist states. Communism carries a strong social stigma in the United States due to a history of anti-communism in the United States. Since the early 1970s, the term Eurocommunism was used to refer to the policies of Communist parties in western Europe, which sought to break with the tradition of uncritical and unconditional support of the Soviet Union. Such parties were politically active and electorally significant in France and Italy. With the collapse of the statalized one-party systems and Marxist‚ÄìLeninist governments, in Eastern Europe from the late 1980s and the breakup of the Soviet Union on December 8, 1991, Marxist‚ÄìLeninist state communism's influence has decreased dramatically in Europe, but around a quarter of the world's population still lives under such a kind of Communist states. = Leninism and Marxism‚ÄìLeninism = Vladimir Lenin never used the term Leninism, nor did he refer to his views as Marxism‚ÄìLeninism. However, his ideas diverged from classical Marxist theory on several important points (see the articles on Marxism and Leninism for more information). Bolshevik communists saw these differences as advancements of Marxism made by Lenin. After Lenin's death, his ideology and contributions to Marxist theory were termed \\"Marxism‚ÄìLeninism\\", or sometimes only \\"Leninism\\". Marxism‚ÄìLeninism soon became the official name for the ideology of the Comintern and of Communist parties around the world. = Stalinism = Stalinism was the theory and practice of communism practiced by Joseph Stalin, leader of the Soviet Union from 1928‚Äì1953. Officially it adhered to Marxism‚ÄìLeninism, but whether Stalin's practices actually followed the principles of Marx and Lenin is a subject of debate and criticism. In contrast to Marx and Lenin, Stalin made few new theoretical contributions. Stalin's main contributions to communist theory were Socialism in One Country and the theory of Aggravation of class struggle under socialism, a theoretical base supporting the repression of political opponents as necessary. Stalinism took an aggressive stance on class conflict, utilizing state violence in an attempt to forcibly purge society of the bourgeoisie.Stephen Kotkin. Magnetic Mountain: Stalinism As a Civilization. First Paperback Edition. Berkeley and Los Angeles, California, USA: University of California Press, 1997. . pp. 71, 307, 81. The groundwork for the Soviet policy concerning nationalities was laid out in Stalin's 1913 work Marxism and the National Question. Stalinist policies in the Soviet Union included rapid industrialization, Five-Year Plans, socialism in one country, a centralized state, collectivization of agriculture and subordination of interests of other communist parties to those of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.T. B. Bottomore. A Dictionary of Marxist thought. Malden, Massaschussetts, USA; Oxford, England, UK; Melbourne, Victoria, Australia; Berlin, Germany: Wiley- Blackwell, 1991. pp. 54. Rapid industrialization was designed to accelerate the development towards communism, stressing that industrialization was needed because the country was economically backward in comparison with other countries, and was needed in order to face the challenges posed by internal and external enemies.Stephen Kotkin. Magnetic Mountain: Stalinism As a Civilization. First Paperback Edition. Berkeley and Los Angeles, California: University of California Press, 1997. . pp. 70‚Äì71. Rapid industrialization was accompanied with mass collective farming and rapid urbanization.Stephen Kotkin. Magnetic Mountain: Stalinism As a Civilization. First Paperback Edition. Berkeley and Los Angeles, California, USA: University of California Press, 1997. . pp. 70‚Äì79. Rapid urbanization converted many small villages into industrial cities. = Maoism = A key concept that distinguishes Maoism from other left-wing ideologies is the belief that the class struggle continues throughout the entire socialist period, as a result of the fundamental antagonistic contradiction between capitalism and communism. Even when the proletariat has seized state power through a socialist revolution, the potential remains for a bourgeoisie to restore capitalism. Indeed, Mao famously stated that \\"the bourgeoisie [in a socialist country] is right inside the Communist Party itself\\", implying that corrupt Party officials would subvert socialism if not prevented. Unlike the earlier forms of Marxism- Leninism in which the urban proletariat was seen as the main source of revolution, and the countryside was largely ignored, Mao focused on the peasantry as a revolutionary force which, he said, could be mobilized by a Communist Party with their knowledge and leadership. Unlike most other political ideologies, including other socialist and Marxist ones, Maoism contains an integral military doctrine and explicitly connects its political ideology with military strategy. In Maoist thought, \\"political power comes from the barrel of the gun\\" (one of Mao's quotes), and the peasantry can be mobilized to undertake a \\"people's war\\" of armed struggle involving guerrilla warfare. Since the death of Mao and the reforms of Deng, most of the parties explicitly defining themselves as \\"Maoist\\" have disappeared, but various communist groups around the world, particularly armed ones like the Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), the CPI (Maoist) and CPI (ML) of India and the New People's Army of the Philippines, continue to advance Maoist ideas and get press attention for them. These groups generally have the idea that Mao's ideas were betrayed before they could be fully or properly implemented. = Trotskyism = Trotskyism is the theory of Marxism as advocated by Leon Trotsky. Trotsky considered himself a Bolshevik‚ÄìLeninist, arguing for the establishment of a vanguard party. He considered himself an advocate of orthodox Marxism. His politics differed greatly from those of Stalin or Mao, most importantly in declaring the need for an international \\"permanent revolution\\" and arguing that democracy is essential to both socialism and communism. Numerous groups around the world continue to describe themselves as Trotskyist and see themselves as standing in this tradition, although they have diverse interpretations of the conclusions to be drawn from this. = Council communism and left communism = Council communism, or councilism, is a current of libertarian Marxism that emerged from the November Revolution in the 1920s, characterized by its opposition to state capitalism/state socialism as well as its advocacy of workers' councils as the basis for workers' democracy. Originally affiliated with the Communist Workers Party of Germany (KAPD), council communism continues today as a theoretical and activist position within the greater libertarian socialism movement. Chief among the tenets of council communism is its opposition to the party vanguardismAnton Pannekoek (1936) Workers‚Äô Councils and democratic centralismPannekoek, Anton. State Capitalism and Dictatorship International Council Correspondence, Vol.III, No.1, January 1937. of Leninist ideologies and its contention that democratic workers' councils arising in the factories and municipalities are the natural form of working class organization and authority. Council communism also stands in contrast to social democracy through its formal rejection of both the reformism and parliamentarism.Ruhle, Otto. \\"The Revolution Is Not A Party Affair\\". 1920. The historical origins of left communism can be traced to the period before World War I, but it only came into focus after 1918. All left communists were supportive of the October Revolution in Russia, but retained a critical view of its development. However, some would in later years come to reject the idea that the revolution had a proletarian or socialist nature, asserting that it had simply carried out the tasks of the bourgeois revolution by creating a state capitalist system. = Autonomism = Antonio Negri, main theorist of Italian autonomism Autonomism refers to a set of left-wing political and social movements and theories close to the socialist movement. As an identifiable theoretical system it first emerged in Italy in the 1960s from workerist (operaismo) communism. Later, post-Marxist and anarchist tendencies became significant after influence from the Situationists, the failure of Italian far-left movements in the 1970s, and the emergence of a number of important theorists including Antonio Negri, who had contributed to the 1969 founding of Potere Operaio, Mario Tronti, Paolo Virno, etc. Unlike other forms of Marxism, autonomist Marxism emphasises the ability of the working class to force changes to the organization of the capitalist system independent of the state, trade unions or political parties. Autonomists are less concerned with party political organization than other Marxists, focusing instead on self-organized action outside of traditional organizational structures. Autonomist Marxism is thus a \\"bottom up\\" theory: it draws attention to activities that autonomists see as everyday working class resistance to capitalism, for example absenteeism, slow working, and socialization in the workplace. Through translations made available by Danilo Montaldi and others, the Italian autonomists drew upon previous activist research in the United States by the Johnson-Forest Tendency and in France by the group Socialisme ou Barbarie. It influenced the German and Dutch Autonomen, the worldwide Social Centre movement, and today is influential in Italy, France, and to a lesser extent the English-speaking countries. Those who describe themselves as autonomists now vary from Marxists to post-structuralists and anarchists. The Autonomist Marxist and Autonomen movements provided inspiration to some on the revolutionary left in English speaking countries, particularly among anarchists, many of whom have adopted autonomist tactics. Some English- speaking anarchists even describe themselves as Autonomists. The Italian operaismo movement also influenced Marxist academics such as Harry Cleaver, John Holloway, Steve Wright, and Nick Dyer-Witheford.  Anarchism  Anarchism is a political philosophy that advocates stateless societies based on non-hierarchical free associations.\\"That is why Anarchy, when it works to destroy authority in all its aspects, when it demands the abrogation of laws and the abolition of the mechanism that serves to impose them, when it refuses all hierarchical organization and preaches free agreement ‚Äî at the same time strives to maintain and enlarge the precious kernel of social customs without which no human or animal society can exist.\\" Peter Kropotkin.

Anarchism is distinguished, philosophically, by its scepticism towards such moral relations-by its questioning of the claims made for such normative power- and, practically, by its challenge to those \\"authoritative\\" powers which cannot justify their claims and which are therefore deemed illegitimate or without moral foundation.\\"Anarchism and Authority: A Philosophical Introduction to Classical Anarchism by Paul McLaughlin. AshGate. 2007. pg. 1\\"Anarchism, then, really stands for the liberation of the human mind from the dominion of religion; the liberation of the human body from the dominion of property; liberation from the shackles and restraint of government. Anarchism stands for a social order based on the free grouping of individuals for the purpose of producing real social wealth; an order that will guarantee to every human being free access to the earth and full enjoyment of the necessities of life, according to individual desires, tastes, and inclinations.\\" Emma Goldman. \\"What it Really Stands for Anarchy\\" in Anarchism and Other Essays.Individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker defined anarchism as opposition to authority as follows \\"They found that they must turn either to the right or to the left, ‚Äî follow either the path of Authority or the path of Liberty. Marx went one way; Warren and Proudhon the other. Thus were born State Socialism and Anarchism ... Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity. Good representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of Karl Marx.\\" Benjamin Tucker. Individual Liberty.Anarchist historian George Woodcock report of Mikhail Bakunin's anti-authoritarianism and shows opposition to both state and non-state forms of authority as follows: \\"All anarchists deny authority; many of them fight against it.\\" (pg. 9) ... Bakunin did not convert the League's central committee to his full program, but he did persuade them to accept a remarkably radical recommendation to the Berne Congress of September 1868, demanding economic equality and implicitly attacking authority in both Church and State.\\" Anarchism as a social movement has regularly endured fluctuations in popularity. Its classical period, which scholars demarcate as from 1860 to 1939, is associated with the working-class movements of the 19th century and the Spanish Civil War-era struggles against fascism.Jonathan Purkis and James Bowen, \\"Introduction: Why Anarchism Still Matters\\", in Jonathan Purkis and James Bowen (eds), Changing Anarchism: Anarchist Theory and Practice in a Global Age (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2004), p. 3. Mikhail Bakunin, a Russian anarchist who opposed the Marxist aim of dictatorship of the proletariat in favour of universal rebellion and allied himself with the federalists in the First International before his expulsion by Marxists BBC News: South America's leftward sweep In 1864 the International Workingmen's Association (sometimes called the First International) united diverse revolutionary currents including French followers of Proudhon, The anti- authoritarian sections of the First International were the precursors of the anarcho-syndicalists, seeking to \\"replace the privilege and authority of the State\\" with the \\"free and spontaneous organization of labor.\\"Resolutions from the St. Imier Congress, in Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas, Vol. 1, p. 100 In 1907, the International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam gathered delegates from 14 different countries, among which important figures of the anarchist movement, including Errico Malatesta, Pierre Monatte, Luigi Fabbri, Beno√Æt Broutchoux, Emma Goldman, Rudolf Rocker, and Christiaan Cornelissen. Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, popular education issues, the general strike or antimilitarism. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and syndicalism (or trade unionism). The Spanish Workers Federation in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain. The most successful was the Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Before the 1940s, the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics, attracting 1.58 million members at one point and playing a major role in the Spanish Civil War. The CNT was affiliated with the International Workers Association, a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922, with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in Europe and Latin America. Some anarchists, such as Johann Most, advocated publicizing violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because \\"we preach not only action in and for itself, but also action as propaganda.\\" Numerous heads of state were assassinated between 1881 and 1914 by members of the anarchist movement. For example, U.S. President McKinley's assassin Leon Czolgosz claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and feminist Emma Goldman. Anarchists participated alongside the Bolsheviks in both February and October revolutions, and were initially enthusiastic about the Bolshevik coup. However, the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, a conflict that culminated in the 1921 Kronstadt rebellion which the new government repressed. Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned, driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks; the anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to the Ukraine. There, in the Free Territory, they fought in the civil war against the Whites (a Western-backed grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the October Revolution) and then the Bolsheviks as part of the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine led by Nestor Makhno, who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months. In the 1920s and 1930s, the rise of fascism in Europe transformed anarchism's conflict with the state. In Spain, the CNT initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right-wing election victory. In 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the former ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì1939). In response to the army rebellion, an anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of Barcelona and of large areas of rural Spain where they collectivised the land. But even before the fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the Stalinists, who controlled the distribution of military aid to the Republican cause from the Soviet Union. Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both dissident Marxists and anarchists. A surge of popular interest in anarchism occurred during the 1960s and 1970s. In 1968 in Carrara, Italy the International of Anarchist Federations was founded during an international Anarchist conference in Carrara in 1968 by the three existing European federations of France, the Italian and the Iberian Anarchist Federation as well as the Bulgarian federation in French exile.London Federation of Anarchists involvement in Carrara conference, 1968 International Institute of Social History, Accessed 19 January 2010Short history of the IAF-IFA A-infos news project, Accessed 19 January 2010 In the United Kingdom this was associated with the punk rock movement, as exemplified by bands such as Crass and the Sex Pistols. The housing and employment crisis in most of Western Europe led to the formation of communes and squatter movements like that of Barcelona, Spain. In Denmark, squatters occupied a disused military base and declared the Freetown Christiania, an autonomous haven in central Copenhagen. Since the revival of anarchism in the mid 20th century, a number of new movements and schools of thought emerged. Around the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti-war, anti- capitalist, and anti-globalisation movements. Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Group of Eight, and the World Economic Forum. International anarchist federations in existence include the International of Anarchist Federations, the International Workers' Association, and International Libertarian Solidarity. = Mutualism = Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, French socialist and theoretician of mutualism Mutualism began in 18th-century English and French labor movements, then took an anarchist form associated with Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in France and others in the US.\\"A member of a community\\", The Mutualist; this 1826 series criticized Robert Owen's proposals, and has been attributed to Josiah Warren or another dissident Owenite in the same circles; Wilbur, Shawn, 2006, \\"More from the 1826 \\"Mutualist\\"?\\" This influenced individualist anarchists in the United States such as Benjamin Tucker and William B. Greene. Josiah Warren proposed similar ideas in 1833Warren published the periodical \\"The Peaceful Revolutionist\\" in 1833, seven years before Proudhon's \\"What is Property.\\" after participating in a failed Owenite experiment.\\"While more learned men lost faith in utopias and in human nature when the New Harmony experiment failed, Warren became more trusting than before in man's intelligence and perfectibility.\\" ‚Äì Native American Anarchism, pg. 94, Eunice Schuster In the 1840s and 1850s, Charles A. Dana,Dana, Charles A. Proudhon and his \\"Bank of the People\\" (1848). and William B. Greene introduced Proudhon's works to the US. Greene adapted Proudhon's mutualism to American conditions and introduced it to Benjamin R. Tucker.Tucker, Benjamin R., \\"On Picket Duty\\", Liberty (Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order) (1881‚Äì1908); 5 January 1889; 6, 10; APS Online pg. 1 Mutualist anarchism is concerned with reciprocity, free association, voluntary contract, federation, and credit and currency reform. Many mutualists believe a market without government intervention drives prices down to labor-costs, eliminating profit, rent, and interest according to the labor theory of value. Firms would be forced to compete over workers just as workers compete over firms, raising wages.\\"Under the mutual system, each individual will receive the just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount; and so much as the individual laborer will then get over and above what he has earned will come to him as his share in the general prosperity of the community of which he is an individual member.\\" From \\"Communism versus Mutualism\\", Socialistic, Communistic, Mutualistic and Financial Fragments. (Boston: Lee & Shepard, 1875) by William Batchelder Greene Some see mutualism as between individualist and collectivist anarchism;Avrich, Paul. Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America, Princeton University Press 1996 , p.6 Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought, Blackwell Publishing 1991 , p.11 in What Is Property?, Proudhon develops a concept of \\"liberty\\", equivalent to \\"anarchy\\", which is the dialectical \\"synthesis of communism and property.\\"Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph What is Property? (1840), p. 281 Greene, influenced by Pierre Leroux, sought mutualism in the synthesis of three philosophies ‚Äì communism, capitalism and socialism.Greene, William B. \\"Communism ‚Äì Capitalism ‚Äì Socialism \\", Equality (1849), p. 59. Later individualist anarchists used the term mutualism but retained little emphasis on synthesis, while social anarchists such as the authors of An Anarchist FAQ claim mutualism as a subset of their philosophical tradition. = Collectivist anarchism = Collectivist anarchism is a revolutionaryPatsouras, Louis. 2005. Marx in Context. iUniverse. p. 54 form of anarchism most commonly associated with Mikhail Bakunin, Johann Most and the anti-authoritarian section of the First International (1864‚Äì1876).Avrich, Paul. 2006. Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America. AK Press. p. 5 Unlike mutualists, collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production, instead advocating that ownership be collectivized. This was to be initiated by small cohesive elite group through acts of violence, or \\"propaganda by the deed\\", which would inspire the workers to revolt and forcibly collectivize the means of production. Workers would be compensated for their work on the basis of the amount of time they contributed to production, rather than goods being distributed \\"according to need\\" as in anarcho-communism. Although Collectivist anarchism shares many similarities with Anarchist communism there are also many key differences between them. For example, collectivist anarchists believe that the economy and most or all property should be collectively owned by society while anarchist communists by contrast believe that the concept of ownership should be rejected by society and replaced with the concept of usage.Alexander Beckman. What is Anarchism?, p. 217 Also Collectivist anarchists often favor using a form of currency to compensate workers according to the amount of time spent contributing to society and production while Anarcho-communists believe that currency and wages should be abolished all together and goods should be distributed \\"to each according to his or her need\\". = Anarcho-communism = Peter Kropotkin, an anarcho-communist theoretician who argued that workers spontaneously self-organize to produce goods in common for all society in anarchy Anarcho-communists propose that a society composed of a number of self-governing communes with collective use of the means of production, with direct democracy as the political organizational form, and related to other communes through federation would be the freest form of social organisation. However, some anarcho-communists oppose the majoritarian nature of direct democracy, feeling that it can impede individual liberty and favor consensus democracy.Graeber, David and Grubacic, Andrej. Anarchism, Or The Revolutionary Movement Of The Twenty-first Century Joseph D√©jacque was an early anarcho- communist and the first person to describe himself as \\"libertarian\\".De l'√™tre- humain m√¢le et femelle ‚Äì Lettre √† P.J. Proudhon par Joseph D√©jacque (in French) Other important anarcho-communists include Peter Kropotkin, Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman and Errico Malatesta. In anarcho-communism, individuals would not receive direct compensation for labour (through sharing of profits or payment), but would instead have free access to the resources and surplus of the commune.Miller. Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought, Blackwell Publishing (1991) , p. 12 On the basis of his biological research and experimentation, Kropotkin believed that humans and human society are more inclined towards efforts for mutual benefit than toward competition and strife.Kropotkin, Peter Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution, 1998 paperback, London: Freedom Press. , also at Project Gutenburg.Kropotkin, Peter The Conquest of Bread, first published 1892, also at Anarchy Archives.Kropotkin, Peter Fields, Factories and Workshops, available at Anarchy Archives.Bookchin, Murray Post Scarcity Anarchism (1971 and 2004) . Kropotkin believed that private property was one of the causes of oppression and exploitation and called for its abolition,\\"[t]he landlord owes his riches to the poverty of the peasants, and the wealth of the capitalist comes from the same source\\" ‚Äì Kropotkin, \\"The Conquest of Bread\\" op cit.Kropotkin, Peter. Words of a Rebel, p99. but he only opposed ownership, not possession.\\"We do not want to rob any one of his coat, but we wish to give to the workers all those things the lack of which makes them fall an easy prey to the exploiter, and we will do our utmost that none shall lack aught, that not a single man shall be forced to sell the strength of his right arm to obtain a bare subsistence for himself and his babes. This is what we mean when we talk of Expropriation...\\" Peter Kropotkin, The Conquest Of Bread, Chapter IV: Expropriation Some anarcho- syndicalists saw anarcho-communism as their objective. For example, the Spanish CNT adopted Isaac Puente's 1932 \\"Libertarian Communism\\" as its manifesto for a post-revolutionary society.Puente, Isaac \\"Libertarian Communism\\" (The Cienfuegos Press Anarchist Review' #6 Orkney 1982) Anarcho- communism does not always have a communitarian philosophy. Some forms of anarcho-communism are egoist and strongly influenced by radical individualism believing that anarcho-communism does not require a communitarian nature at all. Forms of libertarian communism such as Situationism are strongly egoist in nature.see, for example, Christopher Gray, Leaving the Twentieth Century, p. 88. Anarcho-communist Emma Goldman was influenced by both Stirner and Kropotkin and blended their philosophies together in her own, as shown in books of hers such as Anarchism And Other Essays.Emma Goldman, Anarchism and Other Essays, p. 50. = Anarcho-syndicalism = Anarcho-syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that focuses on the labor movement.Sorel, Georges. 'Political Theorists in Context' Routledge (2004) p. 248 Anarcho-syndicalists view labor unions as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self- managed by workers. The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are the following: # Workers' solidarity # Direct action # Workers' self-management Flag often used by anarcho-syndicalists and anarcho-communists and the flag of Revolutionary Catalonia, a 20th-century example of an anarcho-syndicalist society Workers' solidarity means that anarcho-syndicalists believe all workers‚Äîno matter their race, gender, or ethnic group‚Äîare in a similar situation in regard to their boss (class consciousness). Furthermore, it means that, within capitalism, any gains or losses made by some workers from or to bosses will eventually affect all workers. Therefore, all workers must support one another in their class conflict to liberate themselves. Anarcho- syndicalists believe that only direct action‚Äîthat is, action concentrated on directly attaining a goal, as opposed to indirect action, such as electing a representative to a government position‚Äîwill allow workers to liberate themselves.Rocker, Rudolf. 'Anarcho-Syndicalism: Theory and Practice' AK Press (2004) p. 73 Moreover, anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers' organizations (the organizations that struggle against the wage system, which, in anarcho-syndicalist theory, will eventually form the basis of a new society) should be self-managing. They should not have bosses or \\"business agents\\"; rather, the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves. Rudolf Rocker was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement. He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought, and why it was important to the future of labor in his 1938 pamphlet Anarcho-Syndicalism. The International Workers Association is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labor unions from different countries. The Spanish Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo played and still plays a major role in the Spanish labor movement. It was also an important force in the Spanish Civil War. = Individualist anarchism = Individualist anarchism is a set of several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the individual and their will over external determinants such as groups, society, traditions and ideological systems.\\"What do I mean by individualism? I mean by individualism the moral doctrine which, relying on no dogma, no tradition, no external determination, appeals only to the individual conscience.\\"Mini-Manual of Individualism by Han Ryner\\"I do not admit anything except the existence of the individual, as a condition of his sovereignty. To say that the sovereignty of the individual is conditioned by Liberty is simply another way of saying that it is conditioned by itself.\\"\\"Anarchism and the State\\" in Individual Liberty Although usually contrasted to social anarchism, both individualist and social anarchism have influenced each other. Mutualism, an economy theory particularly influential within individualist anarchism whose pursued liberty has been called the synthesis of communism and property,Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph (1840). What Is Property? An Inquiry into the Principle of Right and of Government. \\"Chapter V. Psychological Exposition of the Idea of Justice and Injustice, and a Determination of the Principle of Government and of Right\\". \\"This third form of society, the synthesis of communism and property, we call liberty\\". has been considered sometimes part of individualist anarchism and other times part of social anarchism. Many anarcho-communists regard themselves as radical individualists,Baginki, Max (May 1907). \\"Stirner: The Ego and His Own\\". Mother Earth (2: 3). \\"Modern Communists are more individualistic than Stirner. To them, not merely religion, morality, family and State are spooks, but property also is no more than a spook, in whose name the individual is enslaved ‚Äî and how enslaved! [...] Communism thus creates a basis for the liberty and Eigenheit of the individual. I am a Communist because I am an Individualist. Fully as heartily the Communists concur with Stirner when he puts the word take in place of demand ‚Äî that leads to the dissolution of property, to expropriation. Individualism and Communism go hand in hand.\\"; Novatore, Renzo (1924). \\"Towards the Creative Nothing\\"; Gray, Christopher (1974). Leaving the Twentieth Century. p. 88; Black, Bob (2010). \\"Nightmares of Reason\\". \\"[C]ommunism is the final fulfillment of individualism. [...] The apparent contradiction between individualism and communism rests on a misunderstanding of both. [...] Subjectivity is also objective: the individual really is subjective. It is nonsense to speak of \\"emphatically prioritizing the social over the individual,\\" [...]. You may as well speak of prioritizing the chicken over the egg. Anarchy is a \\"method of individualization.\\" It aims to combine the greatest individual development with the greatest communal unity\\". seeing anarcho-communism as the best social system for the realization of individual freedom.Kropotkin, Peter (1901). \\"Communism and Anarchy\\". \\"Communism is the one which guarantees the greatest amount of individual liberty ‚Äî provided that the idea that begets the community be Liberty, Anarchy [...]. Communism guarantees economic freedom better than any other form of association, because it can guarantee wellbeing, even luxury, in return for a few hours of work instead of a day's work.\\"; Truda, Dielo (1926). \\"Organisational Platform of the Libertarian Communists\\". \\"This other society will be libertarian communism, in which social solidarity and free individuality find their full expression, and in which these two ideas develop in perfect harmony.\\"; \\"My Perspectives\\". Willful Disobedience (2: 12). \\"I see the dichotomies made between individualism and communism, individual revolt and class struggle, the struggle against human exploitation and the exploitation of nature as false dichotomies and feel that those who accept them are impoverishing their own critique and struggle.\\"; Brown, L. Susan (2002). The Politics of Individualism. Black Rose Books; Brown, L. Susan (2 February 2011). \\"Does Work Really Work?\\". As a term, individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy, but it refers to a group of individualist philosophies that sometimes are in conflict. Among the early influences on individualist anarchism were William Godwin, Josiah Warren (sovereignty of the individual), Max Stirner (egoism), Lysander Spooner (natural law), Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (mutualism), Henry David Thoreau (transcendentalism),\\"Paralelamente, al otro lado del atl√°ntico, en el diferente contexto de una naci√≥n a medio hacer, los Estados Unidos, otros fil√≥sofos elaboraron un pensamiento individualista similar, aunque con sus propias especificidades. Henry David Thoreau (1817‚Äì1862), uno de los escritores pr√≥ximos al movimiento de la filosof√≠a trascendentalista, es uno de los m√°s conocidos. Su obra m√°s representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una caba√±a en el bosque, y vivir en √≠ntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosof√≠a trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armon√≠a de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por Jonh Zerzan. Para George Woodcock, esta actitud puede estar tambi√©n motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX.\\"\\"Voluntary non-submission.

Benjamin Tucker, a famous 19th- century individualist anarchist, held that \\"if the individual has the right to govern himself, all external government is tyranny\\". Tucker also argued that it was \\"not Socialist Anarchism against Individualist Anarchism, but of Communist Socialism against Individualist Socialism\\".Tucker, Benjamin (1970). Liberty. Greenwood Reprint Corporation. 7‚Äì8. p. 26. \\"Liberty has always insisted that Individualism and Socialism are not antithetical terms; that, on the contrary, the most ... not of Socialist Anarchism against Individualist Anarchism, but of Communist Socialism against Individualist Socialism.\\" The view of an individualist‚Äìsocialist divide is contested as individualist anarchism is socialistic.Martin, James J. (1953). Men Against the State: the State the Expositors of Individualist Anarchism. Dekalb, Illinois: The Adrian Allen Associates. Josiah Warren, regarded by some as the first American anarchist Josiah Warren is widely regarded as the first American anarchistPalmer, Brian (2010-12-29) What do anarchists want from us?, Slate.com and the four-page weekly paper he edited during 1833, The Peaceful Revolutionist, was the first anarchist periodical published.William Bailie, Josiah Warren: The First American Anarchist ‚Äì A Sociological Study, Boston: Small, Maynard & Co., 1906, p. 20 For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster, \\"[i]t is apparent [...] that Proudhonian Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of Josiah Warren and Stephen Pearl Andrews [...]. William B. Greene presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form\\". Later, the American individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker \\"was against both the state and capitalism, against both oppression and exploitation. While not against the market and property he was firmly against capitalism as it was, in his eyes, a state-supported monopoly of social capital (tools, machinery, etc.) which allows owners to exploit their employees, i.e., to avoid paying workers the full value of their labour. He thought that the \\"labouring classes are deprived of their earnings by usury in its three forms, interest, rent and profit\\", therefore \\"Liberty will abolish interest; it will abolish profit; it will abolish monopolistic rent; it will abolish taxation; it will abolish the exploitation of labour; it will abolish all means whereby any labourer can be deprived of any of his product\\". This stance puts him squarely in the libertarian socialist tradition and Tucker referred to himself many times as a socialist and considered his philosophy to be anarchistic socialism.\\"Benjamin Tucker: Capitalist or Anarchist\\" in An Anarchist FAQ by Various Authors\\"The economic principles of Modern Socialism are a logical deduction from the principle laid down by Adam Smith in the early chapters of his \\"Wealth of Nations,\\" ‚Äì namely, that labor is the true measure of price...Half a century or more after Smith enunciated the principle above stated, Socialism picked it up where he had dropped it, and in following it to its logical conclusions, made it the basis of a new economic philosophy...This seems to have been done independently by three different men, of three different nationalities, in three different languages: Josiah Warren, an American; Pierre J. Proudhon, a Frenchman; Karl Marx, a German Jew...That the work of this interesting trio should have been done so nearly simultaneously would seem to indicate that Socialism was in the air, and that the time was ripe and the conditions favorable for the appearance of this new school of thought...So far as priority of time is concerned, the credit seems to belong to Warren, the American, ‚Äì a fact which should be noted by the stump orators who are so fond of declaiming against Socialism as an imported article.\\" Benjamin Tucker. Individual Liberty √âmile Armand, French idividualist anarchist French individualist anarchist √âmile Armand shows clearly opposition to capitalism and centralized economies when he said that the individualist anarchist \\"inwardly he remains refractory ‚Äì fatally refractory ‚Äì morally, intellectually, economically (The capitalist economy and the directed economy, the speculators and the fabricators of single are equally repugnant to him.)\\". The Spanish individualist anarchist Miguel Gimenez Igualada thought that \\"capitalism is an effect of government; the disappearance of government means capitalism falls from its pedestal vertiginously...That which we call capitalism is not something else but a product of the State, within which the only thing that is being pushed forward is profit, good or badly acquired. And so to fight against capitalism is a pointless task, since be it State capitalism or Enterprise capitalism, as long as Government exists, exploiting capital will exist. The fight, but of consciousness, is against the State\\".\\"el capitalismo es s√≥lo el efecto del gobierno; desaparecido el gobierno, el capitalismo cae de su pedestal vertiginosamente.... Lo que llamamos capitalismo no es otra cosa que el producto del Estado, dentro del cual lo √∫nico que se cultiva es la ganancia, bien o mal habida. Luchar, pues, contra el capitalismo es tarea in√∫til, porque sea Capitalismo de Estado o Capitalismo de Empresa, mientras el Gobierno exista, existir√° el capital que explota. La lucha, pero de conciencias, es contra el Estado.\\"Anarquismo by Miguel Gimenez Igualada His view on class division and technocracy are as follows: \\"Since when no one works for another, the profiteer from wealth disappears, just as government will disappear when no one pays attention to those who learned four things at universities and from that fact they pretend to govern men. Big industrial enterprises will be transformed by men in big associations in which everyone will work and enjoy the product of their work. And from those easy as well as beautiful problems anarchism deals with and he who puts them in practice and lives them are anarchists. [...] The priority which without rest an anarchist must make is that in which no one has to exploit anyone, no man to no man, since that non-exploitation will lead to the limitation of property to individual needs\\".\\"¬øLa propiedad? ¬°Bah! No es problema. Porque cuando nadie trabaje para nadie, el acaparador de la riqueza desaparece, como ha de desaparecer el gobierno cuando nadie haga caso a los que aprendieron cuatro cosas en las universidades y por ese s√≥lo hecho pretenden gobernar a los hombres. Porque si en la tierra de los ciegos el tuerto es rey, en donde todos ven y juzgan y disciernen, el rey estorba. Y de lo que se trata es de que no haya reyes porque todos sean hombres. Las grandes empresas industriales las transformar√°n los hombres en grandes asociaciones donde todos trabajen y disfruten del producto de su trabajo. Y de esos tan sencillos como hermosos problemas trata el anarquismo y al que lo cumple y vive es al que se le llama anarquista...El hincapi√© que sin cansancio debe hacer el anarquista es el de que nadie debe explotar a nadie, ning√∫n hombre a ning√∫n hombre, porque esa no- explotaci√≥n llevar√≠a consigo la limitaci√≥n de la propiedad a las necesidades individuales.\\"Anarquismo by Miguel Gimenez Igualada Oscar Wilde, famous anarchist Irish writer who published the libertarian socialist work titled The Soul of Man under Socialism The anarchist\\"The most ambitious contribution to literary anarchism during the 1890s was undoubtedly Oscar Wilde The Soul of Man under Socialism. Wilde, as we have seen, declared himself an anarchist on at least one occasion during the 1890s, and he greatly admired Kropotkin, whom he had met. Later, in De Profundis, he described Kropotkin's life as one \\"of the most perfect lives I have come across in my own experience\\" and talked of him as \\"a man with a soul of that beautiful white Christ that seems coming out of Russia.\\" But in The Soul of Man Under Socialism, which appeared in 1890, it is Godwin rather than Kropotkin whose influence seems dominant.\\" George Woodcock. Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements. 1962.

There lies its immense value. For what it seeks is to disturb monotony of type, slavery of custom, tyranny of habit, and the reduction of man to the level of a machine\\". For anarchist historian George Woodcock, \\"Wilde's aim in The Soul of Man under Socialism is to seek the society most favorable to the artist [...] for Wilde art is the supreme end, containing within itself enlightenment and regeneration, to which all else in society must be subordinated. [...] Wilde represents the anarchist as aesthete\\".George Woodcock. Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements. 1962. (p. 447) In a socialist society, people will have the possibility to realise their talents as \\"each member of the society will share in the general prosperity and happiness of the society\\". Wilde added that \\"upon the other hand, Socialism itself will be of value simply because it will lead to individualism\\" since individuals will no longer need to fear poverty or starvation. This individualism would, in turn, protect against governments \\"armed with economic power as they are now with political power\\" over their citizens. However, Wilde advocated non-capitalist individualism, saying that \\"of course, it might be said that the Individualism generated under conditions of private property is not always, or even as a rule, of a fine or wonderful type\\" a critique which is \\"quite true\\". In Wilde's imagination, in this way socialism would free men from manual labour and allow them to devote their time to creative pursuits, thus developing their soul. He ended by declaring: \\"The new individualism is the new hellenism\\".  Democratic socialism  Democratic socialism is a broad political movement that seeks to propagate the ideals of socialism within the context of a democratic system. Democratic socialism is closely related to social democracy and in some accounts are identical while other accounts stress differences. Many democratic socialists support social democracy as a road to reform of the current system while others support more revolutionary change in society to establish socialist goals. Generally, social democracy is considered to be more centrist and broadly supportive of current capitalist systems (for example, the mixed economy) and the welfare state while many democratic socialists support a more fully socialist system, either through evolutionary or revolutionary means. Democratic socialists and social democrats both advocate the concept of the welfare state, but whereas many social democrats view the welfare state as the end itself, irrespective of any hierarchies of power that may persist following welfare reforms, many democratic socialists view it as the means to an egalitarian end. Highlighting this difference, contemporary advocates of the democratic socialist model have criticized the social democratic approach of a welfare state if it is not adequately providing socioeconomic welfare programs at the universal level. Democratic socialists are also committed to the ideas of the redistribution of wealth and power, as well as social ownership of major industries, concepts widely abandoned by social democrats. There are no countries in the world that would qualify as a democratic socialist state, although some states describe themselves as such, for example Venezuela, whose former leader Hugo Ch√°vez claimed that democratic socialism was integral to the Bolivarian form of socialism that he was trying to promote. = Social democracy = Social democracy can be divided into classical and modern strands. Classical social democracy attempts to achieve socialism through gradual, parliamentary means and by reforming capitalism from within rather than through revolutionary means. The term social democracy can refer to the particular kind of society that social democrats advocate. The Socialist International (SI), the worldwide organization of social democratic and democratic socialist parties, defines social democracy as an ideal form of representative democracy that may solve the problems found in a liberal democracy. The SI emphasizes principles such as freedom‚Äînot only individual liberties, but also freedom from discrimination and freedom from dependence on either the owners of the means of production or the holders of abusive political power; equality and social justice‚Äînot only before the law, but also economic and socio-cultural equality as well equal opportunities for all, including those with physical, mental, or social disabilities; and solidarity‚Äîunity and a sense of compassion for the victims of injustice and inequality.\\"Declaration of Principles\\". Socialist International. Modern social democracy seeks to contain capitalism through transitioning unstable private sector enterprises into public ownership, correcting economic and social inequality through social safety nets and services (sometimes referred to as welfare state policies) and more aggressive regulation of markets and private enterprise than other forms of mixed economy. Over the past forty years, social democracy has increasingly been replaced with alternate economic systems such as the social market economy or Third Way mixed economies that are informed by Keynesian economics.  Eco-socialism  Merging aspects of Marxism, socialism, environmentalism, anarchism and ecology, Eco-socialists generally believe that the capitalist system is the cause of social exclusion, inequality and environmental degradation. Eco-socialists criticise many within the Green movement for not going far enough in their critique of the current world system and for not being overtly anti-capitalist. At the same time, Eco- socialists would blame the traditional Left for overlooking or not properly addressing ecological problems.Wall, D., Babylon and Beyond: The Economics of Anti-Capitalist, Anti-Globalist and Radical Green Movements, 2005 Eco- socialists are anti-globalisation. Joel Kovel sees globalisation as a force driven by capitalism ‚Äì in turn, the rapid economic growth encouraged by globalisation causes acute ecological crises.Kovel, J., The Enemy of Nature, 2002 Eco-socialism goes beyond a criticism of the actions of large corporations and targets the inherent properties of capitalism. Such an analysis follows Marx's theories about the contradiction between use values and exchange values. As Joel Kovel explains, within a market economy, goods are not produced to meet needs but are produced to be exchanged for money that we then use to acquire other goods. As we have to keep selling to keep buying, we must persuade others to buy our goods just to ensure our survival, which leads to the production of goods with no previous use that can be sold to sustain our ability to buy other goods. Eco-socialists like Kovel stress that this contradiction has reached a destructive extent, where certain essential activities such as caring for relatives full-time and basic subsistence are unrewarded while unnecessary economic activities earn certain individuals huge fortunes. Agrarian socialism is another variant of eco-socialism. = Green anarchism = Green anarchism puts a particular emphasis on environmental issues. An important early influence was the thought of the American individualist anarchist Henry David Thoreau and his book Walden.Diez, Xavier. \\"La insumisi√≥n voluntaria. El anarquismo individualista espa√±ol durante la dictadura y la segund arep√∫blica (1923-1938)\\". . \\"Su obra m√°s representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una caba√±a en el bosque, y vivir en √≠ntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosof√≠a trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armon√≠a de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por John Zerzan. Para George Woodcock, esta actitud puede estar tambi√©n motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX.\\" In the late 19th century, there emerged a naturist current within individualist anarchist circles in Cuba, France, Portugal and Spain.Rosello, Jose Maria. \\"El naturismo libertario en la pen√≠nsula Ib√©rica (1890-1939)\\". Diez, Xavier. \\"La insumisi√≥n voluntaria. El anarquismo individualista espa√±ol durante la dictadura y la segund arep√∫blica (1923-1938)\\". Some contemporary green anarchists can be described as anti- civilization or primitivist anarchists, although not all green anarchists are primitivists. Similarly, there is a strong critique of modern technology among green anarchists, although not all reject it entirely. Important contemporary currents include anarcho-naturism as the fusion of anarchism and naturist philosophies; anarcho-primitivism which offers a critique of technology and argues that anarchism is best suited to uncivilised ways of life; eco- anarchism which combines older trends of primitivism as well as bioregional democracy, eco-feminism, intentional community, pacifism and secession that distinguish it from the more general green anarchism; green syndicalism, a green anarchist political stance made up of anarcho-syndicalist views; social ecology which argues that the hierarchical domination of nature by human stems from the hierarchical domination of human by human;The Anarchist FAQ Collective (2008). \\"A.3.3 What kinds of green anarchism are there?\\". \\"An Anarchist FAQ\\".

Marx went one way; Warren and Proudhon the other. Thus were born State Socialism and Anarchism...Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity. Good representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of Karl Marx.\\" Benjamin Tucker.

The first examples of abertzale parties are the Basque Nationalist Republican Party (EAAE-PRNV), active from 1909 to 1913,Cecilia Arrozarena, El roble y la ceiba. Historia de los vascos en Cuba, , Txalaparta, 2003 and the Basque Nationalist Action (EAE-ANV), active from 1930 to 2008.Santiago de Pablo, Un partido con historia, El Correo, 14 April 2007. This was the political environment in which ETA was formed. More recently, in 1986, the abertzale left of the EAJ-PNV wing to form the social-democratic Basque Solidarity (EA) party. Ezker abertzalea (Spanish: izquierda abertzale) is notably used when referring to the leftist-nationalist environment of Batasuna, an outlawed political party.Jes√∫s Mar√≠a Casquete Badallo, Abertzale s√≠ pero, ¬øqui√©n dijo que de izquierda? , El Viejo Topo, , n. 268, 2010, pp. 14-19.

A group of former members of Batasuna were identified by the media as independents of izquierda abertzale. = Arab socialism = The Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party rules Syria and has ruled Iraq under Saddam Hussein based on a tradition of secular, non-Marxist socialism. Ba'thist beliefs combine Arab socialism, nationalism, and pan- Arabism. The mostly secular ideology often contrasts with that of other Arab governments in the Middle East, which sometimes lean towards Islamism and theocracy. The Ba'athists have persecuted socialists in their own countries. In Iraq, the American Central Intelligence Agency assisted Iraq with a list of communists to eliminate, effectively wiping them out. Socialist Lynn Walsh argues that the Iraqi Ba'athists promoted capitalists from within the party and outside the country.Walsh, Lynn. Imperialism and the gulf war, Chapter 5, 1990-91. The Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party, also known as the Ba'ath Party (), is a secularist pan-Arabist political party that synthesizes Arab nationalism and Arab socialism. It opposes Western imperialism and calls for the ethnic \\"awakening\\" or \\"resurrection\\" of the Arab people into a single united state. Ba'ath, also spelled as Ba'th or Baath, means resurrection or renaissance. The party's motto, \\"Unity, Liberty, Socialism\\" (wahda, hurriya, ishtirakiya), was inspired by the French Jacobin political doctrine linking national unity and social equity. In the slogan, \\"unity\\" refers to Arab unity, \\"liberty\\" emphasizes being free from foreign control and interference, and \\"socialism\\" refers to Arab socialism, not European-style Marxism or communism. The party was founded in Damascus, Syria in 1940 by the Syrian intellectuals Michel Aflaq and Salah al-Bitar, and since its inception, it has established branches in different Arab countries, although the only countries it has ever held power in are Syria and Iraq. Aflaq and al-Bitar both studied at the Sorbonne in the early 1930s, at a time when centre-left Positivism was still the dominant ideology amongst France's academic elite. The Ba'ath party included a significant number of Christian Arabs among its founding members. For them, a resolutely nationalist and secular political framework was a suitable way to avoid a faith-based Islamic orientation and to give non-Muslims full acknowledgement as citizens. In 1955, a coup d'√©tat by the military against the historical leadership of Aflaq and al-Bitar led the Syrian and Iraqi parties to split into rival organizations‚Äîthe Qotri (Regionalist) Syria-based party and the Qawmi (Nationalist) Iraq-based party. Both Ba'ath parties kept their names and maintained parallel structures, but became so antagonistic that the Syrian Ba'ath government became the only Arab government to support non-Arab Iran against Iraq during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. In Syria, the Ba'ath Party has had a monopoly on political power since the party's 1963 coup. Ba'athists seized power in Iraq in 1963, but were deposed months later. They returned to power in a 1968 coup and remained the sole party of government until the 2003 Iraq invasion. Since then, the party has been banned in Iraq. = Chinese and Vietnamese nationalist socialism = The Kuomintang Party (Chinese National People's Party or Chinese Nationalist Party) was founded in the Republic of China in 1912 by Sun Yatsen, a proponent of Chinese nationalism, who founded Revive China Society in Honolulu, Hawaii in 1894.See (Chinese) \\"Major Events in KMT\\" History Official Site of the KMT last accessed Aug. 30, 2009 Kuomintang ideology features Three Principles of the People, which are nationalism, democracy and socialism. The party has adopted a One- China policy, arguing that there is only one state called China, and that the Republic of China (not the People's Republic of China) is its legitimate government. The party has had conflicts with the Chinese Communist Party. Since 2008, in order to ease tensions with the People's Republic of China, the party has endorsed the \\"Three Noes\\" policy as defined by Ma Ying-jeou, namely no unification, no independence and no use of force. The Kuomintang attempted to levy taxes upon merchants in Canton and the merchants resisted by raising an army, the Merchant's Volunteer Corps. The merchants were conservative and reactionary and their leader Chen Lianbao was a prominent comprador trader. Chiang Kai-shek led his army of Whampoa Military Academy graduates to defeat the merchant's army. He was assisted by Soviet advisors, who supplied him with weapons, while the merchants were supplied with weapons from the Western countries. The British led an international flotilla to support the merchants. Chiang seized the Western-supplied weapons from the merchants, and battled against them. A Kuomintang general executed several merchants, and the Kuomintang formed a Soviet-inspired Revolutionary Committee. The Kuomintang's economic and military campaign against merchants continued for many years. Chiang also enforced an anti-Japanese boycott, sending agents to sack the shops of those who sold Japanese-made items, fining them. The Vi·ªát Nam Qu·ªëc D√¢n ƒê·∫£ng (VNQDƒê) was based on the Chinese Kuomintang, and incorporated socialism and nationalism as part of its ideology. The party sought independence from French colonial rule in Vietnam during the early 20th century. Its origins lie in the mid-1920s, when a group of young Hanoi-based intellectuals began publishing revolutionary material. From 1928, the VNQDƒê attracted attention through its assassinations of French officials and Vietnamese collaborators. During the 1930s, the party was eclipsed by Ho Chi Minh's Indochinese Communist Party (ICP). Vietnam was occupied by Japan during World War II and in the chaos that followed the Japanese surrender in 1945 the VNQDƒê and the ICP briefly joined forces in the fight for Vietnamese independence. After a falling out, Ho purged the VNQDƒê, leaving his communist- dominated Viet Minh unchallenged as the foremost anti-colonial militant organisation. As a part of the post-war settlement that ended the First Indochina War, Vietnam was partitioned into two zones. The remnants of the VNQDƒê fled to the anti-communist south, where they remained until the Fall of Saigon in 1975 and the reunification of Vietnam under communist rule. = Irish republican socialism = Socialism has traditionally been part of the Irish republican movement since the early 20th century, when James Connolly, an Irish Marxist theorist, took part in the Easter Rising of 1916. Today, most Irish nationalist and Republican organizations located in Northern Ireland advocate some form of socialism, both Marxist and non-Marxist. The Social Democratic and Labour Party which until recently was the largest nationalist party in Northern Ireland promotes social democracy while militant Republican parties such as Sinn F√©in, Republican Sinn F√©in, and the 32 County Sovereignty Movement all promote their own varieties of democratic socialism intended to re-distribute wealth on an all-island basis once a united Ireland has been achieved. The Irish Republican Socialist Movement, encompassing the Irish Republican Socialist Party and Irish National Liberation Army as well as the defunct Official Irish Republican Army and Irish National Liberation Front are known for promoting an ideology which combines Marxist‚ÄìLeninism with traditional revolutionary militant Republicanism and is said to be the most direct fulfillment of Connolly's legacy.  Religious socialism  Religious socialism is any form of socialism based on religious values. Members of several major religions have found that their beliefs about human society fit with socialist principles and ideas. As a result, religious socialist movements have developed within these religions. = Buddhist socialism = Buddhist socialism is a political ideology which advocates socialism based on the principles of Buddhism. Both Buddhism and socialism seek to provide an end to suffering by analyzing its conditions and removing its main causes through praxis. Both also seek to provide a transformation of personal consciousness (respectively, spiritual and political) to bring an end to human alienation and selfishness.Shields, James Mark; Liberation as Revolutionary Praxis: Rethinking Buddhist Materialism; Journal of Buddhist Ethics. Volume 20, 2013. People who have been described as Buddhist socialists include Buddhadasa Bhikkhu, B. R. Ambedkar S. W. R. D.

Institute of Buddhist Studies and BDK America, Inc. and Norodom Sihanouk.Cambodia Under the Khmer Rouge Bhikkhu Buddhadasa coined the phrase \\"Dhammic socialism\\". He believed that socialism is a natural state,Dhammic Socialism Political Thought of Buddhadasa Bhikku, Chulalangkorn Journal of Buddhist Studies 2 (1), page 118 (2003) PDF meaning all things exist together in one system. Han Yong-un felt that equality was one of the main principles of Buddhism. In an interview published in 1931, Yong-un spoke of his desire to explore Buddhist socialism: \\"I am recently planning to write about Buddhist socialism. Just like there is Christian socialism as a system of ideas in Christianity, there must be also Buddhist socialism in Buddhism\\". Tenzin Gyatso, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama of Tibet has said that \\"[o]f all the modern economic theories, the economic system of Marxism is founded on moral principles, while capitalism is concerned only with gain and profitability. [...] The failure of the regime in the former Soviet Union was, for me, not the failure of Marxism but the failure of totalitarianism. For this reason I still think of myself as half-Marxist, half-Buddhist\\". = Christian socialism = There are individuals and groups, past and present, that are clearly both Christian and socialist, such as Frederick Denison Maurice, author of The Kingdom of Christ (1838), and the Christian Socialist Movement (UK) (CSM), affiliated with the British Labour Party. Distributism, is a third-way economic philosophy formulated by such Catholic thinkers as G. K. Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc to apply the principles of social justice articulated by the Roman Catholic Church, especially in Pope Leo XIII's encyclical Rerum novarum. Various Catholic clerical parties have at times referred to themselves as Christian Social. Two examples are the Christian Social Party of Karl Lueger in Austria before and after World War I, and the contemporary Christian Social Union in Bavaria. Yet these parties have never espoused socialist policies and have always stood at the conservative side of Christian Democracy. Hugo Ch√°vez of Venezuela was an advocate of a form of Christian socialism as he claims that Jesus Christ was a socialist. Leo Tolstoy Christian anarchism is a movement in political theology that combines anarchism and Christianity. The foundation of Christian anarchism is a rejection of violence, with Leo Tolstoy's The Kingdom of God Is Within You regarded as a key text. Tolstoy sought to separate Russian Orthodox Christianity‚Äîwhich was merged with the state‚Äîfrom what he believed was the true message of Jesus as contained in the Gospels, specifically in the Sermon on the Mount. Tolstoy takes the viewpoint that all governments who wage war, and churches who in turn support those governments, are an affront to the Christian principles of nonviolence and nonresistance. Although Tolstoy never actually used the term Christian anarchism in The Kingdom of God Is Within You, reviews of this book following its publication in 1894 appear to have coined the term. Christian anarchist groups have included the Doukhobors, Catholic Worker Movement and the Brotherhood Church. Christian communism is a form of religious communism based on Christianity. It is a theological and political theory based upon the view that the teachings of Jesus Christ compel Christians to support communism as the ideal social system. Although there is no universal agreement on the exact date when Christian communism was founded, many Christian communists assert that evidence from the Bible (in the Acts of the Apostles)Acts 2:44, 4:32‚Äì37; 5:1‚Äì12. Other verses are: Matthew 5:1‚Äì12, 6:24, Luke 3:11, 16:11, 2 Corinthians 8:13‚Äì15 and James 5:3. suggests that the first Christians, including the apostles, established their own small communist society in the years following Jesus' death and resurrection. As such, many advocates of Christian communism argue that it was taught by Jesus and practiced by the apostles themselves.This is the standpoint of the orthodox Marxist Some independent historians confirm it.Gustav Bang Crises in European History p. 24. = Islamic socialism = Islamic socialism incorporates Islamic principles to socialism. As a term, it was coined by various Muslim leaders to describe a more spiritual form of socialism. Scholars have highlighted the similarities between the Islamic economic system and socialist theory as both socialism and Islam are against unearned income. Muslim socialists believe that the teachings of the Quran and Muhammad‚Äîespecially the zakat‚Äîare compatible with principles of socialism. They draw inspiration from the early Medinan welfare state established by Muhammad. Muslim socialists found their roots in anti-imperialism. Muslim socialist leaders believe in the derivation of legitimacy from the public. Islamic socialism is the political ideology of Libya's Muammar al-Gaddafi, former Iraqi president Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad and of the Pakistani leader of Pakistan Peoples Party, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. The Green Book (written by Muammar al-Gaddafi) consists of three parts, namely \\"The Solution of the Problem of Democracy: 'The Authority of the People'\\", \\"The Solution of the Economic Problem: 'Socialism'\\", and \\"The Social Basis of the Third Universal Theory\\". The book is controversial because it completely rejects modern conceptions of liberal democracy and encourages the institution of a form of direct democracy based on popular committees. Critics charge that Qaddafi uses these committees as tools of autocratic political repression in practice. = Jewish socialism = The Jewish left consists of Jews who identify with, or support, left-wing or liberal causes, consciously as Jews, either as individuals or through organizations. There is no one organization or movement which constitutes the Jewish left, however. Jews have been major forces in the history of the labor movement, the settlement house movement, the women's rights movement, anti-racist and anti-colonialist work, and anti- fascist and anti-capitalist organizations of many forms in Europe, the United States, Algeria, Iraq, Ethiopia, and modern-day Israel.\\"The New Left.\\" Jewish Virtual Library (2008); retrieved 6 June 2015.Naeim Giladi, \\"The Jews of Iraq\\": \\"In many countries, including the United States and Iraq, Jews represented a large part of the Communist party. In Iraq, hundreds of Jews of the working intelligentsia occupied key positions in the hierarchy of the Communist and Socialist parties.\\"Hannah Borenstein, \\"Savior Story\\": \\"The violence of the late 1970s and early 1980s Ethiopia spurred many forms of active and comprehensive resistance. Ethiopian Jews participated widely; many, for instance, were members of the Marxist-Leninist EPRP.\\" Jews have a rich history of involvement in anarchism, socialism, Marxism, and Western liberalism. Although the expression \\"on the left\\" covers a range of politics, many well-known figures \\"on the left\\" have been of Jews who were born into Jewish families and have various degrees of connection to Jewish communities, Jewish culture, Jewish tradition, or the Jewish religion in its many variants. Labor Zionism or socialist Zionism (, translit. Tziyonut sotzyalistit; translit. Tnu'at ha'avoda, i.e. The labor movement) is the left-wing of the Zionist movement. For many years, it was the most significant tendency among Zionists and Zionist organizations. It saw itself as the Zionist sector of the historic Jewish labor movements of Eastern and Central Europe, eventually developing local units in most countries with sizable Jewish populations. Unlike the \\"political Zionist\\" tendency founded by Theodor Herzl and advocated by Chaim Weizmann, Labor Zionists did not believe that a Jewish state would be created simply by appealing to the international community or to a powerful nation such as Britain, Germany or the Ottoman Empire. Rather, Labor Zionists believed that a Jewish state could only be created through the efforts of the Jewish working class settling in the Land of Israel and constructing a state through the creation of a progressive Jewish society with rural kibbutzim and moshavim and an urban Jewish proletariat. Labor Zionism grew in size and influence and eclipsed \\"political Zionism\\" by the 1930s both internationally and within the British Mandate of Palestine where Labor Zionists predominated among many of the institutions of the pre-independence Jewish community Yishuv, particularly the trade union federation known as the Histadrut. The Haganah, the largest Zionist paramilitary defense force, was a Labor Zionist institution and was used on occasion (such as during the Hunting Season) against right-wing political opponents or to assist the British Administration in capturing rival Jewish militants. Labor Zionists played a leading role in the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War and Labor Zionists were predominant among the leadership of the Israeli military for decades after the formation of the state of Israel in 1948. Major theoreticians of the Labor Zionist movement included Moses Hess, Nachman Syrkin, Ber Borochov, and Aaron David Gordon and leading figures in the movement included David Ben-Gurion, Golda Meir, and Berl Katznelson.  Syndicalism  FORA in 1915 Syndicalism is a radical current in the labor movement that was most active in the early 20th century. Its main idea is the establishment of local worker-based organizations and the advancement of the demands and rights of workers through strikes. According to the Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm, it was predominant in the revolutionary left in the decade which preceded the outbreak of World War I because Marxism was mostly reformist at that time.Hobsbawm 1973, pg. 72. Major syndicalist organizations included the General Confederation of Labor in France, the National Confederation of Labor in Spain, the Italian Syndicalist Union, the Free Workers' Union of Germany, and the Argentine Regional Workers' Federation. Although they did not regard themselves as syndicalists, the Industrial Workers of the World, the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union and the Canadian One Big Union are considered by most historians to belong to this current. A number of syndicalist organizations were and still are to this day linked in the International Workers' Association, but some of its member organizations left for the International Confederation of Labor, formed in 2018.

It is the first sports car to be designed and produced indigenously in the Middle East. The production of the car was limited to a total of seven units. The first pre- production Lykan HyperSport was unveiled to the public at the Qatar Motor Show in February 2013. Pricing and sales At 3.4 million, the Lykan HyperSport was the third most expensive production car at time of its production. The HyperSport is the first car to have headlights with embedded jewels; they contain titanium LED blades with 440 diamonds (15cts); although buyers had a selection of rubies, diamonds, yellow diamonds, and sapphires to be integrated into the vehicle's headlights at purchase based on the colour choice. The car also uses a holographic display system on the centre console with interactive motion features, as well as gold stitching on the seats. In June 2015, the Abu Dhabi Police purchased a Lykan HyperSport. The Abu Dhabi Police car is included in the total of seven, meaning only six were available for purchase by customers. W Motors has since confirmed all cars were sold.  Specifications = Powertrain  The Lykan HyperSport is powered by a 3.7 litre (3,746 cc) twin-turbocharged flat-six engine developed by Ruf Automobile, producing a (claimed) maximum power output of at 7,100 rpm and of torque at 4,000 rpm. The engine has a mid-rear mounted position and transfers power to the rear wheels. There have been no independent tests of the power output of the vehicle.  Transmission  The Lykan HyperSport was available with either a 6-speed sequential manual or a 7-speed dual-clutch PDK transmission. The transmission is paired with a limited-slip differential and is mounted transversely at the rear of the car.  Suspension  The Lykan HyperSport uses a MacPherson strut suspension on the front axle, and multi- link suspension with horizontal coil over shock absorbers at the rear axle. Anti-roll bars are also installed at both axles.  Wheels  The Lykan HyperSport is equipped with forged aluminum wheels with diameters of 19 inches at the front and 20 inches at the rear. The tyres are Pirelli P Zeros with codes of 255/35 ZR 19 for the front and 335/30 ZR 20 for the rear. The brakes have ventilated ceramic composite discs, with a diameter of 380 mm each and using six-piston aluminium callipers at the front and rear. Performance The manufacturer claims a top speed of , depending on the gear ratio setup. The car has claimed acceleration times of 2.8 seconds for 0-100 km/h (0-62 mph) and 9.4 seconds for 0-200 km/h (0-125 mph), though no independent tests have been conducted. There was a demonstration of the car by W Motors in 2013 in Dubai, in which they claim to have recorded the car's performance. Film version A Lykan HyperSport was featured in the film Furious 7. The film's car coordinator Dennis McCarthy explained in an interview that the Lykan HyperSports used in the film were not production models but purpose-built by W Motors for the film using the same molds, but cheaper material (fiberglass instead of carbon fiber) and a simpler chassis. Of the ten produced for the film, one was returned to W Motors and is displayed in their showroom. The other nine were destroyed. Several Lykan HyperSport replicas were also used in the 2018 British Fast & Furious Live show. At least one has since been sold, and was imported to the United States by Sam Hard (Hard Up Garage) and Ed Bolian (VINwiki). It will be built into a driveable car using a Porsche Boxster chassis by Casey Putsch and Genius Garage. The build is being documented on YouTube.

Early life  Ali was born and raised in Lahore, Punjab in British India (later part of Pakistan). He is the son of journalist Mazhar Ali Khan and activist mother Tahira Mazhar Ali Khan. Ali's mother was the daughter of Sir Sikandar Hyat Khan, who led the Unionist Muslim League and was later Prime Minister of the Punjab from 1937 to 1942. Ali's father, Mazhar, had been \\"mobilising peasants in his family‚Äôs fiefdom\\" when he was invited to join the Pakistan Times by Mian Iftikharuddin, later becoming sympathetic to the Communist cause, although he never joined the party. Ali's father and mother, who were cousins, eloped. His mother later said: \\"Mazhar left for the Middle East on military service. I was very pregnant by then. We didn't see each other for two years. Our son Tariq was born while Mazhar was away. By the time he returned, I had joined the Communist Party. I had given away my entire trousseau, including the family jewels, to the Party.\\" Emerging activism Ali first became politically active in his teens, taking part in opposition to the military dictatorship of Pakistan. An uncle who worked in the Pakistani military intelligence warned his parents that Ali could not be protected. His parents therefore decided to get him out of Pakistan and sent him to England to study at Exeter College, Oxford, where he studied Philosophy, Politics, and Economics. He was elected President of the Oxford Union in 1965. In 1967 Ali was one of 64 prominent figures, including the Beatles, who signed a petition calling for the legalisation of marijuana. Ali's tenure at the Union included a meeting with Malcolm X in December 1964 during which Malcolm X expressed deep consternation about his own risk of assassination. Career Imperial College, London, 2003 His public profile began to grow during the Vietnam War, when he engaged in debates against the war with such figures as Henry Kissinger and Michael Stewart. He testified at the Russell Tribunal over US involvement in Vietnam. As time passed, Ali became increasingly critical of American and Israeli foreign policies. He was also a vigorous opponent of American relations with Pakistan that tended to back military dictatorships over democracy. He was one of the marchers on the American embassy in London in 1968 in a demonstration against the Vietnam war. Active in the New Left of the 1960s, he has long been associated with the New Left Review. Ali inserted himself into politics through his involvement with The Black Dwarf newspaper, he joined the International Marxist Group (IMG) in 1968. He was recruited to the leadership of the IMG and became a member of the International Executive Committee of the (reunified) Fourth International. He also befriended influential figures such as Malcolm X, Stokely Carmichael, John Lennon and Yoko Ono. In 1967, Ali was in Camiri, Bolivia, not far from where Che Guevara was captured, to observe the trial of R√©gis Debray. He was accused of being a Cuban revolutionary by authorities. Ali then said: \\"If you torture me the whole night and I can speak Spanish in the morning I'll be grateful to you for the rest of my life.\\" During this period he was an IMG candidate in Sheffield Attercliffe at the February 1974 general election and was co-author of Trotsky for Beginners, a cartoon book. In 1981, Ali quit the IMG and joined the Labour Party to support Tony Benn in his bid to become deputy leader of the Labour Party. C√≥rdoba, 2010 In 1990, he published the satire Redemption, on the inability of the Trotskyists to handle the downfall of the Eastern bloc. The book contains parodies of many well-known figures in the Trotskyist movement. In 1999 Ali strongly criticised US and UK interventions in the Balkans in the piece Springtime for NATO, and book \\"Masters of the Universe? NATO‚Äôs Balkan Crusade\\" in which he negated extent and nature of crimes committed by Serbian forces in Bosnia and Kosovo. He also defended denialist claims espoused by figures such as Diana Johnstone and Edward S. Herman. His book, Clash of Fundamentalisms, aimed to put the events of the September 11 attacks in historical perspective. He followed that with Bush in Babylon, which criticised the 2003 invasion of Iraq by American president George W. Bush. The book uses poetry and critical essays in portraying the war in Iraq as a failure. Ali believes that the new Iraqi government will fail. Ali has remained a critic of modern neoliberal economics and was present at the 2005 World Social Forum in Porto Alegre, Brazil, where he was one of 19 to sign the Porto Alegre Manifesto. He supports the model of Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela. He has been described as \\"the alleged inspiration\\" for the Rolling Stones' song \\"Street Fighting Man\\", recorded in 1968.Hazou, Christopher Hazou, \\"Journalism and jingoism: Ownership and gullibility are two recurring problems for the Western press, says author and activist Tariq Ali\\", Montreal Mirror.

In 2020, Ali was a member of the Belmarsh Tribunal organized by Progressive International, investigating and evaluating the war crimes committed by the United States government in the 21st century. Screenplay Tariq Ali's The Leopard and The Fox, first written as a BBC screenplay in 1985, is about the last days of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. Never previously produced because of a censorship controversy, it was finally premiered in New York in October 2007, the day before former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto returned to her home country after eight years in exile. In 2009, Ali, alongside Mark Weisbrot wrote the screenplay to the Oliver Stone documentary South of the Border. This gave a favourable account of Hugo Ch√°vez and other left-wing Latin American leaders. Interviewed in the documentary, Ali explained the role that Bolivian water privatisation and the 2000 Cochabamba protests played in eventually bringing Evo Morales to power. Personal life Ali currently lives in Camden, north London, with his partner Susan Watkins, editor of the New Left Review. He has three children: Natasha from a previous relationship, and Chengiz and Aisha with Watkins. He grew up in a secular family that was more culturally Muslim than religious, and describes himself as an atheist.
