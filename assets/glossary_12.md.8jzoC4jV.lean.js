Dark areas appear light or light areas appear dark. Solarization and pseudo- solarization are quite distinct effects. Over time, the \\"pseudo\\" has been dropped in many photographic darkroom circles and discussions, but the effect that is meant is the Sabattier effect and not the solarization by extreme overexposure (see below). Background Initially, the term \\"solarization\\" was used to describe the effect observed in cases of extreme overexposure of the photographic film or plate in the camera. The effect generated in the dark room was then called pseudo-solarization. Spencer defines the Sabattier effect as: \\"Partial image reversal produced by brief exposure to white light of a partly developed silver halide image\\". Many other ways of chemical and actinic radiation \\"exposure\\" can be utilised for the partial image reversal. The use of chemicals for image reversal is also known as 'chemical fogging'. The SPSE Handbook of Photographic Science and Engineering describes the effect as follows: If a film that has been exposed, developed, and washed but not fixed is given a second uniform exposure and developed again, an image with strong border effects is obtained, which combines the original image with a reversed (positive) image. Another usable definition is by Wijnekus & Wijnekus: If an exposed, incompletely developed, and washed, but not fixed film is given a second uniform exposure and developed again, a reversal of the original image may be obtained. The reversal may be partial or complete, depending on the relative magnitude of the first and second exposures. Normal print Pseudo- solarized print from the same negative History The Pseudo-solarization effect was described in print by H. de la Blanch√®re in 1859 in L‚ÄôArt du Photographe. It was described again in 1860 by L.M. Rutherford and C.A. Seely,American Journal of Photography and the Allied Arts and Science. New Series, New York II (1860), page 251 separately, in successive issues of The American Journal of Photography, and in the same year by Count Schouwaloff in the French publication Cosmos. French scientist Armand Sabatier published 26 October 1860 a process of obtaining direct positives (referencing Count Schouwaloff and Poitevin), but according to the description, this process did not seem to have any connection with the Sabattier effect as no mentioning was made of any exposure of the collodion plates after development had started. The name of the author was erroneously spelled with double \\"t\\" and thus the effect is hence known as the Sabattier effect in most literature. Sabatier described correctly the phenomenon in 1862.Bulletin Societ√© Francaise de Photographie 8 (1862), page 175, 289Le Moniteur de la Photographie 2 (1862), pages 27, 45, 50 However, Sabatier could not find an explanation for the phenomenon. The effect was usually caused by accidentally exposing an exposed plate or film to light during developing. The artist Man Ray perfected the technique which was accidentally discovered in the darkroom because of fellow artist Lee Miller accidentally exposing his film in the darkroom. It is evident from publications in the 19th century that this phenomenon was discovered many times by many photographers as it tends to occur whenever a light is switched on inadvertently in the darkroom while a film or print is being developed. Explanation Whereas many photographic effects have been researched and explained in such a way that most researchers agree upon them, the Sabattier effect does not belong to that group. In general the following facts are accepted by the community of photographic researchers: * The assumption that the Sabattier effect can be attributed to the Solarization effect can be overruled. * The opinion that the Sabattier effect is a direct \\"print-through\\" effect of the silver produced by the first development on the below situated layers can not suffice to explain the effect. It has been shown that exposing a photographic layer thru the base also displays the Sabattier effect. Moreover, chemical fogging is also proof that copier effect is only marginal in producing the Sabattier effect. * Oxidation products produced during the first development at the developed grains cannot cause a desensibilisation of the unexposed grains. * It is difficult to envision that the silver produced during the first development has a desensibilitating influence on the first developed grains. However this point must be further researched. * Although with commercial photographic materials the speed of development of the latent image of the second exposure is greater than that of the first development, it cannot be the determining factor for the Sabattier effect. * Several researchers assume that the development of a latent interior image as result of the first exposure thus affecting negatively the surface \\"specks\\" (also known as latent image centers) caused by the second exposure can partially explain the Sabattier effect. One of these researchers, Dr. K.W. Junge, published an explanation for the Sabattier effect as follows: The photographic material suitable for pseudo-solarizing should have a very low tendency to produce surface specks. This is usually achieved by prohibiting the chemical maturity during manufacturing. During the first exposure therefore almost only internal grain specks are produced. The first development will destroy the tendency to produce internal grain specks so that after the second exposure also grain surface specks are produced. These are only produced on grains which have still no internal grain specks. The reason for this is that during the second exposure electrons emerge which are much faster caught by the stable and big internal grain specks than they can serve to build new and smaller surface grain specks. The second development in a surface developer will now attack those grains which remained unchanged by the first exposure so that an image reversal will occur. The fact that instead of a second exposure electron donating systems (e.g. chemical fogging) can be added to the second developer supports this theory. In the darkroom Pseudo-solarization of paper positive in darkroom Pseudo-solarization of paper positive in darkroom Careful choice of the amount of light used and the precise moment in development to provide the additional exposure gives rise to different outcomes. However, pseudo-solarization is very difficult to manage to yield consistent results. As a guide, an exposure of one second to a 25 watt incandescent lamp at two metres distance at around the end of the first minute of a 2-minute development can produce acceptable results. If the exposure is made with the developing print still in the tray of developer, it is important to stop agitation at least 10 seconds prior to exposure to allow any bubbles on the surface to disperse and to ensure that the print is lying flat. Pseudo-solarizing colour prints is more difficult because of the more careful control of temperature and timing that is required and because most amateur processing is undertaken in a processing drum rather than a dish. As lightsource also an enlarger without negative in the carrier can be used. Lafenty advises to use high contrast papers for a more dramatic effect. He also advises to dilute the developer to twice the manufacturers recommendations. In addition he advises to place the paper after initial development in a tray of water during 10 seconds before re-exposing the paper. However this has been reported to affect the result in a negative way. Better is to perform the second exposure in the developing solution. In colour photography, different coloured lights can be used to affect pseudo- solarization, but the results become even less predictable. Using the Sabattier effect it should be obvious that it is very difficult to manage all parameters for yielding consistent and predictable results and therefore other means have been pursued such as Agfacontour and special pseudo-solarizing developersApplied Photography, Arnold et al., Focal Press, page 428 In scientific photography it was observed that when using photographic films with very high contrast (also known as lith films), the image produced by the Sabattier effect exhibited a multitude of lines of various width, representing a specific amount of exposure within a certain range. This led to the use of the Sabattier effect in the fields of Photogrammetry and Equidensitometry. Agfacontour Professional Film In 1970, Agfa marketed Agfacontour Professional Film, which simplified the process of obtaining consistent results for images that looked similar to pseudo-solarized images and therefore it was widely used in equidensitometry and art.Agfacontour Professional in der Photographik, Agfa-Gevaert AG Druckschrift Nr. 151 (in German)Agfacontour Professional in Wissenschaft und Technik, C. Sauer, Agfa- Gevaert AG Druckschrift nr. 152, 1. Auflage 1974 (in German) This special purpose film addressed the uncertainty of pseudo-solarisation results. As of 2002, Agfacontour Film was no longer being produced.  In digital media Early video synthesiser technologists concerned themselves with achieving arbitrary curves not limited by film chemistry. A goal was to extend the range of pseudo-solarization effects possible to a computer specified curve. They then applied the defined solarization curve to real time video images. A video lookup table was often used to implement this. Using this enhanced solarization technology, still photos could also be passed through a grey scale or colour lookup table with the advantage that the effect could be previewed and progressively improved, instead of a procedure based on darkroom exposure calculations applied on a one time basis to a volatile light sensitive film or print, as described above. This was an especial advantage for creating colour solarizations with 3 primary colours. Graphs describing pseudo-solarization curves typically place input range of tones on the x axis, with black at 0 and white to the right, and the output range of tones on the y axis with black at 0 and white up. A curve then defines the input to output mapping. Manipulating custom curves in photo-editing programs such as Photoshop provide tools to mimic the Sabattier effect in digital image processing.

After being convicted of sedition, he was first sentenced to death, but received transportation for life to Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania) in Australia. In 1852, Meagher escaped and made his way to the United States, where he settled in New York City. He studied law, worked as a journalist, and traveled to present lectures on the Irish cause. He married for a second time in New York. At the beginning of the American Civil War, Meagher joined the U.S. Army and rose to the rank of brigadier general.Meagher had at various times been appointed a brevet major general He was most notable for recruiting and leading the Irish Brigade, and encouraging support among Irish immigrants for the Union. By his first marriage in Ireland, he had one surviving son; the two never met. Following the Civil War, Meagher was appointed Montana's Territorial Secretary of State by President Andrew Johnson, and served as acting territorial governor. In 1867, Meagher drowned in the Missouri River after falling from a steamboat at Fort Benton. The cause of his fall is disputed by historians, with varying hypotheses including weakness from dysentery, intoxication, suicide, and murder. A 2016 analysis by Timothy Egan, in The Immortal Irishman, suggested Meagher may have been murdered by Montana political opponents. Family Thomas Francis Meagher was born on 3 August 1823 in Waterford CityLyons, p. 10. in what is now the Granville Hotel on the Quay. From the age of two he lived with his family at nearby Number 19, The Mall. His father, Thomas Meagher (1796‚Äì1874), was a wealthy merchant who had retired to enter politics. He was twice elected Mayor of the City, which he represented in Parliament from August 1847 to March 1857. He had lived in the city since he was a young man, having migrated from Newfoundland in present- day Canada.O'Sullivan pg.192 The senior Meagher was born in St John's, Newfoundland. His father, also named Thomas (1763‚Äì1837),Cavanagh 1892, pg. 12 had emigrated as a young man from County Tipperary just before the turn of the 18th century. Starting as a farmer, the grandfather Meagher became a trader, and advanced to merchant, and shipowner. Newfoundland was the only British colony where the Irish constituted a majority of the population.Duffy, FYIH, pg. 10 The senior Thomas Meagher married a widow, Mary Crotty. He established a prosperous trade between St. John's and Waterford, Ireland. Later, the grandfather placed his eldest son Thomas in Waterford to represent their business interests. The son Thomas became a successful merchant in Waterford, whose economic success was followed by political office. Thomas Francis Meagher's mother, Alicia Quan (1798‚Äì1827), was the second eldest daughter of Thomas Quan and Alicia Forristall. Her father was a partner in the trading and shipping firm known as Wye, Cashen and Quan of Waterford. She died when Meagher was three and a half years old, after the birth of twin girls. (One of the girls also died then; the other at age seven.) Meagher had four siblings; a brother Henry and three sisters. Only he and his older sister Christine Mary Meagher lived past childhood. Wylie 2007, p. 20 Early life and education Meagher was educated at Roman Catholic boarding schools. When Meagher was eleven, his family sent him to the Jesuits at Clongowes Wood College in County Kildare. It was at Clongowes that he developed his skill of oratory, becoming at age 15 the youngest medalist of the Debating Society.Cavanagh 1892, pg. 19 These oratory skills would later distinguish Meagher during his years as a leading figure in Irish Nationalism.Lyons pg10 Although he gained a broad and deep education at Clongowes, as was typical, it did not include much about the history of his country or matters relating to Ireland. After six years, Meagher left Ireland for the first time,Lonergan 1913, pg. 112 to study in Lancashire, England, at Stonyhurst College, also a Jesuit institution.\\"Stonyhurst College\\", Catholic Encyclopaedia (1912); retrieved 18 July 2008 Meagher's father regarded Trinity College, the only university in Ireland, as being both anti-Irish and anti-Catholic.Griffith pg. IV (preface) The younger Meagher established a reputation for developed scholarship and \\"rare talents.\\" While Meagher was at Stonyhurst, his English professors struggled to overcome his \\"horrible Irish brogue\\"; he acquired an Anglo-Irish upper-class accent that in turn grated on the ears of some of his countrymen.Griffith pg. V (preface) Despite his English accent and what some people perceived as a \\"somewhat affected manner\\", Meagher had so much eloquence as an orator as to lead his countrymen to forget his English idiosyncrasies. He became a popular speaker \\"who had no compare\\" in Conciliation Hall, the meeting place of the Irish Repeal Association.O'Sullivan pg. 193Ua Cellaigh, pp. 152‚Äì53Lyons pg. 11 Young Ireland Meagher returned to Ireland in 1843,1843 the \\"Repeal year\\" according to Daniel O'Connell with undecided plans for a career in the Austrian army, a tradition among a number of Irish families. In 1844 he traveled to Dublin with the intention of studying for the bar. He became involved in the Repeal Association, which worked for repeal of the Act of Union between Great Britain and Ireland.O'Sullivan pg 193 Meagher was influenced by writers of The Nation newspaper and fellow workers in the Repeal movement. The movement became nationwide. At a Repeal meeting held in Waterford on 13 December, at which his father presided, Meagher acted as one of the Secretaries. He soon became popular on Burgh Quay, his eloquence at meetings making him a celebrated figure in the capital. Any announcement of Meagher's speaking would ensure a crowded hall. In June 1846, the administration of Sir Robert Peel's Tory Ministry fell, and the Liberals under Lord John Russell came to power. Daniel O'Connell tried to lead the Repeal movement to support both the Russell administration and English Liberalism. Repeal agitation was damped down in return for a distribution of generous patronage through Conciliation Hall.Griffith pg. VI (preface) On 15 June 1846, Meagher denounced English Liberalism in Ireland, as he suspected the national cause of Repeal would be sacrificed to the Whig government. He felt the Irish would be \\"purchased back into factious vassalage.\\"O'Sullivan pg 195 Meagher and the other \\"Young Irelanders\\" (the epithet used by O'Connell to describe the young men of The Nation) vehemently denounced any movement toward English political parties, so long as Repeal was denied. The promise of patronage and influence divided the Repeal Movement. Those who hoped to gain by government positions, also called The \\"Tail\\", and described as the \\"corrupt gang of politicians who fawned on O'Connell\\" wanted to drive the genuinely ecumenical Young Irelanders from the Repeal Association.Griffith pg. VII (preface) Such opponents portrayed the ecumenical Young Irelanders as revolutionaries, factionists, infidels and secret enemies of the Catholic Church. On 13 July, O'Connell's followers introduced resolutions to declare that under no circumstances was a nation justified in asserting its liberties by force of arms. In fact, the Young Irelanders had not, until then, advocated the use of physical force to advance the cause of repeal and opposed any such policy.Doheny Pg 105 The \\"Peace Resolutions\\" declared that physical force was immoral under any circumstances to obtain national rights. Although Meagher agreed that only moral and peaceful means should be adopted by the Association, he added that if Repeal could not be carried by those means, he would adopt the more perilous risky but no less honorable choice of arms. When the Peace resolutions were proposed again on 28 July, Meagher responded with his famous \\"Sword Speech\\".O'Sullivan pg 195‚Äì96 Meagher dissented from the Resolutions, not wanting to pledge to the unqualified repudiation of physical force \\"in all countries, at all times, and in every circumstance\\". He knew there were times when arms would suffice, and when political amelioration called for \\"a drop of blood, and many thousand drops of blood\\". He \\"eloquently defended physical force as an agency in securing national freedom.\\"O'Sullivan pg 196 As Meagher carried the audience to his side, O'Connell's supporters believed they were at risk in not being able to drive out the Young Irelanders. O'Connell's son John interrupted Meagher to declare that one of them had to leave the hall. William Smith O'Brien protested against this attempt to suppress legitimate speech and left the meeting with other prominent Young Irelanders in defiance, never to return. Irish Confederation Trial at Clonmel of Meagher, Terence MacManus, and Patrick O'Donoghue, all sentenced to death. Plaque commemorating Meagher's arrest at 19 The Mall, Waterford, 12 July 1848 In January 1847, Meagher, together with John Mitchel, William Smith O'Brien, and Thomas Devin Reilly formed a new repeal body, the Irish Confederation. In 1848, Meagher and O'Brien went to France to study revolutionary events there, and returned to Ireland with the new Flag of Ireland, a tricolour of green, white and orange made by and given to them by French women sympathetic to the Irish cause. The acquisition of the flag is commemorated at the 1848 Flag Monument in the Irish parliament. The design used in 1848 was similar to the present flag, except that orange was placed next to the staff, and the red hand of Ulster decorated the white field. This flag was first flown in public on 1 March 1848, during the Waterford by-election, when Meagher and his friends flew the flag from the headquarters of Meagher's \\"Wolfe Tone Confederate Club\\" at No. 33, The Mall, Waterford.Cavanagh 1892, p. 100 Following the incident known as the Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848 or \\"Battle of Ballingarry\\" in August 1848, Meagher, Terence MacManus, O'Brien, and Patrick O'Donoghue were arrested, tried and convicted for sedition. Due to a newly passed ex post facto law, the sentence meant that Meagher and his colleagues were sentenced to be \\"hanged, drawn and quartered\\". It was after his trial that Meagher delivered his famous Speech From the Dock.Lyons 1870, pp. 15‚Äì20 While awaiting execution in Richmond Gaol, Meagher and his colleagues were joined by Kevin Izod O'Doherty and John Martin. But, due to public outcryWylie 2007, pg. 61 and international pressure,Cavanagh 1892, pg. 294 royal clemency commuted the death sentences to Penal exile for life to \\"the other side of the world\\". In 1849 all were sent to Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania, Australia).Lyons 1870, pg. 20 On July 20, the day after being notified of his exile to Van Diemen's Land, Meagher announced that he wished henceforth to be known as Thomas Francis O'Meagher. Van Diemen's Land Meagher accepted the \\"ticket-of-leave\\" in Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania), giving his word not to attempt to escape without first notifying the authorities, in return for comparative liberty on the island. A further stipulation was that each of the Irish \\"gentleman\\" convicts was sent to reside in separate districts: Meagher to Campbell Town and shortly after to Ross (where his cottages still stand); MacManus to Launceston and later near New Norfolk; Kevin O'Doherty to Oatlands; John Mitchel and John Martin to Bothwell; and O'Brien (who initially refused a ticket-of-leave) to the \\"Penal Station\\" on Maria Island and later to New Norfolk. During his time in Van Diemen's Land, Meagher managed to meet clandestinely with his fellow Irish rebels, especially at Interlaken on Lake Sorell.Akenson 2006, p 122 Marriage and family On 22 February 1851, in Van Diemen's Land, Meagher married Catherine Bennett, daughter of Bryan Bennett, a farmer who, in 1817, had been convicted of mail robbery and in 1818 transported to Van Diemen's Land.Lonergan 1913, p. 115 Meagher's fellow exiles disapproved of his marriage because she was a \\"dead-common girl\\", or the child of a common criminal. Although his friends believed her social status made them an unsuitable match, Meagher was unperturbed, and his wife and he lived in a house Meagher built on the shore of Lake Sorell. Soon after they were married, Catherine became ill.Wylie 2007, pp 74‚Äì77 Less than a year after his wedding in January 1852, Meagher abruptly surrendered his \\"ticket-of-leave\\" and planned his escape to the United States. Meagher sent his \\"ticket-of-leave\\" and a letter to the authorities, along with notifying them he would consider himself a free man in twenty-four hours. When he escaped, Catherine was in an advanced stage of pregnancy and stayed behind. Following Meagher's departure from Van Diemen's Land, their son, Henry Emmett Fitzgerald O'Meagher was born, but he died at 4 months of age, shortly after Meagher reached New York City. The infant son, Henry Emmett Fitzgerald O'Meagher was buried on 8 June 1852 at St. John's Catholic Church, the oldest Catholic church in Australia, in Richmond, Tasmania, Australia. The small grave is next to the church. A plaque notes his father having been an Irish Patriot and member of the Young Irelanders.Akenson 2006, pp. 125‚Äì27 Following Meagher's escape, Catherine travelled to London, where she was met by her father-in-law and then they both travelled on to Waterford, in south-east Ireland. On arrival at Waterford railway station, she was welcomed by thousands of citizens, such was her husband's fame in Ireland as a nationalist. However, she was not very well and rested at her father-in- law's home for a short time (where a crowd of 20,000 'serenaded' her). Eventually she was able to spend a short time in the United States with Meagher. She returned to Ireland pregnant and in poor health. She gave birth to Meagher's only child to reach adulthood: Thomas Bennett Meagher, named after his father. She died in Ireland on 12 May 1854, at the home of Meagher's father. Meagher never met his son, who was raised by the senior Meaghers and relatives. Meagher in the 1860s After Meagher settled in New York, he soon courted Elizabeth \\"Libby\\" Townsend, the daughter of Peter Townsend and Caroline (n√©e) Parrish of Monroe, New York. The Townsend family were wealthy Protestants, who opposed Meagher's marrying their daughter but they eventually relented. Elizabeth converted to Roman Catholicism, and in 1856 she and Meagher married.Wylie 2007, pp. 96‚Äì97 Immigration to the United States Meagher arrived in New York City in May 1852. He studied law and journalism, and became a noted lecturer. Soon after, Meagher became a United States citizen.Cavanagh 1892, p 367 He eventually founded a weekly newspaper called the Irish News. Meagher and John Mitchel, who had also since escaped, published the radical pro-Irish, anti-British Citizen. After his escape, the question of \\"honor\\" was raised by Mitchel, among others. Meagher agreed to be \\"tried\\" by American notables, and vowed to return to Van Diemen's Land if they held against him. The simulated court martial found for Meagher, and he was vindicated. Prior to the outbreak of the American Civil War, Meagher traveled to Costa Rica, in part to determine whether Central America would be suitable for Irish immigration.Wylie 2007, pp 105 He used his experiences as the basis for writing travel articles which were published in Harper's Magazine. He was commissioned as a captain in the New York State Militia.Eicher, p. 385. American Civil War Meagher's decision to serve the Union was not a simple one; before the onset of the war, he had supported the South. He had visited the South to lecture, and was sympathetic to its people.Wylie 2007, pp 117‚Äì121 Further, his Irish friend John Mitchel, who had settled in the South, supported the secessionists. Meagher and Mitchel split over the issue of slavery.Akenson 2006, p 345‚Äì346 Mitchel went to the Confederate capitol in Richmond, Virginia, and his three sons served with the Confederate States Army. 69th New York Militia On 12 April 1861, the first shots were fired at U.S.-held Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina. This action by the South pushed Meagher into support of the Union cause.Wylie 2007, pp. 117‚Äì21 He began recruiting men for the Union Army. One of his ads in the New York Daily Tribune read: \\"One hundred young Irishman‚Äîhealthy, intelligent and active‚Äîwanted at once to form a Company under command of Thomas Francis Meagher.\\" On April 29, his recruits were enlisted as Company K of the 69th Infantry Regiment of the New York State Militia (the \\"Fighting 69th\\"). Under the command of Colonel Michael Corcoran, another leading Irish political figure, the 69th fought in the First Battle of Bull Run, a Confederate victory.Bruce 2006, pp. 78‚Äì79 Corcoran was captured, and Meagher succeeded him as colonel. After Bull Run, Meagher returned to New York to form the Irish Brigade.Lyons 1870, pp. 82‚Äì88 In lectures, including a famous speech made at the Boston Music Hall in September 1861, he implored the Irish of the North to defend the Union.Lonergan 1913, pp. 115‚Äì16Lyons 1870, pp. 91‚Äì119 He was commissioned brigadier general (effective 3 February) to lead the Brigade in the Peninsula Campaign of 1862. Battle of Fair Oaks, 1 June 1862 At the Battle of Fair Oaks in May, Meagher first led the Brigade in battle. The Union won a defensive victory, and the Irish Brigade furthered their reputation as fierce fighters. This reputation was solidified when the New York printmaker Currier and Ives published a lithograph depicting Meagher on horseback, leading his brigade in a bayonet charge.Wylie 2007, pp. 148‚Äì50 Following the Battle of Fair Oaks, Meagher was given command of a non-Irish regiment. This experiment was unsuccessful, and thereafter Meagher would command only Irishmen.Wylie 2007, pp. 151‚Äì52 Meagher's troops fought at the Battle of Gaines' Mill on 27 June. The Irish Brigade arrived in battle after a quick march through the Chickahominy River, as reinforcements for the weakening V Corps. Later, this march and battle were considered by historians as the highlight of Meagher's military career.Wylie 2007, pp. 154‚Äì55 The Irish Brigade suffered huge losses at the Battle of Antietam that fall. Meagher's brigade led an attack at Antietam on September 17 against the Sunken Road (later referred to as \\"Bloody Lane\\") and lost 540 men to heavy volleys before being ordered to withdraw.Bailey, Ronald H., and the Editors of Time-Life Books, The Bloodiest Day: The Battle of Antietam, p. 100. Time-Life Books, 1984; . During the battle, Meagher was injured when he fell off his horse. Some reports said Meagher had been drunk,Bruce 2006, p. 120 but Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan's official report noted that Meagher's horse had been shot.Wylie 2007, p. 165 Meagher had faced reports of drunkenness at the First Battle of Bull Run.Bruce 2006, p. 89 The high number of casualties at Antietam, and the rumors of his being drunk on the battlefield, increased criticism of Meagher's command ability. The Irish Brigade suffered its largest losses at the Battle of Fredericksburg. Brigade chaplain Father William Corby later said it was \\"a body of about 4,000 Catholic men marchingmost of themto death.\\"Wylie 2007, p. 145 Meagher led 1,200 men into battle, and \\"two hundred and eighty men only appeared under arms to represent the Irish Brigade\\" the next morning. Meagher took no direct part in this battle, remaining at the rear when his brigade began their advance, due to, what he described in his official report as 'a most painful ulcer in the knee joint'.Official Records, Vol 21, p. 243 Meagher spent the next four months recovering from his injuries, and resumed his command three days prior to the Battle of Chancellorsville.Wylie 2007, pp. 184-85 After limited engagement at Chancellorsville, Meagher resigned his commission on 14 May 1863. The Army had refused his request to return to New York to raise reinforcements for his battered brigade.Cavanagh 1892, p. 485 The brigade was 4,000 strong in mid‚ÄìMay 1862, but by late May 1863, it had only a few hundred combat-ready men left.Wylie 2007, p. 181 Meagher's fellow Irish leader, Col. Corcoran, had been exchanged and promoted Brigadier General, but he died in December 1863. So the Army rescinded Meagher's resignation on 23 December. He was assigned to duty in the Western Theater beginning in September 1864. He commanded the District of Etowah in the Department of the Cumberland from 29 November to 5 January 1865. Meagher briefly commanded a provisional division in the Army of the Ohio (9‚Äì25 February); he resigned from the Army on May 15. Territorial governorship of Montana Brigadier General Thomas Francis Meagher After the war, Meagher was appointed Secretary of the new Territory of Montana; soon after arriving there, he was designated Acting Governor. Meagher attempted to create a working relationship between the territory's Republican executive and judicial branches, and the Democratic legislative branch. He failed, making enemies in both camps. Further, he angered many when he pardoned a fellow Irishman who had been convicted of manslaughter. The Territory of Montana was created from the eastern portion of Idaho Territory as its population increased with an influx of settlers following the discovery of gold in 1862. When the Civil War ended, many more settlers entered the territory. Searching for riches, they often disregarded U.S. treaties with the local Native American tribes. In 1867, Montana pioneer John Bozeman was allegedly killed by a band of Blackfeet, who attacked other settlers as well. Meagher responded by organizing the Montana Territory Volunteer Militia to retaliate. He secured funding from the federal government to campaign against the Native Americans, but was unable to find the offenders, or retain the militia's cohesion. He was later criticized for his actions. Meagher called Montana's first constitutional convention to develop a constitution as a step toward statehood. Not enough residents voted for the constitution and statehood to qualify. In addition, copies of the constitution were lost on the way to a printer, and Congress never received copies for review. Montana gained statehood in 1889, more than 20 years after Meagher's death. Disappearance In the summer of 1867, Meagher traveled to Fort Benton, Montana, to receive a shipment of guns and ammunition sent by General William Tecumseh Sherman for use by the Montana Militia.Lonergan 1913, pp. 124-25 On the way to Fort Benton, the Missouri River terminus for steamboat travel, Meagher fell ill and stopped for six days to recuperate. When he reached Fort Benton, he was reportedly still ill.Wylie 2007, pp. 306‚Äì07 Memorial to Meagher near the location of his disappearance into the Missouri River, Fort Benton, Montana Sometime in the early evening of 1 July 1867, Meagher fell overboard from the steamboat G. A. Thompson, into the Missouri River. The pilot described the waters as \\"instant deathwater twelve feet deep and rushing at the rate of ten miles an hour.\\"Lonergan 1913, p. 125 His body was never recovered. Some believed his death to be suspicious and many theories circulated about his death. Early theories included a claim that he was murdered by a Confederate soldier from the war, or by Native Americans. In 1913 a man claimed to have carried out the murder of Meagher for the price of $8000, but then recanted.Wylie 2007, p. 313 In the same vein, American journalist and novelist Timothy Egan, who published a biography of Meagher in 2016, noted that his political nemesis, Wilbur Fisk Sanders, was in Fort Benton at the same time. Egan hypothesized that Meagher may have been set up for murder by his Montana political enemies or powerful and still active vigilantes.Gwinn, Mary Ann. \\"From Dublin to Montana‚ÄîTimothy Egan on his new book 'The Immortal Irishman'\\", The Seattle Times, 25 February 2016; Quote: \\"There were no trials, they just pulled out people they didn't like. Meagher pardoned a man, and then they grabbed him and hanged him the same day, with Meagher's message in his pocket. I think there is pretty good evidence, without being 100 percent sure, that he was murdered.\\" In 2008, John T. Hubbell suggested that Meagher had been drinking and fell overboard. Other hypotheses included the possibility that he had been weakened by dysentery or that his fall was a suicide. A fictionalized account shown on Death Valley Days (1960) had him survive the assassination attempt because his aide had been mistakenly murdered when he accepted one of his trademark cigars; and Meagher used his seeming death as leverage over his political opponents. Meagher was survived by his American second wife, Elizabeth \\"Libby\\" (n√©e Townsend; 1840‚Äì1906). He was also survived by his second son by his first wife, Catherine. Their first son died as an infant in Tasmania. Catherine gave birth to the second son, named Thomas Bennett Meagher, in Ireland after being with Meagher for a time in the United States. She died soon after the birth, and their son, whom he would never meet, grew up in Ireland reared by the family of his father.

Anthony Green (born 30 September 1939) is an English realist painter and printmaker best known for his paintings of his own middle-class domestic life. His works sometimes use compound perspectives and polygonal forms‚Äîparticularly with large, irregularly shaped canvasses. As well as producing oil paintings, he also produces a number of works designed from the start as limited edition prints, which are typically gicl√©e works. Biography Anthony Green was born on 30 September 1939 in Luton, Bedfordshire, and educated at Highgate School, London (where he was taught by Kyffin Williams) and the Slade School of Art (where he first met lifelong friend and fellow RA Ben Levene). In 1960 he moved to Paris and Ch√¢teauroux on a scholarship from the Government of France. He returned to England in 1961 and married Mary Cozens-Walker, with whom he has had two daughters, Kate and Lucy. His first one-man exhibition was held at the Rowan Gallery in 1962. He taught at the Slade from 1964 until 1967 when he received a Harkness Fellowship and spent two years living in Leonia, New Jersey and Altadena, California. Green was elected an Associate Member of the Royal Academy on 23 April 1971, was elected a full Member on 1 March 1977 and won the Royal Academy Summer Exhibit of the Year in 1977.

He owns the hotel chain Budget Suites of America and is the founder of Bigelow Aerospace. Early life and education Bigelow grew up in Las Vegas, Nevada, attended Highland Elementary School, and was first exposed to science through witnessing‚Äîfrom a distance‚Äîa number of the nuclear weapons tests conducted about 70 miles northwest of the city. At age 12, Bigelow decided that his future lay in space travel, despite his limitations in mathematics, and he resolved to choose a career that would make him rich enough that, one day, he could hire the scientific expertise required to launch his own space program. Until then, he would tell no one‚Äînot even his wife‚Äîabout his ultimate goal. He entered the University of Nevada, Reno, in 1962 to study banking and real estate, and he graduated from Arizona State University in 1967. Career After many years from the late 1960s through the 1990s developing commercial real estate hotels, motels and apartments, Bigelow founded Bigelow Aerospace in 1999. In 1995, Bigelow founded the National Institute for Discovery Science to research and advance study of various fringe sciences and paranormal topics, most notably ufology. The organization researched cattle mutilation and black triangle reports, ultimately attributing the latter to the military. The institute was disbanded in 2004. In 1996, Bigelow bought in Utah the Skinwalker Ranch, a 480-acre cattle ranch \\"that some believe is the site of an interdimensional doorway used by alien shape-shifters and stationed watchers there.\\" Bigelow has indicated that he plans to spend up to to develop the first commercial space station, 33% of the $1.5 billion that NASA expended on a single space shuttle mission. Bigelow Aerospace has launched two experimental space modules, Genesis I and Genesis II, and has plans for full- scale manned space habitats to be used as orbital hotels, research labs and factories. In his real estate career, Bigelow built approximately 15,000 units, and purchased another 8,000. For most of his career, \\"he held on to almost everything he bought, but ... eventually unload much of his housing stock in the boom years immediately before the 2008 crash\\". In 2013, Bigelow reflected on this: \\"People just really wanted to throw money away, ... So that was lucky.\\" In 2013, Bigelow indicated that the reason he went into the commercial real estate business was to obtain the requisite resources to be able to fund a team developing space destinations. Bigelow's BEAM module was launched to the International Space Station on April 8, 2016, on the eighth SpaceX cargo resupply mission. Bigelow was interviewed on Coast to Coast AM in March 2013. In May 2017, Bigelow appeared on CBS' 60 Minutes and said he was \\"absolutely convinced\\" there have been extraterrestrial visitors to Earth. In October 2017, Bigelow announced that he planned to put an inflatable \\"space hotel\\" into orbit by 2022. The plan is part of partnership with United Launch Alliance, and the project is estimated to cost $2.3 billion in total. Bigelow was reported by the New York Times in December, 2017 to have urged Senator Harry Reid to initiate what became the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program, a government study which operated from 2007 to 2012 tasked with the study of UFOs. According to the New York Times, Bigelow said he was ‚Äúabsolutely convinced‚Äù that aliens exist and have visited Earth. In March 2020, Bigelow Aerospace let go of all 68 members of staff and halted operations after over 20 years of business, in a move that was partly caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

The school opened on October 17, 1920, in a small schoolhouse on Avenida S√£o Jo√£o, and in 1961 the current campus was built on Avenida Giovanni Gronchi, in a terrain now facing the slum of Parais√≥polis (S√£o Paulo), located in Morumbi. Although the school is located near the Parais√≥polis favela, it is fortified with high levels of security to deal with possible threats. The school offers education from pre- primary to high school, all offering American-style teaching. The Lower School consists of the Montessori Preprimary program (three years old through Kindergarten). The high school also offers an International Baccalaureate (IB) diploma and a Brazilian diploma, in addition to the mandatory SACS-accredited American diploma. There are two Advanced Placement courses available: AP Calculus AB and BC. The majority of classes are taught in English, but the school does offer classes in Portuguese, French, and Spanish. Graded's high school offers two to three levels of maths sets per year. The school has 90 classrooms, eight computer labs, an auditorium, an infirmary, two covered play areas, two gyms, and four science labs. There are also two soccer fields under construction. The libraries contain over 50,000 volumes. All these elements help prepare students for admission to some of the most competitive schools in the world and all graduates receive an American high school diploma. In 2006, the school finished the construction of an arts center. It is a large structure with two floors, but standing as high as a six-floor building. The first floor houses music and theater activities, with an orchestra room, a band room, six practice rooms (two of which contain pianos, and one an electric drum set), a dance studio, a media center for editing film and music, and a black box theater. The second floor is dedicated to the visual arts, and contains several rooms for ceramics, painting, and drawing. The second floor also has a photography room, complete with its own developing facilities. In 2010, the Graded Campus Project was developed. In February 2014, Phase I of the project was completed, with a full renovation of the Lower School Playgrounds and Gymnasiums. In March 2017, Phase II of the Graded Campus Project was inaugurated. It included a new Main Entrance, Parking Garage, Student Center, Large Field, Small Field, Track, Beach Volleyball Court, Wellness Gymnasium, and Maintenance Building. Traditionally more than 95% of the school's graduating class enrolls in a 4-year degree education within one year of graduation.  Accreditation  Accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and the Brazilian Ministry of Education. It is also a member of Association of American Schools in South America. Graded Campus Project. Graded school is a member of the Association of American Schools of South America (AASSA), the US National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS) and the American Montessori Society.  Mission  \\"Inspire. Challenge. Succeed. Every student. Every heart. Every mind.\\"  Vision  Individuals empowered to reach their potential and positively impact the world.  Values  Intellectual Curiosity, Perseverance, Respect, Integrity, and Kindness.  Board  The graded board is composed of a self-perpetuating board, and consists of 12 members that are appointed for up to four 2-year terms. The board was first established in 1931 and continues to set the school‚Äôs fiduciary policies, annual budget and fundraising goals based on input from the superintendent and the Leadership Learning Team. This Board is also in charge of hiring and evaluating the school's superintendent.  The Graded Campus Project  The school is currently undergoing an ambitious campus project which is scheduled to finish in 2020, to celebrate its 100th anniversary. An underground garage and modern, eco-friendly classrooms are planned. Graded began this visionary project in 2010 by developing a plan to modernize its facilities in conjunction with H2L2, a company specializing in international school design. This plan was then used by Zanettini, a S√£o Paulo-based architecture firm famous for its green architecture, to develop detailed architectural specifications based on the overall master educational plan. In conjunction with Hochtief, one of the leading construction companies in Brazil, Graded established a strategically phased approach for implementation. The first phase of this project was accomplished in 2014, that included a full renovation of the Lower School Playgrounds and Gymnasiums. On September 1, 2015, Phase II construction was started. It was inaugurated in March 2017, including a new Main Entrance, Parking Garage, Student Center, Large Field, Small Field, Track, Beach Volleyball Court, Wellness Gymnasium, and Maintenance Building.

He played 50 Test matches and 117 One Day Internationals for Australia as an opening batsman. As the coach of Australia he was in charge when Australia won the 1999 Cricket World Cup in England. He later coached Zimbabwe (2001‚Äì2004) and Sri Lanka (2011‚Äì12). Playing career Marsh was a steady, solid right-handed opening batsman and capable fielder, making his first-class debut for Western Australia as a nineteen-year-old in the 1977‚Äì1978 Sheffield Shield season. In 1978 he played five games of Australian rules football for South Fremantle in the West Australian National Football League before concentrating only on cricket. Marsh established himself as a solid competitor on the domestic front and was on the fringes of the national team for a number of years before winning selection in the Australian Test team. He made his debut in December 1985 against India and took part of the tours of New Zealand and India the following year. However, his domestic debut was less than impressive, scoring a golden pair for Western Australia on debut at Sydney Cricket Ground, which was recorded in hand- written form on a storing cabinet inside the away team's dressing room as a symbolic \\"domestic honours board\\". He soon made the opening position his own (despite his mediocre batting average of 33.18), batting alongside the likes of Mark Taylor and David Boon, and became an integral part of the Australian One Day International team. He along with David Boon became the first pair of openers to notch hundreds in a same ODI innings for the team Marsh played international cricket over a seven-year period, ending in 1992. He is best remembered for his part in the Australian team that won the 1987 World Cup in India, including an unbeaten 126 against New Zealand in Chandigarh, while he also captained his country in four matches. Over his career Marsh was a solid performer in One Day International cricket, with a batting average of nearly 40 but had a very low strike rate compared to more recent opening batsman. Geoff Marsh's Test career batting performance. Coaching career Marsh retired from playing cricket in 1994 before taking up coaching. In July 1996 he was chosen as coach of the Australian national Test and One Day International teams, playing a vital part in continuing his country's positions as the top cricketing nation of the time. He was the coach of the Australian team that won the 1999 World Cup in England, guiding the team to seven consecutive victories to help them win the tournament. He left the Australian coaching job and soon became a selector for the Australian Cricket Board (now Cricket Australia), although he left this position in 2001 to become coach of the Zimbabwean national teams. Marsh continued in this position until 2004 when his contract expired; many considered this decision was made due to the political circumstances of Zimbabwe's government under Robert Mugabe, although he has never commented publicly on the matter. In mid 2009 Geoff was appointed Head Coach of the Fremantle District Cricket Club, a club which Geoff spend most of his senior playing career with. He was appointed as the head coach for the team Pune Warriors India which made its IPL debut in 2011. In September 2011, he was appointed as the head coach of the Sri Lanka national team. However, his tenure lasted barely four months. After Sri Lanka lost the Test and ODI series of their tour of South Africa in December 2011 and January 2012, he was dismissed and replaced by Graham Ford. Family Geoff Marsh is only the third Test player - after Walter Hadlee and Lala Amarnath - to have two sons play Test cricket:Geoff Marsh and sons make history, ESPNcricinfo, 22 October 2014 Shaun Marsh, who made his test debut against Sri Lanka in 2011; and Mitchell Marsh, who made his test debut against Pakistan in 2014. The Marsh family took in the family of England cricketer Tom Curran in Zimbabwe after the Curran Family were evicted from their farm. Curran made his England test debut in the 4th ashes test of 2017 playing against Shaun and Mitchell who played for Australia in the same game.

Anthony Luttrell has pointed out that this family had developed close connections to the Byzantine ruling house of the Palaiologos‚Äî\\"four successive generations of Gattilusio married into the Palaiologos family, two to emperors' daughters, one to an emperor, and one to a despot who later became an emperor\\"‚Äîwhich could explain their repeated involvement in Byzantine affairs.Anthony Luttrell, \\"John V's Daughters: A Palaiologan Puzzle\\", Dumbarton Oaks Papers, 40 (1986), p. 112 The Gattilusi were Lords of Lesbos (present-day in Greece) from 1355 to 1462 and Lords of Aenus (present-day in Turkey) from 1376 to 1456.  History  Relief at the Castle of Mytilene, showing the family cypher of the Palaiologoi (left), the Byzantine double-headed eagle (centre) with the Gattilusi coat of arms on its breast, and the eagle of the Doria family (right) The Gattilusi family was founded by two brothers, Francesco and Niccol√≤ Gattilusi, who were the nephew of Oberto Gattilusi. The name of their father is not known, although based on the heraldic evidence of their inscriptions, Anthony Luttrell argues that their mother was a member of the Doria family.Luttrell, \\"John V's Daughters\\", p. 110 Francesco gained the favor of Byzantine Emperor John V Palaiologos by helping him oust a rival to the throne, John VI Kantakouzenos, in 1354. As reward, Gattilusio was given lordship of the island of Lesbos (and its stronghold, Mytilene) from July 1355, as well as the hand in marriage of the emperor's sister, Maria.Setton, vol. I, p. 225 The Gattilusi possessions grew to include, among others, the islands of Imbros, Samothrace, Lemnos and Thasos, and the mainland city of Aenos (modern Enez in Turkey).Setton, vol. II, p. 188 From this position, they were heavily involved in the mining and marketing of alum, useful in textile production and a profitable trade controlled by the Genoese.Setton, vol. II, p. 239 After the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, the Gattilusi briefly retained control of their possessions under Ottoman suzerainty, but were forced out within a few years. In 1456, the Ottomans appointed a native Greek historian, Michael Critobulus, as governor of Imbros, and likewise removed the Gattilusi from power in the remainder of their possessions, with the exception of Lesbos, which they were permitted to retain in return for an annual payment of 4,000 gold pieces. The lord of Lesbos, Domenico Gattilusio, was strangled and briefly succeeded by his brother Niccol√≤, before an Ottoman fleet captured the island in September 1462, sending Niccol√≤ as prisoner to Constantinople (where he was later executed) and putting an end to the family's power.Setton, vol. II, p. 238 Archaeological excavations in the castle of Mytilene since 1984 by the University of British Columbia under the direction of Caroline and Hector Williams have uncovered the burial chapel of the Gattilusi and a few graves that probably belonged to dependents of the family. The building was converted into a mosque after the Ottoman capture of Mytilene in 1462; an earthquake in February 1867 destroyed it.

It was originally created in the early 1990s as Notator Logic, or Logic, by German software developer C-Lab which later went by Emagic. American technology company Apple acquired Emagic in 2002 and renamed Logic to Logic Pro. It is the second most popular DAW - after Ableton Live - according to a survey conducted in 2015. A consumer-level version based on the same interface and audio engine but with reduced features, called Logic Express, was also available at a reduced cost. Apple's GarageBand comes free with all new Macintosh computers and iOS devices and is another application built on Logic‚Äôs audio engine. On December 8, 2011, the boxed version of Logic Pro was discontinued, along with Logic Express, and as with all other Apple software for Macs, Logic Pro is now only available through the Mac App Store. Features Logic Pro provides software instruments, audio effects and recording facilities for music synthesis. It also supports Apple Loops ‚Äì royalty-free, professionally recorded instrument loops. Logic Pro and Express share many functions and the same interface. Logic Express is limited to two-channel stereo mixdown, while Logic Pro can handle multichannel surround sound. Logic Express can only handle up to 255 audio tracks, depending on system performance (CPU and hard disk throughput and seek time), while, as of version 10.4.5, Logic Pro can handle up to 1000. Logic Pro can work with MIDI keyboards and control surfaces for input and processing, and for MIDI output. It features real-time scoring in musical notation, supporting guitar tablature, chord abbreviations and drum notation. Advanced MIDI editing is possible though Logic Pro's MIDI Transform Window, where velocity, pitch, pitch-bends, note length, humanize and precise note positioning are effected. Software instruments The software instruments included in Logic Pro X include: Drum Kit Designer, Drum Machine Designer, ES, ES2, EFM1, ES E, ES M, ES P, EVOC 20 PolySynth, Sampler, Quick Sampler, Step Sequencer, Klopfgeist, Retro Synth, Sculpture, Ultrabeat, Vintage B3, Vintage Clav, Vintage Electric Piano. These instruments produce sound in various ways, through subtractive synthesis (ES, ES2, ES E, ES M, ES P, Retro Synth), frequency modulation synthesis (EFM1), wavetable synthesis (ES2, Retro Synth), vocoding (EVOC 20 PolySynth), sampling (Sampler, Quick Sampler, Drum Kit Designer), and component modeling techniques (Ultrabeat, Vintage B3, Vintage Clav, and Vintage Electric Piano, Sculpture). As of version 10.2, Logic Pro X also includes Alchemy, a sample-manipulation synthesizer that was previously developed by Camel Audio. The software instruments are activated by MIDI information that can be input via a MIDI instrument or drawn into the MIDI editor. The Space Designer plugin attempts to emulate the characteristic echo and reverberation of a physical environment, using a method called convolution. Audio effects Audio effects include amp and guitar pedal emulators, delay effects, distortion effects, dynamics processors, equalization filters, filter effects, imaging processors, metering tools, modulation effects, pitch effects, and reverb effects. Among Logic's reverb plugins is Space Designer, which uses convolution reverb to simulate the acoustics of audio played in different environments, such as rooms of varying size, or emulate the echoes that might be heard on high mountains. Distributed processing The application features distributed processing abilities (in 32-bit mode), which can function across an Ethernet LAN. One machine runs the Logic Pro app, while the other machines on the network run the Logic node app. Logic will then offload the effects and synth processing to the other machines on the network. If the network is fast enough (i.e. gigabit Ethernet) this can work in near real-time, depending on buffer settings and CPU loads. This allows users to combine the power of several Macintosh computers to process Logic Pro‚Äôs built-in software instruments and plug-ins, and 3rd party processing plug-ins. As of version 10.0.7, Logic can access 24 processing threads, which is inline with Apple's flagship 12-core Mac Pro. History=Creator and Notator In the mid-to-late 1980s, Gerhard Lengeling and Chris Adam developed a MIDI sequencer program for the Atari ST platform called Creator. When musical notation capabilities were added, this became Notator, and later Notator SL. For simplicity these three are collectively referred to as Notator. Its main rivals at the time included Performer, Vision & Steinberg 16. Most MIDI sequencers presented a song as a linear set of tracks; however, Notator and Vision were pattern-based sequencers: songs were built by recording patterns (which might represent for example Intro, Verse, Chorus, Middle-8, Outro) with up to 16 tracks each, then assembling an Arrangement of these patterns, with up to 4 patterns playing simultaneously at any one time in the song. This more closely resembled working principles of hardware sequencers of the 1970s and 1980s. In its time, Notator was widely regarded (by musicians and the musical press of the time e.g. International Musician) as one of the most powerful and intuitive sequencing and notation programs available on any platform, but afterward the popularity of Steinberg's Cubase increased and track-based sequencing prevailed over pattern-based, resulting in the eventual greater integration and hybridization of the two methods in later versions of both Cubase and Logic. Logic The C-Lab programmers left that company to form Emagic, and in 1993 released a new program, Notator Logic, which attempted to fuse both track- and pattern-based operation (but looked much more like track-based sequencers than Notator). While rich in features, early versions of Logic on the Atari lacked the intuitiveness and immediacy of either Cubase or Notator, and never achieved the same success. However, by this time the Atari was becoming obsolete, and part of the reason why Notator Logic had been written from scratch with an object oriented GUI (though it shared the same nomenclature as its predecessor) was to make it easier to port to other platforms. The Notator prefix was dropped from the product name and the software became known as simply Logic. As later versions of the software became available for Mac OS and Windows platforms, and acquired ever more sophisticated functions (especially in audio processing) to take advantage of increased computing power, Logic, together with the rise of the PC, gained popularity again. Apple acquired Emagic in July 2002. The announcement included the news that development of the Windows version would no longer continue. This announcement caused controversy in the recording industry with an estimated 70,000 users having invested in the Windows route not wishing to reinvest in a complete new system. Despite much speculation in various Pro Audio forums however, exactly how many users may have abandoned Logic upon its acquisition by Apple, or abandoned the Windows platform for the Mac version, remains unknown, but Apple Pro Apps revenue has steadily increased since Apple's acquisition of Emagic, (roughly $2 billion a year as of Q1 2014). Versions=Early versions Logic 5 featured significant improvements in user interface, and increased compatibility with more types of computers, operating systems, and a wide range of audio interfaces. Logic 5.5.1 was the last version to be released for Windows. From Logic 6 onwards, the software would only be available on Mac OS. With Logic 6, Emagic added the availability of separately packaged software products that were closely integrated add-ons developed specifically for use with Logic, including software instruments, the EXS sampler and audio processing plug-ins. The Logic 6 package also included the stand-alone program Waveburner, for burning redbook audio CD standard- compliant CDR masters for replication, however, that application was considered a free bonus feature; it was not advertised as part of the package and did not include printed documentation. PDF documentation was included on the installer disc. In March 2004 Apple released Logic Pro 6, which consolidated over 20 different Emagic products, including all instrument and effect plug-ins, Waveburner Pro (CD Authoring application), and Pro Tools TDM support, into a single product package. Apple also released a scaled down version of Logic called Logic Express, replacing two previous versions that filled that position called Logic Silver and Logic Gold. Apple began promoting Logic Pro as one of its flagship software ‚ÄòPro‚Äô applications for the Macintosh platform. Logic Pro 7 Logic Pro 7 was released September 29, 2004. Most notably, Apple modified the interface of Logic 7 to look more like a product that was developed by Apple. Additions to Logic Pro 7 included: the integration of Apple Loops, Distributed Audio Processing (a technology for combining the power of multiple computers on a network), 3 new instruments including Sculpture (a sound modeling synth) and Ultrabeat (a drum synth and sequencer), and 9 new effect plug-ins including Guitar Amp Pro (guitar amp simulator), and a linear phase corrected version of their 6 channel parametric equalizer. In total, Logic Pro 7 now included 70 effect plug-ins and 34 instrument plug-ins. Pro-Tools TDM compatibility, which had been a feature of Logic since version 3.5, was not supported by Logic 7.2 on Intel-based Mac computers;According to Digidesign‚Äôs compatibility document for Pro Tools TDM HD 7.2 and 7.3, Logic Pro will require a future update from Apple to support Pro Tools HD DAE for Intel-based Macs.\\" TDM support returned with the release of Logic 8. Logic Pro 8 On September 12, 2007, Apple released the Logic Studio suite that included Logic Pro 8. Logic Pro was no longer a separate product, although a limited version Logic Express 8 was released on the same day, and remained a separate product. Significant changes were made for Logic 8. Logic Pro 8 was now mainly Cocoa code, but still included some Carbon Libraries. Alongside changes such as the new processing plug-in (Delay Designer), Apple included features such as Quick Swipe Comping, similar to Soundtrack Pro 2, and multi-take management. Apple also made changes to ease of use. These include the discontinuation of the XSKey dongle, and a streamlined interface. Each plug-in used in the channel strip opens in a new window when double-clicked. Many of the features found in Logic 7 have been consolidated into one screen. Other additions to the new interface included consolidated arrange windows, dual channel strips, built in browsers (like that in GarageBand) and production templates. Logic Pro 9 On July 23, 2009, Logic Pro 9 was announced. A major new feature included \\"Flex Time\\", Apple's take on \\"elastic\\" audio, which allows audio to be quantized. A version of the pedalboard from GarageBand was included, together with a new virtual guitar amplifier where the modeled components could be combined in different ways. There were also a number of improvements to audio editing, fulfilled user requests such as \\"bounce in place\\" and selective track and channel strip import, as well as an expanded content library including one more Jam Pack. Some of the bundled software, including MainStage 2 and Soundtrack Pro 3, was also improved. Logic Pro 9 is Universal Binary, although not officially supported for use on PowerPC computers. SoundDiver, which had been quietly bundled with previous versions, was dropped, eliminating support for arguably the world's most popular synthesizer editor/librarian. As Apple has bundled so many software instruments with Logic, it is not likely that we'll see the return of integration with external synthesizer hardware to the Logic platform. On January 12, 2010, Apple released Logic Pro 9.1, an Intel only release, thereby officially discontinuing Logic for the PowerPC platform. Logic Pro 9.1 had the option of running in 64-bit mode, which allowed the application to address more memory than in the past. Says Apple \\"With 64-bit mode, the application memory is not limited to 4GB as with 32-bit applications, so there is essentially no practical limit by today's standards.\\" Third party plug-ins that are 32-bit were still compatible, but would run from a 'wrapper' inside Logic Pro itself. On December 9, 2011, Apple announced that Logic Pro Studio 9 would no longer be available on DVD, and would only be sold via the Mac App Store. The price was reduced from $499 to $199.99 for the Logic Pro app, and $29.99 for MainStage. The download was just over 400MB, and 19GB of optional loops were available as in-app downloads. This version of Logic Pro Studio 9 no longer allowed users to access any microtunings in Scala format other than those provided with the software by Apple. Logic Pro X Released as successor to Logic Pro 9 on July 16, 2013, Logic Pro X (10.0.0) included a new, single-window customizable interface, with a design in line with Final Cut Pro X, as well as new features. New tools in this release are Drummer, a virtual session player that automatically plays along with your song in a wide variety of drumming styles and techniques, and Flex Pitch, a Flex Time equivalent for pitch editing in audio recordings. Also, a new \\"Smart Controls\\" feature allows users to map parameters from an array of plugins to a single, convenient control interface. Redesigned keyboards and synths were included, together with new stomp boxes, bass amp and drum kit designers, and a chord arpeggiator. A completely rebuilt sound and loop library was introduced, along with a new Patch architecture. Logic Pro X also improved track organization by allowing users to group multiple tracks into 'folder' like categories (e.g., acoustics, synthesizers, vocals, percussion, etc.). In addition to this organization, Logic Pro X allowed individuals to trigger 'solo,' 'mute,' and 'volume' controls for each group. Further improvements were made to score editing, exporting (now compatible with MusicXML format), and this version introduced MIDI plug-in compatibility. Coinciding with the release of Logic Pro X was the release of a companion iPad app called Logic Remote, which allows wireless control of Logic Pro X, including Touch Instruments for playing and recording software instruments as well as tools for navigating, making basic edits and mixing. Since this release, Logic Pro X runs in 64-bit mode only and no longer works with 32-bit plug-ins. Logic Pro X is capable of transferring most data from previous projects saved in Logic Pro 5 and later, though the transfer to 64-bit only means older 32-bit plugins will no longer work. Logic 10.4 introduced a new reverb called Chromaverb, and new functionality such as Smart Tempo, as well as the option to undo mixer actions. In addition, version 10.4 introduced support for version 2 of the ARA (Audio Random Access) standard. 10.5 was released in May 2020. It features Live Loops, Sampler, Quick Sampler, Remix FX, new drag-and-drop workflows, Drum Synth, and Step Sequencer .

It relates to the rate of decay of statistical dependence of two points with increasing time interval or spatial distance between the points. A phenomenon is usually considered to have long-range dependence if the dependence decays more slowly than an exponential decay, typically a power- like decay. LRD is often related to self-similar processes or fields. LRD has been used in various fields such as internet traffic modelling, econometrics, hydrology, linguistics and the earth sciences. Different mathematical definitions of LRD are used for different contexts and purposes. Short-range dependence versus long-range dependence One way of characterising long-range and short-range dependent stationary process is in terms of their autocovariance functions. For a short-range dependent process, the coupling between values at different times decreases rapidly as the time difference increases. Either the autocovariance drops to zero after a certain time-lag, or it eventually has an exponential decay. In the case of LRD, there is much stronger coupling. The decay of the autocovariance function is power-like and so is slower than exponential. A second way of characterizing long- and short- range dependence is in terms of the variance of partial sum of consecutive values. For short-range dependence, the variance grows typically proportionally to the number of terms. As for LRD, the variance of the partial sum increases more rapidly which is often a power function with the exponent greater than 1. A way of examining this behavior uses the rescaled range. This aspect of long-range dependence is important in the design of dams on rivers for water resources, where the summations correspond to the total inflow to the dam over an extended period.*Hurst, H.E., Black, R.P., Simaika, Y.M. (1965) Long-term storage: an experimental study Constable, London. The above two ways are mathematically related to each other, but they are not the only ways to define LRD. In the case where the autocovariance of the process does not exist (heavy tails), one has to find other ways to define what LRD means, and this is often done with the help of self-similar processes. The Hurst parameter H is a measure of the extent of long-range dependence in a time series (while it has another meaning in the context of self-similar processes). H takes on values from 0 to 1. A value of 0.5 indicates the absence of long-range dependence.Beran (1994) page 34 The closer H is to 1, the greater the degree of persistence or long-range dependence. H less than 0.5 corresponds to anti-persistency, which as the opposite of LRD indicates strong negative correlation so that the process fluctuates violently. Estimation of the Hurst Parameter Slowly decaying variances, LRD, and a spectral density obeying a power-law are different manifestations of the property of the underlying covariance stationary process X. Therefore, it is possible to approach the problem of estimating the Hurst parameter from three difference angles: *Variance-time plot: based on the analysis of the variances of the aggregate processes *R/S statistics: based on the time-domain analysis of the rescaled adjusted range *Periodogram: based on a frequency-domain analysis Relation to self-similar processes Given a stationary LRD sequence, the partial sum if viewed as a process indexed by the number of terms after a proper scaling, is a self-similar process with stationary increments asymptotically. In the converse, given a self-similar process with stationary increments with Hurst index H > 0.5, its increments (consecutive differences of the process) is a stationary LRD sequence. This also holds true if the sequence is short-range dependent, but in this case the self-similar process resulting from the partial sum can only be Brownian motion (H = 0.5), while in the LRD case the self-similar process is a self-similar process with H > 0.5, the most typical one being fractional Brownian motion. Models Among stochastic models that are used for long-range dependence, some popular ones are autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average models, which are defined for discrete-time processes, while continuous-time models might start from fractional Brownian motion.

His playing was characterized by a virtuoso technique and singing piano tone.Harold C. Schonberg, The Great Pianists from Mozart to the Present, Simon & Schuster, Second Edition (1987) For much of his later life, Cherkassky resided in London. Early years Alexander Isaakovich Cherkassky (Shura is a diminutive form of Alexander) was born in Odessa, Ukraine (then part of the Russian Empire) in 1909. Cherkassky's family fled to the United States to escape the Russian Revolution. His family was Jewish.Elizabeth Carr, Shura Cherkassky: The Piano's Last Czar, Scarecrow Press (2006), p. viii Cherkassky's first music lessons were from his mother, Lydia Cherkassky, who once played for Tchaikovsky in St. Petersburg. She also taught the pianist Raymond Lewenthal. In the United States, Cherkassky continued his piano studies at the Curtis Institute of Music under Josef Hofmann. Before studying with Hofmann, however, Cherkassky auditioned for Sergei Rachmaninoff, who advised him to give up performing for at least two years and to change the position of his hands at the keyboard. Conversely, Hofmann suggested Cherkassky should continue giving concerts, and this long association with public performance meant that Cherkassky felt comfortable before an audience. Hofmann also recommended that he practice for four hours every day and Cherkassky did this religiously throughout his life, maintaining an extensive repertoire (baroque to Berio) to an exacting standard. His studies and advisory sessions with Hofmann continued until 1935. In the interim he began his lifelong obsession with world travel with trips to Australia, New Zealand, the Far East, Russia and Europe. Cherkassky performed actively until the end of his lifeJean-Pierre Thiollet, 88 notes pour piano solo, \\"Solo nec plus ultra\\", Neva Editions, 2015, p.52. ., and many of his best recordings were made under live concert recital conditions. The California years In the 1940s Cherkassky moved to California. He appeared at the Hollywood Bowl with conductors such as Sir John Barbirolli and Leopold Stokowski, and he played the sound track (Beethoven's Appassionata Sonata) for the Bette Davis 1946 film Deception. He also played Stravinsky's Three Pieces from Petrushka for the composer, who advised him to use the 'una corda' pedal for certain loud passages in order to obtain a particular special effect. Concert engagements were infrequent for Cherkassky in California during World War II. The London years In 1946 he married Eugenie Blanc, but divorced two years later. In 1949 he had a great success in Hamburg playing Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini under Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt. This concert resulted in Cherkassky's popularity in Germany and Austria (Salzburg Festival) which lasted until the end of his life and confirmed him as one of the foremost pianists of the day. It was after his Wigmore Hall recital of 27 March 1957 that Cherkassky's career accelerated in the United Kingdom, and, following the death of his mother in Nice in 1961, he settled in London where he lived at The White House Hotel until his death in 1995. Further touring Cherkassky's grave in Highgate Cemetery His career continued to flourish with appearances at all the great concert venues of the world: the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, the Herkulessaal in Munich, the Philharmonie in Berlin, the Musikverein in Vienna, the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es, at Suntory Hall in Tokyo and with all the world's great orchestras and conductors. Cherkassky's love of spontaneity and his dislike of a fixed standard performance meant that some conductors were reluctant to work with him. With Cherkassky, there was no guarantee that what was agreed in rehearsal would happen in concert. Cherkassky's performing career lasted for over 70 years, yet it was only in the last few decades of his life that he was recognized as one of the greatest pianists ‚Äì a self-declared intuitive artist who relished spontaneity, beauty of sound and the kaleidoscopic possibilities of the piano. Cherkassky died in London, aged 86, on 27 December 1995. He is buried in Highgate Cemetery, London, England. Recordings Over seven decades of his concert career, starting in the 1920s, Cherkassky made a large number of recordings for RCA Victor, Vox, Swedish Cupol label, HMV, DG (the famous Tchaikovsky concerto recordings, and a later stereo recording of Franz Liszt's Hungarian Fantasy with the Berlin Philharmonic conducted by Herbert von Karajan), Tudor, Nimbus and Decca ('live' BBC recordings). He made his last recordings at age 85, in May 1995, seven months before his death. These were a selection of Rachmaninoff's pieces to act as fillers for his recording of Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 3 made the previous year.

It is one specific form of a set of sensations known as paresthesias, which also include the more common prickling, tingling sensation known as \\"pins and needles\\". Formication is a well documented symptom, which has numerous possible causes. The word is derived from formica, the Latin word for ant. Formication may sometimes be experienced as feelings of itchiness, tingling, pins and needles, burning, or even pain. When formication is perceived as itchiness, it may trigger the scratch reflex, and because of this, some people who experience the sensation are at risk of causing skin damage through excessive scratching. In some instances, static electricity can attract particulates to the skin and can also cause body hair to move, giving a sensation like insects crawling over the skin. However, in many cases no external trigger creates the sensation. In rare cases, individuals become convinced that the sensation is due to the presence of real insects on or under the skin. In these cases, patients have what is known as delusional parasitosis. They believe that their skin is inhabited by, or under attack by, small insects or similar parasites, despite repeated reassurances from physicians, pest control experts, and entomologists. Causes Causes of formication include normal states such as onset of menopause (i.e. hormone withdrawal). Other causes are medical conditions such as pesticide exposure, mercury poisoning, diabetic neuropathy, skin cancer, syphilis, Lyme disease, hypocalcaemia or herpes zoster (shingles) and neurocysticercosis. Formication can be a result of stimulant intoxication or withdrawal (methamphetamine, cocaine, MDMA aka ecstasy) or alcohol withdrawal in alcoholics (i.e. delirium tremens), and is often accompanied by visual hallucinations of insects (formicanopia). It can also occur as a symptom of benzodiazepine withdrawal, withdrawal from medication such as SSRI/SNRI antidepressants and tramadol; and as a side effect of opioid analgesics. History Formication is etymologically derived from the Latin word formica, meaning \\"ant\\", precisely because of this similarity in sensation to that of crawling insects. The term has been in use for several hundred years. In the 1797 edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, a description of the condition raphania includes the symptom: Described again in an instructional text from 1890: > A variety of itching, often encountered in the eczema of elderly people, is > formication; this is described as exactly like the crawling of myriads of > animals over the skin. It is probably due to the successive irritation of > nerve fibrils in the skin. At times patients who suffer from it will > scarcely be persuaded that it is not due to insects. Yielding to the > temptation to scratch invariably makes the disease worse.Jamieson, William > Allan (1894) Diseases of the Skin: A Manual for Practitioners and Students. > Pentland See also *Antipruritics ‚Äì anti-itch drugs *Morgellons References External links  Category:Hallucinations Category:Symptoms and signs: Cognition, perception, emotional state and behaviour Category:Substance dependence ","title":"Formication"},{"id":"1516712","text":"The Arcetri Observatory () is an astrophysical observatory located in the hilly area of Arcetri on the outskirts of Florence, Italy.

Called either \\"Big Jim\\" or \\"Frenchy\\", he was a key participant in the 1878 Lincoln County War. Out of all Lincoln County Regulators and associates of Billy the Kid, French remains the most mysterious. Not much is known about him, such as where he came from or how he came to work for John Tunstall. He was reported to be a large, powerful man, variously said to be either half-Indian or half-black. Lincoln County War French was present at all the key events of the Regulators during the war, including the Blackwater killings of William Morton, Frank Baker, and William McCloskey on March 9, 1878. After the shooting of Sheriff William Brady on April 1, 1878 in Lincoln (when French and five partners killed Brady and a deputy), he and Billy the Kid broke from cover and ran to Brady's body, ostensibly to get his arrest warrant for Alexander McSween. A deputy who survived the shooting, Billy Matthews, opened fire. His shot wounded both men, French so seriously he that couldn't travel, hiding out under a friend's floor for a day until the Regulators smuggled him out of town. Just three days later, Jim French was present with his pals at the Gunfight at Blazer's Mill against Buckshot Roberts, when Regulator captain Richard M. Brewer was killed. When the Regulators were trapped in Lincoln in July 1878, French was trapped along with McSween and Billy the Kid in the burning McSween house. Throughout the five-day ordeal, French remained volatile and dangerous. During a shouted parlay, when those surrounding them demanded to see the deputized Regulators' arrest warrants for rival James Dolan, French yelled back, \\"Our warrants are in our guns, you cock-sucking sonsabitches!\\" When the house was set afire on July 19, French and Billy the Kid led the Regulators out the rear door and escaped while several of their companions, including McSween, were gunned down in the backyard. By the fall of 1878, the war had ended and the Regulators split up. French left New Mexico, later writing a friend from a new home near Keota, Oklahoma. Postwar French was rumored to have been killed back in Lincoln County, New Mexico, in a quarrel over stolen cattle on June 21, 1879, but this seems unlikely. Others say he went to South America. A man named Jim French was killed on February 6, 1895 while trying to rob a store in Catoosa, Oklahoma, but there is nothing to indicate that this man was the Jim French of the Lincoln County War. Fellow Regulator George Coe stated in 1927 that French had been shot in Oklahoma \\"about three years ago.\\" Jim French's fate remains just as much a mystery as his origins.  In popular culture  In the film Young Guns II, Jim French was combined with fellow Regulator Henry Brown, and presented as a composite named Hendry French. Timid and clumsy, the film's portrayal of French, by actor Alan Ruck bears little actual resemblance to either outlaw. References Bibliography  *Billy the Kid: A Short and Violent Life, by Robert M.

The aircraft was intended to be easy to maintain, forgiving to fly, and capable of 480 km/h (300 mph) at 4,000 m (13,120 ft). The type's sturdy construction was frequently demonstrated and the armament was effective. However, French rearmament began two full years later than that in Britain, and none of these aircraft were available in sufficient numbers to make a difference in 1940. Design and development The 690 had begun life in 1934 as Br√©guet's response to the same strategic fighter aircraft specification as the eventual winner, the Potez 630. Both were twin-engine monoplanes with twin tailplanes, powered by Hispano-Suiza 14AB radial engines of contemporary design and performance. Br√©guet considered the weight limits of the specification ‚Äì requiring a twin-engine, three-man aircraft to be lighter than 3,000 kg/6,600 lb (later 3,500 kg/7,700 lb) ‚Äì to be overly restrictive and ignored them. Instead, the design was advertised as particularly versatile, with reconnaissance, ground attack and level bombing derivatives proposed that required no structural changes. Unsurprisingly, Br√©guet lost out in the competition to Potez, but confident in the 690's potential, nevertheless began building a prototype on its own funds. Although it had kept informed about foreign developments with dive bombers in the early 1930s, the French Air Force did not decide to acquire modern ground-attack aircraft before 1937.Ehrengardt 2002, p. 8. Engineless for nearly a year, the 690-01 prototype finally flew on 23 March 1938,Green 1967, p. 136. and displayed such promise that 100 two-seat attack bomber versions known as the Br√©guet 691 AB2 were ordered in June 1938, an order which was eventually doubled.Ehrengardt 2002, p. 10. For ground-attack, the 691's equipment included a 20 mm cannon and a pair of 7.5 mm (.295 in) machine guns firing forward, as well as an internal bomb rack that could be used in a shallow dive attack and was typically loaded with eight 50 kg (110 lb) bombs. Rear defense was provided by one flexible 7.5 mm (.295 in) machine gun, while a fixed, rearward-firing weapon of the same type was fitted under the fuselage to discourage low-flying fighters or ground fire from behind. A set of armour plates protected the crew, and the fuel tanks had rudimentary self-sealing capacity, but this protection proved insufficient in combat. Production Br√©guet established an assembly line with remarkable speed: the first production aircraft flew less than a year after being ordered and was in service before the end of 1939. As with the Potez 630, the Bre 691 was beset with engine difficulties. Hispano-Suiza had decided to concentrate on its V12 liquid-cooled engines and the 14AB engine was unreliable. The French authorities decided to order a new version, the Bre 693 powered by Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14M radials. Apart from the changed engines, which were of slightly smaller diameter, the two types were virtually identical. Orders for the Bre 691 were switched to the new type and more than 200 of the latter had been completed by the time of France's defeat. Late production versions of the Bre 693 introduced propulsive exhaust pipes that improved top speed by a small margin as well as, according to some sources, a pair of additional machine guns in the rear of each engine nacelle. Belgium ordered 32 licence-built copies but none were completed before the Belgian collapse. French engine makers had even greater difficulties than airframe manufacturers in keeping up with the frantic demands from 1938, and in 1939 the French government decided that all combat aircraft had to be adapted for British and US engines. Fewer than 250 Br√©guet 690 series aircraft were completed. The Arm√©e de l'air received only 211 examples: 75 Bre.691s, 128 Bre.693s and eight Bre.695s but the Germans captured a few dozen complete or near-complete aircraft at the factories. Operational history A small experimental unit had been experimenting with ground-attack tactics since 1937, initially in outdated biplanes such as the Potez 25, then in ANF Les Mureaux 115 monoplanes. Eventually, the Arm√©e de l‚ÄôAir concluded that low-altitude level- bombing was more suitable than dive-bombing for engaging enemy vehicles and artillery over the battlefield. The chosen tactic consisted in a nap-of-the- earth approach at maximum speed, followed by a strafing run or the delivery of time-delayed bombs directly over the target. French commanders widely considered this tactic as safe for the attackers, as anti-aircraft weapons then in service would be inefficient. The French Army was not using anti- aircraft autocannons at the time (the 25 mm Hotchkiss and 20 mm Oerlikon cannons were issued only later), relying instead on rifle-calibre machine guns and slow-firing 75 mm (2.95 in) guns.Taylor and Alexander 1969, pp. 76‚Äì77. In late 1939, two squadrons staffed with volunteers from level bomber units were gathered in the small airfield near Vinon-sur-Verdon, where they began their operational training. As Br√©guet 691s were not available yet, the crews flew the Potez 633 light bomber. When they were eventually delivered, the little Br√©guet were popular with their crews, although the unreliable engines in the Bre 691 affected aircraft availability rates, and undercarriage failures proved especially troublesome. Only in March 1940 were the first combat-worthy Bre. 693s delivered, and there were now five squadrons to equip: GBA I/51, GBA II/51, GBA I/54, GBA II/54, and GBA II/35 (GBA stood for Groupe de bombardement d'assaut ‚Äì assault bomber squadron), with a theoretical complement of 13 aircraft each. Because of this late delivery, crews were still working up their new machines and developing tactics when the Germans attacked. On 12 May, GBAs I/54 and II/54 performed the Br√©guet's first operational sorties, against German motorized columns in the Maastricht- Tongeren-Bilsen area. German anti-aircraft fire was so devastating that only eight of the eighteen Bre.693s returned. The disastrous results of this first engagement forced the French commanders to reconsider their tactics. Until 15 May, GBA crews performed shallow dive attacks from higher altitude, which resulted in reduced losses, but the attacks had clearly been inaccurate, as the Br√©guet lacked a bombsight, and they increased vulnerability to German fighters. On subsequent missions, the GBAs re-introduced low-level attacks, but with smaller formations. As the position of the French and Allied armies grew steadily more desperate, the assault groups were engaged daily, still enduring losses to anti-aircraft fire, but also increasingly to German fighters. In late June, the Arm√©e de l'Air tried to evacuate its modern aircraft to North Africa, out of German reach, from where many hoped to continue the fight. However, the short-ranged Br√©guets were not able to cross the Mediterranean. Unlike other modern French types, the Br√©guet 690 family saw its combat career end with the Armistice. By this time, 119 aircraft had been lost, including 68 to direct enemy action, and a further 14 were written off as too heavily damaged. The five GBAs had therefore endured a mat√©riel loss rate of 63%, while crew casualties were nearly 50%. After the Armistice, the Vichy authorities were allowed to maintain a small air force in mainland France, and its assault bomber pilots flew rare training flights in the Bre.693 and Bre.695. After the Germans occupied all of France in late 1942, some of the survivors were transferred to Italy for use as operational trainers.

Their origins are mixed, predominantly with Malayo-Indonesians arriving before the 5th century AD, then many centuries later by Arabs, Africans and other ethnic groups. They speak the Merina dialect of the official Malagasy language of Madagascar. The Merina people are most commonly found in the center of the island (former Antananarivo Province). Beginning in the late 18th century, Merina sovereigns expanded the political region under their control from their interior capital, outwards into the island, with their king Radama I ultimately helping unite the island under their rule. The French fought two wars with the Merina people in 1883-1885 and in 1895, colonized Madagascar in 1895‚Äì96 and abolished the Merina monarchy in 1897. They built innovative and elaborate irrigation infrastructure and highly productive rice farms in high plateaus of Madagascar by the 18th century. The Merina people were socially stratified with hierarchical castes, inherited occupations and endogamy, as well as one or two of the major and long serving monarchs of the Merina people were queens. History Austronesian people started settling in Madagascar between 200 and 500 CE. They arrived by boats and were from various southeast Asian groups. Later Swahili-Arabs and Indian traders came to the island's northern regions. African slaves were brought to the island's coasts between the 13th and the 18th centuries. The Portuguese traders were the first Europeans to arrive in the 15th century, followed by other European powers. Traditional region of the Merina people (purple center), relative to other Malagasy ethnic groups. This influx of diverse people led to various Malagasy sub-ethnicities in the mid-2nd millennium. The Merina were probably the early arrivals, though this is uncertain and other ethnic groups on Madagascar consider them relative newcomers to the island. The Merina people's culture likely mixed and merged with the Madagascar natives named Vazimba about whom little is known. According to the island's oral traditions, the \\"most Austronesian looking\\" Merina people reached the interior of the island in the 15th century and established their society there because of wars and migrant pressure at the coast. Merina people were settled in the central Madagascar, formed one of the three major kingdoms on the island by the 18th century ‚Äì the other two being Sakalava kingdom on the west-northwest and Betsimisaraka kingdom on the east-northeast. These early Merina settlers through their industriousness and innovative abilities built vast irrigation projects that helped drain the plateau marshes, irrigate arable lands, and grow rice two times every year. They emerged as the politically dominant group and a wealthy kingdom towards the close of the 18th century. The capital of their kingdom remains the capital of contemporary Madagascar. Oral history traces the emergence of a united kingdom in the central highlands of Madagascar ‚Äì a region called Imerina ‚Äì back to early 16th-century king Andriamanelo. By 1824, a succession of Merina kings had conquered nearly all of Madagascar, particularly through the military strategy, ambitious treaties and political policies of Andrianampoinimerina (circa 1785‚Äì1810) and his son Radama I (1792‚Äì1828). The colonial British empire recognized the sovereignty of the Merina kingdom and its control of the Madagascar island in 1817. Radama I welcomed European traders and allowed Christian missionaries to establish missions on Madagascar. After him, the Merina people were ruled by Queen Ranavalona I ruled from 1828 to 1861, Queen Rasoherina from 1863 to 1868, and Queen Ranavalona II ruled from 1868 to 1885. The Swahili Arab traders expanded their opportunities to trade and European colonial powers such as the French trader Joseph-Fran√ßois Lambert signed a disputed lease with King Radama II for plantation lands for sugarcane cultivation and industries along the Madagascar coastal plains. The Merina people called the Malagasy living along the coasts as Cotier. These operations and plantations were worked by the forced labor of imported slaves. The largest influx of slaves was brought in by the 'Umani Arabs and the French. The Makua people from Mozambique were one of the major victims of this demand, slave capture and export that attempted to satisfy this demand. The slavery was abolished by the French administration in 1896, which adversely impacted the fortunes of Merina and non-Merina operated slave- run plantations.Gwyn Campbell, 'Unfree labour, slavery and protest in imperial Madagascar' in Alpers, Campbell, Salman (eds.), Resisting Bondage in Indian Ocean Africa and Asia, Taylor & Francis, 2007, 49‚Äì59. The dominance of the Merina kingdom over all of Madagascar came to an end with the first Franco- Hova War of 1883 to 1885, triggered by the disputed lease signed by Radama II. At the war's end, Madagascar ceded Antsiranana (Di√©go Suarez) on the northern coast to France and paid 560,000 gold francs to the heirs of Joseph-Fran√ßois Lambert, a Frenchman who had been promised lucrative trade privileges under King Radama II that had later been revoked. The French declared Madagascar as a protectorate in 1894, which the then Merina Queen refused to sign to. The Second Franco-Hova War followed in 1895, when the French military landed in Mahajanga (Majunga) and marched by way of the Betsiboka River to the capital, Antananarivo, taking the city's defenders by surprise. In 1896, the French annexed Madagascar, and in 1897 the Merina people became the residents of the colony of French Madagascar. In early 20th century, the Merina people led an anti-French nationalist movement. The group, based in Antananarivo, was led by a Malagasy Protestant clergyman, Pastor Ravelojoana. A secret society dedicated to affirming Malagasy cultural identity was formed in 1913, calling itself Iron and Stone Network (in local language, Vy Vato Sakelika ‚Äì VVS). Repressed at first with numerous arrests over 1915 and 1916, the movement re- emerged in the 1920s through communists who gained concessions by partnering with the French Left in France. A famine in 1943-44 led to an open rebellion in Madagascar. The 1946 constitution of the French Fourth Republic made Madagascar a territoire d'outre-mer (overseas territory) within the French Union. Madagascar gained full independence in 1958 as the Malagasy Republic. The Merina people faced competition from other ethnic groups. The first president of the Republic, Philibert Tsiranana, was a coastal Malagasy of Tsimihety ethnicity, and he was able to consolidate his power with a winner- takes-all system, while the Merina nationalists of the Congress Party for the Independence of Madagascar was weakened by rifts between leftist and ultranationalist factions. The Merina form much of the elite and educated middle-class of Madagascar. They are influential in the economy, universities and government organizations of Madagascar. Language Flag of the Merina people (since 1997)Merina local flag (Madagascar). Flags of the World (2015-05-20). Retrieved on 2017-10-17. The Merina dialect of the Malagasy language, also called as Hova or Malagasy Plateau or just Malagasy, is spoken natively by about a quarter of the population of Madagascar; it is classified as Plateau Malagasy alongside the Betsileo, Bezanozano, Sihanaka, Tanala, Vakinankaritra dialects.Malagasy, Plateau, Ethnologue The Hova is one of two official languages alongside French in the 2010 constitution putting in place the Fourth Republic. Previously, under the 2007 constitution, Malagasy was one of three official languages alongside French and English. Merina is the national language of Madagascar. An estimated 7.5 million people were fluent in this language in 2011, according to Ethnologue. It is written in Latin script, introduced by the Christian missionaries. Merina is the language of instruction in all public schools through grade five for all subjects, and remains the language of instruction through high school for the subjects of history and Malagasy language. Religion King Radama I welcomed Christian missionaries to establish missions on Madagascar in the 1810s. The Merina nobles were along the first to convert to Christianity. The London Missionary Society established numerous missions along the coast of Madagascar in the 1820s. Those who converted were offered scholarships in London and apprenticeship in Manchester. Due to the influence of British missionaries, the Merina upper classes converted to Protestantism entirely in the mid-19th century, following the example of their queen, Ranavalona II. The early spread of Protestantism among the Merina elite resulted in a degree of class and ethnic differentiation among practitioners of Christianity. The French preferred Catholic interpreters and the former slaves of the Merina people converted to Catholicism. The ruling and noble class, however was Protestant. The nobility attempted to intervene, by expelling certain Christian missions. This dynamic ultimately created religious sect divisions in contemporary demographics.Fenella Cannell, \\"How Does Ritual Matter?\\" in: Rita Astuti, Jonathan Parry, Charles Stafford (eds.), Questions of Anthropology, Volume 76 of London School of Economics Monographs on Social Anthropology, 2007 [books.google.ch/books?id=66Ld6SyR4hkC&pg;=PA121 p. 121]. Society and culture=Social stratification Among all the Malagasy ethnicities, the Merina historically have had a highly stratified caste system.Report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, including its causes and consequences, Gulnara Shahinian (December 2012), A/HRC/24/43/Add.2, United Nations General Assembly, Twenty-fourth session, page 4 The overall society, like many ethnic groups in Africa, had two category of people, the free locally called the fotsy who had ancestors with Asian Malagasy physiognomy, and the serfs or mainty who had ancestors with African physiognomy mostly captured in other parts of Madagascar. However, the fotsy-mainty dichotomy among Merina is not based on physiognomy, states Karen Middleton, but whether they have a family tomb: fotsy have family tomb, mainty are those without one or those who have established a recent tomb. The Merine people were divided into three strata: the Andriana (nobles), the Hova (freemen), and the lowest strata called Andevo (slaves)., Quote: \\"Historically, Merina had the most stratified caste system in Africa (...)\\" Each strata had been then hierarchically subdivided. The Andriana are divided into six sub-strata, each had an inherited occupation, and were endogamous. The nineteenth century records show that Andevo or slaves were imported blacks, and they constituted about a third of the Merina society. The Merina society sold highland slaves to both Muslim and European slave traders on Madagascar coast, as well as bought East African and southeast African slaves from them for their own plantations between 1795 and 1895. Marriage and any sexual relations between the fotsy and mainty were a taboo. According to a 2012 report by Gulnara Shahinian ‚Äì the United Nation's Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, the descendants of former slave castes continue to suffer in contemporary Madagascar Merina society, and inter-caste marriages socially ostracized.Report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, including its causes and consequences, Gulnara Shahinian (December 2012), A/HRC/24/43/Add.2, United Nations General Assembly, Twenty-fourth session, pages 3-4, 16 Ritual and folklore The Vazimba feature prominently in Merina oral history and popular imagination. It has been speculated that the Vazimba were the original population of Madagascar, descended from Southeast Asian seafarers who may have had pygmy physical characteristics. Among some Malagasy, the Vazimba are not believed to be human at all, but rather a form of supernatural creature possessing magical powers (mahery). In the first seven years of their lives, boys are typically circumcised in a ritual wherein relatives request the blessings and protection of the ancestors. The Merina people also ritually kill their cattle with unusual violence, cook and consume beef prepared thereafter ceremoniously. The Merina believe their land to be tanin'drazana (the land of the ancestors) and show reverence to their ancestors by burying them in family tombs typically located in the ancestral village of origin. Many believe that ancestors can intervene in events on Earth, for good or for ill, and this belief shapes the actions and thoughts of many Malagasy. Cuisine A Merina woman selling Kakapizon (left, a fried snack) and chips in Antananarivo. The cuisine of the Merina is so heavily dominated by rice that the term for eating a meal is simply \\"to eat rice\\". This staple of the diet is so central to the Merina that it is considered to be masina, or holy, and a common Merina belief holds that the eating of rice is the key to moral behaviour, and the French who occupied Merina lands were often looked down upon for eating bread over rice.Bloch, M. (1985). Almost Eating the Ancestors. Man, 20(4), 631‚Äì646. Beef also plays a large part in the Merina diet, and according to Merina oral history, it was a servant of King Ralambo who discovered that cows were edible and shared this knowledge with the king, who in turn informed the rest of his kingdom. Livelihoods Rice, cassave and potatoes are staple crops of the Merina people. They also grow onions and other supplements, while cattle, pigs and animal husbandry is also a significant occupation. Many Merina people have moved into urban areas, where they operate factories and run businesses.

Embu served as the provincial capital of the former Eastern Province and currently serves as the headquarters of the Eastern Region in Kenya. It is also the county headquarters of Embu County. Located on the south-eastern foothills of Mount Kenya, the Municipality of Embu had a population of 64,979 in 2019 census. It is the commercial hub of the Central Eastern part of Kenya and provides an avenue for trade, tourism and highway transit between the national capital and the Northern Frontier.  History  Embu town is a major trading centre in Eastern Kenya. For a long time, it was the main economic center for the Embu, Mbeere and Kamba communities as well as other communities from central Kenya.

They moved south to Congo. Then they later moved Eastward to the coast of Kenya via Tanganyika. It is in Tanganyika that there were intermarriages with both natives and migrants from farther south (mostly Bantus). Due to many circumstances they moved North towards Meru leaving their relatives, the Gikuyu at Ithanga. They then crossed Igambang'ombe ford. They settled at Gikuuri near Maranga hills. They had come from Igembe and came to Tharaka where they also settled. They left Tharaka possibly due to famines and moved to the current Embu. It is believed as they moved towards the slopes of Mt Kenya, they encountered pygmy tribes such as the Gumba and the Zimba in the forest; some of whom were cannibalistic. They are cultivaters. They planted crops like sorghum, millet and sweet potatoes. Today they have cash crops like coffee, tea and macadamia, among others.

It is notable for its authentic depiction of teenagers, and was among the first YA books to take the genre in a more realistic direction. This dual perspective novel gives the reader two different sides to a story about such an important man. The two main characters, teenagers Lorraine and John, have opposite personalities and together create a powerful narrative. This book would go on to win numerous awards, including the New York Times Outstanding Book of 1968, the ALA Notable Children's Book 1940‚Äì1970 the Horn Book 1969 Fanfare Honor List. The novel is frequently assigned in elementary schools, middle schools, and some high schools for English classes. Although commonly taught, this book has been banned in certain areas for numerous reasons, some including offensive language and sexual themes. The book's sequel, The Pigman's Legacy, was published in 1980. The Pigman & Me, an autobiography by Paul Zindel, was first published in 1990; it is considered an unofficial triquel to The Pigman. Zindel wrote a screenplay, adapting the book for the stage and screen, but it was not taken up by any filmmaker. Significance of the title The story of The Pigman describes the life and hardships of Angelo Pignati. Being portrayed as a simple old man, his life is more interesting and gratifying than seen at his first appearance. His nickname comes from his collection of pig statues, his prized possessions. Plot summary The novel begins with an \\"oath\\" signed by John Conlan and Lorraine Jensen, two high school sophomores, who pledge that they will report only the facts about their experiences with Mr. Pignati. When John, Lorraine, and two teen troublemakers, Norton Kelly and Dennis Kobin, are bored, they make prank phone calls. The goal of the game is to see who can stay on the phone the longest. When it is Lorraine's turn, she picks out Mr. Pignati's phone number and pretends to be calling from a charity. After she wins the game, Mr. Pignati offers to donate ten dollars. Against Lorraine's better judgment, she and John travel to Pignati's house to collect the funds. After hesitantly accepting \\"The Pigman's\\" offer of going to the zoo, a friendship begins to blossom between the three of them. He begins to take on the role of a parental figure for the two teenagers, something neither of them has. John and Lorraine's visits become increasingly frequent, and during one such visit, they discover a document inside his room. After reading it, they realize The Pigman has been lying about where his wife has been. His wife, Conchetta, is dead, instead of being on vacation as The Pigman has stated numerous times. Soon, John and Lorraine visit The Pigman daily after school, and he showers them with gifts, food, and most importantly, the love and attention they do not receive in their own joyless homes. They reveal to him that they were never affiliated with any charity, and he reveals what they already know: that his wife is dead. Pignati gives each of the two a pair of roller skates. Getting a pair for himself also, the three of them could not be happier, until one afternoon. Mr. Pignati suffers a heart attack while he and the teens are playing tag with roller skates. He is sent to the hospital, and John and Lorraine agree to take care of his house while he recovers. While they are doing so, they resemble a married couple. Between the responsibilities and numerous chores, they love being inside the house. They begin to even acquire feelings for one another, and John begins to care about his appearance. Having an empty house to themselves, the kids decide to have a party and invite a few people over. The situation quickly turns into a drunken, boisterous party with more visitors than the two anticipated. The partygoers destroy the house, not caring what they break. Lorraine's friend rips Conchetta Pignati's wedding dress in a drunken accident after putting it on. Norton ransacks Mr. Pignati's house in hopes of finding valuables and destroys Conchetta's collection of porcelain pigs, which Mr. Pignati holds very dear. John beats Norton in retaliation. Mr. Pignati returns to find his house ransacked, and is incredibly hurt when he finds out John and Lorraine were responsible for the incident. The police are called, and John and Lorraine believe they will get arrested, but The Pigman does not press charges. They try to go back into the house and apologize, but the officer tells them Mr. Pignati is crying and that they need to go home. After going home, Lorraine is beaten by her mother and John's parents say they are getting him therapy, which will never happen. Feeling terrible, the two offer to take Pignati to the zoo to help make up for the destruction of his house. When they arrive at the zoo to visit Bobo the baboon, Mr. Pignati's favourite animal and buddy, they learn the creature has died. Overcome with grief and the heaviness of the recent events, Mr. Pignati suffers from cardiac arrest and dies, leaving John and Lorraine grieving and reflecting on the fragility of life. John tells Lorraine to wait outside of the area where he died, fearing that her mother would hit her in punishment for creating the situation. They blame themselves for Pignati's death and believe that he would have been better off never meeting them in the first place. John and Lorraine write their story down. Themes Peer pressure This story goes into the idea of peer pressure on numerous occasions. First is the phone call Lorraine made to Mr. Pignati. She did not want to keep the conversation going and felt as if she was not doing the right thing. Her friends kept pressuring her to continue the conversation and so she did. When she and John, later on, go to visit him after their scheme of collecting money for charity, Lorraine has the same feeling of guilt. She does not want to take money from this poor old man and says to John how it is wrong. Not listening to her at all, he pressures her into taking the money and keeping silent about the truth. Finally, John and Lorraine are pressured into having a party at the house. This results in the destruction of all of his possessions and him ultimately feeling broken. With peer pressure running high in this story, many of the characters were unable to speak their own opinions and were afraid to stand up against the crowd. Whether it is Lorraine afraid to stand up against John, or John afraid to stand up to his friends, the main characters are reluctant in speaking their true emotions. The pressure given to them by a massive audience becomes the reason for the downfall of their great friend, The Pigman. Loss The occurrence of losing loved ones and loved possessions are frequent throughout the novel. It begins with The Pigman's loss of his collection of pigs and his wife's dress. Both these items were very important to him, letting him remember a time of peace and happiness. When they were both destroyed, he lost a huge part of who he was. The Pigman also loses his best friend, Bobo. His death at the zoo was too much for this man, resulting in a heart attack that killed him. His death was the kids losing their dear friend, but also their innocence. The loss of their friend and watching him die was a hugely traumatic experience for them, whether they acknowledge it or not. Losing a friend is a very difficult thing for a person to go through. It becomes even harder when you lose a friend and believe that it is your fault. The amount of terrible and shocking experiences Lorraine and John put The Pigman through were too much for him, especially because of his old age. His last stitch of happiness died along with Bobo, leaving him a shell of his former self. When he finally died, his death was a loss to the kids, but not to himself, because he had been unhappy. Family and Parenting Throughout the story, both John and Lorraine do not know a parental figure. Physically both of them have parents (John having his mother and father, Lorraine having her mother), but mentally they are not there for them. John's parents do not care what he does and are very self-centered. Both let him smoke and drink and show him that there will be no repercussions for his actions. This makes John take part in troublesome actions, simply trying to get his parents' attention. While his efforts fail each time, he does not give up, and ironically only rebels in such a harsh manner wishing his parents paid attention to him. Lorraine only lives with her mother, due to her father leaving them a long time ago. Her mother is not a great parental figure, mocking and ridiculing her daughter constantly throughout the story. Her mother's abusive nature strikes fear into Lorraine. She knows if she does anything wrong she will be hit as a repercussion. This is shown when Lorraine states, \\"She came towards me, and I backed away until I was cornered by the wall. Then she raised her arm and slapped me once across the face. She tried to hit me again, but my arm went up and blocked her.\\" Death Whether physically or emotionally, death recurs throughout this novel. The most apparent sense of death in this novel is physical. Numerous characters in this story die. Some of these include The Pigman, his wife, Lorraine's mother's patients, Lorraine's father, Bobo, and John's Aunt Ahra. While some of these deaths are treated as non-important information, they are all tragic. Losing someone who you are close to or even someone you just know can take a toll on any individual. This story portrays this message with the final physical death in the story, with Mr. Pignati. His death caused a break in not only the story, but in the two main characters John and Lorraine. This leads to the cause of emotional death in the novel. John and Lorraine have been through a traumatic and life-changing experience seeing this man die. Even though he was older his death was shocking and unexpected to them. This death of a fatherlike figure to these children emotionally traumatized them, causing a part of their innocence to die along with the Pigman. This emotional death is similar to that of Lorraine's mother. Her emotional distress after witnessing her husband cheat has caused her to become a bitter person and a different person. Emotionally a part of her died when she found out about her husband's affair and when he died. This novel breaks down the motif of death on a physical and emotional level. Characters *John Conlan (Bathroom Bomber) - the male protagonist who narrates the odd-numbered chapters. John is something of an anti-hero, as he uses his intelligence, looks, and charm for personal gain. He aspires to be an actor, but fuels his creativity with pranks, though most of them are benign. While writing his sections of the story, he uses symbols such as @#$% instead of cursing. His parents are both physically there, but mentally do not care what he does. This is the reason for his constant use of cigarettes and alcohol. He is trying to get his parents' attention by acting out. This is usually to no avail, as they show interest for a little while and then things go back to normal. His biggest stunt of throwing a party at The Pigman's house did not even grasp the attention of his parents, as they nonchalantly said they are taking him to a therapist, knowing it will never happen. *Lorraine Jensen - the female protagonist, who narrates the even-numbered chapters. Lorraine aspires to be a writer or psychologist, and her sensitive, analytical nature provides a counterbalance to John's impulsiveness. She is socially awkward, different, and has low self-esteem. Although not overweight, she is constantly ridiculed by her mother for her weight and abused when doing something wrong. Kids in her class do not make fun of her due to her friendship with John. The girls in their class are amazed that a girl like Lorraine could be best friends with a guy like John, being that they are opposites. This is why John tells Lorraine to stay outside when The Pigman dies, so her mother does not have a reason to abuse her. Since her father ran out on them, Lorraine's mother is very angry in regards to most men. Being a single mother has not only put a huge toll on her but her daughter since she has to take over a great deal of the workload. This has made her more mature in comparison to the people she associates herself with, including John. *Angelo Pignati (The Pigman) - an elderly widower who lives in a messy house in John and Lorraine's neighborhood. His nickname comes from his last name, as well as his vast collection of ceramic pigs. Lonely since the death of his wife, his friendship with John and Lorraine fills a void in his life. The Pigman also finds Lorraine and John to be quite generous and admires them. He treats them like children, as they fill his void of being alone. Throughout the story, The Pigman plays games with the children and teaches them small lessons, such as how to remember a list of items. One of Mr. Pignati's only friends before John and Lorraine is a baboon at a local zoo named Bobo. He would visit the baboon constantly and feed him peanuts, saying that it was his favorite snack. The party which destroyed his house caused The Pigman to become increasingly ill. The loss of important objects such as his pig collection and wife's wedding dress were too much for him. After the death of his best friend, Bobo, he had a heart attack which ultimately killed him. *Bore - John's father. Bore is a commodities trader and although the stress of the job is detrimental to his health, he still pressures John to follow in his footsteps. He was a heavy drinker until he developed cirrhosis of the liver. One of John's lifelong goals is to become an actor, but his father refuses and forces him to be a businessman. Since Bore is constantly not paying his son any attention, he rebels in hopes that his father will correct him, but it never happens. Any interest is shown because of the negatives John does, and this attention is minimal. * The Old Lady - John's mother. It is suggested that she may have obsessive-compulsive disorder, as she is fixated on cleaning, which she uses as a coping mechanism for the tension between her husband and son. John often feels as if she cares more for inanimate objects than she cares for him. *Norton Kelly - a classmate of John and Lorraine, and the main antagonist. Described as a barbarian by the protagonists, Norton spends much of his time stealing and is convinced there are valuables inside the Pignati household. His entering the house ultimately leads to the destruction of all the pig items that The Pigman knows and loves. Norton does not reappear in the Pigman's Legacy but he is briefly referenced when a train with graffiti saying \\"Norton Was Here\\" is seen, which aggravates John. *Dennis Kobin - Norton's follower. He is best friends with Norton and plays a minor role in the novel. *Lorraine's mother - She is critical of her daughter, accuses her of being fat, and constantly tells her \\"you're not a pretty girl, Lorraine.\\" After she discovered that her husband was cheating on her, she filed for divorce; later he died. She never got over that, and now she thinks that all men are evil. She constantly warns Lorraine against men and boys, saying \\"they have only one thing on their mind.\\" The loss of her husband was hard for both of them and is a huge reason for her mother being so judgmental. She and Lorraine later reconcile. *Bobo - the baboon that the Pigman goes to see constantly when visiting the zoo. The Pigman has a great deal of love for this monkey, as he is one of the few living creatures he can look forward to seeing. He always feeds Bobo and makes sure that he is completely comfortable in his environment. His death later on in the story is something The Pigman cannot handle, as the animal has been one of his greatest friends for a very long time. The death of Bobo resembles the loss of hope in the eyes of The Pigman, as he has truly lost everyone and everything close to him. * Kenneth Conlan-John's older brother.

Flor√©al is capable of operating helicopters up to the size of the Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma. The ship has a complement of 90 including the aircrew and officers and 24 marines with capacity for a further 13 personnel.  Construction and career  Flor√©al was ordered as part of the first pair on 20 January 1989 from Chantiers de l'Atlantique for construction at their yard in Saint-Nazaire, France and the keel was laid down on 2 April 1990. The frigate was built using modular construction methods which reduced the vessel's construction time. Flor√©al was launched on 6 October 1990 and commissioned into the French Navy on 27 May 1992. Following sea trials, Flor√©al sailed for Arsenal de Lorient, Lorient where the weapons and sensors were installed and underwent further trials. After entering service, Flor√©al was assigned to the French Pacific territories, based at R√©union, monitoring of the exclusive economic zone in the French Southern and Antarctic Lands. In October 1995, one week after Bob Denard overthrew the government of the Comoros in late September, French commandos using the frigate as a base of operations, landed in the island and arrested Denard. In 2002, Flor√©als helicopter drove off pirates that were attacking the Lebanese vessel Princess Sarah off Somalia. In 2003, Flor√©al underwent a major overhaul at Papeete, Tahiti. On 17 March 2009, Flor√©al contacted the private yacht Tanit, which was sailing for Kenya, about entering the Gulf of Aden and the dangers of piracy. The owners of the yacht, Florent and Chlo√´ Lema√ßon, decided to continue on their journey. The frigate escorted the yacht until 20 March, when the frigate was not allowed to go any farther. On 4 April, Tanit was seized by pirates off the coast of Ras Hafun, Somalia and those aboard taken hostage. Flor√©al took part in the action that led to the release of Tanit during which one of the hostages and two of the pirates were killed. On 5 December 2014, the frigate searched three vessels illegally fishing near Juan de Nova Island. Shark fins without carcasses were found and as a result of fishery products were destroyed. On 10 October 2017, while at the port of Durban, South Africa, Flor√©al was struck by a container ship that had broke its hawsers during a storm and drifted into the frigate. The frigate was seriously damaged. The ship was repaired at Mauritius. In 2018, the frigate was assigned to Combined Task Force 150 (CTF 150), intercepting drug smuggling in the Indian Ocean. Flor√©al seized of cannabis after searching two dhows off Oman. In 2019, the vessel joined CTF 150 again and intercepted of cannabis. On 28 May 2019, the frigate moved to inspect an un-flagged dhow in the Indian Ocean. During the inspection, of heroin was found and seized.

Their population in 2003 stood at 1,100. Ethnically related to the Tibetans, they speak Layakha, a Tibeto-Burman language. Layaps refer to their homeland as Be-yul ‚Äì \\"the hidden land.\\" Dress The dress of the Layap is similar to the Tibetan costume, except for a few differences. While men wear the Bhutanese costume, which consists of a silk or linen garment that is typically colored saffron and red (cf. gho), the women wear black woolen jackets, which reach right down to the ankles. A blue pattern band may also be found at the bottom of their long sleeves. Religion Owing to Tibetan influence, the Layap practice a mixture of Bon and Tibetan Buddhism. According to legend, Laya village is the spot where Ngawang Namgyal, the founder of Bhutan, first entered the country. Particularly unique among the Layap is the extensive tradition of \\"living defilements\\" (Dzongkha: soen drep), whereby a ritually impure person is ostracized from social activities. The Layap shun \\"living defilements\\" in order not to anger deities, and to avoid physical maladies and livestock plagues. Among ritually impure acts are birth, divorce, and death, including the death of a horse. Lifestyle Located near the Tibetan border, the Layap have traditionally engaged in trade. Nowadays that includes the smuggling of bootleg Chinese blankets and plastic goods which are embargoed by the Bhutanese government, but in much demand by Bhutanese villagers. Traditionally, the Layap lived a semi-nomadic lifestyle, who rearing yaks and dzos, although in recent times small ponies may also be found in the area. Owing to the cold weather at this altitude, few crops can be planted, except for some grasses. Layaps also traditionally pick cordyceps, valuable traditionally medicinal and magical fungi native to the region. With Bhutan's increased environmental protection, Layaps and rural farmers face more challenges protecting their livestock from natural predators, particularly leopards. Layap people also participate in the heavy labor to drain Thorthormi, a glacial lake prone to GLOF flooding. Flooding is a particularly serious threat to the Layap way of life, heavily dependent on livestock and sparse water resources. Until the 1980s, the Layap lived in near-complete isolation from the world, except for occasional visits to Thimphu or Punakha, which was a five-day walk. Since the new millennium, Laya has been visited by tourists from all over the world. One can see beautifully painted houses fitted with solar panels, and the construction of new schools for the impoverished children. Most villagers are now able to abandon the village in the winter and return in the springtime. Many Layaps now live in permanent settlements complete with modern amenities ‚Äì from toilets to mobile phones and televisions ‚Äì thanks to disposable incomes from business and trade. Increasingly, Layap children are attending Bhutanese schools. Though somewhat modernized, Layaps and other tribal peoples of Bhutan remain a curiosity to the majority of the native population, many of whom lead much more modernized lives. The government encourages pride among Bhutan's tribal groups, and cites them as an example of humans successfully living in harmony with nature. In traditional Layap culture, casual sex is commonplace and accepted among both males and females, unmarried and married. As a consequence, Layap communities face enormous exposure to syphilis, gonorrhoea, and hepatitis B. Although condoms were somewhat available, almost no Layaps reported safer sex practices through 2009, a trend the government hopes to buffet. Marriage and family The Layap are known for their tradition of polyandry, practiced to keep families and property together, although the custom now in decline. The Layap also have a tradition of child marriage, with brides as young as 10 years old. Layap women speaking to media anticipate the increase in schooling among their daughters will result in a decline in child marriages. Many Layap women find healthcare difficult to access during pregnancy due to isolated settlements and nomadic lifestyles. Among the foremost concerns for Layap women is prenatal care.

Although it is surrounded by a 'green belt' of farms, Albion Park had a population of 13,316 at the . The Illawarra escarpment is to the west, Dapto is to the north, Jamberoo is to the south and Shellharbour is to the east.  History  On 9 January 1821, the area around Albion Park was part of a grant of land of over 2000 acres given to Samuel Terry, a former convict who became one of the richest men in New South Wales. Terry owned and operated the Terry's Meadows Estate, which operated as a cattle stud. In 1834, Terry suffered from a stroke and died in 1838. The land was inherited by Samuel Terry's nephew, John Terry Hughes. Hughes renamed the site to Albion Park. The township began to grow around the centre of the estate. For European settlers, this had been a natural meeting place as it was where the road from Wollongong in the north crossed the road from the timber industry in Calderwood and Tongarra in the west as it ran out towards the port at Shellharbour. The arrival of the railway line in 1887, and the completion of the road through Macquarie Pass to the Southern Highlands, hastened the town's growth.

The frigate is the fourth ship of its class, and the first French vessel named after Vent√¥se, the fifth month of the Republican Calendar. The ship was constructed by Chantiers de l'Atlantique at Saint-Nazaire, France in 1991‚Äì1992 and entered service in 1993. Vent√¥se is stationed in the French Caribbean Sea territories for patrol duties. Design and description The s were designed in response to a demand for a cheap warship capable of operating in low threat areas and able to perform general patrol functions. As a result, the Flor√©al class were constructed to mercantile standards in the areas of ammunition stowage, helicopter facilities and damage control, which significantly lowered the cost of the vessels. The Flor√©al class were designed for using modular construction which shortened their building times. Vent√¥se has a standard displacement of and at full load. The frigate measures long between perpendiculars and overall with a beam of and a draught of . Due to the frigate's broad beam, the ship is equipped with fin stabilisers. The frigate is powered by a combined diesel and diesel (CODAD) system comprising four SEMT Pielstick 6 PA6 L280 BPC diesel engines driving two shafts each turning a LIPS controllable pitch propeller. The CODAD system is rated at The vessel is also equipped with one bow thruster. Due to the mercantile construction design, the four diesels are all located within one machinery room for ease of maintenance. Both diesel fuel and TR5 aviation fuel is brought aboard at a single location at the stern compared to naval- constructed vessels which sport two. The ship also has three diesel-electric generators located just fore and aft of the machinery room. Vent√¥se has a maximum speed of and a range of at . Vent√¥se was armed with two Exocet MM38 surface-to-surface missiles in launchers situated centrally atop the midships superstructure. However, at the end of the missile's life cycle in 2014, the launchers were removed as the French Navy did not intend to replace the capability aboard the ships. The ship also mounts one 100 mm CADAM turret with the Najir fire control system located forwards and two 20 mm mod√®le F2 guns situated in atop the aft superstructure. The ship is equipped with DRBV-21C (Mars) air sentry, Racal Decca RM1290 navigation and Racal Decca RM1290 landing radars along with ARBG-1A Sa√Øgon communications intercept, CSF ARBR 16A radar intercept electronic surveillance systems and two Dagaie decoy systems. The frigate is equipped with a helicopter landing pad located on the stern and a hangar. The ship is capable of operating the embarked Eurocopter AS565 Panther up to sea state 5. Vent√¥se is capable of operating helicopters up to the size of the Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma. The ship has a complement of 90 including the aircrew and officers and 24 marines with capacity for a further 13 personnel.  Construction and career  Vent√¥se was ordered as part of the second pair on 9 January 1990 from Chantiers de l'Atlantique for construction at their yard in Saint-Nazaire, France and the keel was laid down on 28 June 1991. The frigate was built using modular construction methods which reduced the vessel's construction time. Vent√¥se was launched on 14 March 1992 and commissioned into the French Navy on 5 May 1993. Following sea trials, Vent√¥se sailed for Arsenal de Lorient, Lorient where the weapons and sensors were installed and underwent further trials. Vent√¥se is stationed in the Caribbean Sea to patrol French oversea territories in the region. The vessel was assigned to the French Antilles, stationed at Martinique. In 2005, in the aftermath of the Hurricane Katrina disaster in the United States, the frigate was offered as part of the French response. However, the United States declined France's offer. In June 2009, Vent√¥se took part in the recovery operation for the Air France Flight 447 which crashed some off the northeast coast of Brazil. A sailor aboard Vent√¥se tracks a surface contact during an exercise supporting FRUKUS 2011 On 6 and 7 January 2012, Vent√¥se intercepted two sailboats, Jo Ann Moore and Sangria, off Guadeloupe. Jo Ann Moore was stopped first and searched, with its four crew apprehended. Leaving a small party aboard the sailboat, the frigate made off to the southwest to catch up with the second sailboat, Sangria. The three crew members on board Sangria were arrested and 45 bundles comprising of cocaine were seized. On 30 November 2012, Vent√¥se was alerted to the presence of a smuggler's go-fast boat by an American patrol aircraft. The smugglers were forcibly stopped and three crew were arrested along with the seizure of of cocaine. In June 2015, the frigate stopped a go-fast boat and seized of marijuana. On 3‚Äì4 June, Vent√¥se moved to intercept the Anguillan-flagged coastal trading vessel Lady Margaret, suspected of smuggling. Lady Margaret was stopped without incident and the boarding party from Vent√¥se uncovered of marijuana, which was destroyed. In September 2017, Vent√¥se, with sister ship , was deployed to Saint Martin after the island was hit by Hurricane Irma. From October to November 2018, Vent√¥se trained with the Guyana Defence Force, then stopping at Bel√©m, Brazil before spending the rest of the time off West Africa as part of Operation Corymbe, the permanent French mission to the Gulf of Guinea. On 26‚Äì27 May 2019 Vent√¥se intercepted a suspected smuggling go-fast boat off Dominica. Two smugglers were arrested and of cocaine was seized.

It is located and about south of Castletown. The stone has been claimed as the grave stone of Ljot Thorfinnsson, the 10th century earl of Orkney. At about from ground level, however, it seems rather taller than anything the 10th century Norse are likely to have used. It is one of the more impressive standing stones in Caithness and has mass and size to compare with those of the Ring of Brodgar in Orkney. Also it is one of two stones, of which the second is now fallen, about from the first. When erect the second is supposed to have been behind the first as seen from the direction of the northern hemisphere summer solstice sunset. In The Standing Stones of Caithness (2003) Leslie J Myatt gives the alignment of the stones as 322 degrees, from the fallen stone to the still standing stone. Leslie J Myatt, The Standing Stones of Caithness, 2003 This alignment may appear to suggest a summer solstice sunset which is too far north for the latitude. However, at about , the altitude of the stones is quite high with respect to an Atlantic horizon which is visible on this bearing. The sunset alignment differs from that of Maeshowe, a chambered cairn in Orkney, which is built so that sunlight will penetrate the cairn at the time of the winter solstice sunset. The name of Ljot is very close to that of Lot or Loth, the mythic King of Orkney and Lothian in Arthurian legend, and in Celtic Myths and Legends (1912), Charles Squire identifies Lot as a late incarnation of a British god who is remembered in medieval Welsh legend as Lludd Llaw Eraint. (Gresham, Celtic Myths and Legends, 1912, page 359 as republished by Paragon 1998, ) Modern scholars are more skeptical of this connection.

Studium generale is the old customary name for a medieval university in medieval Europe. Overview There is no official definition for the term studium generale. The term studium generale first appeared at the beginning of the 13th century out of customary usage, and meant a place where students from everywhere were welcomed, not merely those of the local district or region.Rashdall, Hastings. The Universities of Europe in the Middle Ages: Salerno. Bologna. Paris. Vol. 1. Clarendon Press, 1895, 8. In the 13th century, the term gradually acquired a more precise (but still unofficial) meaning as a place that (1) received students from all places, (2) taught the arts and had at least one of the higher faculties (that is, theology, law or medicine) and (3) that a significant part of the teaching was done by masters.Rashdall, 9. A fourth criterion slowly appeared: a master who had taught and was registered in the Guild of Masters of a Studium Generale was entitled to teach in any other studium without further examination. That privilege, known as jus ubique docendi, was, by custom, reserved only to the masters of the three oldest universities: Salerno, Bologna and Paris. Their reputations were so great that their graduates and teachers were welcome to teach in all other studia, but they accepted no outside teachers without an examination. Pope Gregory IX, who, seeking to elevate the prestige of the papal-sponsored University of Toulouse, which he had founded in 1229, issued a bull in 1233, allowing Masters of Toulouse to teach in any studium without an examination. It consequently became customary for studia generalia, eager to elevate themselves, to apply for similar bulls. The older universities at first disdained requesting such privileges themselves, feeling their reputation was sufficient. However, Bologna and Paris eventually stooped down to apply for them too, receiving their papal bulls in 1292.Rashdall, 11‚Äì12. Arguably, the most coveted feature of the papal bulls was the special exemption, instituted by Pope Honorius III in 1219, which allowed teachers and students to continue reaping the fruits of any clerical benefices they might have elsewhere. That dispensed them from the residency requirements set out in Canon Law.Rashdall, 12. As this privilege was granted only to those in studia generalia, certainly routinely by the 14th century, it began to be considered by many to be not only another (fifth) criterion but the definition of a studium generale\\" . (Although the old universities of Oxford and Padua, which resisted asking for a papal bull, had sufficient reputation to be referred to as studium generale without a bull, Oxford masters were not allowed to teach in Paris without examination. Oxford reciprocated by demanding examinations from Paris masters and ignoring the papal privileges Paris enjoyed.) Finally, the pope could issue bulls guaranteeing the autonomy of the university from the interference of local civil or diocesan authorities, a process that had begun with the issuing of the 1231 bull for the University of Paris. Although not a necessary criterion, to bestow the \\"privileges of Paris\\" to other studia generalia became customary. The pope was not the only supplier of privileges. The Holy Roman Emperor also issued imperial charters granting much the same privileges, starting with the University of Naples in 1224. A universal student body, one or more higher faculties, teaching by masters, the right to teach in other Studia, retention of benefices, autonomy: those were common features in studia generalia. In other respects (structure, administration, curriculum etc.), studia generalia varied. Generally speaking, most tended to copy one of two old models: the student-centred system of Bologne or the master-centered structure of Paris.  History  Studium generale of Alcal√° de Henares (May 20, 1293). Most of the early studia generalia were found in Italy, France, England, Spain and Portugal, and these were considered the most prestigious places of learning in Europe. The Vatican continues to designate many new universities as studia generalia, although the popular significance of this honour has declined over the centuries. As early as the 13th century, scholars from a studium generale were encouraged to give lecture courses at other institutes across Europe and to share documents, and this led to the current academic culture seen in modern European universities. The universities generally considered as studia generalia in the 13th century were: * University of Bologna (founded in 1088) * University of Oxford (founded in 1167) * University of Cambridge (founded in 1209) * University of Paris (founded in 1215) * University of Arezzo (founded in 1215) * University of Salamanca (founded in 1218) * University of Padua (founded in 1222) * University of Naples Federico II (founded in 1224) * University of Toulouse (founded in 1229) * University of Northampton (founded in 1261, closed in 1265) * University of Siena (founded in 1240) * University of Valladolid (founded in 1241) * University of Salerno (uncertain) * University of Montpellier (founded in 1289) * University of Coimbra (founded in Lisbon in 1290) * University of Alcal√° (founded in Alcal√° de Henares on May 20, 1293) Both theological and secular universities were registered. This list quickly grew as new universities were founded throughout Europe. Many of these universities received formal confirmation of their status as studia generalia towards the end of the 13th century by way of papal bull, along with a host of newer universities. While these papal bulls initially did little more than confer the privileges of a specified university such as Bologna or Paris, by the end of the 13th century universities sought a papal bull conferring on them ius ubique docendi, the privilege of granting to masters licences to teach in all universities without further examination (Haskins, 1941:282). Universities officially recognized as studia generalia in the 14th century were several, among these: *University of Lleida (founded in 1301) *Sapienza University of Rome (founded in 1303) *University of Perugia (founded in 1308) *University of Florence (founded in 1321) *University of Pisa (founded in 1343) *Charles University in Prague (founded in 1348) *University of Pavia (founded in 1361) *Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w (founded in 1364) *University of Vienna (founded in 1365) *University of Zadar (founded in 1396) Contemporary usage Today studium generale is primarily used within a European university context as a description for lectures, seminars and other activities which aim at providing academic foundations for students and the general public. They are in line with the humanistic roots of the traditional universities to reach outside of their boundaries and provide a general education. In the early post-war years in Germany the concept was re- introduced, for example, with a formal programme begun in 1948 at the Leibniz College of University of T√ºbingen. Today the term is often used interchangeably with orientation year and may be regarded as the academic equivalent of a Gap year. Studium particulare A studium particulare tended to take local students. A studium generale, by contrast, would take students from all regions and all countries.Georgedes, Kimberly. \\"Religion, Education and the Role of Government in Medieval Universities: Lessons Learned or Lost?.\\" Forum on public policy.

The Church of St. Roch and the Castle of Alboin. After the fall of the Western Empire, under which it had developed into a flourishing city, it became a Lombard dominion. Later in the Middle Ages, it was ruled by Ezzelino da Romano, by the Camino family, and then by the Scaligeri of Verona, from 1315 to 1337. Feltre was subsequently under Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, the da Carrara and the Visconti until 1404, when, together with Belluno, it was conquered by the Republic of Venice. In 1499 it received a new line of walls. In 1509 the center of the town was mostly destroyed during battles between the Venetians and the League of Cambrai, and later rebuilt with a characteristic 16th- century style. In 1797, after the capitulation of Venice to Napoleon, it was ruled for some time by the French. Napoleon made his minister of war, Henri Jacques Guillaume Clarke, Duke of Feltre in 1807. After the Congress of Vienna (1814), Feltre was assigned to the Austrian Empire, to which it remained until it was joined to the Kingdom of Italy in 1866. It was besieged by Austria during World War I. During World War II, Adolf Hitler demanded a meeting with Benito Mussolini to discuss his strategy for defending Italy from the Allied Armies since the Axis armies had just surrendered Tunis to the British Army, giving Allied Armies total control of North Africa. This meeting took place on July 19, 1943 in Feltre, Italy. Notable people of Feltre include printer Panfilo Castaldi, Friar Minor, missionary and founder of Monti di Piet√† Blessed Bernardine of Feltre, humanist educator Vittorino da Feltre and painter Morto da Feltre.

One of his most important contributions to social psychology is the mere-exposure effect. Zajonc also conducted research in the areas of social facilitation, and theories of emotion, such as the affective neuroscience hypothesis. He also made contributions to comparative psychology. He argued that studying the social behavior of humans alongside the behavior of other species, is essential to our understanding of the general laws of social behavior. An example of his viewpoint is his work with cockroaches that demonstrated social facilitation, evidence that this phenomenon is displayed regardless of species. A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Zajonc as the 35th most cited psychologist of the 20th century. He died of pancreatic cancer on December 3, 2008 in Palo Alto, California. Zajonc is survived by his wife Hazel Rose Markus and his four children.  Biography = Early life  Zajonc, born in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Poland on November 23, 1923, was the only child of the family. In 1939, before the Nazi invasion of Poland reached ≈Å√≥d≈∫, his family fled to Warsaw. During their short stay, the building they were living in was hit by an air raid. Both of Zajonc's parents were killed, and he was seriously injured. The rest of his time in Warsaw was dedicated to studying at an underground university in Warsaw until he was sent to a German labor camp. He escaped from the work camp, got recaptured, and then sent to a political prison in France. After escaping for the second time, he joined the French Resistance, continuing his studies at the University of Paris. In 1944, he moved to England where he became a translator for the American forces during their European Campaign.  Career  After the end of World War II, he immigrated to the United States, where he applied for undergraduate admission at the University of Michigan. Under probation, he was accepted. In 1955, he received his Ph.D. from the University of Michigan, where he was a professor there for nearly four decades, until 1994. During his time there, he held the positions of Director for the Research Center of Group Dynamics in the 1980s and Director of the Institute for Social Research in the 1990s. He then became Professor Emeritus of Psychology at Stanford University.  Personal life and death  Zajonc's first marriage, to Donna Benson, ended in divorce. He had three sons with Benson: Peter, Michael, and Joseph Zajonc. He spent the rest of his life with his second wife, Hazel Rose Markus, a social psychologist at Stanford, known for her contributions to cultural psychology. Zajonc had one daughter with Markus, a daughter named Krysia. He died in Stanford, California from pancreatic cancer on December 3, 2008, at the age of 85.  Contributions = Mere-exposure effect  One of Zajonc's contributions to psychology is the demonstration of the mere-exposure effect. The exposure effect demonstrates a phenomenon by which people show a preference towards an object simply because they are familiar with it. He focused on processes involved in social behavior, with an emphasis on the relationship between affect, or emotion, and cognition. Zajonc claims that this phenomenon exists across cultures, species, and different stimulation. One experiment he did with fertilized chicken eggs and rats provides evidence for the mere-exposure effect. He also proposes that the mere-exposure effect proceeds unconsciously through a subliminal channel.  Social facilitation  Another contribution that Zajonc made to psychology was through demonstrating social facilitation. Social facilitation is the improvement of performance around the presence of others. Zajonc was able to provide support for social facilitation through a variety of experiments. In one experiment he sought to see if individuals would change their decisions depending on the presence of an audience. He found that in the presence of an audience, the dominant preference would be enhanced.Zajonc, R. B., Wolosin, R. J., Wolosin, M. A., & Loh, W. D. (1970). Social facilitation and imitation in group risk- taking. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 6(1), 26-46. doi:10.1016/0022-1031(70)90074-0 In another experiment on social facilitation, Robert Zajonc gave participants associations to 184 words alone and in the presence of an audience. Half of the participants worked alone, then with an audience, and vice versa. Zajonc found that participants were effected by the presence of an audience, and fewer unique responses were given when with an audience. The audience acts as a general drive energizer, in the presence of an audience there would be an increased probability of the dominant response.Matlin, M. W., & Zajonc, R. B. (1969). \\"Social facilitation of word associations\\": Erratum. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 12(2), 150. doi:10.1037/h0020915  Preferences need no inferences  In 1980, a speculative and widely debated paper entitled \\"Feeling and Thinking: Preferences Need No Inferences,\\" invited in honor of his receipt of the 1979 Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award from the American Psychological Association, made the argument that affective and cognitive systems are largely independent, and that affect is more powerful and comes first. This paper precipitated a great deal of interest in affect in psychology, and was one of a number of influences that brought the study of emotion and affective processes back into the forefront of American and European psychology. The nature of affective judgments can be perceived as independent of, and precede in time of, the perceptual and cognitive operations often thought of as constituting the basis of these affecting judgments. His proposals presented to be contrary to the widely-considered belief in most contemporary psychology theories that affective judgment is post-cognitive. The partial-autonomy of the systems underlying cognition and affect were observed in his findings reflecting that the presence of recognition memory is not always necessary for the production of reliable affective judgments. However, it was described that these systems are not entirely independent of each other either and do affect one another in several ways, and simultaneously, contribute separate conserves of effects to the processing of information. Convergence in spouses appearance Zajonc was interested in studying whether after staying together for a long time, couples display similarities in their physical features. He explored this by conducting a study where he collected pictures of married couples on the day they were married and then one from 25 years later. He then compared these two pictures to test for physical similarities. The results indicated that there were physical similarities between facial features of the couples after living together for 25 years. They also found that couples with more facial similarities indicated that they were happier and had greater marital success. Zajonc and his colleagues gave the following four explanations for this phenomenon. (a) Diet, husbands and wives eat the same type of food, hence the fat consumed is similar and this might lead to similar facial features. (b) Regional similarities, married couples usually live in the same region, hence experience similar weather conditions which might lead to facial similarities. (c) People marry individuals who look like them or will eventually look like them. (d) The theory of emotional efference (Waynbaum, 1907), one of the implications of this theory is that the similarity in facial features could be attributed to the feeling of empathy. When you are being empathetic towards someone you unknowingly mimic their expression which then leads you to feel similar emotions. So the involvement of facial motor muscles in empathy might result in similar facial features among people who have lived together for a long period of time. To conclude these findings according to Zajonc tell us that social contact with others might have an effect on our facial features.  Affective neuroscience hypothesis  The affective neuroscience hypothesis posits that hedonic mood was linked to the temperature of the brain. This relationship was moderated by venous blood changes, which fluctuated according to changes in the function of the hypothalamus. Zajonc hypothesized that venous blood from the brain was moderated by facial expressions. In turn the blood drained from the brain into the sinus cavities, before flowing into the veins of the body. The heat from the blood of the cavernous sinus is able to influence the temperature of the hypothalamus due to their close proximity. Happy facial expressions cooled the hypothalamus, causing a strengthening of positive emotions. Conversely, negative emotions were caused by the ability of the negative facial expressions to warm the hypothalamus. Zajonc studied this theory by having research participants pronounce vowel sounds that resulted in a facial expression that would result in cool blood and brain patters. Zajonc and his colleagues found that participants assigned more positive evaluations of stimuli This finding was also replicated in rats who had their hypothalamus experimentally cooled or warmed via a small probe. Hypothalamic cooling in rats Robert Zajonc was also interested in manipulation of hypothalamic temperature to see if the attractiveness to stimuli could be moderated by changes in cephalic blood temperature. He created two experiments to examine the attractiveness and pleasure of food in rats during hypothalamic cooling or hypothalamic eating. The first experiment screened for elicitation of feeding. There were 17 male rats with hypothalamic thermodes implanted at the anterior border of the medial hypothalamus as well as two chronic oral cannulae in order to permit taste reactivity testing. In the first experiment there was a screening procedure consisting of an initial habituation phase that lasted 10 days and a test phase that lasted 6 days, A rat was placed once per day in a transparent chamber and its hypothalamic thermode was connected to the water flow and for a 10 minute period, the hypothalamic thermode was cooled by 2.5¬∞ in alternating On/Off bins of 15 sec each. Hypothalamic cooling was delivered on days 1,3, and 5 while a behavioural test was run on the second, fourth and sixth days. During hypothalamic cooling, many rats showed enhanced feeding. Zajonc also found that feeding was elicited during hypothalamic cooling but not heating or when the rat was left at its normal temperature. In his second experiment, which looked at hedonic and aversive reactions to taste, Zajonc connected the hypothalamic thermode of the 17 rats to water flow, and the rat‚Äôs were connected to an infusion delivery tube. Rats were infused with pure sucrose,a sucrose/quinine mixture, or distilled water, in random order through a 1 minute period, once per day. The thermode was then either cooled or heated by 2.5¬∞C for 0-20 seconds, then switched off for 20-60 seconds. Zajonc found that hedonic reactions to pure sucrose, sucrose / quinine mixture, or distilled water were not altered by hypothalamic cooling or heating. Berridge, K. C., & Zajonc, R. B. (1991). Hypothalamic cooling elicits eating: Differential effects on motivation and pleasure. Psychological Science, 2(3), 184-189. doi:10.1111/j.1467-9280.1991.tb00128.x  Confluence model  Zajonc, along with Greg Markus, developed the Confluence Model (1975), which provided a mathematical model of the effect of birth order and family size on IQ scores quantifying the relationship between in-family dynamics variability and intellectual ability. In forming this quantitative value, the confluence forms an averages of the absolute intellectual capacities of the entire family environment. As families increase in size, the overall IQ of the family drops; children from larger families do have slightly lower IQs. The last child in the family is denied the opportunity to tutor younger children, and there is a slight \\"extra\\" detriment for being the youngest child in a family. These effects are theoretically important, but the size of the effects is fairly small (amounting to a range of about 3 IQ points), thus, birth order is not an absolute determining factor for IQ although its influence is apparent. The capacity to which IQ is birth-order dependent was challenged by Wichman, Rodgers, and MacCallum (2006) whom claim that the observed differences were a product of between-family differences instead. Zajonc argued that this perceived conclusion as based on them incorrectly treating birth-order effects to parallel a linear relationship, in addition to shortcomings in the methods they progressed such as implementing the use of unfocused tests causing significantly significant trends to remain unrecognized. A study by Bjerkedal et al. (in press) offers support to the with-in family nature of the phenomena through its own findings showing that increasing birth rank paralleled a decline in IQ in a sample of 127,902 Norwegian same-family siblings. Sensory interaction on non-human animals Zajonc wanted to test the Sensory interaction hypothesis that a stimulus response not only depends on the intensity but also depends on other aspects of the condition.For this Zajonc conducted an experiment where he studied two male white carneaux pigeons. The pigeons were trained to distinguish between two tones, they were required to peck the left key for loud noise and the right key for soft noise. Every correct response was awarded with food to the pigeons. After each trial, there was a blackout followed by a light which indicated start of another trial.They found that the sensory interaction hypothesis does hold true, the pigeons not only used the intensity of the tone but also used the presentation of light while making a response.  Awards  Zajonc was the winner of the 1975 AAAS Prize for Behavioral Science Research. Zajonc won work on Preference Need No Inferences won the award for the Distinguished Scientific Contribution on September 2, 1979 at the meeting of the American Psychological Association  Further reading  This is a partial bibliography of Zajonc's works in English. * 1965.

Among the Javanese, Kakawin Ramayana has always been considered the pinnacle of artistic expression. The large number of preserved manuscripts attest to its popularity and adaptation. It is the lengthiest of all the Old Javanese kakawins of the Hindu-Buddhist period of Java. Divergence The Javanese Ramayana differs markedly from the original Hindu prototype. The first half of this Ramayana Jawa is similar to the original Sanskrit version, while the latter half is divergent to the point of being unrecognizable by Indian scholars of the original Ramayana. One of the many major changes is the inclusion of the all-powerful Javanese indigenous deity dhayana Guardian God of Java Semar (in Balinese literature known as Twalen) and his misshapen sons, Gareng, Petruk, and Bagong who make up the numerically significant four Punokawan or \\"clown servants\\".

The first half of the is more or less an exact rendering of . Synopsis Dasarata from Ayodya had four sons: Rama, Bharata, Laksmana and Satrugna. One day an ascetic named Wiswamitra requested that Dasaratha help him to repel a demon attack on his hermitage. Then Rama and Laksmana departed. In the hermitage, Rama and Laksmana destroyed the demons and proceeded to the Mithila country where a swayambara was being held. The visitor of the swayambara was to be given the king's daughter, Sinta, in marriage. The participants were told to draw the bow that had accompanied Sinta in her birth. Not a single one was successful except for Rama, then they got married and returned to Ayodya. In Ayodya, Rama was prepared to become the king, because he was the eldest son. However Kaikeyi, another wife of the king Dasaratha, invoked the king's oath to her asking for her son Bharata to become king. Dejected, king Dasaratha granted him the kingship. Rama, Sinta and Laksmana were made to leave the palace, and, grieving intensely, king Dasaratha died. The new king Bharata sought out Rama. He felt he did not deserve kingship and asked Rama to return to Ayodhya. Rama, however, refused and gave his sandals to Bharata as the symbol of his authority. Bharata returned to the palace with Rama's sandals. Rama with his two companions went to the woods to live there. During their stay, a female demon called Surpanaka saw Laksamana and fell in love with him and disguised herself as a beautiful woman. Laksmana was not interested in her and even cut off the tip of her nose when she threatened to grow violent. She was enraged and told this to her brother, Rawana the demon King of Lanka. Surpanka told Rawana of the beauty of Sinta and thus persuaded him to kidnap Sinta. Sinta saw a beautiful deer and asked Rama to catch it. Rama obliged entrusting Laksmana to protect Sinta. Rama was gone for a long period, and Sinta, growing worried convinced Laksmana to leave her and go in search of Rama. Rawana seized the moment to abduct Sinta and take her to Lanka. Then Rama and Laksmana tried to get her back. In their endeavor they got help from the King of the Monkeys Hanuman. In the end Rawana was killed. Rama and Sinta then returned to Ayodya where Rama was crowned. See also * Yogesvara * Bhattikavya References *C. Hooykaas, 1955, ', VKI 16, The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff.

She is the fifth ship of the class, and is named after Vend√©miaire, the first month of the Republican Calendar. The ship was constructed at Saint-Nazaire, France in 1992 and entered service in 1993. Vend√©miaire is stationed in the French Pacific territories for patrol duties. Design and description The s were designed in response to a demand for a cheap warship capable of operating in low threat areas and able to perform general patrol functions. As a result, the Flor√©al class were constructed to mercantile standards in the areas of ammunition stowage, helicopter facilities and damage control, which significantly lowered the cost of the vessels. The Flor√©al class were designed for using modular construction which shortened their building times. Vend√©miaire has a standard displacement of and at full load. The frigate measures long between perpendiculars and overall with a beam of and a draught of . Due to the frigate's broad beam, the ship is equipped with fin stabilisers. The frigate is powered by a combined diesel and diesel (CODAD) system comprising four SEMT Pielstick 6 PA6 L280 BPC diesel engines driving two shafts each turning a LIPS controllable pitch propeller. The CODAD system is rated at The vessel is also equipped with one bow thruster. Due to the mercantile construction design, the four diesels are all located within one machinery room for ease of maintenance. Both diesel fuel and TR5 aviation fuel is brought aboard at a single location at the stern compared to naval-constructed vessels which sport two. The ship also has three diesel-electric generators located just fore and aft of the machinery room. Vend√©miaire has a maximum speed of and a range of at . Vend√©miaire was armed with two Exocet MM38 surface-to-surface missiles in launchers situated centrally atop the midships superstructure. However, at the end of the missile's life cycle in 2014, the launchers were removed as the French Navy did not intend to replace the capability aboard the ships. The ship also mounts one 100 mm CADAM turret with the Najir fire control system located forwards and two 20 mm mod√®le F2 guns situated in atop the aft superstructure. The ship is equipped with DRBV-21C (Mars) air sentry, Racal Decca RM1290 navigation and Racal Decca RM1290 landing radars along with ARBG-1A Sa√Øgon communications intercept, CSF ARBR 16A radar intercept electronic surveillance systems and two Dagaie decoy systems. The frigate is equipped with a helicopter landing pad located on the stern and a hangar. The ship is capable of operating the embarked Eurocopter AS565 Panther up to sea state 5. Vend√©miaire is capable of operating helicopters up to the size of the Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma. The ship has a complement of 90 including the aircrew and officers and 24 marines with capacity for a further 13 personnel.  Construction and career  Vend√©miaire alongside at Noum√©a Vend√©miaire was ordered as part of the third pair in January 1991 from Chantiers de l'Atlantique for construction at their yard in Saint-Nazaire, France and the keel was laid down on 17 January 1992. The frigate was built using modular construction methods which reduced the vessel's construction time. Vend√©miaire was launched on 23 August 1992 and commissioned into the French Navy on 21 October 1993.Gardiner, Chumbley & Budzbon have the ship launched on 29 August and commissioned on 20 October. Following sea trials, Vend√©miaire sailed for Arsenal de Lorient, Lorient where the weapons and sensors were installed and underwent further trials. Vend√©miaire was assigned to Noum√©a, New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean. The frigate was deployed to East Timor as part of the Australian-led INTERFET peacekeeping taskforce from 20 September to 17 November 1999. Vend√©miaire alongside at Ocean Terminal, Hong Kong in 2011 The ship went on a tour of China in 2011, stopping at Hong Kong. Vend√©miaire was opened to the public 17 April 2011 in Hong Kong. The ship visited the city again from 26 February to 2 March 2018, being opened for public tours. In October 2013 the vessel participated in the International Fleet Review 2013 in Sydney, Australia. From 1 to 3 June 2015, Vend√©miaire performed French sovereignty missions to Matthew Island and Hunter Island. In 2015, following Cyclone Pam France ordered Vend√©miaire to sail from Noum√©a to Vanuatu to conduct surveys along with aircraft from the island territory. After the Cyclone Pam operations, Vend√©miaire sailed to Wellington, New Zealand in April 2016 to take part in the ANZAC commemorations. In May 2016, the frigate stopped at Busan, South Korea for joint training with the Republic of Korea Navy.

On 6 April 2019, Vend√©miaire sailed through the Taiwan Strait, shadowed by Chinese naval forces. China issued a diplomatic protest after Vend√©miaire allegedly violated Chinese territorial waters; France holds that the Taiwan Strait is international waters and claimed a right to freedom of navigation. Vend√©miaire was subsequently absent at the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the People's Liberation Army Navy at Qingdao, which she had been scheduled to attend. In September 2019, Vend√©miaire joined naval units from the Royal Australian Navy and Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force for naval exercises off the coast of Australia.

M√≠rz√° Mihd√≠ ( 1848 ‚Äì June 23, 1870) was the youngest child of Bah√° º√≠ Faith founder Bah√° ºu'll√°h and his wife √Ås√≠yih Kh√°num. He was given the title GÕühusn-i-Athar (\\"Purest Branch\\" or \\"Purer Branch\\").The elative is a stage of gradation in Arabic that can be used both for a superlative or a comparative. GÕühusn-i-Athar could mean \\"Purest Branch\\" or \\"Purer Branch.\\"  Biography  He was born in Tehran, Persia as Mehdi Nuri.Named after his father's deceased brother, Nuri being his father's surname. Mirza Mehdi was his mother's favourite child. Mihd√≠ did not remember his once luxurious life as at the age of four his father, founder of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, was arrested and imprisoned on account of his faith. The family were left in penury and his sister later recollected how the siblings would hold each other and weep. When his family were exiled to Baghdad, the family thought it necessary to leave M√≠rz√° Mihd√≠ in Persia as a result of his health. He was left to the care of his maternal great-grandmother and his paternal aunt. The separation was hard for his family, especially his mother. At the age of twelve, he rejoined his family in Baghdad. There he accompanied his father through all his exiles and grew very close to him. He later became the amanuenses of Bah√° ºu'll√°h and a staunch companion. He was beloved by the Bah√° º√≠s; revered in a similar sense to  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° and was noted for his meekness, piety, purity and sincerity. Whilst rapt in prayer, chanting the Ode of the Dove (a prayer revealed by his father during the period in Kurdistan) and pacing on the rooftop, M√≠rz√° Mihd√≠ fell through a skylight, and the wooden crate that he fell onto pierced his ribs and injured his lungs. Bah√° ºu'll√°h was horrified and asked for a physician to attend his son. However, by this time it was too late. His mother was especially hurt and poignantly caressed her blood-soaked son shortly before his death. Bah√° ºu'll√°h was heard lamenting ‚ÄúMihd√≠! O Mihd√≠!‚Äù as his son was dying. His companions surrounding him on his death-bed remember his courtesy despite his pain, and even apologizing that he was lying before their presence.In Persian custom, it is rude to be lying down in front of people; it is viewed as disrespectful. The graves of Navv√°b and Mirz√° Mihd√≠ within the Monument Gardens. He died on June 23, 1870, at the age of twenty-two. His dying wish was that the believers would attain the presence of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, a wish which the broken-hearted Bah√° ºu'll√°h accepted. His body was taken away and buried in a Muslim cemetery. His sister collected the blood-soaked clothes of Mihd√≠ and other relics. These are seen in the International Archives in Israel. Bah√° ºu'll√°h eulogized his son and connected the subsequent easing of restrictions and pilgrims' ability to visit him to his dying prayer. He wrote that his death caused ‚Äúthe Concourse on high to lament‚Äù. He also exalted his death, comparing it to the intended sacrifice of Abraham's son, the crucifixion of Christ and the martyrdom of the Imam Husayn. Bah√° ºu'll√°h also named him the Purest Branch. The exiles and companions commented that he had been a \\"pillar of strength\\" amongst the exiles and adored for his gentleness and patience.

She is the sixth and last ship of her class, and the first French vessel named after Germinal, the seventh month of the Republican Calendar. The ship was constructed at Saint-Nazaire, France in 1992‚Äì1993 and entered service in 1994. The frigate has served in the Mediterranean and Caribbean Seas and the Gulf of Guinea. Design and description The s were designed in response to a demand for a cheap warship capable of operating in low threat areas and able to perform general patrol functions. As a result, the Flor√©al class were constructed to mercantile standards in the areas of ammunition stowage, helicopter facilities and damage control, which significantly lowered the cost of the vessels. The Flor√©al class were designed for using modular construction which shortened their building times. Germinal has a standard displacement of and at full load. The frigate measures long between perpendiculars and overall with a beam of and a draught of . Due to the frigate's broad beam, the ship is equipped with fin stabilisers. The frigate is powered by a combined diesel and diesel (CODAD) system comprising four SEMT Pielstick 6 PA6 L280 BPC diesel engines driving two shafts each turning a LIPS controllable pitch propeller. The CODAD system is rated at The vessel is also equipped with one bow thruster. Due to the mercantile construction design, the four diesels are all located within one machinery room for ease of maintenance. Both diesel fuel and TR5 aviation fuel is brought aboard at a single location at the stern compared to naval- constructed vessels which sport two. The ship also has three diesel-electric generators located just fore and aft of the machinery room. Germinal has a maximum speed of and a range of at . Germinal was armed with two Exocet MM38 surface-to-surface missiles in launchers situated centrally atop the midships superstructure. However, at the end of the missile's life cycle in 2014, the launchers were removed as the French Navy did not intend to replace the capability aboard the ships. The ship also mounts one 100 mm CADAM turret with the Najir fire control system located forwards and two 20 mm mod√®le F2 guns situated in atop the aft superstructure. The ship is equipped with DRBV-21C (Mars) air sentry, Racal Decca RM1290 navigation and Racal Decca RM1290 landing radars along with ARBG-1A Sa√Øgon communications intercept, CSF ARBR 16A radar intercept electronic surveillance systems and two Dagaie decoy systems. The frigate is equipped with a helicopter landing pad located on the stern and a hangar. The ship is capable of operating the embarked Eurocopter AS565 Panther up to sea state 5. The ship is capable of operating helicopters up to the size of the Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma. The ship has a complement of 90 including the aircrew and officers and 24 marines with capacity for a further 13 personnel. Construction and career Germinal was ordered as part of the third pair in January 1991 from Chantiers de l'Atlantique for construction at their yard in Saint-Nazaire, France and the keel was laid down on 17 August 1992. The frigate was built using modular construction methods which reduced the vessel's construction time. Germinal was launched on 13 March 1993 and commissioned into the French Navy on 18 May 1994. Following sea trials, Germinal sailed for Arsenal de Lorient, Lorient where the weapons and sensors were installed and underwent further trials. In 1997, Germinal was part of the French naval presence in the Gulf of Guinea, known as the Corymbe Mission. That year, the frigate participated in Operation Espadon, evacuating French nationals from Sierra Leone. In January 2009, Germinal was reassigned from the UNIFIL mission along the Lebanese coast to a surveillance mission along the Gaza coast for ten days, beginning on 24 January. In 2014, while stationed at Fort-de-France, Martinique, the frigate intercepted a smuggler go-fast boat with of cocaine aboard. The smugglers were turned over to the Colombian frigate . In March 2015, Germinal, with support, intercepted another go-fast, this time off the coast of Barbados. The frigate seized of cocaine and of marijuana. On 19 June 2015 Germinal caught up with a sailboat making a trans-Atlantic crossing southeast of Martinique. The two crew of the sailboat were apprehended and of cocaine intended for Europe was seized. In April 2016, Germinal caught another go-fast, roughly from the Martinique coast and seized of marijuana. In October, the frigate intercepted a transfer of of cocaine between a go fast and a fishing boat from Dominica. Then on the night of 17/18 November, while operating off the coast of Guajira Peninsula, Colombia, Germinal took part in the chase of another go-fast, seizing of cocaine. In September 2017, Germinal, with sister ship , was deployed to Saint Martin after the island was hit by Hurricane Irma. Departing Saint Martin on 9 October, Germinal sailed for the Gulf of Guinea as part of the Corymbe Mission until December. In 2018, Germinal underwent a four-month overhaul at Fort-de- France. On 20 July 2018, the frigate seized 53 bundles of cocaine weighing a combined . Germinal intercepted a sailboat with two crew at sea. The crew set the sailboat on fire and jumped overboard and were collected by the frigate. Germinals crew successfully extinguished the fire aboard the sailboat and then boarded it. The frigate took the two prisoners and the sailboat back to Fort- de-France.

The soldier is the centre is holding a Hawkins grenade The Grenade, Hand, Anti-Tank, No. 75, also known as the \\"Hawkins grenade\\" was a British anti-tank hand grenade used during World War II. It was one of a number of grenades developed for use by the British Army and Home Guard in the aftermath of the Dunkirk evacuation. The grenade first appeared in 1942, and was designed to be more versatile than previous grenades, such as the No. 73 grenade and the sticky bomb. It was rectangular in shape, about in length and in width, and contained approximately of explosive. When a vehicle drove over the grenade, it cracked a chemical igniter and leaked acid onto a sensitive chemical, which detonated the explosive. Multiple grenades were often used to destroy tanks or disable their tracks, and the grenade could also be used as a demolition charge. It was used by the British Army and the United States Army, with the former using it until 1955 and the latter also creating their own variant, the M7 anti-tank mine. Development With the end of the Battle of France and the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force from the port of Dunkirk between 26 May and 4 June 1940, a German invasion of Great Britain seemed likely.Mackenzie, p. 20 However, the British Army was not well-equipped to defend the country in such an event; in the weeks after the Dunkirk evacuation it could only field twenty-seven divisions.Lampe, p. 3 The army was particularly short of anti-tank guns, 840 of which had been left behind in France and only 167 were available in Britain; ammunition was so scarce for the remaining guns that regulations forbade even a single round being used for training purposes. As a result of these shortcomings, a number of new anti- tank weapons had to be developed to equip the British Army and the Home Guard with the means to repel German armoured vehicles.Hogg, pp. 237-239 Many of these were anti-tank hand grenades, large numbers of which could be built in a very short space of time and for a low cost.Mackenzie, p. 92 They included the No. 73 Grenade, which was little more than a Thermos-sized bottle filled with TNT, and the grenade, hand, anti-tank No. 74, also known as the \\"sticky bomb\\", which was coated with a strong adhesive and stuck to a vehicle.Hogg, pp. 239-240 A more versatile grenade appeared in 1942 in the form of the grenade, hand, anti-tank, No. 75, more commonly known as the \\"Hawkins grenade\\", which was designed so that it could be used in a number of roles.Bishop, p. 214 Design The grenade was rectangular in shape and approximately in length and in width,Hogg, p. 240 and weighed about . Its explosive content consisted of around of blasting explosive,Hogg, p. 240 which was usually either ammonal or TNT. On the top of the grenade was a plate, under which the user would insert a chemical igniter, which would act as the weapon's fuse. When a vehicle drove over the grenade, its weight crushed the plate, which in turn cracked the igniter; this then leaked acid onto a sensitive chemical which detonated the charge. The grenade was designed so that it could either be thrown at a vehicle like an ordinary anti-tank grenade, or placed at a location when used as an anti-tank mine. It was also fitted with areas where blasting caps or cordtex could be placed, so that it could be used as a demolition charge.Rottman, World War II Infantry Assault Tactics, p. 25 When the grenade was used, it was recommended that the user be within a short distance of their target, ideally concealed within a trench; if the target were an armoured vehicle, then the best areas to target were the sides and rear, where the engine compartment was located and armour was generally thinner.Hogg, p. 241 Operational history General Dwight D. Eisenhower speaking with 1st Lieutenant Wallace C. Strobel and men of Company E, 502nd Parachute Infantry Regiment on 5 June. Note the Hawkins grenades strapped to the paratroopers' legs. Introduced in 1942, the grenade saw service with the British Army until 1955. The United States Army also used the grenade, as well as developing their own variant known as the \\"M7 light anti-tank mine\\". When used in an anti-tank role, a number of the grenades could be strung together in a \\"daisy chain\\" at intervals of around two feet, and then placed across a road to damage an armoured vehicle.Rottman, World War II Infantry Anti-Tank Tactics, pp. 61-62 It was particularly effective at damaging the tracks of tanks.Bull, p. 32 When sufficient grenades were grouped together, they were capable of disabling a medium tank.Lowry, p. 16 The Hawkins was also used in other roles, such as breaching walls, and its small size also meant that it could easily be placed into the \\"web\\" of a railway line and, when detonated, destroy a section of track.

Felsted School is an English co-educational day and boarding independent school, situated in Felsted in Essex, England. It is in the British public school tradition, and was founded in 1564 by Richard Rich, 1st Baron Rich. Felsted is one of the 12 founder members of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference, and a full member of the Round Square Conference of world schools. Felsted School has been awarded the Good Schools Guide award twice and is regularly featured in Tatler's Schools Guide. Felsted's production of \\"Oh, What a Lovely War!\\" Fire at Felsted School in 2012 Felsted is notable as the only public school ever to have educated a British head of state, Richard Cromwell. History Felsted was founded in 1564 by Richard Rich, 1st Baron Rich (also known as Riche) who, as Lord Chancellor and Chancellor of the Court of Augmentations, acquired considerable wealth from the spoils of the Dissolution of the Monasteries including the nearby Leez Priory where he lived. The school became a notable educational centre for Puritan families in the 17th century, numbering a hundred or more pupils, under Martin Holbeach, Headmaster from 1627‚Äì1649, and his successors (see below). John Wallis and Isaac Barrow were educated at Felsted in this period, as were four of Oliver Cromwell's sons. Another era of prosperity set in under the headmastership of William Trivett between 1778 and 1794; but numbers dwindled under his successors . Thomas Surridge (headmaster 1835‚Äì1850) discovered from research among the records, that a larger income was really due to the foundation, a re-organisation took place by Act of Parliament, and in 1850, under the headmastership of the Rev. Albert Henry Wratislaw, the school was put under a new governing body (a revised scheme coming into operation in 1876). Thereafter, Felsted rapidly developed into one of the regular public schools of the modern English type, under the Rev. W. S. Grignon. New buildings were built on an elaborate scale, numbers increased to more than 200, and a complete transformation took place, which was continued under Grignon's successors, like Frank Stephenson, who ordered large extensions to the buildings and playing-fields. This allowed admittance up to 475 pupils, nearly all of whom were boarders. The school was evacuated to three Herefordshire houses near Ross-on-Wye during the Second World War at the owners invitation to be out of the way of German bombing. Most of the school was in Goodrich Court and Windsor's and Ingle's Houses occupied Hill Court Manor. On 25 July 1953 the school's Combined Cadet Force armoury was raided by the Irish Republican Army (1922‚Äì69), making off with 8 Bren guns, 12 Sten guns, an anti-tank gun, a mortar and 109 rifles. Their van was stopped by a police patrol and Cathal Goulding, Sean Stephenson, later known as Se√°n Mac St√≠of√°in and Manus Canning each received 8 years in prison.Bishop, P, and Mallie, E. (1987). The Provisional IRA Major building works took place for the 400th anniversary celebrations in 1964, when the Queen Mother laid the foundation stone for the then new Music School, subsequently opened by Felsted governor Lord Butler of Saffron Walden, (formerly Rab Butler). In 2008 this building was replaced by a larger new building which was opened in 2009 by Dame Evelyn Glennie. The Princess Royal opened the new Lord Riche Hall in 1989. Girls were taken into the Sixth Form in 1970, and into the whole school in 1993. Felsted School perform 'Cabaret' in Bedford Hills Correctional Facility 21st century The success of taking drama productions every two years to perform in American high schools from 2000 onwards, led to the school being invited in 2008 by the U.S. authorities to put on a production of Stephen Sondheim's 'A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum' at Bedford Hills Maximum Security Correctional Facility for Women. The audience consisted of life prisoners and received international news coverage. The success of this venture led to three further productions in the Correctional Facility:'Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat' (2010), 'A Secret Garden' (2012) and 'Cabaret' (2014). In July 2012 part of the school was devastated by fire after a blaze broke out in the roof and first floor of Follyfield House, one of the girls' boarding houses. The school term had ended but about 25 students and staff from a summer school were on site and evacuated. Nobody was injured. The school reopened as normal in September, with a new, temporary house situated next to the Lord Riche Hall. Soon after, an all new state-of-the-art boarding house was built in a different location, nearer to Gepp's & Deacon's houses, and opened as planned in September 2014. On 6 May 2014, the school was visited by reigning monarch Queen Elizabeth II to mark the 450th anniversary of Felsted School. She unveiled plaques for the visit as well as officially opening the newly constructed Follyfield House.

Swine influenza virus (SIV) or swine-origin influenza virus (S-OIV) is any strain of the influenza family of viruses that is endemic in pigs. As of 2009, the known SIV strains include influenza C and the subtypes of influenza A known as H1N1, H1N2, H2N1, H3N1, H3N2, and H2N3. Swine influenza virus is common throughout pig populations worldwide. Transmission of the virus from pigs to humans is not common and does not always lead to human flu, often resulting only in the production of antibodies in the blood. If transmission does cause human flu, it is called zoonotic swine flu. People with regular exposure to pigs are at increased risk of swine flu infection. Around the mid-20th century, identification of influenza subtypes became possible, allowing accurate diagnosis of transmission to humans. Since then, only 50 such transmissions have been confirmed. These strains of swine flu rarely pass from human to human. Symptoms of zoonotic swine flu in humans are similar to those of influenza and of influenza-like illness in general, namely chills, fever, sore throat, muscle pains, severe headache, coughing, weakness, shortness of breath, and general discomfort. It is estimated that in the 2009 flu pandemic 11‚Äì21% of the then global population (of about 6.8 billion), or around 700 million to 1.4 billion people, contracted the illness‚Äîmore in absolute terms than the Spanish flu pandemic. Actual fatalities ranged between 12,000 and 18,000. However, in a 2012 study, the CDC estimated more than 284,000 possible fatalities worldwide, with range from 150,000 to 575,000. In August 2010, the World Health Organization declared the swine flu pandemic officially over. Subsequent cases of swine flu were reported in India in 2015, with over 31,156 positive test cases and 1,841 deaths up to March 2015. Signs and symptoms In pigs, a swine influenza infection produces fever, lethargy, sneezing, coughing, difficulty breathing and decreased appetite. In some cases the infection can cause miscarriage. Although mortality is usually low (around 1‚Äì4%), the virus can produce weight loss and poor growth, causing economic loss to farmers. Infected pigs can lose up to 12 pounds of body weight over a three- to four-week period. Swine have receptors to which both avian and mammalian influenza viruses are able to bind to, which leads to the virus being able to evolve and mutate into different forms. Influenza A is responsible for infecting swine, and was first identified in the summer of 1918. Pigs have often been seen as \\"mixing vessels\\", which help to change and evolve strains of disease that are then passed on to other mammals, such as humans. Humans Main symptoms of swine flu in humans Direct transmission of a swine flu virus from pigs to humans is occasionally possible (zoonotic swine flu). In all, 50 cases are known to have occurred since the first report in medical literature in 1958, which have resulted in a total of six deaths. Of these six people, one was pregnant, one had leukemia, one had Hodgkin's lymphoma and two were known to be previously healthy. One of these had unknown whereabouts. Despite these apparently low numbers of infections, the true rate of infection may be higher, since most cases only cause a very mild disease, and will probably never be reported or diagnosed. In this video, Dr. Joe Bresee, with CDC's Influenza Division, describes the symptoms of swine flu and warning signs to look for that indicate the need for urgent medical attention. See also: See this video with subtitles on YouTube According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in humans the symptoms of the 2009 \\"swine flu\\" H1N1 virus are similar to influenza and influenza-like illness in general. Symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, watery eyes, body aches, shortness of breath, headache, weight loss, chills, sneezing, runny nose, coughing, dizziness, abdominal pain, lack of appetite, and fatigue. The 2009 outbreak showed an increased percentage of patients reporting diarrhea and vomiting as well. The 2009 H1N1 virus is not zoonotic swine flu, as it is not transmitted from pigs to humans, but from person to person through airborne droplets. Because these symptoms are not specific to swine flu, a differential diagnosis of probable swine flu requires not only symptoms, but also a high likelihood of swine flu due to the person's recent and past medical history. For example, during the 2009 swine flu outbreak in the United States, the CDC advised physicians to \\"consider swine influenza infection in the differential diagnosis of patients with acute febrile respiratory illness who have either been in contact with persons with confirmed swine flu, or who were in one of the five U.S. states that have reported swine flu cases or in Mexico during the seven days preceding their illness onset.\\" A diagnosis of confirmed swine flu requires laboratory testing of a respiratory sample (a simple nose and throat swab). The most common cause of death is respiratory failure. Other causes of death are pneumonia (leading to sepsis), high fever (leading to neurological problems), dehydration (from excessive vomiting and diarrhea), electrolyte imbalance and kidney failure. Fatalities are more likely in young children and the elderly. Virology=TransmissionBetween pigs= Influenza is quite common in pigs, with about half of breeding pigs having been exposed to the virus in the US. Antibodies to the virus are also common in pigs in other countries. The main route of transmission is through direct contact between infected and uninfected animals. These close contacts are particularly common during animal transport. Intensive farming may also increase the risk of transmission, as the pigs are raised in very close proximity to each other. The direct transfer of the virus probably occurs either by pigs touching noses, or through dried mucus. Airborne transmission through the aerosols produced by pigs coughing or sneezing are also an important means of infection. The virus usually spreads quickly through a herd, infecting all the pigs within just a few days. Transmission may also occur through wild animals, such as wild boar, which can spread the disease between farms. =To humans= People who work with poultry and swine, especially those with intense exposures, are at increased risk of zoonotic infection with influenza virus endemic in these animals, and constitute a population of human hosts in which zoonosis and reassortment can co-occur. Vaccination of these workers against influenza and surveillance for new influenza strains among this population may therefore be an important public health measure. Transmission of influenza from swine to humans who work with swine was documented in a small surveillance study performed in 2004 at the University of Iowa. This study, among others, forms the basis of a recommendation that people whose jobs involve handling poultry and swine be the focus of increased public health surveillance. Other professions at particular risk of infection are veterinarians and meat processing workers, although the risk of infection for both of these groups is lower than that of farm workers. =Interaction with avian H5N1 in pigs= Pigs are unusual as they can be infected with influenza strains that usually infect three different species: pigs, birds, and humans. Pigs are a host where influenza viruses might exchange genes, producing new and dangerous strains. Avian influenza virus H3N2 is endemic in pigs in China and has been detected in pigs in Vietnam, increasing fears of the emergence of new variant strains. H3N2 evolved from H2N2 by antigenic shift. In August 2004, researchers in China found H5N1 in pigs. These H5N1 infections may be quite common; in a survey of 10 apparently healthy pigs housed near poultry farms in West Java, where avian flu had broken out, five of the pig samples contained the H5N1 virus. The Indonesian government has since found similar results in the same region. Additional tests of 150 pigs outside the area were negative. report on pigs as carriers. Structure Structure of H1N1 Virion. Main symptoms of swine flu in swine The influenza virion is roughly spherical. It is an enveloped virus; the outer layer is a lipid membrane which is taken from the host cell in which the virus multiplies. Inserted into the lipid membrane are \\"spikes\\", which are proteins‚Äîactually glycoproteins, because they consist of protein linked to sugars‚Äîknown as HA (hemagglutinin) and NA (neuraminidase). These are the proteins that determine the subtype of influenza virus (A/H1N1, for example). The HA and NA are important in the immune response against the virus; antibodies (proteins made to combat infection) against these spikes may protect against infection. The NA protein is the target of the antiviral drugs Relenza and Tamiflu. Also embedded in the lipid membrane is the M2 protein, which is the target of the antiviral adamantanes amantadine and rimantadine. =Classification= Of the three genera of influenza viruses that cause human flu, two also cause influenza in pigs, with influenza A being common in pigs and influenza C being rare. Influenza B has not been reported in pigs. Within influenza A and influenza C, the strains found in pigs and humans are largely distinct, although because of reassortment there have been transfers of genes among strains crossing swine, avian, and human species boundaries. =Influenza C= Influenza viruses infect both humans and pigs, but do not infect birds. Transmission between pigs and humans have occurred in the past. For example, influenza C caused small outbreaks of a mild form of influenza amongst children in Japan and California. Because of its limited host range and the lack of genetic diversity in influenza C, this form of influenza does not cause pandemics in humans. =Influenza A= Swine influenza is caused by influenza A subtypes H1N1, H1N2, H2N3, H3N1, and H3N2. In pigs, four influenza A virus subtypes (H1N1, H1N2, H3N2 and H7N9) are the most common strains worldwide. In the United States, the H1N1 subtype was exclusively prevalent among swine populations before 1998; however, since late August 1998, H3N2 subtypes have been isolated from pigs. As of 2004, H3N2 virus isolates in US swine and turkey stocks were triple reassortants, containing genes from human (HA, NA, and PB1), swine (NS, NP, and M), and avian (PB2 and PA) lineages. In August 2012, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed 145 human cases (113 in Indiana, 30 in Ohio, one in Hawaii and one in Illinois) of H3N2v since July 2012. The death of a 61-year-old Madison County, Ohio woman is the first in the USA associated with a new swine flu strain. She contracted the illness after having contact with hogs at the Ross County Fair. Diagnosis Thermal scanning of passengers arriving at Singapore Changi airport The CDC recommends real-time PCR as the method of choice for diagnosing H1N1. The oral or nasal fluid collection and RNA virus- preserving filter-paper card is commercially available. This method allows a specific diagnosis of novel influenza (H1N1) as opposed to seasonal influenza. Near-patient point-of-care tests are in development. Prevention Prevention of swine influenza has three components: prevention in pigs, prevention of transmission to humans, and prevention of its spread among humans. Proper hand washing techniques can prevent the virus from spreading. Avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth. Stay away from others who display symptoms of the cold or flu and avoid contact with others when displaying symptoms. Swine Methods of preventing the spread of influenza among swine include facility management, herd management, and vaccination (ATCvet code: ). Because much of the illness and death associated with swine flu involves secondary infection by other pathogens, control strategies that rely on vaccination may be insufficient. Control of swine influenza by vaccination has become more difficult in recent decades, as the evolution of the virus has resulted in inconsistent responses to traditional vaccines. Standard commercial swine flu vaccines are effective in controlling the infection when the virus strains match enough to have significant cross-protection, and custom (autogenous) vaccines made from the specific viruses isolated are created and used in the more difficult cases. Present vaccination strategies for SIV control and prevention in swine farms typically include the use of one of several bivalent SIV vaccines commercially available in the United States. Of the 97 recent H3N2 isolates examined, only 41 isolates had strong serologic cross-reactions with antiserum to three commercial SIV vaccines. Since the protective ability of influenza vaccines depends primarily on the closeness of the match between the vaccine virus and the epidemic virus, the presence of nonreactive H3N2 SIV variants suggests current commercial vaccines might not effectively protect pigs from infection with a majority of H3N2 viruses. The United States Department of Agriculture researchers say while pig vaccination keeps pigs from getting sick, it does not block infection or shedding of the virus. Facility management includes using disinfectants and ambient temperature to control viruses in the environment. They are unlikely to survive outside living cells for more than two weeks, except in cold (but above freezing) conditions, and are readily inactivated by disinfectants. Herd management includes not adding pigs carrying influenza to herds that have not been exposed to the virus. The virus survives in healthy carrier pigs for up to three months, and can be recovered from them between outbreaks. Carrier pigs are usually responsible for the introduction of SIV into previously uninfected herds and countries, so new animals should be quarantined. After an outbreak, as immunity in exposed pigs wanes, new outbreaks of the same strain can occur. Humans ;Prevention of pig-to-human transmission thumb Swine can be infected by both avian and human flu strains of influenza, and therefore are hosts where the antigenic shifts can occur that create new influenza strains. The transmission from swine to humans is believed to occur mainly in swine farms, where farmers are in close contact with live pigs. Although strains of swine influenza are usually not able to infect humans, it may occasionally happen, so farmers and veterinarians are encouraged to use face masks when dealing with infected animals. The use of vaccines on swine to prevent their infection is a major method of limiting swine-to-human transmission. Risk factors that may contribute to swine-to-human transmission include smoking and, especially, not wearing gloves when working with sick animals, thereby increasing the likelihood of subsequent hand-to-eye, hand-to-nose, or hand-to- mouth transmission. ;Prevention of human-to-human transmission Influenza spreads between humans when infected people cough or sneeze, then other people breathe in the virus or touch something with the virus on it and then touch their own face. \\"Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Germs spread this way.\\" Swine flu cannot be spread by pork products, since the virus is not transmitted through food. The swine flu in humans is most contagious during the first five days of the illness, although some people, most commonly children, can remain contagious for up to ten days. Diagnosis can be made by sending a specimen, collected during the first five days, for analysis. Thermal imaging camera and screen, photographed in an airport terminal in Greece ‚Äì thermal imaging can detect elevated body temperature, one of the signs of the virus H1N1 (swine influenza). Recommendations to prevent spread of the virus among humans include using standard infection control, which includes frequent washing of hands with soap and water or with alcohol-based hand sanitizers, especially after being out in public. Chance of transmission is also reduced by disinfecting household surfaces, which can be done effectively with a diluted chlorine bleach solution. Experts agree hand- washing can help prevent viral infections, including ordinary and swine flu infections. Also, avoiding touching one's eyes, nose, or mouth with one's hands helps to prevent the flu. Influenza can spread in coughs or sneezes, but an increasing body of evidence shows small droplets containing the virus can linger on tabletops, telephones, and other surfaces and be transferred via the fingers to the eyes, nose, or mouth. Alcohol-based gel or foam hand sanitizers work well to destroy viruses and bacteria. Anyone with flu-like symptoms, such as a sudden fever, cough, or muscle aches, should stay away from work or public transportation and should contact a doctor for advice. Social distancing, another tactic, is staying away from other people who might be infected, and can include avoiding large gatherings, spreading out a little at work, or perhaps staying home and lying low if an infection is spreading in a community. Public health and other responsible authorities have action plans which may request or require social distancing actions, depending on the severity of the outbreak. =Vaccination= Vaccines are available for different kinds of swine flu. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the new swine flu vaccine for use in the United States on September 15, 2009. Studies by the National Institutes of Health show a single dose creates enough antibodies to protect against the virus within about 10 days. In the aftermath of the 2009 pandemic, several studies were conducted to see who received influenza vaccines. These studies show that whites are much more likely to be vaccinated for seasonal influenza and for the H1N1 strain than African Americans Uscher-Pines, Lori, Jurgen Maurer, and Katherine M. Harris. \\"Racial And Ethnic Disparities In Uptake And Location Of Vaccination For 2009‚ÄìH1N1 And Seasonal Influenza.\\" American Journal of Public Health 101.7 (2011) 1252‚Äì55. SocINDEX with Full Text. Web. 6 Dec. 2011. This could be due to several factors. Historically, there has been mistrust of vaccines and of the medical community from African Americans. Many African Americans do not believe vaccines or doctors to be effective. This mistrust stems from the exploitation of the African American communities during studies like the Tuskegee study. Additionally, vaccines are typically administered in clinics, hospitals, or doctor's offices. Many people of lower socioeconomic status are less likely to receive vaccinations because they do not have health insurance. Surveillance Although there is no formal national surveillance system in the United States to determine what viruses are circulating in pigs, an informal surveillance network in the United States is part of a world surveillance network. Treatment=Swine As swine influenza is rarely fatal to pigs, little treatment beyond rest and supportive care is required. Instead, veterinary efforts are focused on preventing the spread of the virus throughout the farm or to other farms. Vaccination and animal management techniques are most important in these efforts. Antibiotics are also used to treat the disease, which, although they have no effect against the influenza virus, do help prevent bacterial pneumonia and other secondary infections in influenza-weakened herds. In Europe the avian-like H1N1 and the human-like H3N2 and H1N2 are the most common influenza subtypes in swine, of which avian- like H1N1 is the most frequent. Since 2009 another subtype, pdmH1N1(2009), emerged globally and also in European pig population. The prevalence varies from country to country but all of the subtypes are continuously circulating in swine herds. In the EU region whole-virus vaccines are available which are inactivated and adjuvanted. Vaccination of sows is common practice and reveals also a benefit to young pigs by prolonging the maternally level of antibodies. Several commercial vaccines are available including a trivalent one being used in sow vaccination and a vaccine against pdmH1N1(2009). In vaccinated sows multiplication of viruses and virus shedding are significantly reduced. Humans If a person becomes sick with swine flu, antiviral drugs can make the illness milder and make the patient feel better faster. They may also prevent serious flu complications. For treatment, antiviral drugs work best if started soon after getting sick (within two days of symptoms). Beside antivirals, supportive care at home or in a hospital focuses on controlling fevers, relieving pain and maintaining fluid balance, as well as identifying and treating any secondary infections or other medical problems. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the use of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza) for the treatment and/or prevention of infection with swine influenza viruses; however, the majority of people infected with the virus make a full recovery without requiring medical attention or antiviral drugs. The virus isolated in the 2009 outbreak have been found resistant to amantadine and rimantadine. In the U.S., on April 27, 2009, the FDA issued Emergency Use Authorizations to make available Relenza and Tamiflu antiviral drugs to treat the swine influenza virus in cases for which they were currently unapproved. The agency issued these EUAs to allow treatment of patients younger than the current approval allows and to allow the widespread distribution of the drugs, including by volunteers. History=Pandemics Swine influenza was first proposed to be a disease related to human flu during the 1918 flu pandemic, when pigs became ill at the same time as humans. The first identification of an influenza virus as a cause of disease in pigs occurred about ten years later, in 1930. For the following 60 years, swine influenza strains were almost exclusively H1N1. Then, between 1997 and 2002, new strains of three different subtypes and five different genotypes emerged as causes of influenza among pigs in North America. In 1997‚Äì1998, H3N2 strains emerged. These strains, which include genes derived by reassortment from human, swine and avian viruses, have become a major cause of swine influenza in North America. Reassortment between H1N1 and H3N2 produced H1N2. In 1999 in Canada, a strain of H4N6 crossed the species barrier from birds to pigs, but was contained on a single farm. The H1N1 form of swine flu is one of the descendants of the strain that caused the 1918 flu pandemic. As well as persisting in pigs, the descendants of the 1918 virus have also circulated in humans through the 20th century, contributing to the normal seasonal epidemics of influenza. However, direct transmission from pigs to humans is rare, with only 12 recorded cases in the U.S. since 2005. Nevertheless, the retention of influenza strains in pigs after these strains have disappeared from the human population might make pigs a reservoir where influenza viruses could persist, later emerging to reinfect humans once human immunity to these strains has waned. Swine flu has been reported numerous times as a zoonosis in humans, usually with limited distribution, rarely with a widespread distribution. Outbreaks in swine are common and cause significant economic losses in industry, primarily by causing stunting and extended time to market. For example, this disease costs the British meat industry about ¬£65 million every year. =1918 = The 1918 flu pandemic in humans was associated with H1N1 and influenza appearing in pigs; this may reflect a zoonosis either from swine to humans, or from humans to swine. Although it is not certain in which direction the virus was transferred, some evidence suggests, in this case, pigs caught the disease from humans. For instance, swine influenza was only noted as a new disease of pigs in 1918, after the first large outbreaks of influenza amongst people. Although a recent phylogenetic analysis of more recent strains of influenza in humans, birds, animals, and many others, including swine, suggests the 1918 outbreak in humans followed a reassortment event within a mammal, the exact origin of the 1918 strain remains elusive. It is estimated that anywhere from 50 to 100 million people were killed worldwide. = U.S. 2009 = The swine flu was initially seen in the US in April 2009, where the strain of the particular virus was a mixture from 3 types of strains. Six of the genes are very similar to the H1N2 influenza virus that was found in pigs around 2000. Outbreaks1976 U.S.= On February 5, 1976, a United States army recruit at Fort Dix said he felt tired and weak. He died the next day, and four of his fellow soldiers were later hospitalized. Two weeks after his death, health officials announced the cause of death was a new strain of swine flu. The strain, a variant of H1N1, is known as A/New Jersey/1976 (H1N1). It was detected only from January 19 to February 9 and did not spread beyond Fort Dix. U.S. President Gerald Ford receives a swine flu vaccination This new strain appeared to be closely related to the strain involved in the 1918 flu pandemic. Moreover, the ensuing increased surveillance uncovered another strain in circulation in the U.S.: A/Victoria/75 (H3N2), which spread simultaneously, also caused illness, and persisted until March. Alarmed public health officials decided action must be taken to head off another major pandemic, and urged President Gerald Ford that every person in the U.S. be vaccinated for the disease. The vaccination program was plagued by delays and public relations problems.Richard E. Neustadt and Harvey V. Fineberg. (1978). The Swine Flu Affair: Decision-Making on a Slippery Disease. National Academies Press. On October 1, 1976, immunizations began, and three senior citizens died soon after receiving their injections. This resulted in a media outcry that linked these deaths to the immunizations, despite the lack of any proof the vaccine was the cause. According to science writer Patrick Di Justo, however, by the time the truth was known‚Äîthat the deaths were not proven to be related to the vaccine‚Äîit was too late. \\"The government had long feared mass panic about swine flu‚Äînow they feared mass panic about the swine flu vaccinations.\\" This became a strong setback to the program.\\"The Last Great Swine Flu Epidemic\\", Salon.com, April 28, 2009. There were reports of Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome (GBS), a paralyzing neuromuscular disorder, affecting some people who had received swine flu immunizations. Although whether a link exists is still not clear, this syndrome may be a side effect of influenza vaccines. As a result, Di Justo writes, \\"the public refused to trust a government-operated health program that killed old people and crippled young people.\\" In total, 48,161,019 Americans, or just over 22% of the population, had been immunized by the time the National Influenza Immunization Program was effectively halted on December 16, 1976. Overall, there were 1098 cases of GBS recorded nationwide by CDC surveillance, 532 of which occurred after vaccination and 543 before vaccination. About one to two cases per 100,000 people of GBS occur every year, whether or not people have been vaccinated. The vaccination program seems to have increased this normal risk of developing GBS by about to one extra case per 100,000 vaccinations. Recompensation charges were filed for over 4,000 cases of severe vaccination damage, including 25 deaths, totalling US$3.5 billion, by 1979. The CDC stated most studies on modern influenza vaccines have seen no link with GBS, Although one review gives an incidence of about one case per million vaccinations, a large study in China, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, covering close to 100 million doses of H1N1 flu vaccine, found only 11 cases of GBS, which is lower than the normal rate of the disease in China: \\"The risk-benefit ratio, which is what vaccines and everything in medicine is about, is overwhelmingly in favor of vaccination.\\" =1988 U.S. = In September 1988, a swine flu virus killed one woman and infected others. A 32-year-old woman, Barbara Ann Wieners, was eight months pregnant when she and her husband, Ed, became ill after visiting the hog barn at a county fair in Walworth County, Wisconsin. Barbara died eight days later, after developing pneumonia. The only pathogen identified was an H1N1 strain of swine influenza virus. Doctors were able to induce labor and deliver a healthy daughter before she died. Her husband recovered from his symptoms. Influenza-like illness (ILI) was reportedly widespread among the pigs exhibited at the fair. Of the 25 swine exhibitors aged 9 to 19 at the fair, 19 tested positive for antibodies to SIV, but no serious illnesses were seen. The virus was able to spread between people, since one to three health care personnel who had cared for the pregnant woman developed mild, influenza-like illnesses, and antibody tests suggested they had been infected with swine flu, but there was no community outbreak. In 1998, swine flu was found in pigs in four U.S. states. Within a year, it had spread through pig populations across the United States. Scientists found this virus had originated in pigs as a recombinant form of flu strains from birds and humans. This outbreak confirmed that pigs can serve as a crucible where novel influenza viruses emerge as a result of the reassortment of genes from different strains. Genetic components of these 1998 triple-hybrid strains would later form six out of the eight viral gene segments in the 2009 flu outbreak.CDC Confirms Ties to Virus First Discovered in U.S. Pig Factories Video Segments 3,4,5 in Flu Factories: Tracing the Origins of the Swine Flu Pandemic Swine Flu Kept Stable Humans Untouched For 80 Years Triple Hybrid Mutant Pig-Bird-Human Crossbreed Virus North Carolina, 1998 Ground Zero =2007 Philippines= On August 20, 2007, Department of Agriculture officers investigated the outbreak of swine flu in Nueva Ecija and central Luzon, Philippines. The mortality rate is less than 10% for swine flu, unless there are complications like hog cholera. On July 27, 2007, the Philippine National Meat Inspection Service (NMIS) raised a hog cholera \\"red alert\\" warning over Metro Manila and five regions of Luzon after the disease spread to backyard pig farms in Bulacan and Pampanga, even if they tested negative for the swine flu virus. =2009 Northern Ireland= Since November 2009, 14 deaths as a result of swine flu in Northern Ireland have been reported. The majority of the victims were reported to have pre-existing health conditions which had lowered their immunity. This closely corresponds to the 19 patients who had died in the year prior due to swine flu, where 18 of the 19 were determined to have lowered immune systems. Because of this, many mothers who have just given birth are strongly encouraged to get a flu shot because their immune systems are vulnerable. Also, studies have shown that people between the ages of 15 and 44 have the highest rate of infection. Although most people now recover, having any conditions that lower one's immune system increases the risk of having the flu become potentially lethal. In Northern Ireland now, approximately 56% of all people under 65 who are entitled to the vaccine have gotten the shot, and the outbreak is said to be under control. =2015 and 2017 India= Swine flu outbreaks were reported in India in late 2014 and early 2015. As of March 19, 2015 the disease has affected 31,151 people and claimed over 1,841 lives. The largest number of reported cases and deaths due to the disease occurred in the western part of India including states like Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Gujarat. Researchers of MIT have claimed that the swine flu has mutated in India to a more virulent version with changes in Hemagglutinin protein, contradicting earlier research by Indian researchers. There was another outbreak in India in 2017. The states of Maharashtra and Gujarat were the worst affected. Gujarat high court has given Gujarat government instructions to control deaths by swine flu. 1,090 people died of swine flu in India in 2017 until August 26, 2017. =2015 Nepal= Swine flu outbreaks were reported in Nepal in the spring of 2015. Up to April 21, 2015 the disease had claimed 26 lives in the most severely affected district, Jajarkot in Northwest Nepal. Cases were also detected in the districts of Kathmandu, Morang, Kaski, and Chitwan. As of 22 April 2015 the Nepal Ministry of Health reported that 2,498 people had been treated in Jajarkot, of whom 552 were believed to have swine flu, and acknowledged that the government's response had been inadequate. The Jajarkot outbreak had just been declared an emergency when the April 2015 Nepal earthquake struck on 25 April 2015, diverting all medical and emergency resources to quake-related rescue and recovery. =2016 Pakistan= Seven cases of swine flu were reported in Punjab province of Pakistan, mainly in the city of Multan, in January 2017. Cases of swine flu were also reported in Lahore and Faisalabad. =2017 Maldives= As of March 16, 2017, over a hundred confirmed cases of swine flu and at least six deaths were reported in the Maldivian capital of Mal√© and some other islands. Makeshift flu clinics were opened in Mal√©. Schools in the capital were closed, prison visitations suspended, several events cancelled, and all non-essential travel to other islands outside the capital was advised against by the HPA. An influenza vaccination program focusing on pregnant women was initiated thereafter. An official visit by Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud to the Maldives during his Asian tour was also cancelled last minute amidst fears over the outbreak of swine flu.  2020 G4 EA H1N1 publication  G4 EA H1N1, also known as the G4 swine flu virus (G4) is a swine influenza virus strain discovered in China. The virus is a variant genotype 4 (G4) Eurasian avian- like (EA) H1N1 virus that mainly affects pigs, but there is some evidence of it infecting people. A peer-reviewed paper from the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) stated that \\"G4 EA H1N1 viruses possess all the essential hallmarks of being highly adapted to infect humans ... Controlling the prevailing G4 EA H1N1 viruses in pigs and close monitoring of swine working populations should be promptly implemented.\\" Michael Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization (WHO) Health Emergencies Program, stated in July 2020 that this strain of influenza virus was not new and had been under surveillance since 2011. Almost 30,000 swine had been monitored via nasal swabs between 2011 and 2018. While other variants of the virus have appeared and diminished, the study claimed the G4 variant has sharply increased since 2016 to become the predominant strain. The Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs rebutted the study, saying that the media had interpreted the study \\"in an exaggerated and nonfactual way\\" and that the number of pigs sampled was too small to demonstrate G4 had become the dominant strain. Between 2016 and 2018, a serum surveillance program screened 338 swine production workers in China for exposure (presence of antibodies) to G4 EA H1N1 and found 35 (10.4%) positive. Among another 230 people screened who did not work in the swine industry, 10 (4.4%) were serum positive for antibodies indicating exposure. Two cases of infection caused by the G4 variant have been documented as of July 2020, with no confirmed cases of human-to-human transmission. Health officials (including Anthony Fauci) say the virus should be monitored, particularly among those in close contact with pigs, but it is not an immediate threat. There are no reported cases or evidence of the virus outside of China as of July 2020. H1N1 virus pandemic history A 2008 study discussed the evolutionary origin of the flu strain of swine origin (S-OIV). According to this study, the phylogenetic origin of the flu virus that caused the 2009 pandemics can be traced before 1918. Around 1918, the ancestral virus, of avian origin, crossed the species boundaries and infected humans as human H1N1. The same phenomenon took place soon after in America, where the human virus infected pigs; it led to the emergence of the H1N1 swine strain, which later became known as swine flu. Genetic coding of H1N1 shows it is a combination of segments of four influenza viruses forming a novel strain: *North American Swine (30.6%) ‚Äì pig origin *North American Avian (34.4%) ‚Äì bird origin *Human influenza strain (17.5%) *Euroasian swine (17.5%) ‚Äì Pig origin Quadruple genetic re-assortment ‚Äì coinfection with influenza viruses from diverse animal species. Due to coinfection, the viruses are able to interact, mutate, and form a new strain to which host has variable immunity. New events of reassortment were not reported until 1968, when the avian strain H1N1 infected humans again; this time the virus met the strain H2N2, and the reassortment originated the strain H3N2. This strain has remained as a stable flu strain until now. The mid-1970s were important for the evolution of flu strains. First, the re-emergence of the human H1N1 strain became a seasonal strain. Then, a small outbreak of swine H1N1 occurred in humans, and finally, the human H2N2 strain apparently became extinct. Around 1979, the avian H1N1 strain infected pigs and gave rise to Euroasiatic swine flu and H1N1 Euroasiatic swine virus, which is still being transmitted in swine populations. The critical moment for the 2009 outbreak was between 1990 and 1993. A triple reassortment event in a pig host of North American H1N1 swine virus, the human H3N2 virus and avian H1N1 virus generated the swine H1N2 strain. In 2009, when the virus H1N2 co-infected a human host at the same time as the Euroasiatic H1N1 swine strain a new human H1N1 strain emerged, which caused the 2009 pandemic. Swine flu spread very rapidly worldwide due to its high human-to-human transmission rate and due to the frequency of air travel.Choffnes, Eileen R., Alison Mack, and David A. Relman. \\"The Domestic and International Impacts of the 2009‚ÄìH1N1 Influenza a Pandemic: Global Challenges, Global Solutions : Workshop Summary\\". Washington, DC: National Academies, 2010. Print.

It is made of ferromagnetic metal such as iron, or ferrimagnetic compounds such as ferrites. The high permeability, relative to the surrounding air, causes the magnetic field lines to be concentrated in the core material. The magnetic field is often created by a current-carrying coil of wire around the core. The use of a magnetic core can increase the strength of magnetic field in an electromagnetic coil by a factor of several hundred times what it would be without the core. However, magnetic cores have side effects which must be taken into account. In alternating current (AC) devices they cause energy losses, called core losses, due to hysteresis and eddy currents in applications such as transformers and inductors. \\"Soft\\" magnetic materials with low coercivity and hysteresis, such as silicon steel, or ferrite, are usually used in cores.  Core materials  An electric current through a wire wound into a coil creates a magnetic field through the center of the coil, due to Ampere's circuital law. Coils are widely used in electronic components such as electromagnets, inductors, transformers, electric motors and generators. A coil without a magnetic core is called an \\"air core\\" coil. Adding a piece of ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic material in the center of the coil can increase the magnetic field by hundreds or thousands of times; this is called a magnetic core. The field of the wire penetrates the core material, magnetizing it, so that the strong magnetic field of the core adds to the field created by the wire. The amount that the magnetic field is increased by the core depends on the magnetic permeability of the core material. Because side effects such as eddy currents and hysteresis can cause frequency-dependent energy losses, different core materials are used for coils used at different frequencies. In some cases the losses are undesirable and with very strong fields saturation can be a problem, and an 'air core' is used. A former may still be used; a piece of material, such as plastic or a composite, that may not have any significant magnetic permeability but which simply holds the coils of wires in place. Solid metals Soft iron = \\"Soft\\" (annealed) iron is used in magnetic assemblies, direct current (DC) electromagnets and in some electric motors; and it can create a concentrated field that is as much as 50,000 times more intense than an air core. Iron is desirable to make magnetic cores, as it can withstand high levels of magnetic field without saturating (up to 2.16 teslas at ambient temperature.Daniel Sadarnac, Les composants magn√©tiques de l'√©lectronique de puissance, cours de Sup√©lec, mars 2001 [in french]) Annealed iron is used because, unlike \\"hard\\" iron, it has low coercivity and so does not remain magnetised when the field is removed, which is often important in applications where the magnetic field is required to be repeatedly switched. Due to the electrical conductivity of the metal, when a solid one-piece metal core is used in alternating current (AC) applications such as transformers and inductors, the changing magnetic field induces large eddy currents circulating within it, closed loops of electric current in planes perpendicular to the field. The current flowing through the resistance of the metal heats it by Joule heating, causing significant power losses. Therefore, solid iron cores are not used in transformers or inductors, they are replaced by laminated or powdered iron cores, or nonconductive cores like ferrite. = Laminated silicon steel = (left) Eddy currents (I, red) within a solid iron transformer core. (right) Making the core out of thin laminations parallel to the field (B, green) with insulation between them reduces the eddy currents. In this diagram the field and currents are shown in one direction, but they actually reverse direction with the alternating current in the transformer winding. In order to reduce the eddy current losses mentioned above, most low frequency power transformers and inductors use laminated cores, made of stacks of thin sheets of silicon steel:  Lamination  Typical EI Lamination. Laminated magnetic cores are made of stacks of thin iron sheets coated with an insulating layer, lying as much as possible parallel with the lines of flux. The layers of insulation serve as a barrier to eddy currents, so eddy currents can only flow in narrow loops within the thickness of each single lamination. Since the current in an eddy current loop is proportional to the area of the loop, this prevents most of the current from flowing, reducing eddy currents to a very small level. Since power dissipated is proportional to the square of the current, breaking a large core into narrow laminations reduces the power losses drastically. From this, it can be seen that the thinner the laminations, the lower the eddy current losses.  Silicon alloying  A small addition of silicon to iron (around 3%) results in a dramatic increase of the resistivity of the metal, up to four times higher. The higher resistivity reduces the eddy currents, so silicon steel is used in transformer cores. Further increase in silicon concentration impairs the steel's mechanical properties, causing difficulties for rolling due to brittleness. Among the two types of silicon steel, grain-oriented (GO) and grain non-oriented (GNO), GO is most desirable for magnetic cores. It is anisotropic, offering better magnetic properties than GNO in one direction. As the magnetic field in inductor and transformer cores is always along the same direction, it is an advantage to use grain oriented steel in the preferred orientation. Rotating machines, where the direction of the magnetic field can change, gain no benefit from grain- oriented steel. = Special alloys = A family of specialized alloys exists for magnetic core applications. Examples are mu-metal, permalloy, and supermalloy. They can be manufactured as stampings or as long ribbons for tape wound cores. Some alloys, e.g. Sendust, are manufactured as powder and sintered to shape. Many materials require careful heat treatment to reach their magnetic properties, and lose them when subjected to mechanical or thermal abuse. For example, the permeability of mu-metal increases about 40 times after annealing in hydrogen atmosphere in a magnetic field; subsequent sharper bends disrupt its grain alignment, leading to localized loss of permeability; this can be regained by repeating the annealing step. = Vitreous metal = Amorphous metal is a variety of alloys (e.g. Metglas) that are non-crystalline or glassy. These are being used to create high-efficiency transformers. The materials can be highly responsive to magnetic fields for low hysteresis losses, and they can also have lower conductivity to reduce eddy current losses. Power utilities are currently making widespread use of these transformers for new installations. Powdered metals Powder cores consist of metal grains mixed with a suitable organic or inorganic binder, and pressed to desired density. Higher density is achieved with higher pressure and lower amount of binder. Higher density cores have higher permeability, but lower resistance and therefore higher losses due to eddy currents. Finer particles allow operation at higher frequencies, as the eddy currents are mostly restricted to within the individual grains. Coating of the particles with an insulating layer, or their separation with a thin layer of a binder, lowers the eddy current losses. Presence of larger particles can degrade high- frequency performance. Permeability is influenced by the spacing between the grains, which form distributed air gap; the less gap, the higher permeability and the less-soft saturation. Due to large difference of densities, even a small amount of binder, weight-wise, can significantly increase the volume and therefore intergrain spacing. Lower permeability materials are better suited for higher frequencies, due to balancing of core and winding losses. The surface of the particles is often oxidized and coated with a phosphate layer, to provide them with mutual electrical insulation. = Iron = Powdered iron is the cheapest material. It has higher core loss than the more advanced alloys, but this can be compensated for by making the core bigger; it is advantageous where cost is more important than mass and size. Saturation flux of about 1 to 1.5 tesla. Relatively high hysteresis and eddy current loss, operation limited to lower frequencies (approx. below 100 kHz). Used in energy storage inductors, DC output chokes, differential mode chokes, triac regulator chokes, chokes for power factor correction, resonant inductors, and pulse and flyback transformers. The binder used is usually epoxy or other organic resin, susceptible to thermal aging. At higher temperatures, typically above 125 ¬∞C, the binder degrades and the core magnetic properties may change. With more heat-resistant binders the cores can be used up to 200 ¬∞C. Iron powder cores are most commonly available as toroids. Sometimes as E, EI, and rods or blocks, used primarily in high-power and high-current parts. Carbonyl iron is significantly more expensive than hydrogen-reduced iron.  Carbonyl iron  Powdered cores made of carbonyl iron, a highly pure iron, have high stability of parameters across a wide range of temperatures and magnetic flux levels, with excellent Q factors between 50 kHz and 200 MHz. Carbonyl iron powders are basically constituted of micrometer-size spheres of iron coated in a thin layer of electrical insulation. This is equivalent to a microscopic laminated magnetic circuit (see silicon steel, above), hence reducing the eddy currents, particularly at very high frequencies. Carbonyl iron has lower losses than hydrogen-reduced iron, but also lower permeability. A popular application of carbonyl iron-based magnetic cores is in high-frequency and broadband inductors and transformers, especially higher power ones. Carbonyl iron cores are often called \\"RF cores\\". The as-prepared particles, \\"E-type\\"and have onion-like skin, with concentric shells separated with a gap. They contain significant amount of carbon. They behave as much smaller than what their outer size would suggest. The \\"C-type\\" particles can be prepared by heating the E-type ones in hydrogen atmosphere at 400 ¬∞C for prolonged time, resulting in carbon-free powders.  Hydrogen-reduced iron  Powdered cores made of hydrogen reduced iron have higher permeability but lower Q than carbonyl iron. They are used mostly for electromagnetic interference filters and low-frequency chokes, mainly in switched-mode power supplies. Hydrogen- reduced iron cores are often called \\"power cores\\". = MPP (molypermalloy) = An alloy of about 2% molybdenum, 81% nickel, and 17% iron. Very low core loss, low hysteresis and therefore low signal distortion. Very good temperature stability. High cost. Maximum saturation flux of about 0.8 tesla. Used in high-Q filters, resonant circuits, loading coils, transformers, chokes, etc. The material was first introduced in 1940, used in loading coils to compensate capacitance in long telephone lines. It is usable up to about 200 kHz to 1 MHz, depending on vendor. It is still used in above-ground telephone lines, due to its temperature stability. Underground lines, where temperature is more stable, tend to use ferrite cores due to their lower cost. = High-flux (Ni-Fe) = An alloy of about 50‚Äì50% of nickel and iron. High energy storage, saturation flux density of about 1.5 tesla. Residual flux density near zero. Used in applications with high DC current bias (line noise filters, or inductors in switching regulators) or where low residual flux density is needed (e.g. pulse and flyback transformers, the high saturation is suitable for unipolar drive), especially where space is constrained. The material is usable up to about 200 kHz. = Sendust, KoolMU = An alloy of 6% aluminium, 9% silicon, and 85% iron. Core losses higher than MPP. Very low magnetostriction, makes low audio noise. Loses inductance with increasing temperature, unlike the other materials; can be exploited by combining with other materials as a composite core, for temperature compensation. Saturation flux of about 1 tesla. Good temperature stability. Used in switching power supplies, pulse and flyback transformers, in-line noise filters, swing chokes, and in filters in phase-fired controllers (e.g. dimmers) where low acoustic noise is important. Absence of nickel results in easier processing of the material and its lower cost than both high-flux and MPP. The material was invented in Japan in 1936. It is usable up to about 500 kHz to 1 MHz, depending on vendor. = Nanocrystalline = A nanocrystalline alloy of a standard iron-boron-silicon alloy, with addition of smaller amounts of copper and niobium. The grain size of the powder reaches down to 10-100 nanometers. The material has very good performance at lower frequencies. It is used in chokes for inverters and in high power applications. It is available under names like e.g. Nanoperm, Vitroperm, Hitperm and Finemet. Ceramics Ferrite = Ferrite ceramics are used for high-frequency applications. The ferrite materials can be engineered with a wide range of parameters. As ceramics, they are essentially insulators, which prevents eddy currents, although losses such as hysteresis losses can still occur.  Air  A coil not containing a magnetic core is called an air core. This includes coils wound on a plastic or ceramic form in addition to those made of stiff wire that are self-supporting and have air inside them. Air core coils generally have a much lower inductance than similarly sized ferromagnetic core coils, but are used in radio frequency circuits to prevent energy losses called core losses that occur in magnetic cores. The absence of normal core losses permits a higher Q factor, so air core coils are used in high frequency resonant circuits, such as up to a few megahertz. However, losses such as proximity effect and dielectric losses are still present. Air cores are also used when field strengths above around 2 Tesla are required as they are not subject to saturation.  Commonly used structures = Straight cylindrical rod  Ferrite rods are simple cylinders of ferrite that can be wound around. Most commonly made of ferrite or powdered iron, and used in radios especially for tuning an inductor. The coil is wound around the rod, or a coil form with the rod inside. Moving the rod in or out of the coil changes the flux through the coil, and can be used to adjust the inductance. Often the rod is threaded to allow adjustment with a screwdriver. In radio circuits, a blob of wax or resin is used once the inductor has been tuned to prevent the core from moving. The presence of the high permeability core increases the inductance, but the magnetic field lines must still pass through the air from one end of the rod to the other. The air path ensures that the inductor remains linear. In this type of inductor radiation occurs at the end of the rod and electromagnetic interference may be a problem in some circumstances.  Single \\"I\\" core  Like a cylindrical rod but square, rarely used on its own. This type of core is most likely to be found in car ignition coils.  \\"C\\" or \\"U\\" core  U and C-shaped cores are used with I or another C or U core to make a square closed core, the simplest closed core shape. Windings may be put on one or both legs of the core.  \\"E\\" core  E-shaped core are more symmetric solutions to form a closed magnetic system. Most of the time, the electric circuit is wound around the center leg, whose section area is twice that of each individual outer leg. In 3-phase transformer cores, the legs are of equal size, and all three legs are wound. = \\"E\\" and \\"I\\" core = Sheets of suitable iron stamped out in shapes like the (sans-serif) letters \\"E\\" and \\"I\\", are stacked with the \\"I\\" against the open end of the \\"E\\" to form a 3-legged structure. Coils can be wound around any leg, but usually the center leg is used. This type of core is frequently used for power transformers, autotransformers, and inductors. = Pair of \\"E\\" cores = Again used for iron cores. Similar to using an \\"E\\" and \\"I\\" together, a pair of \\"E\\" cores will accommodate a larger coil former and can produce a larger inductor or transformer. If an air gap is required, the centre leg of the \\"E\\" is shortened so that the air gap sits in the middle of the coil to minimize fringing and reduce electromagnetic interference.  Planar core  A planar core consists of two flat pieces of magnetic material, one above and one below the coil. It is typically used with a flat coil that is part of a printed circuit board. This design is excellent for mass production and allows a high power, small volume transformer to be constructed for low cost. It is not as ideal as either a pot core or toroidal core but costs less to produce.  Pot core  Usually ferrite or similar. This is used for inductors and transformers. The shape of a pot core is round with an internal hollow that almost completely encloses the coil. Usually a pot core is made in two halves which fit together around a coil former (bobbin). This design of core has a shielding effect, preventing radiation and reducing electromagnetic interference.  Toroidal core  This design is based on a toroid (the same shape as a doughnut). The coil is wound through the hole in the torus and around the outside. An ideal coil is distributed evenly all around the circumference of the torus. The symmetry of this geometry creates a magnetic field of circular loops inside the core, and the lack of sharp bends will constrain virtually all of the field to the core material. This not only makes a highly efficient transformer, but also reduces the electromagnetic interference radiated by the coil. A toroidal core It is popular for applications where the desirable features are: high specific power per mass and volume, low mains hum, and minimal electromagnetic interference. One such application is the power supply for a hi-fi audio amplifier. The main drawback that limits their use for general purpose applications is the inherent difficulty of winding wire through the center of a torus. Unlike a split core (a core made of two elements, like a pair of E cores), specialized machinery is required for automated winding of a toroidal core. Toroids have less audible noise, such as mains hum, because the magnetic forces do not exert bending moment on the core. The core is only in compression or tension, and the circular shape is more stable mechanically.  Ring or bead  ferrite rod with connection wires glued to the ends. On the right, a molded ferrite rod with holes, with a single wire threaded through the holes. A ferrite ring on a computer data cable. The ring is essentially identical in shape and performance to the toroid, except that inductors commonly pass only through the center of the core, without wrapping around the core multiple times. The ring core may also be composed of two separate C-shaped hemispheres secured together within a plastic shell, permitting it to be placed on finished cables with large connectors already installed, that would prevent threading the cable through the small inner diameter of a solid ring.  AL value  The AL value of a core configuration is frequently specified by manufacturers. The relationship between inductance and AL number in the linear portion of the magnetisation curve is defined to be: :L = n^2 A_L where n is the number of turns, L is the inductance (e.g. in nH) and AL is expressed in inductance per turn squared (e.g. in nH/n2).http://www.jmag- international.com/catalog/101_ChokeCoil_CurrentCharacteristic.html, AL Value  Core loss  When the core is subjected to a changing magnetic field, as it is in devices that use AC current such as transformers, inductors, and AC motors and alternators, some of the power that would ideally be transferred through the device is lost in the core, dissipated as heat and sometimes noise. Core loss is commonly termed iron loss in contradistinction to copper loss, the loss in the windings. Iron losses are often described as being in three categories: Hysteresis losses When the magnetic field through the core changes, the magnetization of the core material changes by expansion and contraction of the tiny magnetic domains it is composed of, due to movement of the domain walls. This process causes losses, because the domain walls get \\"snagged\\" on defects in the crystal structure and then \\"snap\\" past them, dissipating energy as heat. This is called hysteresis loss. It can be seen in the graph of the B field versus the H field for the material, which has the form of a closed loop. The net energy that flows into the inductor expressed in relationship to the B-H characteristic of the core is shown by the equation :W=\\\\int{\\\\left(nA_c\\\\frac{dB(t)}{t}\\\\right)\\\\left(\\\\frac{H(t)l_m}{n}\\\\right)dt}=(A_cl_m)\\\\int{HdB} This equation shows that the amount of energy lost in the material in one cycle of the applied field is proportional to the area inside the hysteresis loop. Since the energy lost in each cycle is constant, hysteresis power losses increase proportionally with frequency. The final equation for the hysteresis power loss is :P_H=(f)(A_cl_m)\\\\int{HdB} Eddy-current losses If the core is electrically conductive, the changing magnetic field induces circulating loops of current in it, called eddy currents, due to electromagnetic induction. The loops flow perpendicular to the magnetic field axis. The energy of the currents is dissipated as heat in the resistance of the core material. The power loss is proportional to the area of the loops and inversely proportional to the resistivity of the core material. Eddy current losses can be reduced by making the core out of thin laminations which have an insulating coating, or alternatively, making the core of a magnetic material with high electrical resistance, like ferrite. Most magnetic cores intended for power converter application use ferrite cores for this reason. Anomalous losses By definition, this category includes any losses in addition to eddy-current and hysteresis losses. This can also be described as broadening of the hysteresis loop with frequency. Physical mechanisms for anomalous loss include localized eddy-current effects near moving domain walls.  Legg's equation  An equation known as Legg's equation models the magnetic material core loss at low flux densities. The equation has three loss components: hysteresis, residual, and eddy current, and it is given by :\\\\frac{R_{\\\\text{ac}}}{\\\\mu L} = a B_{\\\\text{max}} f + c f + e f^2 where * R_{ac} is the effective core loss resistance (ohms), * \\\\mu is the material permeability, * L is the inductance (henrys), * a is the hysteresis loss coefficient, * B_{\\\\text{max}} is the maximum flux density (gauss), * c is the residual loss coefficient, * f is the frequency (hertz), and * e is the eddy loss coefficient.  Steinmetz coefficients  Losses in magnetic materials can be characterized by the Steinmetz coefficients, which however do not take into account temperature variability. Material manufacturers provide data on core losses in tabular and graphical form for practical conditions of use.

Early life He was born William Robert Bellenie, in Newington, Surrey, England, in 1869. Around 1900, he adopted the name William Bellenie-Walker, eventually dropping the Bellenie part to be known as Walker. Diving career In 1887, Walker began diver training at Portsmouth Dockyard. He worked through the roles of diver's attendant and diver's signal man, passing his medical exam and deep-water test to qualify as a deep-water diver in 1892. In his time, William Walker was the most experienced diver of Siebe Gorman Ltd. Between 1906 and 1911, working in water up to a depth of six metres (20 feet), he shored up Winchester Cathedral, using more than 25,800 bags of concrete, 114,900 concrete blocks, and 900,000 bricks. Winchester cathedral Before his work, the cathedral had been in imminent danger of collapse as it sank slowly into the ground, which consisted of peat. To enable bricklayers to build supporting walls, the groundwater level had to be lowered. Normally, the removal of the groundwater would have caused the collapse of the building. So, to give temporary support to the foundation walls, some 235 pits were dug along the southern and eastern sides of the building, each about six metres deep. Walker went down and shored up the walls by putting concrete underneath them. He worked six hours a day‚Äîin complete darkness, because the sediment suspended in the water was impenetrable to light. After Walker finished his work, the groundwater was pumped out and the concrete he had placed bore the foundation walls. Conventional bricklayers then were able to do their work in the usual way and restore the damaged walls. During the latter part of his time working at Winchester, Walker cycled home, 70 miles to South Norwood, at weekends returning by train on the Monday. To celebrate the completion of the work, a thanksgiving service, led by the Archbishop of Canterbury, was held on 15 July 1912. At this, Walker was presented with a silver rose bowl by King George V. Newspaper reports at the time remarked that this was the second time Walker had met George V, the first being when the king was a naval cadet and Walker was his diving instructor. Later, Walker was honoured by being appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO). An interview that Walker gave to the Hampshire Observer in 1911 gives insight into his work. In it, Walker reveals that, unlike some other divers, he had never worked on any treasure dives. Other aspects of his work: * Rescue work, December 1896, at the River Level Colliery at Abernant, near Aberdare Wales, when the pit was flooded and six men and boys drowned. * Work on the building of the Blackwall Tunnel, 1891‚Äì1897. * Being foreman in charge of works on the construction of the new naval docks in Gibraltar. * Work on the construction of the jetty for the Royal Victoria Dock Granary, 1905. * Emergency work, which called him away from Winchester, on the wreck of the SS Dordone in Newport. * Work with Sir Leonard Hill developing linear decompression tables. Statuette of Walker at Winchester Cathedral Part of the interview article: \\"In cold water diving he [William] explained what a man has to contend with is the pressure\\". At Gibraltar he says: \\"Two of my men died through pressure of water\\". In response to questions about his work on Winchester, William says \\"It was not difficult. It was straightforward work, but had to be carefully done\\". He went on to say that Mr. Jackson had told him that he was very pleased with the work and that he had done what no other man had done‚Äîthat he had laid the foundation of a whole cathedral. Walker said \\"I am proud of the honour\\". A commemoration service was held at Winchester Cathedral, 100 years after he died. Family and death Walker married twice. His first wife died before he began work at Winchester. He married his second wife, sister of his first, in 1907, and had several children during his years working at Winchester. Walker died during the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918 and is buried in Beckenham Crematorium and Cemetery, London. His grave bears the words: \\"The diver who with his own hands saved Winchester Cathedral.\\" Legacy A small statue of Walker is displayed in the Cathedral, near the shrine of St Swithun and the remains of King Canute. Until May 2001 the statue was one mistakenly modelled on the project's consultant engineer, Francis Fox. There is also a bust of Walker in the Cathedral gardens. A public house in Winchester is also named after him. There is a plaque commemorating him on 118 Portland Road, South Norwood where he lived. A service of remembrance for Walker, was held at the Cathedral in October 2018. An exhibition about Walker ran until 31 October.

This end position illustrates a trump squeeze play. Hearts are trumps, and the lead is in the North hand. Declarer plays the A (the squeeze card), discarding the 3 from hand, and East has no good discard. If East plays a spade, declarer cashes the A to set up the spade suit, which he can reach with a club ruff after cashing North's K. If East plays a club, declarer cashes the K, ruffs a club, and has the Ace of spades as an entry to dummy. Here is perhaps the simplest possible example. Assume hearts are trump and both red suit Aces have been played. When declarer leads the A from North, East must drop his guard in one of the minor suits. If he discards a diamond, then declarer ruffs a diamond, setting up the suit and takes the last two tricks with the A and the J. If East instead discards a club, South cashes the A, ruffs a diamond and enjoys the J for the final trick. This shows all the elements clearly: {*A blocked threat in Suit A (the two clubs in the South hand) that is accompanied by a trump, which will provide the means of reaching the blocked threat if it becomes good because the defender drops his Suit A guard; *a second threat in Suit B in the other hand that can be established by ruffing if the defender drops his guard in Suit B (the two diamonds in the North hand); and *a single defender guarding both threats. } The North card that blocks the Suit A threat (A) provides the means of reaching the Suit B threat if it becomes good via ruffing. The key elements are: * A suit that declarer can ruff to set up extra tricks * An entry to another suit which can also yield extra tricks * One defender who guards both suits Another example illustrates the squeeze card (a trump) being led from South (declarer) and East being squeezed. Spades are trump and the lead of the 8 squeezes East after South discards a small diamond from dummy. The Q is the blocked threat and clubs can be established by ruffing if the squeezee discards a club. If East discards a club, South will play the Ace and King of clubs, ruff the third round of that suit and then return to dummy with the A to cash the established club. If East instead elects to bare his K, South will play the two top clubs and the A, dropping the K and then ruffing a club back to hand to win his Q. If West guards both minor suits, the trump squeeze is not necessary (although it will still work). South can simply play the two top clubs, ruff a club back to hand and then lead the final trump as the squeeze card, catching West in a simple positional squeeze. A very rare example is the double trump squeeze, where both opponents suffer the same fate. Here is an example from the quarterfinals of the 2004 Olympiad, in the match between Italy and the USA. Declarer, Norberto Bocchi of Italy, declared 4 and achieved the following end position with the lead in dummy: Declarer led the Ace of hearts from dummy, discarding the 8, and the defence had no answer. If both pitched spades, declarer could play the Ace and King of spades, establishing the ten. If both pitched diamonds, a spade to the Ace and a diamond ruff would establish the Queen. If one pitched a spade and the other a diamond, then declarer's play depended on who released the diamond guard. If it were West, a spade to the Ace and a ruff of the Ten of diamonds would set up the Queen. If it were East, a spade to the Ace and a lead of the Queen of diamonds would smother the Jack and create a ruffing finesse position, since declarer has the Ten (if West covers, declarer will ruff; if West ducks the Queen, declarer will discard from dummy and then ruff the Ten). At the table, East (Michael Rosenberg) discarded a spade and West (Zia Mahmood) had to release his low diamond. Bocchi played a spade to reach his hand, then ruffed his low diamond, dropping the King from Zia and then made his Queen when he returned to hand with a high spade.See BIL Xmas Tournament writeup, at http://www.todheugh.plus.com/paul/bbo/xmas04.pdf Note that the squeeze was not automatic; if the East-West diamond holdings are reversed, the squeeze will fail, as it will if West holds King-Jack doubleton. Bocchi understood that his only chance was to find West (Zia) with the King- doubleton and East (Rosenberg) with the Jack-doubleton. He read the situation accurately when West discarded the seven of diamonds and made the only play that gave him a chance.

He helped popularise Ramist logic in the English language. Fenner was also one of the first theologians to use the term \\"covenant of works\\" to describe God's relationship with Adam in the Book of Genesis. Life He was born in Kent and educated at Peterhouse, Cambridge. There he became an adherent of Thomas Cartwright, and publicly expounded his presbyterian views, with the result that he was obliged to leave Cambridge without taking his degree. For some months he seems to have assisted the vicar of Cranbrook, Kent, but it is doubtful whether he received ordination. He next followed Cartwright to Antwerp, and, having received ordination according to rite of the Reformed church, assisted Cartwright for several years in preaching to the English congregation there. The leniency shown by Archbishop Grindal to puritans encouraged him to return to England, and he became curate of Cranbrook in 1583. In the same year, however, he was one of seventeen Kentish ministers suspended for refusing to sign an acknowledgement of the Queen's supremacy and of the authority of the Prayer Book and articles. He was imprisoned for a time, but eventually regained his liberty and spent the remainder of his life as chaplain in the Reformed church at Middelburg. Works A list of his authentic works is given in Cooper's Athenae Cantabrigienses (Cambridge, 1858-1861). They rank among the best expositions of the principles of Puritanism. His textbook, The Arts of Logic and Rhetoric, was a popular textbook on the Ramist school of logic; it used Scripture passages to demonstrate his theories. His major work was Sacra theologia (Geneva, 1585).

He was one of the most important Hungarian generals of the Hungarian War of Independence of 1848‚Äì1849, politician, member of the Hungarian Parliament, and deputy War Minister.

Here he was sent as lieutenant to the Border Region Division, but soon he disarmed. In 1847 he thought to go to India and to become an officer in the army of one of the Indian kings, but hearing the news about the revolution from Paris from February 1848 he decided to remain in Hungary. His military career in the Hungarian War of Independence= Before becoming a general  After the victory, on 15 March, of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, Klapka volunteered in the Hungarian army, and he was conscripted as Captain. In May 1848 he was appointed by Batthy√°ny Government with two Hungarian officers to go to Kolozsv√°r and in the Sz√©kely Land to find out if Transylvania want to reunite with Hungary, and to measure how many from the Sz√©kely border guard units can be sent to Hungary. On 13 June he is appointed as a Captain to the 16 Hungarian Battalion in Veszpr√©m. Starting with August he joins the Hungarian military operations in B√°cska (Southern Hungary) against the Serbian insurgents. On 25 September he is sent to be the temporary director of the fortification works of the fortress of Kom√°rom, called the Gibraltar of the Danube. During that time he prevented Wilhelm Mertz, the constable of the fortress, to deliver it in the hands of the Habsburgs, and played a role in forcing Mertz and the officers loyals to the Habsburgs, to leave Kom√°rom, securing this very important stronghold for Hungary. From 16 October 1848 Klapka supervised also the fortification works from Pozsony. During that time, as the commander of the concentrated Hungarian national guards, he participate in the military operations against the Austrian troops led by Balthasar von Simunich which broke into Hungary from Moravia. On 13 November he is appointed chief of general staff of the B√°ns√°g army corps, and together with general Antal Vetter, he elaborates a plan to crush the Serbian insurgency, but this plan fails because its weak execution by the main commander of the military operations: general Ern≈ë Kiss. In the end of December 1848 he works in the general staff section of the Hungarian Ministry of Defence. When in December 1848 the main Austrian imperial troops led by Field Marshal Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Gr√§tz attacked Hungary, he is appointed as Major in the Hungarian army, by 9 January 1849 he is already a Colonel. Together with his chief Antal Vetter he elaborates the plan of retreating the main Hungarian troops behind the Tisza river, and becomes the commander of the Upper Tisza Corps (Fels≈ë- tiszai hadtest). Scene from the Battle of Bodrogkereszt√∫r 23 January 1849 This map shows the successful defensive actions of Klapa in stopping Schlik's crossing of the Tisza river. Before this the Upper Tisza Corps was led by the Minister of War General L√°z√°r M√©sz√°ros, who was defeated by the Austrian troops led by Lieutenant-General Franz Schlik in the Battle of Kassa.. Klapka took over these beaten troops in January 1849, reorganized them, and beat Schlik in three consecutive battles at Tarcal (20 January), Bodrogkereszt√∫r (23 January), and Tokaj (31 January). Thanks to these victories Klapka held the Hungarian defensive line along the Tisza river, and won precious time for the Hungarian commandment to organize the counter-attack against Windisch- Gr√§tz imperial troops. From 29 January 1849 he is under the command of Lieutenant-General Henryk Dembi≈Ñski the main commander of the Hungarian armies. After their victory at 5 February 1849 in the Battle of Branyiszk√≥, the Upper Danube Corps led by Art√∫r G√∂rgei approached to the Tisza river from North-West, menacing, together with Klapka's corps, to encircle and destroy Schlik's army.. Understanding the importance of this chance, Klapka tried to convince Dembi≈Ñski, to attack from the South Schlik's corps, but the latter refused, ordering Klapka to retreat. This wrong decision of the main commander enabled Schlik to escape the danger, and to retreat. Klapka defeated him again on 8 February at Hidasn√©meti, but the Austrian general was able to retreat towards West, joining the main imperial troops led by Windisch-Gr√§tz. Klapka participated at 26‚Äì27 February in the Battle of K√°polna, commanding the right wing of the Hungarian army at Verpel√©t. The battle was lost because of Dembi≈Ñski's poor army leading and indecision. After Dembi≈Ñski's order of retreat, at 1 March Klapka fought successful rearguard actions against the Austrian corps led by Ladislaus von Wrbna at Egerfarmos. At 3 March he joins the revolt at Tiszaf√ºred of the Hungarian officers dissatisfied with Dembi≈Ñski's leadership, and force him to resign, supporting G√∂rgei's election to the main commandment. For his victories against Schlik he receives the 2d Class Hungarian Military Decoration.  General and deputy War Minister  At 28 March, only 29, he received the rank of General. Klapka elaborated the plan of the Spring Campaign of the Hungarian army, which will bring in the end of May, after a series of victories, the liberation of almost all Hungary from the Austrian armies. The plans main purpose was to distract the attention of the Austrian commanders with the attack from the North of the VII Corps, while the other three corps (I, II, III) had to march undetected from South and to attack from the flank the main Austrian troops stationed at G√∂d√∂ll≈ë. The map of the first phase of the Spring Campaign, its plan being elaborated by Gy√∂rgy KlapkaBut unfortunately Klapka was the one who, unwillingly revealed the plan to the enemy, as it follows. Initially the victory of the Hungarian VII Corps led by Andr√°s G√°sp√°r against Schlik in the Battle of Hatvan at 2 April, deceived Windisch-Gr√§tz to think that the attack of the Hungarian forces will come from that direction. But the failed attack of Klapka's I corps against the Austrian I Corps led by Josip Jelaƒçiƒá in the first phase of the Battle of T√°pi√≥bicske (he sent his troops in the city without scouting before that, to see if any enemy troops are in there, thus his troops were ambushed by an enemy infantry and a cavalry brigade),. forced the III corps led by J√°nos Damjanich to intervene, and to turn the tide of the battle - which could become a serious defeat for the Hungarians - in a victory, made the Austrian Field-Marshal suspicious, that the main Hungarian attack could come from other directions, and not from where he expected that. M√≥r Than: Cavalry fight in the battle of T√°pi√≥bicske But Jelaƒçiƒá's report, who, because of his vanity, wrote to Windisch-Gr√§tz that his troops won the battle of T√°pi√≥bicske, deceived him, to think that the Croatian general was attacked only by minor Hungarian forces, so he still was not sure from where to expect the enemies attack. Furthermore, Windisch-Gr√§tz was informed about the attack of a Hungarian detachment, on 24 March against Losonc, which took prisoner half of the 500-600 strong Austrian detachment, making him to think that important Hungarian troops will attack also from the North-East.. But Klapka's attack made Windisch-Gr√§tz aware of a danger coming from South, and this can be considered his error.. In the Battle of Isaszeg from 6 April, the first decisive battle of the Spring Campaign, after initial successes, Klapka's I Corps were pushed back by Jelaƒçiƒá's superior forces, which made Klapka to waver, and to think seriously to retreat from the battlefield, letting Damjanich's III Corps alone, but the arrival of G√∂rgei, and his order to resist at all costs, then the arrival of the II Corps led by Lajos Aulich, convinced him to remain and fight. At the end of the battle Klapka's I corps charge chased the enemy from Isaszeg and brought the victory for the Hungarians.. The fluctuating behavior of Klapka during the battle showed that despite of being a good strategist, creating good operation plans, which enabled, in the Spring Campaign, to defeat the superior imperial troops (55,000 Austrians against 47,500 Hungarians),. he could be hesitating in their execution. During the battle of Isaszeg Damjanich criticized Klapka of being too timorous and sensible to the complaints of his soldiers, instead of being resolute and determined, a quality necessary for every successful general. Luckily the main commander of Army of the Upper Danube (Feldunai Hadsereg) was G√∂rgei, who was the most able Hungarian general to carry out Klapka's plans, and he led the army in the best way, being able to take quickly the correct decisions after short thinking, being very determined in his decisions, showing no hesitation even before the most unexpected situations, and thanks to this the Hungarian army emerged victorious in the Spring Campaign.. The second phase of the campaign was elaborated not by Klapka but by the chief of the general staff, J√≥zsef Bayer.B√°nlaky J√≥zsef: A magyar nemzet hadt√∂rt√©nete XXI, A Kom√°rom felment√©s√©t c√©lz√≥ hadm≈±veletek (1849. √°prilis elej√©t≈ël v√©g√©ig). Arcanum Adatb√°zis Kft. 2001 During this phase of the Spring Campaign Klapka took part in the Battle of Nagysall√≥ (19 April), playing a leading role in that victory, in the same way as in the relief of Kom√°rom (26 April).

In the middle on a white horse is Gy√∂rgy Klapka, at left on a black horse is J√°nos Damjanich At 30 April 1849 he was named deputy War Minister substituting G√∂rgei, who was leading the Siege of Buda (04-21 May 1849). Quite in the first day in his office in Debrecen Klapka had a conflict with S√°ndor Pet≈ëfi, the Hungarian national poet, then a major in the Army of Transylvania under the command of Lieutenant General J√≥zef Bem. The cause of the conflict was the article written by Pet≈ëfi in the newspaper Honv√©d, in which he published a letter of Bem against general K√°roly V√©csey, accusing the latter of high treason, cowardice and incapacity, because he did not helped Bem in his failed attempt to capture the fortress of Temesv√°r.. Hearing about this Klapka and also other Hungarian generals, who were on V√©csey's side, accused Pet≈ëfi of being undisciplined, dressing not accordingly to a soldier, besmirching the Hungarian army to the public, thus weakening the will of the nation to fight against the enemy.. S√°ndor Pet≈ëfi as a Major in 1849 Klapka was angered on Pet≈ëfi also because the poet's former conflicts with other Hungarian officers and war ministers like Lieutenant General Antal Vetter and Lieutenant General L√°z√°r M√©sz√°ros (against whom he wrote also a satirical poem), so he dumped on the poet, who came to the war office to ask for permission to go to the freshly liberated Pest, to bury his father. At the end of the quarrel, seeing that Klapka would not allow him to go, Pet≈ëfi declared that he resigns from his military title and quits the army.. After this, thinking that now he is liberated from all military discipline rules, Pet≈ëfi wrote a letter to Klapka, declaring that he cannot bear the offenses from Klapka, which offended his dignity, and wrote a poem entitled Egy goromba t√°bornokra (About a Rude General), in which he named Klapka an unworthy man and a weak general.. Klapka prosecuted Pet≈ëfi for this, and when he met him at 14 May at Pest, he arrested the poet. Pet≈ëfi was saved by General G√∂rgei, whose favorite poet he was, liberating him from the arrest, sending a deputation made of officers to ask for pardon from Klapka in the name of Pet≈ëfi. In the middle of May 1849, the news about the upcoming Russian intervention spread throughout Hungary, and the need to take measure against this grave danger, became imminent.. The enemy had a huge numerical advantage against the Hungarian army: the attacking Russian and Austrian armies had 358 000 soldiers (plus other 75 000 soldiers in Galicia and Walachia in reserve) and 770 cannons against 150 000 Hungarian soldiers with 440 cannons.. In the second part of May, Klapka was designated to elaborate the united operation plan of all the armies from Hungary.. According to this operation plan the main army under G√∂rgei had to defend the Western border, while the army of Transylvania under J√≥zef Bem had to defend mountain passes in the Eastern Carpathians, but in the same time he had to crush also the Romanian revolt from the Western Carpathians, to take the fortresses of Gyulafeh√©rv√°r and D√©va, then to attack towards West, taking the Titel Plateau, liberating P√©terv√°rad, then advancing to the Adriatic Sea, or to the Western front. Although it was accepted by the Ministry Council from 20 May, this operation plan was met with harsh critics from G√∂rgei and Bem, who accused it with no concern to the imminent Russian intervention which menaced from North and from East, and that Lieutenant General Bem and General M√≥r Perczel had been designated to carry out military actions which exceeded their capacities, while the other Hungarian corps were condemned to almost complete inactivity.. Bem declared that he will not carry out the military actions entailed on him by this operation plan, and he will remain in Transylvania to defend it from the imminent Russian attack, while G√∂rgei said that the only correct thing to do in this grave situation, is to immediately attack with all forces on the Western front towards Vienna, to crush the Austrian army before the Russians could intervene. As the result of these reactions and the start of the Russian intervention on 15 June 1849, the operation plan elaborated by Klapka was not carried out. Cavalry skirmish around Als√≥ny√°rasd during the battle of Pered at 20 June 1849 In June, when G√∂rgei took over his duties in the War Ministry, Klapka substituted him in the command of the Army of the Upper Danube, being entrusted, together with the chief of the general staff Colonel J√≥zsef Bayer, to attack the imperial forces led by Field-Marshal Julius Jacob von Haynau in the region of the V√°g river, and push them towards Pozsony and Vienna, but at 16 June they were defeated by the Austrians in the battle of Zsig√°rd.. When G√∂rgei took over the main command, in the Battle of Pered from 20‚Äì21 June 1849, Klapka had the mission to attack with the VIII corps the Austrians in the Csall√≥k√∂z, but his troops were defeated at Ny√°rasd, and forced to retreat.. Nevertheless, at the end of the battle Klapka's troops secured the retreat of the Hungarian army, by securing the bridge from Asz√≥dpuszta.. During the Second Battle of Kom√°rom of 2 July, Klapka commanded the left wing of the Hungarian army, retreating initially from √ìsz≈ëny, but at the end of the battle, after fierce fighting, recaptured the important locality from the Austrian IV corps led by General Ludwig von Benedek.. At the end of this battle G√∂rgei was heavily wounded, and once again, Klapka took over the command from him, until he was again able to lead the army. During this period under the lead of Klapka, the Hungarian officers decided to oppose the decisions of the Hungarian government, which demanded the immediate retreat of the army from Kom√°rom, and the deposition of G√∂rgei from the commandment of the Army of the Upper Danube. Klapka and the officers refused to fulfill both these orders, forcing the government to accept their decision to remain for several days in Kom√°rom, and to keep G√∂rgei as their commander.. At 11 July, because G√∂rgei was still unable to lead the army, Klapka commanded the Hungarian forces in the Third Battle of Kom√°rom. The Hungarians tried to break the Austrian blockade from the West against Kom√°rom, but, because of the inactivity of two of the corps commanders, the battle was lost..  Klapka's heroical \\"last man standing\\" as the defender of Kom√°rom  On 12‚Äì13 July, when, under G√∂rgei's command, the Army of the Upper Danube retreated from Kom√°rom to the East Klapka remained with the II and VIII corps (around 18,300 soldiers) in Kom√°rom, having the duty to defend with all cost the fortress and to \\"bind\\" as many enemy troops around it, preventing them to participate in the campaign against the Hungarian armies.. The map of the fortress of Kom√°rom in 1849 As the captain of the encircled fortress, cut from the other Hungarian armies, Klapka decided to do a heroical fight against the superior enemy, to resist until nothing can be done, and if he would be forced to leave Kom√°rom, he would do it only with honor and head erect. He wrote this in July: I say it already from now: no matter what will be the situation, we can leave this place only with honor, or we will be buried together under the crumbling ruins of this [fortress]. Long live the Fatherland, and its heroic army!Zsolt K√°ntor Az 1848-1849-es forradalom √©s szabads√°gharc epil√≥gusa a kom√°romi er≈ëd kapitul√°ci√≥ja , (2016) Until 23 July this task was fulfilled with success, forcing 28,000 imperial soldiers to secure the fortress, but then half of these troops were sent to Pest.. On 25 July a Hungarian raiding unit captured a stagecoach in which they found documents containing the list of the imperial troops around Kom√°rom, from which Klapka understood that his troops from within the fortress are more numerous than the besiegers, and because the fact that the imperial troops were positioned on the both shores of the Danube, which prevented them to help each other when attacked, he had the opportunity to defeat the enemy in detail. A. Arnst: Gy√∂rgy Klapka leading the Hussars charge in the Fourth Battle of Kom√°rom at 3 August 1849 In the night of 29‚Äì30 June Klapka sent troops on the left bank of the Danube, chasing away the Austrian troops from the North-West of Kom√°rom. In the night of 3 August 1849, Klapka personally led the Hungarian troops to the right bank of the Danube, attacking the Austrian blockade around the fortress, crushing the imperial forces led by Lieutenant Field Marshal Anton Csorich in the Fourth Battle of Kom√°rom, causing them 1500 casualties, capturing 30 cannons, many thousands of riffles, ammunition and an entire herd of oxen.. This was the last important battle won by the Hungarians in the Hungarian War of Independence.. After the battle Klapka's troops advanced towards West and occupied the city of Gy≈ër, liberating a huge territory from North Transdanubia, cutting the connection and supply lines between Vienna and the troops led by Haynau in Central Hungary. Hearing the news of this victory the citizens of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r revolted against the occupying Austrian forces and chased them away.. Klapka started recruitment from the liberated territories, which added 5000-6000 new recruits to his troops, and planned to attack the Austrian province of Styria.. But on 11 August he received news about the disastrous situation on the other fronts, and he halted his operations. He understood that his victory came a little too late to change the fate of the Hungarian war of independence. Two days after this, at 13 August 1849, 10 days after Klapka's victory, the main Hungarian army led by Art√∫r G√∂rgei surrendered in front of the Russian troops at the Sz√∂ll≈ës Meadow near the village of Vil√°gos.. Klapka, together with his 25,000 soldiers, retreated on 15 August to Kom√°rom. On 19 August the Austrian and Russian troops arrived to the fortress and begun to encircle it, on 14 September the number of the Austrians reached 44,000 soldiers and 154 cannons, and the Russians numbered 12 000 soldiers and 56 cannons. The Austrians then the Russians too demanded the surrender of the fortress but Klapka and the Hungarian military council refused. Thanks to the intervention in the negotiations of the Habsburg Minister of Defense Ferenc Gyulay, himself a Hungarian, on 21 August a 14-day armistice was signed, which allowed to Klapka to send four commissioners to travel across all Hungary to ascertain about the military situation in the country, and to be sure that the Hungarian army had lost the Independence War. Gy√∂rgy Klapka by K√°roly Sterio After the commissioners turned back with the news of the surrender of the Hungarian armies and the majority of the fortresses, instead of deciding to surrender as well, like the Austrians and the Russians hoped, the defenders of Kom√°rom became more combative and wanted even more than before, to continue their fight. Klapka ordered new battalions and one division to be formed, and the trenches around the fortress to be strengthened. He even founded a personal guards unit made up of grenadiers. During the Austro-Russian siege the Hungarian composer B√©ni Egressy who was in the besieged Kom√°rom, wrote the Klapka March, in honor of the general. This military march is played often also today during the military parades in Hungary. The marchs lyrics, entitled Fel, fel vit√©zek a csat√°ra (Rise, Rise Soldiers to the Battle) were written much later, in 1861, by K√°lm√°n Thaly. At the end of August all of the mobile Hungarian troops surrendered, as well the fortresses too, with the exception of P√©terv√°rad, which held until 7 September.. Only the fortress of Kom√°rom refused to surrender. On 5, 7, 10, 25 and 27 September the Hungarian defenders fought with success against the enemy troops, furthermore the Hungarian Hussars executed successful sorties against the besieging army. For example, on 5 September 300 Hungarian hussars, led personally by Klapka, routed a Russian Cossack unit at Het√©ny. Seeing that they have no success in their attempts to take the fortress by force, the Austrians tried distraction, attempting to diminish the morale, fighting spirit and the unity of the defenders. They sent in the fortress different leaflets, fake reports, orders, which tried to persuade the defenders to treachery, to revolt, to refuse to fulfill the orders, or to desert, promising them amnesty in exchange. This method had a certain success, because the number of the desertions increased, and Klapka was forced to take more drastical measures against them. As a result, 15 Hungarian deserters were executed publicly in the main square of Kom√°rom. The Austrians even paid a hitman to assassinate Klapka. His name was Feh√©rhegyi, and allegedly he was born in New York. He was caught before he could assassinate Klapka. They found at him a letter of credence from the Austrian officer Lieutenant-Colonel Hoyos, which demonstrated that he worked for the Austrians. Feh√©rhegyi was sentenced to death by the martial court and executed. The siege of Kom√°rom in August‚ÄìSeptember 1849 by the Austrian and Russian troops The Austrians continued to send demands to surrender, and on 19 September the Hungarian military council of Kom√°rom decided to resume the talks with the Austrians. Some of the officers were against this and conjured against Klapka, but they were caught and put to jail. Klapka sent a demand to the besiegers demanding from the Austrians to give total amnesty for all people from Hungary, who participated in the revolution and in the War of Independence, and to liberate the war prisoners. Probably Klapka knew that these conditions could not be accepted, but he wanted to win time, hoping for a new Hungarian uprising or a foreign help. He also hoped that with these exaggerated demands he will be able to obtain at least amnesty for the defenders of Kom√°rom. This was rejected, Lieutenant Field Marshal Anton Csorich demanding unconditional surrender, so the Hungarians decided to continue the resistance. On 26 September the main commander of the Austrian froces Julius Jacob von Haynau arrived to Kom√°rom, took over the leadership of the besieging forces and ordered general attack against the fortress, but it was easily repulsed by the Hungarian artillery and a Hussar squadron.B√°nlaky J√≥zsef: A magyar nemzet hadt√∂rt√©nete XLIV, A kom√°romi esem√©nyek. 1849. j√∫lius k√∂zep√©t≈ël okt√≥ber elej√©ig.. Arcanum Adatb√°zis Kft. 2001 This was the last military engagement of the Hungarian War of Independence of 1848‚Äì1849. Haynau understood that taking Kom√°rom will be a very hard and very long task, and it will cause thousands of deaths among his troops, so he decided to seek a compromise with Klapka and the defenders. Vinzenz Katzler: General Gy√∂rgy Klapka surrendering the fortress of Kom√°rom to Field Marshall Jacob Julius von Haynau on 2 October 1849 Finally on 27 September 1849 the delegation of the defenders agreed with Field Marshal Haynau about the conditions of the capitulation of the fortress. These conditions were as follows: \\\\- The soldiers could leave without their arms, while the officers could leave retaining theirs; \\\\- Those officers who prior to the Hungarian War of Independence were in the Austrian army, received passport to leave the country; \\\\- Those who didn't wanted to leave, they could return home, without being prosecuted; \\\\- Those Hungarian officers who prior to the war were not in the Austrian army could return home, they were free to work in any profession, start businesses, but they were prohibited to be conscripted in the army again; \\\\- The former soldiers of the Habsburg armies received total amnesty; \\\\- Those who wanted to leave the country, had to ask for passports in 30 days; \\\\- The officers received payment for 30 days, while the simple soldiers for 10 days in Austrian banknotes; \\\\- The vouchers used as money by the soldiers and the people of Kom√°rom during the siege, will be redeemed in Austrian banknotes; \\\\- The crippled, the sick and the wounded people and soldiers which were in the hospitals of Kom√°rom will receive medical attendance; \\\\- Everybody will retain their personalities and realties. The amnesty given by the Austrians regarded only the soldiers. But Klapka knew that the civilian people, intellectuals or politicians, who lived or retreated in Kom√°rom, who participated in the Hungarian revolution and politics can be prosecuted by the Austrians after the surrender of Kom√°rom. So he gave to all of them military certificates. Between 2‚Äì5 October 1849 Klapka surrendered the fortress to Haynau, with this ending the Hungarian War of Independence.. On 2 October the Hungarian troops started to evacuate one by one the fortifications and different buildings of the fortress and the town. The soldiers formed lines before the Starfort (Csillager≈ëd), while the military orchestra played the Klapka March. Then came Klapka, who rode before their lines, then he stopped on the middle and said goodbye to them. Then the soldiers put their weapons in stacks, and took farewell from each other. At the end all of them received Geleitscheins (safe conduct papers), which assured for them their total freedom and immunity. At the end Klapka declared: Indeed, in the history of the 1848-1849 European revolutions only Kom√°rom and Venice put their weapons down with such favourable conditions. The capitulation of Kom√°rom was the last event from the Hungarian Revolution and War of Independence, and it was the last place in the European revolutions of 1848-1849, which ended the resistance against the united forces of the monarchies. So the capitulation of Kom√°rom by Klapka was the last event of the European 1848-49 Revolutions. Exile Klapka left the country at once, and lived thenceforward for many years in exile, at first in England and afterwards chiefly in Switzerland. He became a Swiss citizen, he settled in Geneva and started to work in the finances. He went to Istanbul, working at a bank. He continued by every means in his power to work for the independence of Hungary, especially at moments of European war, such as 1854, 1859 and 1866, at which an appeal to arms seemed to him to promise success.\\"C.C. Giurescu (ed.), 1972, Romania's History in Data, Bucharest, Romanian Encyclopedic Publishing, p. 207 Using his international reputation as great Hungarian general, won in the press of the European countries became a sort of \\"wandering ambassador\\" of the Hungarian cause, trying to win supporters to start a new Hungarian freedom war. The old Gy√∂rgy Klapka He tried to create an alliance with the states and nations which were neighbours with Hungary, like the Principality of Serbia or Moldavia and Wallachia, and supported the Polish Uprising of 1863‚Äì1864 against Russia. In 1859, Alexander John Cuza, the first Ruler of the United Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia, offered general Klapka military support asking for a favourable reconfiguration of other peoples' situation in the Habsburg Empire (including Romanians): \\"In May 1859 two agreements were signed between Alexandru Ioan Cuza and general Klapka, commander of the Hungarian revolutionaries, by which A.I. Cuza commits to obtain and provide weapons to Hungarian revolutionaries, helping them against Austria, at the same time setting the principles for reconciliation between the nationalities of Austria.\\" During the Crimean War (1853-1856), the Ottoman government wanted to appoint him as a commander of an army, but they renounced upon the protests of Austria.  Hungarian corps  During the Second Italian War of Independence (1859) Lajos Kossuth signed an agreement with Napoleon III the emperor of France, to organize in Italy a Hungarian Legion from the Hungarian soldiers from Italy, which had to break in Hungary, and organize a rebellion there against the Habsburgs. Klapka, who became a member of the Hungarian National Directorate (Magyar Nemzeti Igazgat√≥s√°g), which was fulfilling the role of a Hungarian government in exile, was appointed to organize and then lead it. But it wasn't Napoleon's interest to destroy the Habsburg Empire, so, after the Battle of Solferino he concluded a peace treaty with the Habsburgs, without asking the Italians or the Hungarians opinion. As a result of this the Hungarian Legion disbanded, and Klapka protested against this by retiring. He was more and more disappointed with Kossuth's role and activity in leading the fight for the Hungarian cause in Europe, believing that Kossuth's policy is condemned to fail. When the Austro-Prussian War from 1866 broke out, the Hungarian politicians and officers in exile agreed with the Minister President of Prussia Otto von Bismarck to form a Hungarian Legion, which had to fight against Austria, and start a national uprising in Hungary. Once again Klapka was designated to organize a Hungarian corps in Silesia, and as major-general to lead it into Hungary. He gathered 1500 soldiers, but when, at 3 August 1866 he entered in Hungary through the Jablonka Pass in Hungary, the fate of the war was already decided, and the Austrians and the Prussians concluded an armistice, so he lost the Prussian support. Klapka was informed about the armistice when he was preparing to cross the Jablonka pass into Hungary, and the Prussians asked him to retreat, and stop his military actions. Klapka refused this and entered in Hungary, advancing until Turz√≥falva, but the Slovak population which lived there didn't wanted to join his troops.\\"H√≠res Kom√°rom\\" v√©d≈ëje, (2015) Then Klapka's 1500 soldiers were met by much superior Austrian troops, which forced him to retreat. Klapka protested against this by retiring, and once again, the Hungarian Legion was disbanded. Return After the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 Klapka was permitted to return to his native country, but as well as in the case of Art√∫r G√∂rgei, the emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria didn't allow him to join the army, because he didn't forgive his campaign attempt in Hungary from 1866. As a result of this Klapka turned to politics, between 1868-1872 becoming member of the right wing De√°k Party, being elected in the Hungarian Parliament as a deputy of Illava, then his hometown Temesv√°r. He didn't spoke often from the pulpit, instead he edited a political magazine. In 1868 he became the president of the associations of the Hungarian veteran soldiers of 1848‚Äì1849. After a while he retired from politics and tried his luck in economy, spending his time in Istanbul and Genoa, founding there businesses. In 1864 he married with the daughter of an English businessman, who settled in Brussels. Her name was Inez d'Arboin, they settled in France and had two boys and a girl: Gy√∂rgy, Ern≈ë and M√°rta. In this period Klapka spent much of his time in Cognac. From the 1870s, Klapka couldn't withstand to the homesickness, so he returned to Hungary. He was celebrated by the crowd in Budapest and in other towns, he was offered to return in politics, but he refused, continuing to work in economy. In 1877 he tried to convince Hungary to open a war against the Russians to help the Ottomans. During the Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì1878) he became a military counselor of the Ottoman army. In his last years he lived in the Crown Prince Joseph Hotel (J√≥zsef F≈ëherceg Sz√°lloda) from Budapest. He died on 17 May 1892 in Budapest. His coffin was escorted to the cemetery by a huge crowd singing the Klapka March. The first handful of earth which was thrown on his coffin was taken from Kom√°rom, the fortress which he defended so heroically in 1849. He was buried in the Kerepesi Cemetery in Budapest. A memorial was erected to his memory at Kom√°rom in 1896 and the city's museum was named after him.

In the United States, approximately 9.2 million people are eligible for \\"dual\\" status. Dual- eligibles make up 14% of Medicaid enrollment, yet they are responsible for approximately 36% of Medicaid expenditures. Similarly, duals total 20% of Medicare enrollment, and spend 31% of Medicare dollars. Dual-eligibles are often in poorer health and require more care compared with other Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.Medicare Payment Advisory Commission and Medicaid and CHIP Payment Access Commission, Data Book: Beneficiaries Dually Eligible for Medicare and Medicaid (Washington, D.C.: December 2013), 26.  Medicare and Medicaid coverage for dual-eligibles  Medicare is the primary payer for most services, but Medicaid covers benefits not offered by Medicare. Medicare coverage for dual-eligibles includes hospitalizations, physician services, prescription drugs, skilled nursing facility care, home health visits, and hospice care. Under Medicaid, states are required to cover certain items and services for dual-eligibles, including long-term nursing facility services and home health services. Although states are required to cover certain populations and services, they have the option to expand coverage beyond these mandatory levels (i.e., offer home and community-based services), and accordingly state Medicaid programs vary in scope. Dual-eligibles may be categorized as full-benefit or partial-benefit. Those with full benefits may receive the entire range of Medicaid benefits; those with partial-benefits do not receive Medicaid-covered services, but Medicaid covers their Medicare premiums or cost-sharing, or both. Partial benefit dual-eligible beneficiaries have limited income and assets, but their income and assets are not low enough to qualify them for full Medicaid benefits in their state.  Change in prescription drug coverage for dual-eligibles  With the advent of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, these dual eligibles have automatically been enrolled to a random Medicare Part D plan, effective January 1 of 2006. As a result of this auto assignment, participants who were already enrolled in a Medicare Advantage HMO, may have been automatically disenrolled from their medical plan to allow for part D enrollment. Medicaid will still cover drugs for dual-eligible patients that are not covered by Medicare Part D, including certain controlled substances.  Efforts to integrate Medicare and Medicaid benefits  Dual-eligibles typically receive their Medicare and Medicaid benefits through each program separately. For Medicare benefits, beneficiaries may opt to enroll in Medicare's traditional fee-for-service (FFS) program or in a private Medicare Advantage (MA) plan (Medicare Part C), which is administered by a Managed Care Organization (MCO), under contract with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency in the Department of Health and Human Services that administers the Medicare program and oversees state Medicaid programs. In addition, dual-eligibles may choose a type of MA plan called a dual-eligible special needs plan (D-SNP), which is designed to target the needs of this population. For Medicaid benefits, beneficiaries generally enroll in their state's Medicaid FFS program or a Medicaid managed care plan administered by an MCO under contract with the state. Recently, Congress and CMS have placed greater emphasis on the coordination and integration of Medicare and Medicaid benefits for dual-eligible beneficiaries. For example, the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 required D-SNPs to contract with state Medicaid agencies to provide Medicaid benefits. More recently, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) established a type of D-SNP, referred to as a Fully Integrated Dual Eligible (FIDE) SNP, which‚Äîunlike other D-SNPs‚Äîis designed to integrate program benefits for dual-eligible beneficiaries through a single managed care organization, although payment is generally provided separately by each program. In 2011, CMS announced a financial alignment demonstration that is intended to further integrate the programs' services. CMS expects that the demonstration will decrease incentives for cost shifting and increase care coordination, resulting in improved care for beneficiaries and savings to Medicare and Medicaid. CMS projects that approximately 61 to 75 percent of savings will come from reductions in costly Medicare-covered services.Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Joint Rate - Setting Process for the Capitated Financial Alignment Model (Baltimore, Md . : August 2013)  Historical challenges with the dually-eligible  Historically, one of the major challenges for the dually- eligible has been care coordination between Medicare and Medicaid. These two systems of care do not \\"talk to each other\\" systematically, so one physician that bills primarily through Medicare may not be familiar with benefits that are available through Medicaid. Additionally, since Medicaid benefits vary by state, it is difficult for care providers and consumers to understand the complexity that is inherent within the Medicaid system. Because duals tend to be the most vulnerable, and often sickest, adults, their care has historically been expensive, totaling $319.5 billion in 2011. One proposed reason for this significant cost would be that many Medicaid programs, prior to the 2010 passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) used a fee-for-service model. Fee- for-service models are typically more costly because they allow providers to charge for the quantity of care they provide, rather than the quality. In order to resolve these pain points, the ACA includes provisions that specifically address the coverage and care of duals. On a federal level, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has established two new offices: The Federal Coordinated Health Care Office (FCHCO aka the \\"duals office\\") as well as the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) in order to both strategize and monitor the type and quality of care afforded to duals. These offices focus on both monetary expenses as well as care innovation and quality for dual eligible beneficiaries.  Research  A study by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that the integration of Medicare and Medicaid benefits generally improves the care provided to dual- eligibles but does not lead to Medicare savings or a reduction in costly Medicare services (i.e., emergency room visits, hospital admissions, and 30-day risk-adjusted all-cause readmissions). Medicare Advantage health plans that fully integrated Medicare and Medicaid benefits for dual-eligibles (i.e., FIDE-SNPs) generally had better quality of care scores (particularly for intermediate outcome measures) relative to plans with less integration of benefits. However, only FIDE-SNPs that operated in states with long-standing integration programs performed well on quality of care scores. While the care provided generally improved for dual-eligibles enrolled in FIDE-SNPs, very few of these plans reported lower estimated Medicare costs relative to what Medicare's fee-for-service program would have spent for beneficiaries with the same demographic and health characteristics. Furthermore, the FIDE-SNPs that reported potential Medicare savings generally did not demonstrate lower costs than other D-SNPs in the same geographic areas. These results were consistent for dual-eligibles both under the age of 65 and those age 65 and over. While operating specialized plans and integrating benefits could lead to improved care, GAO's results suggest that these conditions have not demonstrated a reduction in dual-eligible beneficiaries' Medicare spending compared with Medicare spending in settings without integrated benefits. Because the GAO study also found that the average number of costly Medicare services increases as the number of chronic and mental health conditions increase, it is possible that savings were not demonstrated because the population being served by FIDE-SNPs is too large to be cost-effective and major complications were averted for relatively few beneficiaries. A study looking at physician's views of Medicare Part D, and in particular how it pertains to dual-eligibles, found that many physicians expressed concern regarding access to prescription drugs, especially for dual-eligibles. Almost half of physicians responded that the access to prescription drugs for dual-eligibles was worse under Part D than relative to the previous Medicaid, and more than half (63%) reported higher administration burden. Many physicians stated that dual-eligibles had less access under Part D than in three Medicaid restrictive states. This suggests that the transparency of Part D formulary coverage needs to be improved to improve access to these resources for physicians. A further study by the same group of researchers found that despite the above physicians' views on access to healthcare among dual-eligibles, there were no statistically significant changes in pharmaceutical utilization or out-of-pocket expenditures in the 18 months after Medicare Part D implementation. When comparing a group of dual- eligibles (the experimental group) with a control group of near-elderly Medicaid-covered patients, both groups showed a decline in costs rights after the implementation of Part D, which then leveled off. The expenditures for both groups tracked each other.

The meanings in the predecessor languages are also part of the discussion. Lewis's motivation for writing the book was in explaining to students of the work of previous centuries that the definition of a word that they already think they know (his dangerous sense, which he abbreviates D.S.) may yield a total misunderstanding of what the author meant to say. Those who have a large vocabulary are actually more likely to pick a wrong meaning because they can rationalize its enjambment. Some of the earlier meanings are only partially recalled in stock phrases, such as \\"world without end,\\" which employs the earlier use of the word \\"world\\" to mean 'age'.

Awareness symbol The red ribbon is a symbol for drunk driving prevention, drug prevention and for the fight against HIV/AIDS. The Red Ribbon Foundation and Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) are examples of organizations that utilize the red ribbon symbol. MADD is an organization founded in 1980 whose mission is to stop drunk driving, support the victims of this violent crime and prevent underage drinking. Red Ribbon International is an organization founded in 1993 whose main purpose is the education about prevention of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus or HIV, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Related Complex, ARC and AIDS. Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) origins In 1986, MADD started the \\"Tie One On For Safety\\" campaign. It is MADD‚Äôs longest running and most visible public awareness project. During the holiday season, drivers are encouraged to tie MADD red ribbons to visible locations on their vehicles, or place window decals on their vehicles‚Äô windows. The red ribbons represent the drivers‚Äô commitment to drive safe, sober and buckled up. It also encourages others to designate a sober driver before drinking. Alcohol, tobacco and other drug prevention awareness origin The Red Ribbon was used as an awareness symbol made by after DEA Agent Enrique Camarena was kidnapped, tortured, and murdered while working undercover in Guadalajara, Mexico. Citizens in his home town of Calexico, California donned the ribbons to emphasize the need for increased prevention efforts. In 1988, Red Ribbon Week, sponsored by National Family Partnership, became a national campaign. It is celebrated from October 23 through October 31. AIDS awareness origin Actor Jason Priestley wearing a red awareness ribbon at the 1992 Emmy Awards The Red Ribbon Project was created by the New York-based Visual AIDS Artists Caucus in 1991. # Remain anonymous as individuals and to credit the Visual AIDS Artists Caucus as a whole in the creation of the Red Ribbon Project, and not to list any individual as the creator of the Red Ribbon Project; # Keep the image copyright free, so that no individual or organization would profit from the use of the red ribbon; # The Red Ribbon should be used as a consciousness raising symbol, not as a commercial or trademark tool. The artists who formed the Visual AIDS Artists Caucus wished to create a visual symbol to demonstrate compassion for people living with AIDS and their caregivers. Inspired by the yellow ribbons honoring American soldiers serving in the Gulf war, the color red was chosen for its, \\"connection to blood and the idea of passion--not only anger, but love, like a valentine.\\" First worn publicly by Jeremy Irons at the 1991 Tony Awards,Ribbon: The Art of Adornment p.22.

A large red ribbon hangs between columns in the north portico of the White House for World AIDS Day, November 30, 2007. To symbolize the United States' commitment to combat the world AIDS epidemic through its landmark PEPFAR program, Steven M. Levine, a communications aid in President George W. Bush's administration, proposed that the administration display a AIDS ribbon on the White House's iconic North Portico on World AIDS Day 2007. The display, now an annual tradition across three administrations, quickly garnered attention, as it was the first banner, sign or symbol to prominently hang from the White House since Abraham Lincoln lived in the building. Fair award At fairs and competitions in Canada, a red ribbon is awarded to the winning competitor (first place). It is used for second place in the United States for horticultural fairs. In the U.S. in some judging competitions, particularly in 4-H and FFA livestock and horticultural competitions, red ribbons may be given to a project that meets some of the judging criteria but falls short in other areas, while superior projects and exhibits are awarded blue ribbons (which are second-place ribbons in Canada).

After filling clerical posts in Leipzig (1845‚Äì1856), he became a preacher at the Leopoldst√§dter Tempel in Vienna in 1856. Footnotes: Jewish Encyclopedia, vii. 92-94. For a character sketch of Adolf Jellinek see S. Singer, Lectures and Addresses (1908), pp. 88‚Äì93; Kohut, Ber√ºhmte israelitische M√§nner und Frauen. Writings He was associated with the promoters of the New Learning within Judaism, and wrote on the history of the Kabbalah in the tradition of Western scholarship. Jellinek is also known for his work in German on Abraham ben Samuel Abulafia, one of the earliest students of Kabbalah who was born in Spain in 1240. Jellinek's bibliographies (each bearing the Hebrew title Qontres) were useful compilations, but his most important work lay in three other directions: midrashic, psychological and homiletic. Jellinek published in the six parts of his Beth ha-Midrasch (1853‚Äì1878) a large number of smaller Midrashim, ancient and medieval homilies and folklore records, which have been of much service in the revival of interest in Jewish apocalyptic literature. A translation of these collections of Jellinek into German was undertaken by August Wuensche, under the general title Aus Israels Lehrhallen. Before the study of ethnic psychology had become a science, Jellinek devoted attention to the subject. There is much keen analysis and original investigation in his two essays Der j√ºdische Stamm (1869) and Der j√ºdische Stamm in nicht-j√ºdischen Sprichw√∂rtern (1881‚Äì1882). Jellinek compared the Jewish temperament to that of women in its quickness of perception, versatility and sensibility. Jellinek was probably the greatest synagogue orator of the 19th century. He published some 200 sermons, in most of which are displayed unobtrusive learning, fresh application of old sayings, and a high conception of Judaism and its claims. According to Abrahams, Jellinek was a powerful apologist and an accomplished homilist, at once profound and ingenious. Family His wife was Rosalie Bettelheim (born 1832 in Budapest, died 1892 in Baden bei Wien). Their family included: The eldest son, Georg Jellinek (1851‚Äì1911), professor of international law at Heidelberg University. Another son, Max Hermann Jellinek (1868‚Äì1938), was made assistant professor of German philology at Vienna University in 1892, became an associate professor in 1900 and was a full professor from 1906 until 1934, and from 1919 also a member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences.IGL 1800-1950, p.844 A third son, Emil Jellinek (1853‚Äì1918), was an automobile entrepreneur, whose daughter Mercedes inspired the brand name of Mercedes Benz. His daughter Paula Jellinek married a lawyer, Dr. Jur. Heinrich Wechsberg and was the aunt of psychiatrist Erwin Wexberg. A brother of Adolf, Hermann Jellinek (born 1823), was executed at the age of 26 on account of his association with the Hungarian national movement of 1848. One of Hermann Jellinek's best-known works was Uriel Acosta. Another brother, Moritz Jellinek (1823‚Äì1883), was an accomplished economist, and contributed to the Academy of Sciences essays on the price of cereals and on the statistical organization of the country. He founded the Budapest tramway company (1864) and was also president of the corn exchange.  References  * Article on Jellinek, Adolf at Britannica.com * Jewish encyclopedia * A.

According to the lawsuit, during Fujimori's presidency, this \\"chicha press\\" highlighted the President's good works and tried to destroy his opponents with defamatory front-page headlines. This \\"chicha press,\\" comprising about 15 sensationalist newspapers, followed instructions of the former head of the National Intelligence Service, Vladimiro Montesinos. The idea, carried out with success, was to maintain popular approval of Fujimori's government by destroying political opposition candidates and politicians. Once Fujimori resigned, many of the newspapers closed, but some, such as La Raz√≥n and El Chino survived. La Raz√≥n', still owned by Moises Wolfenson, opposes President Alejandro Toledo's government, and it is said that is now the main platform and vehicle for Fujimori's messages from Japan. \\"La Raz√≥n\\" contends that the Wolfensons were convicted without sufficient proof and that their sentence is in effect political revenge.

Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor 2002; March 31, 2003 In May 2002, Toledo's government authorities placed the Wolfenson brothers, publishers of pro-Fujimori tabloid El Chino and of opposition daily La Raz√≥n, under house arrest on corruption charges. On June 22 of the same year, a radio station broadcast a tape in which Salomon Lerner Ghitis, the chairman of the government-owned Financial Corporation for Development and a government insider, threatened both Alex and Moises with judicial proceedings and jail time should they continue to criticize the Government. On August 1, an anticorruption judge found the daily newspapers El Men, El Tio and Editora Sport, S.A., the company that published opposition dailies La Raz√≥n and El Chino, guilty of corporate embezzlement for the dealings their publishers Jose Olaya and Moises Wolfenson had with Vladimiro Montesinos. In September of the same year a court ratified the house arrest for the Wolfenson brothers. In July 2005, congress issued a controversial law # 28658, which stated that days spent under house arrest could count as days in jail, so Moises and his brother Alex were freed. However, on July 25, 2005, Mr. Wolfenson presented himself to the Supreme Court first penal transitory court, because the Constitutional Tribunal declared unconstitutional and abolished law 28658 after only one week of having been issued law by congress, so the Supreme court ordered the Wolfenson brothers to come again to be jailed. Before entering jail, Moises declared that he considers himself persecuted politically by the current government.

Gaudenzio Ferrari (c. 1471 ‚Äì January 11, 1546) was a Northern Italian painter and sculptor of the Renaissance. Biography Gaudenzio was born to Franchino Ferrari at Valduggia in the Valsesia in the Duchy of Milan. Valduggia is now in the Province of Vercelli in Piedmont. He is said to have first learned the art of painting at Vercelli from Gerolamo Giovenone. He subsequently studied in Milan, in the school of the Cathedral artisan Giovanni Stefano Scotti, and perhaps alongside Bernardino Luini.Pinacoteca di Brera: guida ufficiale edited by Luisa Arrigoni, Emanuela Daffra, Pietro C. Marani, page 147. HCirca 1504 he proceeded to Florence. It was once thought that he later moved to Rome. He died in Milan. Gaudenzio was not related to Defendente Ferrari (c.1490‚Äì1535) a painter from Chivasso, nor to Eusebio Ferrari (1508‚Äì1533) the painter from Vercelli. Mature work His initial pictorial style may be considered as derived mainly from the old Milanese school, which had imbibed the classic influence of Leonardo and pupils such as Bramantino. However, the provincial impetus was also strong, as is demonstrated in his emotive work at the Sacro Monte of Varallo. Gaudenzio Ferrari, Crucifixion, 1513, fresco, Santa Maria delle Grazie, Varallo Sesia By 1513, Gaudenzio had depicted the Life of Christ in a fresco at Santa Maria delle Grazie in Varallo Sesia. He returned to work in the chapels of the Sacro Monte di Varallo by 1524. The chapels are dispersed over a hilltop sanctuary, connected by a winding path, and containing a combination of diorama and wax museum(Freedberg, p. 393) with life-size terracotta figures.Abbaye de Saint Michel ou Sacra di San Michele, Sacro Monte de Varallo dans le Pi√©mont italien He executed his most memorable work, a fresco of the Crucifixion (pictured right), with a multitude of figures, no less than twenty-six of them being modelled in actual relief, and colored; on the vaulted ceiling are lamenting angels. The figures include goitrous bestial assailants.Sacro Monte di Varallo ‚Äì Vercellink There are other works which show flashes of innovation such as the crowded chorus decorating duomo of Santa Maria dei Miracoli in Saronno or his fresco of St Anne.St Anne Consoled by a Woman by FERRARI, Gaudenzio This painting shows the overlap of Milanese realism and Venetian colorism. He was a very prolific painter, distinguished by strong animation. In general character, his work suggests more the 15th than the 16th century. His subjects were always religious. Andrea Solario, Giovanni Battista Cerva, Gian Paolo Lomazzo, and Fermo Stella were his principle students.

Johnston and as Franz Johnston, (June 19, 1888July 19, 1949) was a member of the Group of Seven. Life and career Frank Johnston was born on June 19, 1888 in Toronto, the son of Hugh Hans and Mary Elizabeth (Roderick) Johnston. He was educated at Central Technical School in Toronto, studying with Gustav Hahn, and the Central Ontario School of Art with William Cruikshank and George Agnew Reid. In 1908, he joined Grip Ltd. as a commercial artist. In 1910, he left for the United States where he studied art in Philadelphia and worked in commercial design in New York. Upon his return to Toronto in 1915, he used his spare time from commercial art to pursue landscape painting, through sketching trips around Toronto. In 1918, he was commissioned by the Canadian War Memorials to record Canadian flying personnel training for overseas duty. From 1918 on, he joined Lawren Harris and J.E.H. MacDonald on their journeys to Algoma. His paintings from those years express a strong decorative interpretation of the landscape, but he often employed tempera rather than oil paint to search out the pattern and texture of his subject. Johnston's rate of production was such that in the 1919 Algoma show at the Art Gallery of Toronto he contributed sixty works - more than any other artist. A few months later, he asserted his independence even more, having a large one-man show of 200 paintings at the T. Eaton Company Galleries. In 1920, he was invited to join the Group of Seven, but his association with it was brief. He did take part in the Group's first exhibition of 1920, but by 1921 he had left Toronto to become Principal at the Winnipeg School of Art. He claimed that he had no disagreement with the group, only that he wanted to go his own way with regard to exhibition. Pools of Sapphire Frank Johnston 1941 Group of seven artists: Frederick Varley, A. Y. Jackson, Lawren Harris, Fairley, Frank Johnston (artist), Arthur Lismer, and J. E. H. MacDonald In 1925, Johnston changed his name to the more exotic first name of 'Franz' Johnston. By 1927, he was back in Toronto, workng as the principal at the Ontario College of Art. In later years, the artist's style became more realistic and revealed a strong fascination with the qualities of light, especially light on snow. This theme recurred in later works, in large narrative paintings of the 1930s and 1940s as well as more intimate examinations of a river valley, the bright blue of the water contrasting with snow-laden banks. His subjects range from the pastoral countryside of the Wyebridge area, to northern Quebec, and the Northwest Territories. He had begun to hold regular solo exhibitions in the 1920s and his paintings found a great following among the public. Unlike many Canadian artists, Johnston was able to achieve considerable financial success in his own lifetime. He was made a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. He was also a member of the Ontario Society of Artists. His work is in many public collections such as the National Gallery of Canada. He died in Toronto in 1949 and buried with his fellow members of the Group of Seven at McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario. Of his four children, two were artists: Francis-Anne Johnston and Paul Roderick. A retrospective of his work was organized at the Rothmans Art Gallery, Stratford (today called Gallery Stratford) in 1970.

The most well-known groups are the descendants of Clan MacPherson members who migrated in association with military conflict participation in the 16th through 18th centuries. In keeping with the Scottish military identity and the Stuart-era professional soldier class , some left to join foreign militaries and were given knighthoods. The most well-known holders of the surname settled in the Baltic Sea area, including modern day Sweden and the governorate of Livonia (modern day Latvia and Estonia) which were once part of the Russian Empire. The earliest records of the Fersen family of the Baltic area in the late 17th century suggest possible links to earlier participation in the Northern Wars; service in Northern Europe was commonplace and Scots had served in great numbers in the series of Northern Wars, whose onset was marked by an invasion of Livonia by Ivan the Terrible in 1558. More secure is their participation in the Thirty Years' War (1619-1648). The official alliances of the Stuart regime, the independent diplomacy of the Scottish Parliament, and the actions of numerous well placed individuals at various European courts combined to make Scotland one of the prime providers of military manpower in Europe, with some 50,000 Scots fighting between 161-1640. After the 1629 peace of L√ºbeck, many left to join substantial numbers of their compatriots in the Swedish army. During the 1620s the number of Scots serving in the Swedish army is estimated at around 20,000. The Swedish branch of the Fersen family originally derived from the line in Livonia. After moving to Sweden, some of its members were awarded Countships for gallant military acts. This line is best known through its line of distinguished military service and for Axel von Fersen the Younger's possible love affair with Marie Antionette, suggested in court accounts and a recently uncovered series of \\"torrid\\" love letters.

In 1798 at the Battle of the Raz de Sein she fought a famous single-ship duel with the French seventy-four Hercule, in the dusk near the Pointe du Raz on the coast of Brittany. Hercule attempted to escape through the Passage du Raz but the tide was running in the wrong direction and she was forced to anchor, giving Captain Hood the chance to attack at close quarters. The two ships were of equal strength, but Hercule was newly commissioned; after more than an hour and a half of bloody fighting at close quarters she struck her flag, having lost over three hundred men.

The location is J√∏a, in Fosnes, Norway Olav Duun (November 21, 1876 - September 13, 1939) was a noteworthy author of Norwegian fiction. He is generally recognized to be one of the more outstanding writers in Norwegian literature. He once lacked only one vote to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature,A History of Norwegian Literature(by Harald Beyer; New York University Press, 1956)Olav Duun (Store norske leksikon) and was nominated twenty-four times, in fourteen years. Early life Duun was born in the traditional district Ytre Namdal,Grethe F. Sy√©d med glitrende bok om Olav Duun on J√∏a an island in the Namsen Fjord in Fosnes municipality, Nord-Tr√∏ndelag county, Norway. His parents were Johannes Antonius Duun and Ellen (Fossum) Duun. Olav Duun was born Ole Johannesen Raaby. Duun was the oldest in a family of eight siblings. During his years as a boy his family lived at several farms on the island, the last one being Duun. He adopted the last name Duun when he left the island to start his training as a teacher. He attended the state school at Tr√∏ndelag. In 1901, Duun took a position as a school teacher at Levanger in Nord-Tr√∏ndelag county, Norway. After accepting a post as a teacher He completed the graduate teacher examination in 1904. In 1908, he was hired by the Ramberg school at Botne in Vestfold, where he combined teaching profession with writing poetry. He worked as a teacher in Holmestrand until 1927. At the age of fifty, he retired in order to devote his time to writing.Olav Duun -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia at www.britannica.com Writing career Duun was known as one of the outstanding writers of 20th-century Norwegian fiction. He stands as a remarkable synthesis of the Norwegian folk spirit and the European cultural form. Duun wrote in Landsm√•l, an amalgam of peasant dialects that developed into Nynorsk, one of the official languages of Norway. In the period 1907-38 he published 25 novels, four short story collections (\\"sagas\\" was his own genre term) and two children's books. Many of his books incorporate the dialects of his subjects: peasants, fishermen and farmers. His novels analyze the psychological and spiritual characteristics of rural, peasant life. Contact with family traditions is a strength for the heroes in his historical novels, and awareness of those who have lived before, and the strength of their actions can help modern people through crises. The most notable works are his six volume, The People of Juvik, which deals with four generations of a family of peasant landowners. This work was translated into English and published as: The Trough of the Waves (1930), The Blind Man (1931), The Big Wedding (1932), Odin in Fairyland (1932), Odin Grows Up (1934) and Storm (1935).Twentieth Century Authors: A Biographical Dictionary of Modern Literature, (edited by Stanley J.

The blue plaque reads: She was born at St Helens, Isle of Wight, the daughter of an alcoholic fisherman named Richard Daw (or Dawes). She grew up in the workhouse at Newport and after a short period of employment with a local farmer worked as a chambermaid in Portsmouth, then went to London where she worked as a servant in a high-class brothel on Piccadilly. There, she eventually met the exiled duc de Bourbon, afterwards Prince of Cond√©, in 1811 and became his mistress. She was ambitious, and Cond√© had her educated well not only in modern languages but, as her still extant exercise books show, in Greek and Latin. He took her to Paris and, to prevent scandal and to qualify her to be received at court, had her married in 1818 to Adrien Victor de Feuch√®res, a major in the Royal Guard. The prince provided her dowry and made her husband his aide-de- camp and a baron. The baroness, pretty and clever, became a person of consequence at the court of Louis XVIII. However, De Feuch√®res finally discovered the relations between his wife and Cond√©, whom he had been assured was her father, and left her, obtaining a legal separation in 1827. On hearing of the scandal, the king banished her from his court, declaring her \\"naught more than a commoner street-wench yet tragically bereft of any skills of the trade.\\" Thanks to her influence, however, Cond√© was induced in 1829 to sign a will bequeathing about ten million francs to her, and the rest of his estate‚Äîmore than sixty-six millions‚Äîto the duc d'Aumale, fourth son of Louis Philippe. Again she was in high favour. Charles X received her at court, Talleyrand visited her, her niece married a marquis Hugues de Chabannes La Palice and her nephew was made a baron. Cond√©, wearied by his mistress's importunities, and depressed after the July Revolution and the subsequent exile of the King, made up his mind to leave France secretly. When on 27 August 1830 he was found hanging dead from his window, the baroness was suspected and an inquiry was held. But the evidence of death being the result of any crime appearing insufficient, she was not prosecuted. There were rumours that the new King of the French, Louis-Philippe, had collaborated with Sophie in the crime. Later, rumours circulated amongst the nobility that Cond√© had died pleasuring himself, engaged in what would later be known as autoerotic asphyxiation.see for instance DIEKSTRA, Ren√©, De macht van een ma√Ætresse, Karakter Uitgevers BV, Uithoorn, 2011, 431 p Hated as she was by the French, the baroness returned to London, where she died in December 1840. Her grave can still be seen in Kensal Green Cemetery.

It was released in the UK, Sweden and the U.S. starting in March 2005. Its first- party games were developed in studios in Helsingborg, Sweden, and Manchester, England. Gizmondo Europe, Ltd. was based in London, England, and was a subsidiary of Florida-based Tiger Telematics, whose chairman Carl Freer led Gizmondo's development. Before its launch the Gizmondo had high expectations by some journalists due to its extensive feature set, and it was aimed to compete against Nintendo and Sony; however, it ended up as a major sales failure. The company extravagantly spent millions on promotions such as a celebrity party at London's Park Lane Hotel, and taking part at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, despite never making a profit. Its American debut was delayed several times, and a widescreen version was announced shortly before its release - resulting in low sales. With fewer than 25,000 units sold, the Gizmondo was named by GamePro as the worst selling handheld console in history. The Gizmondo was further overshadowed when Swedish press revealed criminal pasts of several executives, causing their resignations including Tiger Telematics CEO Carl Freer. Director of Gizmondo Europe Stefan Eriksson was involved in a Swedish criminal organisation, the \\"Uppsalamaffian\\" (the Uppsala mafia). By February 2006, the company was forced into bankruptcy after amassing US$300 million debt, and the Gizmondo stopped production. Weeks thereafter Eriksson crashed a rare Ferrari Enzo driving at 260km/h in California, and was later jailed and subsequently deported for driving under the influence in connection with the crash and other criminal offenses. History The Gizmondo device was originally called Gametraq. Tiger Telematics first published on their website in October 2003 about the device being developed. This came in response to Nokia's N-Gage. During December that year, Gizmondo made its debut as a concept product at the Las Vegas CES in January 2004, and later appeared at the German CeBIT show in March 2004. The company and the console were renamed Gizmondo around April 2004. The former Gizmondo store in Regent Street, London British Formula One driver Jenson Button appeared on magazine adverts for the Gizmondo, and also had his own licensed video game for the device, Chicane, though it never released due to a dispute with Tiger Telematics and the developer of the game. In London's Regent Street, Tiger Telematics threw a party with several celebrities invited to promote the device. Busta Rhymes, Jodie Kidd and Pharrell Williams were among the celebrities invited, of whom some performed. There were also two television adverts that aired after release. Also, in an attempt to promote the console, Gizmondo's executive Stefan Eriksson took part in the 24 Hours of Le Mans race of 2005 in a Gizmondo-sponsored Ferrari 360 Modena GTC. The Gizmondo's problems were compounded by the involvement of Eriksson in Swedish organized crime, and later for crashing a Ferrari Enzo in Malibu, California, which was apparently owned by the Royal Bank of Scotland. He pleaded guilty to numerous criminal charges which led him to 2 years in jail. In 2007, GameTrailers named it \\"the worst console of all time.\\"(May 6, 2007). Top Ten Worst Consoles , GameTrailers. Accessed November 14, 2012. Widescreen Gizmondo Tiger Telematics announced a new Gizmondo model for release in Q2 2006. It was intended to have a larger, 4\\" widescreen screen and upgrades like Wi-Fi, TV-out support, an improved 480 √ó 272 pixel resolution, a 2-megapixel camera, and a 500 MHz processor. It also included tri-band GSM technology, effectively making it a mobile phone too. It also featured new icons on the buttons. The widescreen Gizmondo was announced just a few weeks before the U.S. launch of the Gizmondo, possibly prompting some potential customers to not buy the Gizmondo, and instead wait for the improved model, in an example of the Osborne effect. Tiger Telematics promised to show the device at CES 2006 in January; however, it never appeared there. Shortly thereafter Tiger went bankrupt, and thus the new Gizmondo was never released. Release=United Kingdom Gizmondo was released in the United Kingdom on 19 March 2005, priced at ¬£229. The Gizmondo was available from the Gizmondo flagship store on London's Regent Street, via Gizmondo's online shop, and other high- street and online retailers such as Argos, Dixons, Currys, John Lewis, although it was never clear how many units were actually introduced into those retail channels. The SMS service of the Gizmondo enabled people to send messages by pre-pay Vodafone accounts bundled in with the device. The Gizmondo sold 1000 units within an hour of launch. In April, a month after the initial release, a variant of the console with GPS-assisted \\"Smart Adds\\" advertising enabled was released with an RRP of ¬£129. Sweden Gizmondo was launched in Sweden in the late Summer of 2005, with both \\"Smart Adds\\" and normal units available. Rather than opening flagship stores, the manufacturer relied on established retailers such as Webhallen. \\"Smart Adds\\" were never enabled for the Swedish market, even though the technology \\"was there\\". United States A booth selling Gizmondos in West Covina, California, November 2005 In the United States, the Gizmondo launched on October 22, 2005. Retail price was $400 for a unit without \\"Smart Ads\\", or $229 for a \\"Smart Ads\\" enabled device. It was available only at kiosks located in shopping malls throughout the U.S. (operated by National Kiosk, LLC, located in the western corner of North Carolina). Only 8 of the planned 14 games were ever released in the U.S., along with no CoPilot GPS software, though the software was sold on the British site for a week or two. There was little to no advertising, and some of their advertising was even put in magazines of Nintendo Power (Nintendo's official magazine). Plans to distribute the handheld through other retailers never materialized. Games The Gizmondo launched in the United Kingdom with only one game, Trailblazer. The console launched in the United States with a line-up of eight titles, including Trailblazer. In addition to these eight, six others were released in Europe only. A further 30 titles were known to have been in development for the system, but all were canceled before their release due to Tiger Telematics' bankruptcy. Also all games released in North America were effectively launch titles. Certain games were claimed to be capable of using \\"augmented reality\\", most notably the unreleased game Colors. It was intended to be the first GPS video game, with the ability to track a user's real world movements in real time. Additionally several games including Motocross 2005, Hockey Rage 2005, and Sticky Balls had bluetooth multiplayer features. The accessibility to purchase Gizmondo games was limited. In the United States, games were only available through a small numbers of kiosks located in shopping malls across the country. After Tiger Telematic's bankruptcy, the Gizmondo and its games were left without any proper marketing or distribution. Fan site Gizmondo Central reviewed all games, and Trailblazer and SSX 3 had the best score. Sticky Balls and FIFA Football 2005 were second- best. Gizmondo main menu screen running on low battery Smart Adds The \\"Smart Adds\\" system was intended as a way for advertisers to subsidize part of the cost of the unit. The apparent misspelling of the name was intentional and a trademark and company name were registered in the UK as \\"Smart Adds\\", though even Tiger Telematics occasionally slipped up and referred to it as Smart Ads in their publicity material. A \\"Smart Adds\\"-enabled Gizmondo cost less (¬£129/$229), but would display advertisements on the Gizmondo's screen at random intervals when the user entered the home screen. These advertisements would be downloaded via the device's GPRS data connection, and would be targeted based on data inputted to the device. A maximum of three ads would be shown per day. Some ads would include special offers in the form of vouchers or barcodes, and some would utilize the device's GPS system to direct users to the nearest store carrying the advertised product. However, the \\"Smart Adds\\" service was never activated, and users who paid the reduced price for a \\"Smart Adds\\"-enabled device did not receive any advertisements through their device.

The original planned launch date was May 2008, but this was quickly pushed back to November 2008, along with details of a new company, Media Power, behind the launch, headed by Carl Freer and his Swedish partner Mikael Ljungman, with development apparently proceeding according to the new schedule at least until September. By December 2008, the console had still not appeared, which Freer blamed on the difficult economic conditions. The device was delayed to 2009 as a result. The latest design prototype turned it into a smartphone running both Windows CE or Google Android. However, since then the Media Power website went offline. Co-founder Mikael Ljungman was later arrested, extradited to Denmark and convicted of serious fraud due to his activities at IT Factory. Nothing more has been announced about the device by Freer, effectively confirming its cancellation. In popular culture A reference to the Gizmondo is made in the British movie Goal!, when a meeting takes place in a Gizmondo store.

Most scholars agree that all three letters are written by the same author, although there is debate on who that author is. First This epistle, unlike the other two, is written more as a sermon, one to help strengthen people's faith in Jesus, to help them understand why a being as great as the Son of God would have a mortal life and a mortal's agonizing death. Second This epistle is written as a short letter from the Apostle to an unnamed \\"elect lady\\" whom he loves and her children. Within the letter, John warns about opening her home to false teachers and to always practice truth, avoiding secrecy. First Epistle Third The third epistle, also a short letter, is addressed to a man named Gaius and mentioned as \\"a dear friend\\". It talks about a man named Diotrephes whom Gaius excommunicated from the church and had gone on to create an anti-missionary sentiment, trying to get the church to stop receiving missionaries. It is believed that the letter was delivered by a third person, Demetrius.

It was approved for funding in late 2004, with the aim of having the full telescope operational by 2009. The project was jointly run by Cardiff University, Oxford University, the Cavendish Astrophysics Group and the University of Manchester. History The Clover Project was meant to consist of two independent telescopes, one operating at 95 GHz with the other operating at both 150 and 225 GHz. Both telescopes were to be sited near the CBI site in the Atacama Desert, Chile. The two telescope receivers would have been large format focal plane arrays of either 100 or 200 bolometric detectors. The aim of the experiment was to measure the B-mode polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background between multipoles of 20 and 1000 down to a sensitivity limited by the foreground contamination due to lensing. This would have allowed the detection of primordial gravitational waves in the universe so long as the ratio of scalar perturbations (caused by density fluctuations in the early universe) to the tensor perturbations caused by gravitational waves was greater than r = 0.01. It was hoped that the telescope would have spent around 2 years observing a total of around 1,000 degrees of sky, made up of several patches of sky where polarized foregrounds (synchrotron and thermal dust emission) are at a minimum. Clover was canceled in March 2009 as STFC were unable to provide the requested additional funds of 2.55 million pounds to finish the project.

It is also known as a simple knot or schoolboy knot, due to its simplicity and style. Some reports state that carriage drivers tied their reins with a four-in-hand knot, while others claim that the carriage drivers wore their scarves in the manner of a four-in-hand, but the most likely etymology is that members of the Four-in- Hand Club in London began to wear the neckwear, making it fashionable. The knot produced by this method is on the narrow side, notably asymmetric, and appropriate for most, but not all occasions. For United States Army uniforms, and United States Navy uniforms that include a necktie, the four-in-hand knot is one of three prescribed options for tying the necktie, the other two being the half-Windsor and Windsor. Tying The four-in-hand knot is tied by placing the tie around the neck and crossing the broad end of the tie in front of the narrow end. The broad end is folded behind the narrow end and brought forward on the opposite side, passed across the front horizontally, folded behind the narrow end again, brought over the top of the knot from behind, tucked behind the horizontal pass, and the knot pulled snug. The knot is slid up the narrow end of the tie until snug against the collar.

He resides in Vienna and near Kapuv√°r. Leopold Lummerstorfer is one of the younger directors of the new Austrian cinema. As early as 19, he made his first long film ‚ÄúMy Country in Pink‚Äù, an adventurous feature with underground, cult character. He studied ethnology and philosophy at the University of Vienna, worked in very diverse occupations such as road construction worker, journalist, estate manager, long-distance heating supervisor and youth social worker. Parallel to this, he made a set of short features as well as documentary films, including ‚ÄúThe Dream That Remains‚Äù, a film ‚Äúthat goes from a social study to a gentle, true satire without much effort. A surprise success for domestic cinema, in artistic value and in public numbers and a politically alert as well as amusing film‚Äù (Die Presse). His films usually highlight a social focus, which he brings to the screen, documentarily or fictionally, by means of accurate narrative structure. His last feature, ‚ÄúWhite Cherries‚Äù (with Martin Puntigam, Josef Hader, and Maria Hofst√§tter), was acclaimed as the, up to then, most successful new generation film in Austrian cinema. His work has received numerous festival invitations (among others, San Francisco, S√£o Paulo, Saarbruecken, Istanbul, Cin√©ma du r√©el Paris) and awards.

In a 16-year professional career he played mainly with S√£o Paulo and Real Betis; who made him the world's most expensive player in 1998. He also appeared for teams in five other countries during his career. Den√≠lson gained more than 60 caps for Brazil, making his full debut before his 20th birthday and representing the nation in six international tournaments, including two World Cups (winning the 2002 edition). Denilson was known for his dribbling skills. Club career=S√£o Paulo/Betis Born in Diadema, S√£o Paulo, Den√≠lson made his senior debuts with local S√£o Paulo FC at the age of only 17, appearing with the team in the 1994 Copa CONMEBOL and winning the tournament. In 1998, he broke the world-record transfer fee when Real Betis paid ¬£21.5 million for his services. He made his La Liga debut on 29 August in a 0‚Äì0 away draw against Deportivo Alav√©s, and finished his first season with 35 games and two goals as his team ranked in 11th position; the Andalusians were relegated to Segunda Divisi√≥n in 2000. Den√≠lson spent some months back in his country with Clube de Regatas do Flamengo, on loan, but returned in January 2001 to be a productive attacking unit for Betis as it achieved promotion back (21 games, one goal). He continued to be regularly played in the following top flight campaigns, but more often than not as a substitute. In 2004‚Äì05 Betis finished in fourth position and qualified to the UEFA Champions League, also adding the season's Copa del Rey, but Den√≠lson was only a fringe player now, starting in just three games and playing only 290 minutes. Bordeaux In the 2005 off- season, Den√≠lson was sold to French club FC Girondins de Bordeaux for an undisclosed amount, four years before his Betis contract was due to expire. In his only season in Ligue 1 he appeared regularly to help to a second-place finish, albeit trailing eventual champions Olympique Lyonnais by 15 points. As the team failed to match Den√≠lson's wage demands, he left and signed for Saudi Arabia's Al Nassr FC, where he played for a couple of months. Dallas On 24 August 2007, he joined FC Dallas of Major League Soccer, becoming the team's designated player. he made his league debut on 1 September, entering in the 55th minute against D.C. United, and the following week he made his first start, against Toronto FC at Pizza Hut Park, scoring from the penalty spot in the 36th minute of an eventual 2‚Äì0 win. After only one goal and no assists, Den√≠lson was excluded from Dallas' squad for their appearance in the final of the U.S. Open Cup, raising questions of whether he would remain with the club following the season (even though Open Cup regulations allowed no more than five foreign players on the game-day roster). Further fueling speculation, head coach Steve Morrow said the player would need to \\"earn a spot in the starting lineup like everybody else\\"; goalkeeper Dar√≠o Sala added the team was having problems adjusting to a change in scheme to accommodate Den√≠lson. Later years At the end of the season, FC Dallas decided not to pick up its option on Den√≠lson, but stated their desire to resign the winger at a lower salary. In February 2008 he signed a one-year performance-based contract with Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras, hoping the club structure and experienced coach Vanderlei Luxemburgo would help him recover his best football. He was unable to make the starting squad, spending most of the season as a bench option; nonetheless, he helped O Verd√£o to the S√£o Paulo State Championship and a berth in the Copa Libertadores after the fourth place in the S√©rie A. On 6 January 2009, Den√≠lson was taken on trial by Premier League side Bolton Wanderers with a chance to sign a contract until the end of the campaign.Bolton move for Denilson; Sky Sports, 6 January 2009 He stated: \\"I want to play in Europe, but I am not in a rush. I have received proposals from England, Greece, Turkey and Germany.

He made his debut on the 21st against Ho√†ng Anh Gia Lai FC, scoring through a free kick just two minutes into the game, but left after only three weeks with the team with only that single appearance to his credit due to injury. Den√≠lson was paid $12,000 for the match and a $5,000 bonus for the goal. In January 2010, Den√≠lson signed a two-year contract with Kavala in Greece. He was released on 16 April, without having played any games.Denilson cut by Kavala ; Greek Soccer, 16 April 2010 International career Den√≠lson made his debut for Brazil in November 1996 at the age of 19, against Cameroon. He was called for the squad that competed at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, appearing in all the games for the eventual runners-up; the previous year, he was also selected for the 1997 Copa Am√©rica and the 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup, winning both tournaments and totalling ten appearances (two goals). Den√≠lson was picked by manager Luiz Felipe Scolari for his 2002 World Cup squad in Japan and South Korea. Always as a substitute, he played in five matches as the Sele√ß√£o won its fifth World Cup, appearing one minute in the final against Germany. After Carlos Alberto Parreira returned for his third spell as national team boss, Den√≠lson was not called again. He gained a total of 61 caps. Style of play A creative and technically gifted left-footed player, Denilson was mainly known for his dribbling skills, in particular for his use of several feints to beat opponents such as the step over, which he frequently employed. Despite his talent, he was considered by some to not have fulfilled the potential he showed at the start of his career. Media Den√≠lson was sponsored by sportswear company Nike, and appeared in commercials for the brand. In a global advertising campaign in the run-up to the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan, he starred in a \\"Secret Tournament\\" commercial (branded \\"Scorpion KO\\") directed by Terry Gilliam, appearing alongside football players such as Fabio Cannavaro, Hern√°n Crespo, Edgar Davids, Rio Ferdinand, Lu√≠s Figo, Paul Scholes, Thierry Henry, Gaizka Mendieta, Hidetoshi Nakata, Ronaldinho, Ronaldo and Francesco Totti among others, with former player Eric Cantona the tournament \\"referee\\".

They can be used in some applications such as food processing, water treatment, and medical applications. Overview Energy is typically stored within electrostatic fields (capacitors), magnetic fields (inductors), as mechanical energy (using large flywheels connected to special- purpose high-current alternators), or as chemical energy (high-current lead- acid batteries, or explosives). By releasing the stored energy over a very short interval (a process that is called energy compression), a huge amount of peak power can be delivered to a load. For example, if one joule of energy is stored within a capacitor and then evenly released to a load over one second, the average power delivered to the load would only be 1 watt. However, if all of the stored energy were released within one microsecond, the average power over one second would still be one watt, but the instantaneous peak power would be one megawatt, a million times greater.

The NPOI primarily produces space imagery and astrometry, the latter a major component required for the safe position and navigation of all manner of vehicles for the DoD. The facility is located at Lowell's Anderson Mesa Station on Anderson Mesa about southeast of Flagstaff, Arizona (US). Until November 2011, the facility was known as the Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer (NPOI). Subsequently, the instrument was temporarily renamed the Navy Optical Interferometer, and now permanently, the Kenneth J. Johnston Navy Precision Optical Interferometer (NPOI) ‚Äì reflecting both the operational maturity of the facility, and paying tribute to its principal driver and retired founder, Kenneth J. Johnston. The NPOI project was initiated by the United States Naval Observatory (USNO) in 1987. Lowell joined the project the following year when the USNO decided to build the NPOI at Anderson Mesa. The first phase of construction was completed in 1994, which allowed the interferometer to see its first fringes, or light combined from multiple sources, that year. The Navy began regular science operations in 1997. The NPOI has been continuously upgraded and expanded since then, and has been operational for a decade. The workings of NPOI as a classic interferometer, are described at Scholarpedia,http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Ground- based_optical_interferometry and at the NPOI site.http://www2.lowell.edu/npoi/what_is_it/default.php Description The NPOI is an astronomical interferometer laid out in a three-arm \\"Y\\" configuration, with each equally-spaced arm measuring long. There are two types of stations that can be used in the NPOI. Astrometric stations, used to measure the positions of celestial objects very accurately, are fixed units placed apart, with one on each arm and one at the center. Imaging stations can be moved to one of nine positions on each arm, and up to six can be used at one time to perform standard observing. Light from either type of station is first directed into the feed system, which consists of long pipes which have been evacuated of all air. They lead to a switchyard of mirrors, where the light is directed into the six Long Delay Lines, which is another set of long pipes that compensate for the different distances to each station. The light is then sent into the Beam Combining Facility, where it enters the Fast Delay Lines. This third set of evacuated pipes contains mechanisms that move mirrors back and forth with a very high degree of accuracy. These compensate for the movement of the mirrors as they track an object across the sky, and for other effects. Finally, the light leaves the pipes inside the BCF and goes to the Beam Combining Table, where the light is combined in a way that allows images to be formed. Navy Precision Optical Interferometer layout. Both types of station have three elements: a siderostat, a Wide Angle Star Acquisition (WASA) camera, and a Narrow Angle Tracking (NAT) mirror. The first is a precisely-ground flat mirror in diameter. The WASA cameras control the aiming of the mirror at the celestial target. The reflected light from the siderostat is directed through a telescope which narrows the beam down to the diameter of the pipes, which is . The light then hits the mirror of the NAT, which compensates for atmospheric effects and directs the light into the feed system. In 2009 NOFS began final plans for NPOI to incorporate four aperture optical-infrared telescopes into the array, which were accepted by the Navy in 2010,http://www.chara.gsu.edu/CHARA/Papers/Pasadena/12.Hutter.pdf and assigned to the Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station. They were originally intended to be \\"outrigger\\" telescopes for the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, but were never installed and incorporated into Keck's interferometer. Three telescopes are being prepared for near-immediate installation, while the fourth is currently at Mount Stromlo Observatory in Australia and will be incorporated at some point in the future. The new telescopes will help with faint object imaging and improved absolute astrometry, due to their greater light-gathering abilities than the existing siderostats. NOFS operates and leads the science for the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer,http://www2.lowell.edu/npoi/index.phpPlans for utilizing the Keck Outrigger Telescopes at NPOI  Publications. SPIE. Retrieved on 18 October 2011. as noted, in collaboration with Lowell Observatory and the Naval Research Laboratory at Anderson Mesa. NOFS funds all principal operations, and from this contracts Lowell Observatory to maintain the Anderson Mesa facility and make the observations for NOFS to conduct the primary astrometry. The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) also provides funds to contract Lowell Observatory's and NRL's implementation of additional, long-baseline siderostat stations, facilitating NRL's primary scientific work, synthetic imaging (both celestial and of orbital satellites). When complete by 2013, NPOI will run the longest baseline interferometer in the world. The three institutions - USNO,http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/about-us/scientific-director-usno NRL, and Lowell \\\\- each provide an executive to sit on an Operational Advisory Panel (OAP), which collectively guides the science and operations of the interferometer. The OAP commissioned the chief scientist and director of the NPOI to effect the science and operations for the Panel; this manager is a senior member of the NOFS staff and reports to the NOFS Director. NPOI is an example of the Michelson Interferometer design, with the principal science managed by NOFS. Lowell Observatory and NRL join in the scientific efforts through their fractions of time to use the interferometer; science time is 85% Navy (NOFS and NRL); and 15% Lowell. NPOI is one of the few major instruments globally which can conduct optical interferometry.http://usic.wikispaces.com/file/view/Armstrong_OpticalInterferometry_TEC_OIR.pdfhttp://frank.harvard.edu/~howard/papers/optical_interferometry_review.pdf See an illustration of its layout, at bottom. NOFS has used NPOI to conduct a wide and diverse series of scientific studies, beyond just the study of absolute astrometric positions of stars,;Large-Angle Astrometry at the Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer (NPOI). Adsabs.harvard.edu. Retrieved on 18 October 2011. additional NOFS science at NPOI includes the study of binary stars, Be Stars, Oblate stars, rapidly rotating stars, those with starspots, and the imaging of stellar disks (the first in history) and flare stars. In 2007‚Äì2008, NRL with NOFS used NPOI to obtain first-ever closure phase image precursors of satellites orbiting in geostationary orbit.http://www.amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2009/Non- resolved_Object_Characterizaion/Vrba.pdfhttp://www.amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2010/Systems/Jorgensen.pdfhttp://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a531729.pdf Installation plans for a 1m Array have been developed by NRL and Lowell Observatory, based on the funded science performed. Discussion Optical interferometers are extremely complex, unfilled aperture photon-collecting telescopes in the visual (sometimes the near infrared, too), which produce synthesized images and fringe data \\"on the fly\\" (unlike radio interferometers which are privileged to record the data for later synthesis), essentially by taking an inverse Fourier transform of the incoming data. Astrometry is understood by precisely measuring delay line additions while fringing, to match the light path differences from baseline ends. Using essentially trigonometry the angle and position of where the array is 'pointed' can be determined, thus inferring a precise position on the sphere of the sky. Only a few exist that can be considered operational. To date NPOI has produced the highest resolution optical images of any astronomical instrument, though this may change when the CHARA array and Magdalena Ridge Observatory Interferometer begin optical-band operations. The first astronomical object imaged (resolved) by NPOI was Mizar, and since, a significant amount of astrometry, reference tie frame, rapid rotator star, and Be stellar disk study has been performed. NPOI is capable of determining positions of celestial objects to a few milli- arcsecond, in part due to the optical anchoring of its components using a complex metrology array of lasers that connect main optical elements to each other and to bedrock. Many specialized lasers are also used to align the long train of optics. The current NPOI siderostat array remains the world's only long-baseline (437-meter) optical interferometer that can simultaneously co- phase six elements. NPOI is expected to grow significantly in capability with the pending addition of four 1.8-meter aperture IR/Optical telescopes into the current array. The enhanced array will also employ adaptive optics techniques. This layout and increased sparse aperture will permit significant improvements to the science capability, from a tenfold increase in measuring ever-fainter wide-angle astrometry targets, to improved positional determination for numerous binary and flare stars. When the 1.8m telescope addition are complete, NPOI also will undertake additional studies of dust and proto- planetary disks, and planetary systems and their formation.

The pen was originally marketed under the name of Golden Arrow, a reference to the new arrow clip but was again changed to Vacuum Filler in reference to its ink reservoir filling action. The Vacumatic featured a brand new filling mechanism which took 5 years to develop at a cost of $125,000. Parker boasted the model to be the first self-filler without a sac; while this was not entirely true, the filling mechanism was still a great innovation. By using a diaphragm rather than a sac, the whole barrel can be used as a reservoir. The principle workings are essentially like that of the earlier button fillers like the Duofold as the depression of the plunger pushed on the rubber sac and forced out the air (creating a vacuum) and when the rubber regained its natural form the ink got sucked into the pen to replace the air. The difference was that the previous button was replaced with a fat (approximately 4 mm) plunger that was used to operate the diaphragm. The plunger could be locked in a down position with a twist of the thumb and is referred to as the Lock-Down Fill, or Twist-Fill. Although the pen came in many sizes and colors, the most widely recognizable Vacumatics featured alternating horizontal bands of pearlescent and clear celluloid. These clear bands allowed the user to see the level of ink in the barrel. Several generations of Vacumatic were produced. The pen remained Parker‚Äôs top-of-the-line product until the launch of the 51 in 1941. The Parker Vacumatic was phased out in 1948 but remained in production in Canada until 1953.

Early life His family was German in origin (from HolsteinKaufmann, Konstantin von, In: Meyers Konversations-Lexikon), but had been in the service of the Tsars for over 100 years, and had since converted to Orthodoxy. Kaufmann graduated from Nikolayev Engineering Institute (now Military Engineering-Technical University; Russian –í–æ–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –∏–Ω–∂–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–Ω–æ- —Ç–µ—Ö–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —É–Ω–∏–≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏—Ç–µ—Ç) as a military engineer. Kaufman entered the military engineering field in 1838, served in the campaigns in the Caucasus, was promoted to the rank of colonel, and commanded the sappers at the siege of Kars in 1855. On the capitulation of Kars, he was deputed to settle the terms with General William Fenwick Williams. In 1861, he became director-general of engineers at the War Office, assisting Minister of War Count Dmitry Milyutin in the reorganization of the army. Promoted lieutenant general in 1864, he became Governor-General of Vilna, where at that time the Tsarist state had begun a policy of expropriating the Polish aristocracy in an attempt to break its influence in the countryside. Conquest of Turkestan At the high point of the Russian conquest of Turkestan, in 1867, he became Governor-General of the new province of Turkestan, and held the post until his death, making himself a name in the expansion of the empire in Central Asia. The western part of the Khanate of Kokand along the Syr Darya had already been captured, and the independence of the rest of that country became merely nominal. He accomplished a successful campaign in 1868 against the Emirate of Bukhara, capturing Samarkand and gradually subjugating the whole country. The painter Vasily Vereshchagin accompanied Kaufmann in his campaigns. During the Khivan campaign of 1873, he attacked Khanate of Khiva, took the capital, and forced the Khan to become a vassal of Russia. This was followed in 1875 by the campaign against Kokand, in which Kaufman defeated the uprising khan, Nasreddin, after an anti-Russian uprising against the previous ruler, Khudoyar. The fiction of Kokand's independence was ended, and the remaining rump of the Khanate in the Ferghana Valley was annexed. This rapid absorption of these Khanates brought Russia into proximity to Afghanistan, and the reception of Kaufmann's emissaries by the Sher Ali Khan was a main cause of the Second Anglo-Afghan War. Administration The various temporary statutes under which Turkestan was administered from 1867-1886 gave von Kaufmann a great deal of latitude in policy. In 1868 he contacted experts in Moscow to identify Alexei and Olga Fedchenko to create an expedition to document the countries natural history. Whilst Kaufmann was still extending the borders of the Russian Empire, he was creating a team to investigate and document the new territory. Kaufmann's team included statisticians, the Fedchenkos, the war artist Vasily Vereshchagin and later the educationalist Nikolai Ostroumov. Kaufman wanted an investigation of a \\"newly and scarcely explored region\\". Kaufmann set up a Tashkent outpost of the Moscow Society of Devotees of Natural Science, Anthropology, and Ethnography (OLEAE). The Fenchenkos made three separate explorations between 1868 and 1872. These investigations were central to the Governor-General's policy as he wanted to see this information shared with Russians as well as locals The local newspaper was used to publish the scientific findings. Kaufmann targeted the 1872 Moscow All-Russian Technical Exhibition as an opportunity to display the research of this new part of the Russian empire. Kaufmann was allowed to carry out administrative negotiations with neighbouring states on his own account, to establish and oversee the expenditure of the budget, set taxes, and establish the privileges of Russian subjects in the General-Gubernatorstvo; he also had the power to confirm and revoke death sentences passed in the Russian military courts. Nowhere else in the Russian Empire did a Military Governor-General have this kind of independence from central control, and nowhere else was there such obvious pessimism about the region‚Äôs potential for integration into the main body of the Empire. Isolated geographically from European Russia by an expanse of Steppe that took two months to cross, it was isolated still more decisively in the minds of Tsarist officials by its dense, ancient and settled Islamic culture. In its early years under Kaufmann, Turkestan was thus also administratively isolated, with many distinctive institutions within the military bureaucracy, that was loosely superimposed on a largely unreformed native administration. Although Kaufmann was unable to induce his government to support all his ambitious schemes of further conquest, he was still in office when General Mikhail Skobelev, the hero of the Russo-Turkish war of 1877, was despatched from Tiflis in 1880 and 1881 against the Turkomans of the Akhal-Teke Oasis. Skobelev, although being the effective military governor of the Fergana valley, directing matters from Margelan and New Margelan, was cut short in this second campaign of his in the area. He was recalled. (On 7 July 1882, while staying at a Moscow hotel, on his way to his estate, he died suddenly of a heart attack, shortly before the annexation of Merv). General Chernyayev, the conqueror of Tashkent in 1865, was appointed as his successor. There are various species of plants are named after him including Eremurus kaufmannii, Eremostachys kaufmanniana, Tulipa kaufmanniana, Gentiana kaufmanniana, and Statice kaufmanniana.

It was published as part of a 1961 collection with some short stories called Consider Her Ways and Others (where it forms over a third of the book). The title is from Proverbs, Chapter 6, verse 6: \\"Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise\\". Plot The story is mostly a first-person narrative. It begins with a woman (Jane Waterleigh) who has no memory of her past waking up and discovering that she is a mother of some description, in a bloated body that is not her own. After some confusing experiences Jane's memory gradually returns and she recalls that she was part of an experiment using a drug (chuinjuatin) to see if it enabled people to have out-of-body experiences. It seems that the drug has worked far better than anyone could have anticipated: Jane has been cast into the future. She also realises that she is in a society consisting entirely of women, organised into a strict system of castes, and that she is now a member of the mother caste. Jane's initial contacts have never even heard of men, and believe her to be delusional. When it becomes clear to doctors who attend Jane that something strange has happened (since she can read and write, while the mother caste are illiterate) they arrange for her to be taken to meet an aged historian named Laura. It seems that Jane is in a society somewhat more than a century after her own time. Laura relates that not long after Jane's own time a Dr Perrigan carried out scientific experiments that unintentionally created a virus that killed all the men in the world, leaving only women. After a very difficult period of famine and breakdown, a small number of educated women, found mainly in the medical profession, took control and embarked on an urgent programme of research to enable women to reproduce without males. The women also decided to follow some advice from the Bible (\\"Go to the ant thou sluggard, consider her ways\\") and created a caste-based society in which Jane has become a member of the Mother caste. Laura does understand what Jane means when she talks of men. However, she is certain that they were oppressors of women and that the world is far better without them. Jane disagrees and feels the demise of men to be a terrible blow. Distressed at the prospect of spending her life as a bloated producer of babies, expected to be unable to read, write or reason, Jane requests that she be administered a dose of chuinjuatin in the hope that she might return to her own time. It works, and once transported, Jane decides to stop Dr Perrigan at all costs. The story has an ambiguous ending, which may suggest that it is the narrator's own actions that will lead to the catastrophe she hopes to prevent, an example of the predestination paradox. Other stories in the collection *\\"Odd\\" is a tale of how an ordinary man profited from an extraordinary time paradox when he stops to help a man seemingly lost and confused, and then learns the reasons why. *\\"Stitch in Time\\" concerns an elderly lady reflecting on a lost love and, thanks to her sons' experiments with time, finally discovering the reason why her lover abandoned her so many years ago. *\\"Oh Where, Now, is Peggy MacRafferty?\\" is a social satire on Hollywood glamour in which a bright, individual young Irish woman becomes part of the celebrity circuit, and loses all that makes her special in the process of becoming a star. *\\"Random Quest\\" combines romance and parallel universes. *\\"A Long Spoon\\" is the story of how a demon is summoned by mistake and the lengths the couple that invoked him have to go to get rid of him without losing their souls in the bargain. Adaptations Consider Her Ways was an episode of The Alfred Hitchcock Hour in 1964. This was a fairly faithful adaptation of Wyndham's story, although somewhat condensed and with the action moved to America. The screenplay was written by Oscar Millard, and it starred Barbara Barrie as the woman who travels through time and Gladys Cooper as the historian.

He is a member of the USA Swimming's International Relations Committee as well as the United States' technical representative for the Amateur Swimming Union of the Americas (ASUA/UANA). He is an assistant director of development for The University of Michigan Athletic Department. He then was the head coach at Colgate University. In his first season at Colgate, the women's team took home the 2011 Patriot League Championship, and the men's team finished the meet in fifth place. In 2016 he coached his home country Puerto Rico at the Olympics in Rio. Currently he is the head coach for Pitchfork Aquatics and Puerto Rico. His father is Francisco Canales Roman, from Toa Baja, Puerto Rico, and his mother is Carmen Alvarez Canales, from Mexico City D.F. Fernando has two brothers (swimmer Francisco‚ÄîHarvard '78 and Stanford '82; Harry Noel‚ÄîMichigan '87) and one sister (Sandra Lee‚ÄîCMU '88 & Grand Valley State '89). He graduated from Colegio San Ignacio de Loyola (San Juan) in 1977 and was honored for civic service and athletic achievements with the symbolic key to the City of Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, in 1978. He graduated in 1982 with a Bachelor of Science in physiology of exercise and a Bachelor of Arts in history and English from the University of Michigan. After his graduation he worked with legendary Olympic coaches Jon Urbanchek and Dick Kimball from 1982 to 1987 and helped the Wolverines reclaim the Big Ten Championship Title after a 24-year drought in March 1986. Canales was the head swimming and water polo coach at the University of California, Santa Cruz from 1990 to 1992, where he also taught classes within the Physical Education Department. He became a national swimming champion at an early age by becoming the top-ranked 17 and under, 100 meter freestyler in the US in 1977 while training under Coach Brad Glenn in Huntsville, Alabama. Canales was ranked 25th in the world that very same year in the 100 Free. His triumphs brought him to the University of Michigan from 1977 to 1982. He excelled at the national and international level by winning All-America Awards in each of his four years of competition. He earned a total of 13 Big Ten Championship titles. Canales was the first swimmer in Big Ten Conference history to capture an individual title (100 yard freestyle) during his four years of competition while training under Head Olympic Coach Gus Stager and 1964 US Olympian Bill Farley. Canales was a 100-meter freestyle finalist in the 1978 World Championships in West Berlin, Germany, earning a 5th place. He was the \\"first\\" Puerto Rican swimmer to final in the world championships along with Jesse \\"Cheyenne\\" Vassallo. He earned five gold medals and one silver medal during the 1978 Central American and Caribbean Games in Medell√≠n, Colombia. He became the first Puerto Rican to win an individual medal in the Pan American Games by winning silver in the 100 meters free in 1979 (San Juan, Puerto Rico) and repeating that feat in 1983 (Caracas, Venezuela). He also won a bronze medal in the 4 x 100 meters medley relay in 1979. Fernando became a national champion while representing Club Wolverine in 1986, when he won the 4 x 100 meter free relay alongside three other Wolverines, Joe Parker, Greg Varner and Dave Kerska. This was the fastest Club Relay in the World for that year. He won the 100 meter free gold medal during the Soviet Spartakiade National Championships in 1979. He won the 50 meter and 100 meter freestyle events during the Swedish and German World Cup events in 1983 and 1984. He won the Latin Cup in 1978, 1979 and 1981. He won sprint freestyle titles in Italy, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Puerto Rico, The United States, Germany, Sweden, Dominican Republic and Guadeloupe. Canales made three Olympic Teams: Montreal '76, Moscow '80 and Los Angeles '84). He was honored as the flag bearer for the Puerto Rican Olympic Team during the 1984 Summer Olympics Opening and Closing Ceremonies in Los Angeles, 1984. Canales, a 13-time Big Ten Champion and 4 year All-America at Michigan, is featured in the book \\"Paths to the Olympics ‚Äì Maize and Blue to Olympic Gold\\" by Marc Parrish, Colemar Press 1997. He attributes his triumphs to the support of his mother, brothers and sister, the memory of his father, John Daly's tutelage, his teammates, and the wonderful coaches that helped him during his career: Kika, Julia, Mr. Tom Forte, Carlos Sala, Brad Glenn, Gus Stager, Bill Farley, Dick Kimball, Maggie Shook, Bob Bowman, Mona Nyheim and Jon Urbanchek. All of these coaches shared one thing in common: they participated in the Olympics or the Pan American Games, thus instilling the Olympic dream and the desire to rise above the rest of the competition from an early age. Canales was inducted into the Puerto Rico Sports Hall of Fame with the class of 1993, which also included internationally famous sports personalities: Orlando \\"Peruchin\\" Cepeda, Carlos \\"Charlie\\" Passarell, Raymond Dalmau, Amado Morales and Osvaldo Gil. In addition, he was also inducted into the City of Bayamon, P.R., Sports Hall of Fame in 2009. Fernando is married to Mona Nyheim-Canales, a Norwegian national swimming champion and Arizona Wildcat, she is the head assistant coach for Club Wolverine in Ann Arbor. They have two sons, Francisco Enrique Canales and Thor Bjorn Canales. Canales coached in Texas from 1992 to 2006 with the City of Richardson Swim team. He speaks five languages and has lived in Canada, Italy, Brazil, the United States and Puerto Rico. He is an active volunteer with the American Red Cross.

Research in graphonomics generally involves handwriting movement analysis in one form or another. History and conferences The first international conference relating to graphonomics was held in Nijmegen, The Netherlands, in July 1982. The term 'graphonomics' was used there for the first time. The second conference was held in July 1985 in Hong Kong and, at that meeting, a decision was taken to form the International Graphonomics Society. The IGS became a legal non-profit organization under Netherlands law on January 30, 1987. Subsequently, an international conference, symposium and/or workshop has been held every two years. Past events have been held in various locations with most events having a specific theme, as follows: *Nijmegen, The Netherlands (1982), _Motor Aspects of Handwriting_ *Hong Kong (1985), _Graphonomics_ *Montreal, QC, Canada (1987), _Third International Symposium on Handwriting and Computer Applications_ *Trondheim, Norway (1989), Fourth IGS Conference. _The Development of Graphic Skills (DOGS)_ *Tempe, AZ, USA (1991), Fifth Handwriting Conference of the IGS. _Motor Control of Handwriting_ *Paris, France (1993), _Sixth International Conference on Handwriting and Drawing (ICOHD93)_ *London, ON, Canada (1995), Seventh Biennial Conference of the International Graphonomics Society. _Basic and Applied Issues in Handwriting and Drawing Research_.

This has been done through conferences, workshops and publication of proceedings from those events. IGS Publications As the main academic body for graphonomics, the IGS publishes a biannual bulletin as well as proceedings of the biennial conference. The Bulletin of the International Graphonomics Society is published by the IGS in March and November each year and it is the primary means of communication among IGS members and the public. A complete list of past BIGS issues is available online. Conference proceedings are published in the form of a peer-reviewed scientific journal or book shortly after each of the conferences. Research topics Some research topics in graphonomics include: *Handwriting regeneration - the simulated production of a given recording of handwriting movement. This is realized not using recorded kinematic or kinetic signals but by an abstracted model of human movement control. *Handwriting generation - the process of producing handwriting (e.g. pen tip) movements. This usually implies the use of a computer simulation model which can generate handwriting movement and/or shape, producing newly generated text in a manner similar to the handwriting of an individual person. *Handwriting Production Fluency - Measures of the ability of handwriting in the integral of the absolute of the acceleration signal (velocity peaks), or alternatively the absolute of the integral of the jerk time function.

He was born in Oslo. Radio and television shows Schau is known from several radio shows (most of them also with his brother Alexander Schau) including XL, Karate, and Et Norge I Krig. On TV he has been involved in the shows XLTV, Team Antonsen (2004), and De 7 d√∏dssyndene (2007). He has also been part of several bands, among them Gartnerlosjen, Hurra Torpedo, K√•per Gjete, Sinsen, Reidar Roses Orkester, Datsun, The Cumshots and Mongo Ninja. He is also the writer of the Norwegian underground comic Margarin which is now discontinued. He has created the television shows Dag and One Night with his friend √òystein Karlsen. De 7 d√∏dssyndene In 2007, Schau launched his television show, De 7 d√∏dssyndene, focusing on the seven deadly sins. In the show, Schau attempted to commit all the deadly sins, combined with Schau and his co-hosts, √òystein Karlsen and Morten St√•le Nilsen, presenting information on the history of sin and related subjects. Many Norwegian conservative Christians protested against the program. They organized a petition and a boycott against the show's corporate sponsors, leading to several companies dropping their advertisements. This did not decrease the show's popularity. \\"Forfall\\" One of his projects had him living in a brown Opel Rekord automobile for a whole week. This event was also televised in daily segments. Another one of his projects was \\"Forfall\\" (en. decline), where Schau devoted an entire week to living as unhealthily as possible. Originally the idea was to deteriorate both physically and mentally, but despite the initial intentions in the mental area (reading books by Norwegian pulp fiction authors), the project mainly focused on eating unhealthy foods and smoking. He spent the entire week on display in an Oslo shop window. The project was also shown on TV and streamed on the internet for the entire week. He gained about 10 kg (22 lbs) and his cholesterol level skyrocketed during the project. He also nearly suffered a heatstroke when the temperature in the shop window display was significantly increased. The heat experiment was then aborted. Court case During the 2004 Quartfestival, a couple, who were both members of Fuck for Forest, had sex on stage during a concert with The Cumshots, a band fronted by Schau. This led to a lawsuit against Schau, the other band members and the couple who performed the sex stunt. Schau and his bandmate Ole Petter Andreassen were both fined 10 000 NOK for their roles in the stunt.

The Exis took their name from the existentialist movement, and were influenced by its chief proponents Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus. Parallels Quite a few of the Hamburg fans of The Beatles, in the period 1960‚Äì62, regarded themselves as \\"Exis\\". In some ways, the Exis were the spiritual successors of the Swing Kids of the 1930s. Both movements were heavily influenced by the prevailing popular culture and music of the United States, whether 1930s Jazz, in the case of the Swing Kids or 1950s Rock and Roll, in the case of the Exis. Aside from the utterly transformed political and cultural atmosphere in Germany after the war, the biggest difference between the two movements was that, where the Swing Kids wholeheartedly embraced American culture (right down to zoot suits and bobby socks), Exis generally wanted to show that they could think for themselves, as many young people do. Post-War ties between Britain and Hamburg One of the factors, which had strengthened the link between British musical acts and the Hamburg clubs, was the presence of large numbers of British servicemen (see British Army of the Rhine), in the north- west of Germany. In the aftermath of the Second World War, it became common practice for music promoters in north Western Germany, a number of whom were British themselves, to book British acts. However, some parts of Hamburg were off limits to soldiers and airmen and they never seem to have had the influence, which one might have expected, in the post-war development of St. Pauli. This was partly because of the changing political and legal position. After 1955, they were \\"guests\\" on the territory of an ally and NATO member. Before the establishment of the Federal Republic of Germany (i.e. West Germany) in 1949, the British forces had actually governed their sector. St Pauli, a haven for those who are different In any case, the St. Pauli district was a place for sailors to relax and artisans to experiment with new ideas, long before the Reeperbahn became internationally famous. In addition, \\"Hamburgers\\" have always had some sense of being different from other Germans and the area around the Grosse Freiheit, originally just outside the city boundary, was where people were allowed to \\"do their own thing\\", in various ways (but primarily when it came to religion), as far back as the Eighteenth Century. Influences on fashions and image While the fashion choices of some Exis had a slightly preppy or conservative quality (and, given the middle-class background of most of them, this was probably unavoidable), many sought to distance themselves from the blue-jeaned, check-shirted excesses of President Dwight D. Eisenhower's America, by projecting a somewhat darker and more introspective image. Sartre's black polo-neck sweaters and Gauloises cigarettes were the most obvious symbols. In an interview with NPR, Astrid Kirchherr described the Exy style in Hamburg as consisting of black clothes and very long scarves trailing to the floor. However some American icons of the time, such as James Dean and Marlon Brando, were, in the eyes of most middle-aged Americans of the 1950s, young rebels, rather than suitable role models for the nation's youth. Thus, they were bound to be more attractive to those adolescents, who were trying to stand out from the rest of society, than the \\"respectable\\" performers, whom parents admired. The dress of British and American rockers and bikers, the vast majority of whom had not been anywhere near Hamburg, was not vastly different from some of the Exis but to obsessive teenagers, an extra zip, here and there, can be everything and such comparisons may well have been dismissed by Exis (or Rockers), at the time. There are also similarities to jazz musicians and some of their fans but the Exis did not listen exclusively to Rock and Roll, that unruly mix of Country and Western and Rhythm and Blues.

Narrated by a nun who remains unnamed, it is a hagiography of the life of Saint Cecilia. The lack of portrait description for the second nun in the General Prologue of The Canterbury Tales has led some scholars to speculate that the tale is merely the second tale of the single nun or of the prioress but this idea is not widely held. Its relationship to the subsequent \\"The Canon's Yeoman's Tale\\" is to offer a serious and worthy religious-themed story before a much more irreverent tale of contemporary religious behaviour about foolish alchemists. Placement in The Canterbury Tales Although it is unconfirmed what order Geoffrey Chaucer intended The Canterbury Tales, and therefore where \\"The Second Nun's Tale\\" would place, the main scholarly consensus has placed \\"The Second Nun's Tale\\" in Fragment VIII (Group G) out of X of the Canterbury Tales. In all of the extant manuscripts, The Second Nun's Tale always occurs with The Canon's Yeoman's Tale, further indicating the two tales are to be regarded as a pair. The Second Nun's Tales was likely written for another occasion and only later inserted into The Canterbury Tales. In line VIII.62 of the Second Nun's Prologue, the Second Nun refers to herself as an \\"unworthy sone of Eve\\", indicating the tale previously has a male narrator. In addition, the attribution of the tale to the Second Nun only occurs in the rubrics of the manuscripts, not in the Prologue or Tale itself. Notable characters * Cecilia ‚Äì Saint, wife of Valerian * Valerian ‚Äì Husband of Cecilia * Tiberuce ‚Äì Brother of Valerian * Almachius ‚Äì The prefect of the district * Pope Urban Prologue The Prologue of The Second Nun's Tale contains three sections: 1. four stanzas on the hazards of idleness, 2. the Invocation to Mary (nine stanzas), and 3. the \\"Interpretation of the name Cecilia which Brother Jacob of Genoa put in his legend\\". This final section comprises a series of invented etymologies about that name Cecilia. \\"It is a good example of a medieval method of interpretation that adds rather than discovers meaning; it aims not for one but for a variety of interpretations, all of which are right and none which excludes the others, so that the object of interpretation, here the name Cecilia, gains in richness of meaning and range of reference.\\"Benson Invocation to Mary The Invocation to Mary (Invocacio ad Mariam) is a nine paragraph portion of the prologue, telling of the origin of the name of Cecilia. The Invocation has been argued to draw from many other sources in terms of its composure,: first of all Dante, but also many medieval liturgical hymns. Synopsis A virgin maiden, Cecilia, is to be wedded to a man Valerian. Cecilia asks Valerian to swear not to betray her if she tells her secret, that she has an angel that watches over her, with Christianity being a crime at the time. From there Valerian is sceptical and Cecilia asks him to embark on a journey to see Saint Urban, who would \\"purge\\" Valerian of sin and let him see the angel. Valerian then found Urban who purged him of sin and when Valerian returned he saw Cecilia with an angel. This angel gave Valerian a single wish, of which Valerian answered to give his brother, Tiburce, the same gift he was given, of the truth of Christ. Tiberuce appeared and then accepted the word of Christ. Valerian then took Tiburce to Urban, who had been condemned to die by the state, and Christened Tiberuce. Almachius, the prefect, later seizes the martyrs and orders them to abandon their faith or be sentenced to death; However, the executioners were converted to Christianity. Both Tiburce and Valerian still come forward for the execution as a show of faith, and as their heads fall their spirits rise up to heaven converting even more spectators. Eventually, Almachius orders his men to capture Cecilia, which they do successfully, and they bring her to him during which she boldly spites him with religiously charged words and champions her faith. Almachius orders her execution by a boiling bath; however, due to her faith Cecilia sits safely in the bath. Almachius then orders the executioner to strike three blows on her ‚Äì but her head does not fall off. Eventually, three days later, after preaching even in her partially decapitated state, she ascends to heaven and Saint Urban buries her body among other saints. Plot The Second Nun's Tale explains the story of a young noble lady named Cecilia, and how her unwavering faith in God transformed her into Saint Cecilia. A young maiden named Cecilia, from \\"her cradle onward,\\" was highly devoted to her faith in Christ, and her love for Virgin Mary, so she asked God to protect her virginity. Even when she was betrothed to a man named Valerian, on her wedding day she begged God again to protect her virginity and sang to him, \\"O Lord, keep my soul and my body unspotted, lest I be confounded.\\" On her wedding night, Cecilia asked Valerian to understand her decision to not consummate the marriage, and informed him that her body is protected by an angel of God, and if he was to touch or love her \\"ignobly,\\" the angel would \\"without delay...slay you on the spot\\". However, if he protects Cecilia \\"in clean love\\", the angel would also love him and appreciate him for his purity. When Valerian asked to see the angel, Cecilia told him that he must \\"go forth to the Appian Way,\\" and get baptised by Saint Urban. After his baptism, during which he saw God who appeared as an old man in pure white garments, Valerian returned home and saw the angel. The angel gifted him and Cecilia with two crowns of lilies and roses, and asked that they guard the crowns with \\"a pure body and unspotted thought.\\" The lilies and roses from the crown were fetched by the angel from \\"Paradise\\". Valerian then asked his brother, Tiburce, to come and accept God and know the truth, so he could also be protected by the angel. The angel then agreed and called his brother to come. Upon his arrival, Valerian convinced Tiburce to get baptised by Pope Urban, and renounce his faith in idols. Cecilia referred to them as, \\"nothing but vain things, for they are dumb and deaf‚Ä¶\\" Tiburce went with his brother to Pope Urban, and got christened, which allowed him also to see the angel of God. Eventually, Almachius the prefect heard of this and ordered his officers to take these saints to the idol of Jupiter, and to behead anyone who does not make a sacrifice. On his way, Maximus, one of his officers, started crying and per the saints' instructions, he took the executioners to his house and from their preaching, \\"...they rooted out the false faith from the executioners,\\" and made them believers of God. Cecilia baptised them all together, and told Valerian and Tiburce that they had served well, and preserved their faith, and in order to save their lives, they should do the sacrifice. However, Valerian and Tiburce did not care for this, and in their unwavering devotion, fell to their knees, ready to lose their heads. When Maximus saw this, he told many others, in turn converting many of them, and also losing his life to his oppressor, Almachius. After Cecilia buried the three of them, Almachius sent for some of his men to seize her and have her taken to Jupiter to make a sacrifice, who were also converted by her preaching. After hearing this, Almachius ordered her to be brought before him, and in a trial, questioned her about her faith. Cecilia told him that she did not fear his power, and that she would neither make a sacrifice nor renounce her faith in Christianity. Cecilia greeted a man with such power as a \\"foolish creature\\". She stated that Almachius \\"in all things an ignorant officer and a vain judge\\". Enraged by her boldness and steadfast faith, Almachius commanded his men to bring her to the bathhouse and \\"burn her right in a bath of red flames.\\" She laid in the bath for the day and night however her body, representative of her unwavering faith, remained unharmed that \\"she sat cold and felt no pain; it did not make her sweat even a drop\\". So Almachius sent for one of his men to slay her and kill her. The executioner struck her thrice in her neck, and no more because it was against the law, yet she still did not die. Cecilia stayed like that, half-dead, with her neck cut open for three days, preaching and converting those who gathered around her. She finally died after the third day, and after she died, Pope Urban buried her body with the other saints and decreed her as Saint Cecilia.  Saint Cecilia's body analysed  Throughout the story, the importance of chastity is first to Saint Cecilia. Daily, Cecilia prayed that God would \\"protect her virginity\\". She then tells her husband, Valerian, that if he were to \\"touch or love [her] ignobly, without delay [the angel] will slay you on the spot; and thus [he] would die in [his] youth\\".He hears this and he respects her wishes. Almachius, a Roman prefect, does not. After learning that she is practising Christianity and of her boldness, he orders her to be burnt. Although she sat in a bath of flames, she sat there untouched by any of them. She sat cold and did not sweat one drop. After realising his failure, he then used his \\"evil mind\\" to devise that she be beheaded. She was then sent to be executed by three strokes to the neck. After three strokes, her head was still attached and the executioner could not hit her again. Even with this occurrence, Saint Cecilia still tells the Gospel to anyone that will hear her. Despite the physical torture that Cecilia's body endures through the beating, burning, and slashing of her throat, she still remains alive for three days, and is able to convert many non-believers through her preachings. Her body supports her, and does not fail her when she needs it the most. Cecilia's body is a symbol for her unwavering faith, and devotion. It refuses to give in to the pain inflicted by her oppressor, Almachius, just like how Cecilia refuses to give in to his psychological tortures. Cecilia's body's ability to maintain its chastity can also be seen as noteworthy. Despite having been forced into marriage to Valerian, and being punished for her chastity by Almachius, she was still able to preserve her chastity until she died. During this time, the female body was seen as one of the major sources where evil was birthed from. In \\"Body Symbolism in the Book of Margery Kempe\\", Susan Morgan states that, \\"medieval theologians and hagiographers viewed female sin as intrinsically bodily and sexual, emanating from within.\\"Morgan, Susan. \\"Body Symbolism in the Book of Margery Kempe.\\" New Blackfriars, vol. 76, no. 897, October 1995, pp. 426. https://www.jstor.org/stable/43249779 By keeping her virginity intact, Cecilia's body was able to evade this \\"sin\\" which ultimately helped her maintain her devotion, and led to her being a saint. According to \\"Body and Soul Dialogues in the Seventeenth Century\\", \\"the body may commit sinful actions, but the guilt is really the soul's\\".OSMOND, ROSALIE. \\"Body and Soul Dialogues in the Seventeenth Century.\\" English Literary Renaissance, vol. 4, no. 3, 1974, pp. 364‚Äì403. https://www.jstor.org/stable/43446809. In the case of Cecilia, she controlled her body through her soul. She did not let the ways of the world affect her soul, therefore her body remained unharmed. \\"Body and Soul\\" goes on to state that the soul was \\"created good and noble\\". The \\"world and the devil\\" impacted the flesh, yet the soul can take control and urge the body not to sin. This is what Saint Cecilia does through her faith. \\"Body without soul does nothing\\" meaning that her soul and faith are so strong, her body must and will follow her willingly. Cecilia's ability to maintain control over her body can be explained by her tendency to fast. Cecilia prayed to God to protect her virginity, and \\"for the love of Him who died upon a tree she fasted every second or third day.\\"Chaucer, Geoffrey. \\"The Second Nun's Tale.\\" The Canterbury Tales. 1478. pp. 2 By many, fasting was seen as a way to maintain control over one's body. Susan Morgan states that, \\"[t]he link between eating and sexual domination has a long history in Christian tradition\\" and \\"[w]hen women‚Ä¶fasted‚Ä¶they were‚Ä¶punishing and disciplining their flesh in pursuit of the higher goal of asexuality or chastity.\\"Morgan, Susan. \\"Body Symbolism in the Book of Margery Kempe.\\" New Blackfriars, vol. 76, no. 897, October 1995, pp. 429. https://www.jstor.org/stable/43249779 Similarly, Cecilia's decision to fast helped her control her body and remain chaste and pure.

The crowns are composed of roses and lilies, which are allegorical references to martyrdom and virginity. These crowns were given to Valerian and Cecilia after the angel told them to \\"always guard these crowns well, with pure body and unspotted thought\\". By referencing virginity through the flowers the angel fetched from \\"Paradise\\", the crowns are now a symbolic representation of their purity through God and from God. Importance of bodily sensation on divine comprehension In the Second Nun's Tale, Geoffrey Chaucer's characters' senses of sight, smell, and touch allows them to perceive the divine nature of things and gain a deeper spiritual understanding, which helped some of them ultimately reach martyrdom. Sight: When Valerian asks Cecilia to see the angel, she says, \\"That angel you shall see‚Ä¶ so long you believe in Christ and are baptized.\\"Chaucer, Geoffrey. \\"The Second Nun's Tale.\\" The Canterbury Tales. 1478. pp. 2. Tiburce, also, only sees the angel after he gets baptised by Saint Urban. Elizabeth Robertson states that, \\"Chaucer validates the body's ability to apprehend the meaning of Christianity through senses.\\"Robertson, Elizabeth. \\"Apprehending the Divine and Choosing To Believe:: Voluntarist Free Will in Chaucer's Second Nun's Tale.\\" The Chaucer Review, vol. 46, No. 1-2, 2011, pp. 120. https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/chaucerrev.46.1_2.0111 Overcoming their limited sight and seeing the angel, parallels to them gaining a deeper understanding of Christianity and religion. According to \\"Truth and Sight: Generalizing without Universalizing\\", \\"with the type of psychology that the awareness of deceit creates, the idea that what is seen is more truthful than what is reported in speech seems an obvious way in order to bypass human...deceit\\". Smell: Tiburce was immediately able to smell the sweet odour of the crowns of lilies and roses, even if he could not see them. These crowns are symbolic of the divine and his brother's and Cecilia's faith in God, and they lure Tiburce to seek this divinity and become a believer. Robertson confirms this by saying, \\"the flowers create in Tiburce a desire to know more about the spiritual truth, a desire that leads him to affirm his belief in God.\\"Robertson, Elizabeth. \\"Apprehending the Divine and Choosing To Believe:: Voluntarist Free Will in Chaucer's Second Nun's Tale.\\" The Chaucer Review, vol. 46, No. 1-2, 2011, pp. 116. https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/chaucerrev.46.1_2.0111 Touch: Valerian is unable to touch Cecilia's body, because the angel of God will kill him, so long as he is still a non-believer. Later, Cecilia tells Almachius to go beyond the materialised idols, and touch what he cannot see. However, Almachius is unable to do so, thus preventing him from gaining deeper spiritual understanding and belief.

It is Zambia's largest and oldest learning institution. The university was established in 1965 and officially opened to the public on 12 July 1966. The language of instruction is English. History The beginnings of UNZA can be traced back to before the Second World War when the idea to establish a University in Northern Rhodesia was conceived. However, plans were halted when the war broke out and only revived after. The colonial government instituted plans to set up a Central African University College, for Africa, due to the development of higher education institutions in most parts of Africa. The Central Africa council (CAC) appointed a committee to investigate requirements for a college for higher education and, it subsequently recommended that a college for higher education be established. A subsequent investigation into the need for higher education for Africans in Central Africa was conducted by Sir Alexander Carr-Saunders in 1952, with a follow up report submitted in March 1953. The Southern Rhodesia Government accepted the establishment of a multi-racial University College and the commission consequently recommended that an institution be established in Salisbury. However, a minority report written by Alexander Kerr, provided a counter argument suggesting that the establishment of a higher education institution on the basis of equality between races was not feasible and thus recommended that a university for non- Europeans be established in Lusaka. The political climate, as a result of the independence struggle, in the late 1950s and early 1960s made the idea of an all-inclusive University College of Rhodesia less attractive. As a result, plans to solicit support for the establishment of a higher education institution in Lusaka were initiated. In March 1963, the new Northern Rhodesia Government appointed a commission, the Lockwood Commission, led by Sir John Lockwood to assess the feasibility of setting up a university for Northern Rhodesia. The commission placed a lot of emphasis on autonomy and thus recommended the establishment of a university with no ties with already established universities in Britain. The report also recommended the establishment of the University of Zambia as a full-fledged university from the onset. A Provisional Council of the University of Zambia was put in place after enactment of the University of Zambia Act, 1965. In July 1965, Douglas G. Anglin was appointed Vice Chancellor and, in October 1965, President Kenneth David Kaunda gave the assent of Act no 66 of the 1965 act. The University of Zambia was inaugurated on 13 July 1966 following the appointment of President Kenneth David Kaunda as the first Chancellor on 12 July 1966. Campus University of Zambia as seen from the School of Education Its main campus, the Great East Road Campus, is along the Great East Road, about 7 km from the CBD.

(His family name is also seen as \\"Thabaud de La Touche\\" and even sometimes \\"Delatouche\\".) Life He was born at La Ch√¢tre (Indre). Among his works may be distinguished his comedies: Projets de sagesse (1811), and, in collaboration with Emile Deschamps, Selmours de Florian (1818), which ran for a hundred nights; also La Reine d'Espagne (1831), which proved too indecent for the public taste; a novel, Fragoletta ou Naples et Paris en 1799 (1829), which attained a success of notoriety; La Vall√©e aux loups (1833), a volume of prose essays and verse; and two volumes of poems, Les Adieus, (1843) and Les Agrestes (1844). Latouche's chief claim to remembrance is that he revealed to the world the genius of Andr√© Ch√©nier, then only known to a limited few. The remains of the poet's work had passed from the hands of Daunou to Latouche, who had sufficient critical insight instantly to recognize their value. In editing the first selection of Ch√©nier's poems (1819) he made some trifling emendations, but did not, as Beranger afterwards asserted, make radical and unnecessary changes. Latouche was guilty of more than one literary fraud. He caused a licentious story of his own to be attributed to the duchess of Duras, the irreproachable author of Ourika. He made many enemies by malicious attacks on his contemporaries. The Constitutionnel was suppressed in 1817 by the government for an obscure political allusion in an article by Latouche. He then undertook the management of the Mercure du XIXe si√®cle, and began a bitter warfare against the monarchy. After 1830 he edited Le Figaro, and spared neither the liberal politicians nor the romanticists who triumphed under the monarchy of July. In his turn he was violently attacked by Gustave Planche in the Revue des deux mondes for November 1831. But it must be remembered to the credit of Latouche that he did much to encourage George Sand at the beginning of her career. The last twenty years of his life were spent in retirement at Val d‚ÄôAulnay. Sainte-Beuve, in the Causeries du lundi, vol. 3, gives a not too sympathetic portrait of Latouche.

The game is a simulation of the campaign for North Africa during World War II, from the arrival of Erwin Rommel in April 1941 until November 1942, when the Second Battle of El Alamein took place in reality. The game was designed by Jim Dunnigan, with the system design and graphics by Redmond A. Simonsen and game development by Irad Hardy and Hank Zucker. It was first published in Strategy & Tactics #40, and later appeared in a boxed edition. It was republished by Avalon Hill in the mid-1980s. This game provided a relatively realistic simulation of the actual campaign, with small numbers of units, rapid movements across the map, critical logistic effects, the ebb and flow of the forces, and the strengths and weaknesses of both the Allied and Axis formations. Components This game was published using the compartmented plastic box that was common with many of the wargames produced by Simulations Publications. It included a 22\\" √ó 34\\" stiff paper map printed in various shades of brown, a set of die-cut cardboard counters, and the rules. The map is overlaid by a hex grid to standardize movement, with a scale of 12 miles per hex. Each game turn represented one month during the war, and the full campaign lasts 20 turns. Only about half the total height of the game board is used for the actual map. The remainder is covered by various charts and tables used in the game. Along the bottom is the game turn track that lists the reinforcements for each side. There is also a chart showing the various effects of the different terrain types, a combat results chart for resolving battles, a summary table of the various supply effects, and tracks for marking replacements for allied and axis forces. Most of the game map consists of the western desert of Libya and Egypt, and the various roads and tracks that were used for movement and supply. Important features include the array of escarpments near Tobruk, and the Qattara Depression - impassably rugged terrain south of El Alamein and northern Cyrenaica. The hexes containing Tobruk and Bardia are also fortified (the latter less so), aiding in their defense. At the start of the game the entire map is controlled by (thinly-spread) Commonwealth forces, who are deemed to have driven the Italians from Cyrenaica in late 1940, only for many of the Commonwealth forces to be withdrawn to fight in the Greek campaign. The counters represent the major formations that took part in the campaign, including German, Italian, and British allied units. Each counter represented a battalion, regiment, or brigade-strength unit. The sheet is printed in different shades of brown for the different forces, with creme for Italy, tan for Germany, and dark brown for Britain and her allies (the latter are red in the Avalon Hill edition). There are also various markers used primarily to manage the supply rules. Each of the military unit counters is printed with standard markings indicating the unit type, size, designation, and the combat strength and movement allowance. Typical movement allowances were 40, 50, 60, making for a highly fluid and mobile game. The types of units represented are infantry, paratroops, glider infantry, armor, armored infantry, and reconnaissance. Game play This is a two player game with one player controlling the allied forces and the other player the axis units. Each turn resolves allied actions first, followed by the axis. A player's turn consists of the supply determination, followed by movement, combat resolution, and the addition of reinforcements and the replacement of previously destroyed units. The allied player also has a command control phase before movement, which restricts certain units from moving. Each hex on the map grid has a unique 4-digit number. Based on a random die roll, units on a hex with last numbers matching the three values on the command control chart values are unable to move. Thus, although the allied forces normally enjoy numerical superiority, typically 30% of them are stationary each turn. Movement across the map is measured in terms of movement points (MP). Roads provide the optimal path for movement, and it only costs 1 MP to advance a hex through a hex side with a road. Track hexes cost 2 MP, open hexes 3 MP, and swamp or rough hexes and escarpment hex sides cost 10 MP. Only three friendly units can end their movement in the same hex. Supply is a key factor in this game, as it was in the historical campaign. Supply is typically provided by supply units, which are indicated by markers on the map. Each side must have a chain of these markers back to a supply base, with each supply unit within 20 movement points of the next. Supply units can be captured or moved about by each player's truck unit, but both sides normally only receive one such unit. As the truck only has 40 MP and must move back and forth to carry the supply units, this can severely hinder the advance of a supply line. Additional truck units may be generated by immobilising combat units. In order to be considered in supply, a unit must be within 20 movement points of a supply unit that is part of a supply chain. Unsupplied units are unable to move or attack, and defend at half strength. Supplied units can move and defend normally, and attack at half strength. Units within 8 MP of a supply unit receive a higher level of supply, and can attack at full strength. By expending a supply unit, the combat strength of units within 8 MP is temporarily doubled (\\"Maximum Attack Supply\\"). The six hexes surrounding the hex containing a unit on the map form a zone of control over which the unit exerts an influence. Units entering an enemy zone of control must cease their movement for the round. Units already in an enemy zone of control can not directly move to another enemy zone of control. Zones of control also block enemy supply lines. Attacks can be made against adjacent enemy units. The player selects which units adjacent to the enemy will participate in the attack and adds up their combat strength. The combat strengths of the opponents units in the hex being attacked are also totaled, and the result is subtracted from the attack total. This determines the column on the combat results table to be used to resolve the combat. A six-sided die is rolled to determine the result. The outcome of the attack is either no effect (for a low differential and a poor roll) or a number of the defenders strength points lost. The defender must eliminate enough of the units under attack to satisfy the losses, and then perform a counterattack after doubling (or quadrupling for the Germans) the surviving defender's combat strengths. The game includes special rules for overruns (attacks performed during movement); sea movement; rail movement between Alexandria and Matruh and replacement points to rebuild destroyed units - the Allied player may use such points to augment his units beyond their initial strength. There are also optional game variants to cover the results of the off-map attempt to capture Malta (decided by a single die roll, with extra Axis reinforcements if the attack succeeds, but fewer if it fails) and the arrival of additional Allied units beyond the historical deployment (e.g. US reinforcements - in reality US forces fought in Tunisia but not in the Desert campaign).

Correns was a student of Karl N√§geli, a renowned botanist with whom Mendel corresponded about his work with peas, and who subsequently engaged in a long exchange of letters concerning reproducibility of the results in another species (Hieracium). Because of the special properties of Hieracium, those experiments failed and Mendel dropped his studies on the subject. Early life and education Carl Correns was born September 1864 in Munich. Orphaned at an early age, he was raised by an aunt in Switzerland. He entered the University of Munich in 1885. While there, he was encouraged to study botany by Karl N√§geli. After completing his thesis, Correns became a tutor at the University of T√ºbingen and in 1913 he became the first director of the newly founded Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology in Berlin-Dahlem. He married a niece of Karl N√§geli, Elisabeth Widmer. Key experiments and findings Carl Correns Carl Correns conducted much of the foundational work for the field of genetics at the turn of the 20th century. He rediscovered and independently verified the work of Mendel in a separate model organism. He also discovered cytoplasmic inheritance, an important extension of Mendel's theories, which demonstrated the existence of extra- chromosomal factors on phenotype. Some of his unpublished work and most of his lab books were destroyed in the Berlin bombings of 1945. Rediscovery of Mendel In 1892, while at the University of T√ºbingen, Correns began to experiment with trait inheritance in plants. Correns published his first paper on 25 January 1900, which cited both Charles Darwin and Mendel, recognising the relevance of genetics to Darwin's ideas. In Correns' paper, \\"G. Mendel's Law Concerning the Behavior of the Progeny of Racial Hybrids\\", he restated Mendel's results as the' law of segregation' and introduced a new 'law of independent assortment'. Cytoplasmic inheritance After rediscovering Mendel's laws of heredity, which can be explained with chromosomal inheritance, he undertook experiments with the four o'clock plant Mirabilis jalapa to investigate apparent counterexamples to Mendel's laws in the heredity of variegated (green and white mottled) leaf color. Correns found that, while Mendelian traits behave independently of the sex of the source parent, leaf color depended greatly on which parent had which trait. For instance, pollinating an ovule from a white branch with pollen from another white area resulted in white progeny, the predicted result for a recessive gene. Green pollen used on a green stigma resulted in all green progeny, the expected result for a dominant gene. However, if green pollen fertilized a white stigma, the progeny were white, but if the sexes of the donors were reversed (white pollen on a green stigma), the progeny were green. This non- mendelian inheritance pattern was later traced to a gene named iojap which codes for a small protein required for proper assembly of the chloroplast ribosome. Even though iojap assorts according to Mendel's rules, if the mother is homozygous recessive, then the protein is not produced, the chloroplast ribosomes fail to form, and the plasmid becomes non-functional because the ribosomes cannot be imported into the organelle. The progeny could have functional copies of iojap, but since the chloroplasts come exclusively from the mother in most angiosperms, they would have been inactivated in the previous generation, and so will give white plants. Conversely, if a white father is paired with a green mother with functional chloroplasts, the progeny will only inherit functional chloroplasts, and will thus be green. In his 1909 paper, he established variegated leaf color as the first conclusive example of cytoplasmic inheritance.

(, ), originally called Archbishopric of Justiniana Prima and all Bulgaria (), was an autonomous Orthodox Church under the tutelage of the Patriarchate of Constantinople between 1019 and 1767. It was established following the Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria in 1018 by lowering the rank of the autocephalous Bulgarian Patriarchate due to its subjugation to Constantinople. Name The initial title of the archbishopric was simply \\"Bulgaria\\" (), but under the famous archbishop Theophylact Hephaistos (1078‚Äì1107) it was expanded to \\"All Bulgaria\\" or \\"Whole Bulgaria\\" (). John IV (1139/42‚Äì1163/64), the cousin of Emperor John II Komnenos, was the first to use the title of \\"Archbishop of Justiniana Prima and All Bulgaria\\" () in 1157, reflecting a recently developed trend that claimed for the see the succession and prerogatives of the short- lived Archbishopric of Justiniana Prima (535 ‚Äì ), founded by Justinian I. This title apparently fell into disuse by John's immediate successors, possibly due to pressure from the Patriarchate of Constantinople, but in the early 13th century it was revived by the ambitious Demetrios Chomatenos (1216‚Äì1236) to support his claims of quasi-patriarchal status in his clash over authority with the patriarchs of Constantinople in exile at the Empire of Nicaea. The designation finally became accepted by Constantinople and the Byzantine imperial chancery after 1261, and a fixed part of the archbishops' titulature; in the fullest form, the see was hence known as the Archbishopric of Justiniana Prima, Ohrid and all Bulgaria (). \\"Archbishopric of Ohrid\\" is the most common term of reference for the see because for the duration of its existence, from 1020 to 1767, its seat was in the city of Ohrid. History=Background Shortly after 934, the Byzantine emperor Romanos I Lekapenos recognized the head of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, Archbishop Damian, to the rank of patriarch, following the terms of the peace treaty that ended the Byzantine‚ÄìBulgarian war of 913‚Äì927. In 971, Emperor John I Tzimiskes dismissed Damian after annexing the capital city of Great Preslav and parts of northeast Bulgaria, but the Bulgarian patriarchate was probably restored under Tsar Samuel of Bulgaria. During his rule, the residence of the Bulgarian patriarchs remained closely connected to the developments in the war between Samuel and the Byzantine emperor Basil II. Thus, the next Patriarch German resided consecutively in Moglena (Almopia), Vodena (Edessa) and Prespa. Around 990, the last patriarch, Philip, moved to Ohrid. History Mantle presented to the Archbishopric of Ohrid from the Byzantine Emperor, Andronikos II Palaiologos, with an inscription, saying that the Archbishop was the spiritual shepherd of the Bulgarians - Bulgarian National Historical Museum. Following his final subjugation of the Bulgarian state in 1018, Basil II established the Archbishopric of Ohrid by downgrading the Bulgarian patriarchate into an autocephalous church, separate from the Patriarchate of Constantinople; to underscore that fact, its head was selected by the emperor from a list of three candidates submitted by the local church synod. In three sigillia issued in 1020 Basil II gave extensive privileges to the new see. Although the first appointed archbishop (John of Debar) was a Bulgarian, his successors, as well as the whole higher clergy, were invariably Byzantine, the most famous of them being Saint Theophylact (1078‚Äì1107). The Archbishops were chosen from among the monks in Constantinople. Adrianos Komnenos, under his monastic name of John (IV) (1143‚Äì1160), was the cousin of Emperor John II Komnenos, and was the first Archbishop who held the title of Archbishop of Justiniana Prima. The later archbishop John V Kamateros (1183‚Äì1216) was a former imperial clerk. In the 13th and the first half of the 14th centuries, the territory of the Archbishopric was contested by the Byzantine Empire, the Latin Empire, the Despotate of Epirus, the Second Bulgarian Empire and later Serbia. After the fall of Constantinople to the Latins in 1204 and with the foundation of the new states on the territory under jurisdiction of the Ohrid Archbishopric, autonomous churches were founded in the states which did not accept the jurisdiction either of Constantinople or of Ohrid. After 1204, the Empire of Nicaea claimed the Byzantine imperial heritage and provided refuge to the exiled patriarchs of Constantinople. In the restored Second Bulgarian Empire, a new Archbishopric was founded with its see in Tarnovo. Tsar Kaloyan (1197‚Äì1207) did not succeed in putting the Ohrid Archbishopric under the jurisdiction of the Tarnovo Archbishopric, but nevertheless managed to expel the Greek bishops and install Bulgarians instead. The next Bulgarian rulers were constantly trying to reunite the Ohrid Archbishopric with the Tarnovo Archbishopric. The Latin conquests, the restoring of the Bulgarian Empire and the formation of independent Serbian state reduced the jurisdiction of the Ohrid Archbishopric immensely, but it did not disappear. During the time of Archbishop Demetrios Chomatenos, the autocephaly of the Archbishopric was confirmed with the act of anointing the despot of Epirus, Theodore Komnenos Doukas, as Emperor and in a correspondence with the Patriarch. The southward expansion of the Serbian state in the second half of 13th century was also followed by changes in ecclesiastical jurisdiction of some sees. After the successful Serbian campaigns against Byzantine empire in 1282‚Äì1283, cities of Skopje and Debar were annexed and local eparchies transferred to the jurisdiction of Serbian Archbishopric of Peƒá. Serbian expansion reached its apogee at the time of king and tsar Stefan Du≈°an (1331‚Äì1355). Du≈°an had conquered Ohrid around 1334. Under Serbian rule the Archbishopric of Ohrid kept its autonomy. On 16 April 1346 (Easter), at the Serbian capital city of Skopje, a joined state and church assembly (sabor) was held, attended by Serbian Archbishop Joanikije II, the Archbishop Nicholas I of Ohrid, the Patriarch Simeon of Bulgaria and other hierarchs and dignitaries, including monastic leaders of Mount Athos. The assembly proclaimed the raising of the autocephalous Serbian Archbishopric to the rank of Patriarchate. The Archbishopric of Ohrid was not annexed to the Serbian Patriarchate of Peƒá and kept its autonomy, recognizing only the honorary seniority of the Serbian Patriarch. After the Battle of Maritsa in 1371, and Battle of Kosovo in 1389, much of the territory of the Archbishopric of Ohrid was affected by expansion of Ottoman Turks, who conquered Skopje in 1392 and annexed all southern regions after the death of Prince Marko in 1395. The archbishopric managed to survive the transition and was legalized by new Ottoman authorities. Not long after the fall of the Bulgarian Patriarchate in 1394, some of the bishoprics under its jurisdiction also entered the Ohrid Archbishopric. Thus, in the beginning of the 15th century, the Archbishop of Ohrid, attached the dioceses of Sofia and Vidin to the Archbishopric. In 1408, Ohrid came under Ottoman rule. Still, the Ottomans did not reach after the Ohrid Archbishopric, mostly because of their tolerance for monotheistic religions, and left the people to govern themselves regarding religion. When the last medieval Serbian Patriarch died in 1463, there were no technical options to elect a new one, so the Ohrid Archbishopric had laid its claim over many of the Serbian Patriarchate's eparchies on the basis of its old 1019 territorial rights, predating Serbian autocephaly. By the 1520s, the Archbishopric of Ohrid had managed to put practically the entire Serbian Church under its jurisdiction, however by intervention of Sokollu Mehmed Pasha in 1557, the latter was renewed and reorganized. During the 15th century, dioceses from the other side of the Danube, from the duchies of Wallachia and Moldova, fell under the jurisdiction of the Archbishopric. Nevertheless, this did not last for more than a hundred years. Towards the beginning of the 16th century, the Ohrid Archbishopric expanded its jurisdiction even over territories in Southern Italy, as well as in Dalmatia. The flock of this diocese was made of Greeks and Albanians. Towards the middle of the 16th century, the Ohrid Archbishopric lost the Diocese of Veroia, however, at the beginning of the 17th century, it gained the Diocese of Durazzo from the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. Since then and until its abolishment in 1767, the Archbishopric neither lost nor gained a diocese under its jurisdiction. Abolition The autocephaly of the Ohrid Archbishopric remained respected during the periods of Byzantine, Bulgarian, Serbian and Ottoman rule and the church continued to exist until its abolition in 1767, when it was abolished by the Sultan's decree, at the urging of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, and was placed under the jurisdiction of the Patriarch of Constantinople. The division into phanariotes and autochthonists which occurred among the diocesan bishops of the Ohrid Archbishopric and, the difficult financial position of the Ohrid Archbishopric over a longer period of time, contributed to its abolishment. Just a year before, the Patriarchate of Constantinople abolished the Serbian Patriarchate of Peƒá in the same manner, and its dioceses adjoined to the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Language The Greek language quite early replaced Old Church Slavonic as the official language of the Archbishopric. All documents and even hagiographies of Bulgarian saints, for example the hagiography of Saint Clement of Ohrid, were written in Greek. Despite this, the Slavonic liturgy was preserved on the lower levels of the Church for several centuries. Administration The Archbishopric of Ochrid was an autocephalous church, with full internal ecclesiastical self-governance. Only after the Ottoman conquest, as part of the millet system, did it come under the supreme ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. At the time of its establishment, the archbishopric comprised 32 suffragan sees. However, over the following decades many of the bishoprics removed from other jurisdictions and accorded to Ohrid by Basil II were returned to their original metropolises. Despite the creation of new bishoprics from existing ones, by the middle of the 12th century the number of suffragans‚Äîapart from Ohrid itself‚Äîhad decreased to 23 (modern names in parentheses): Kastoria, Skopia (Skopje), Belebousdion (Velbazhd), Sardike or Triaditza (Sofia), Malesobe or Morobisdion (unlocated), Edessa or Moglena, Herakleia (Bitola) or Pelagonia, Prisdiana, Tiberioupolis or Stroummitza (Strumica), Nisos, Kephalenia or Glabinitze, Morabos or Branitzobe, Sigida or Belegrada (Belgrade), Bidine (Vidin), Sirmion (Sremska Mitrovica), Lipenion, Rhasos (Ras), Selasphoros or Diabolis (Devol), Slanitza or Pella, Illyrikon or Kanina, Grebenon (Grevena), Deure, and the bishopric of the Vlachs.

Early life Bell was born and raised in Chicago as an only child. His father was an accountant for the Link-Belt Company. His mother was primarily a homemaker, with a part-time job with Mrs. Steven's Candies. (In later years, his parents adopted a daughter.) Bell grew up listening to radio soap operas when he came home from school for lunch and late at night, including Life Can Be Beautiful, The Romance of Helen Trent and Our Gal Sunday. He noted while listening to The Guiding Light that after the title the announcer would say 'created by Irna Phillips'. As a depression-era child, he would work at various odd jobs on weekends to help the family. In high school, he participated in the ROTC. After serving in the Navy as a corpsman, he attended the University of Michigan. Career=Chicago radio writer At the age of 21, Bell had a relatively short stint at WJJD radio as a writer for two shows, with the focus being teen problems. His work there was the catalyst for soliciting a job at WBBM radio as a comedy writer; specifically, character-oriented comedy, rather than jokes. He worked there for about three years. Advertising industry Bell received an offer to work at McCann Erickson, the second-largest advertising agency worldwide (at that time). He wrote radio and television commercials for Standard Oil of Indiana, the agency's biggest account; he was subsequently promoted to account executive, responsible for five small accounts. He worked there for three years. Bell was then offered an account executive position with Cunningham & Walsh. Procter and Gamble Productions During his time as a comedy writer at WBBM radio in Chicago, he made a call to Irna Phillips' secretary Rose Cooperman asking her if Phillips had an opening for a writer, as she was a well-known soap opera creator and Bell had become aware that Phillips also resided in Chicago. Cooperman said Phillips did have an opening. While Bell was composing a sample script, he was informed that the writer who was supposedly leaving had decided to stay, so the writing job was not available. Later, during the time that Bell was in the advertising business, he ran into Phillips' niece. She mentioned him to her aunt and Phillips remembered who he was; she also knew his wife, who was a well-known celebrity due to her work on local television. He started his writing career on The Guiding Light and then moved over to As the World Turns, working under Phillips; Phillips' other protegee at the time was Agnes Nixon. Bell co-created Another World with Phillips in 1964. In 1965, he co-created the primetime As the World Turns spinoff Our Private World.  Days of our Lives  In 1966, he was hired as head writer of the then- struggling soap Days of Our Lives. Bell was credited with the show's initial surge of popularity. Bell changed the dynamics of soaps when he began focusing on sexuality. Formerly, soap operas did not delve into the sexual side of their romances. He intended to leave the show around 1972 when he began creating his own show The Young and the Restless, but the show sued him and he agreed to write long-term story projections for them. He remained as head writer until 1975.  The Young and the Restless  In 1972, CBS executives wanted a new daytime serial that was youth oriented. William along with his wife Lee Phillip Bell created The Young and the Restless for the network under the working title, The Innocent Years. However, before the show went into production, he had to rename the series as Bell mentioned...\\"We were confronted with the very disturbing reality that young America had lost much of its innocence,\\". \\"Innocence as we had known and lived it all our lives had, in so many respects, ceased to exist.\\" They renamed the series to The Young and the Restless because they felt it \\"reflected the youth and mood of the early seventies.\\" He spent between ten and sixteen hours a day writing stories. The Young and the Restless debuted on March 26, 1973. Although slow to rise in the ratings (he got very frustrated and asked head of CBS Daytime Bud Grant to cancel the serial), CBS had faith in the show and gave it a chance. Y&R; was credited for breathing new life into the daytime serial, with its brightness, humor and cutting-edge storylines. As he did on Days of our Lives, Bell saw to sexuality also playing a major role in the stories. Bell guided Y&R; as head writer from 1973 until stepping down in 1998, the longest tenure of any head writer in soap opera history. Y&R; has been the highest- rated soap on the air since 1988 in households, and 1989 among viewers. =Controversy= Brenda Dickson, an original cast member of The Young and The Restless, claims that Bell blacklisted her after 15 years on the show after they partook in a secret love affair. He then went on to wreak havoc on her personal and professional life by hiring \\"Mafia cartel judges and attorneys\\" to \\"ruin\\" her life. As a result, she ended up \\"broke and homeless\\" and has been blocked from working ever since.  The Bold and the Beautiful  In 1986, he began working on creating another soap for CBS Daytime, but plans were halted until the end of the year when the network decided to cancel the soap Capitol and needed a replacement. He created The Bold and the Beautiful, which debuted on March 23, 1987. B&B; is known for its glamorous look as it is set in the fashion industry. It followed Y&R; and has been a ratings success as well. Personal life William J. Bell's grave Bell was married to former talk show host Lee Phillip Bell, who co-created The Young and the Restless and The Bold and the Beautiful with him. Their three children, William James Bell, Bradley Phillip Bell, Lauralee Bell Martin, and daughter-in-law Maria Arena Bell are all involved in their parents' soaps in some capacity. On April 29, 2005, Bell died at age 78 from complications of Alzheimer's disease. He is buried at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.

Gameplay In King Arthur's World, the player controls King Arthur. At the start of each level, only the King is present and various types of troops can be brought out of the tent where he starts. The King and his troops can be commanded to move in a direction, which they do until they receive new orders, are killed or come across enemy troops, which they fight if they can. Also, some troops have special commands, such as for archers to fire arrows. The aim of each level is to proceed from the tent at the start to the finishing point. This may require the player to defeat various enemies, avoid traps and obstacles. King Arthur is the only essential character. If he dies, the player has failed and play can only continue if 100 gold coins are spent to rescue him, in which case the player restarts at their tent. The game can be played with a standard controller or, alternatively, with the Super NES Mouse. King Arthur's World Mobile In 2018 it was announced that some of the original makers of the game had reunited to redevelop King Arthur's World, initially for mobile platforms.

The Royal Mail postcode is LL71, and it has a population of 1,360,Office for National Statistics : Census 2011 : Parish Headcounts : Isle of Anglesey of whom more than 60% is Welsh speaking. The village is situated near the centre of Anglesey close to the large water supply reservoir, Llyn Alaw, and is believed to have an ancient foundation. Llannerch means \\"a woodland clearing\\". The word medd in the name is Welsh for mead, which is made from honey, and the name may be related to the production of honey for mead. The disused Anglesey Central Railway runs through the village. Its station, opened in 1866, was closed in 1964 as part of the Beeching Axe, and its goods yard is now a car park. There is now a cafe and tea rooms housed in a modern extension of the old buildings. Just to the northeast of the village is the hill called Pen y Foel which is 123m above sea level; between 1951 and 1956 this was the site of a VHF Fixer station, part of the RAF Western Sector, and was one of a number similar fixed sites managed by RAF Longley Lane near Preston in Lancashire. The site contained an octagonal wooden hut with a hand- steerable radio mast with two radio receivers of type R1392D, transmitter and telephone line. This hut was protected by a close surrounding octagonal brick wall to provide some bomb blast protection which still exists. The station was used to allow each sector to locate RAF or allied aircraft and to help pilots find airfields in low cloud weather conditions. Also on the hill was a rectangular brick hut (now unroofed) also built by the RAF; this was a simple two-room hut with a rainwater collection tank. The site had three RAF wireless personnel (two were normally on duty) who were billeted with a landlady in Llannerch-y-Medd and attached to nearby RAF Valley. The site closed in around 1956 as the technology was replaced by improved systems. The hill Pen y Foel is also the basis for the name of the local Male Voice Choir Cor Meibion Y Foel which is a member of the National Association of Choirs. It has 43 members and rehearses in the village at Capel Ifan. Over the past decade the Choir has supported local Eisteddfodau, competed in the Anglesey Eisteddfod, raised money for numerous charities and has entertained audiences in concerts, weddings and other functions throughout North Wales. A claim that Mary, the mother of Jesus, is buried in the village forms the subject of Graham Phillips's The Marian Conspiracy. Mary's traditional burial place is near Ephesus, in present-day Turkey. Governance An electoral ward exists in the same name. This ward stretches to cover the Community of Tref Alaw with a total population taken at the 2011 census of 1,941.

The file format and the program were both called ARC. The format is known as the subject of controversy in the 1980s, part of important debates over what would later be known as open formats. ARC was extremely popular during the early days of the dial-up BBS. ARC was convenient as it combined the functions of the SQ program to compress files and the LU program to create .LBR archives of multiple files. The format was later replaced by the ZIP format, which offered better compression ratios and the ability to retain directory structures through the compression/decompression process. The .arc filename extension is often used for several file archive-like file types. For example, the Internet Archive uses its own ARC format to store multiple web resources into a single file. The FreeArc archiver also uses .arc extension, but uses a completely different file format. Nintendo uses an unrelated \\"ARC\\" format for resources, such as MIDI, voice samples, or text, in GameCube and Wii games. Several unofficial extractors exist for this type of ARC file.  History  In 1985, Thom Henderson of System Enhancement Associates wrote a program called ARC, based on earlier programs such as ar, that not only grouped files into a single archive file but also compressed them to save disk space, a feature of great importance on early personal computers, where space was very limited and modem transmission speeds were very slow. The archive files produced by ARC had file names ending in \\".ARC\\" and were thus sometimes called \\"arc files\\". The source code for ARC was released by SEA in 1986 and subsequently ported to Unix and the Atari ST in 1987 by Howard Chu. This more portable codebase was subsequently ported to other platforms, including VAX/VMS and IBM System/370 mainframes. Howard's work was also the first to disprove the prevalent belief that Lempel-Ziv encoded files could not be further compressed. Additional compression could be achieved by using Huffman coding on the LZW data, and Howard's version of ARC was the first program to demonstrate this property. This hybrid technique was later used in several other compression schemes by Phil Katz and others. Later, Phil Katz developed his own shareware utilities, PKARC and PKXARC, to create archive files and extract their contents. These files worked with the archive file format used by ARC and were significantly faster than ARC on the IBM-PC platform due to selective assembly-language coding. Unlike SEA, which combined archive creation and archive file extraction in a single program, Katz divided these functions between two separate utilities, reducing the amount of memory needed to run them. PKARC also allowed the creation of self- extracting archives, which could unpack themselves without requiring an external file extraction utility. Following the System Enhancement Associates, Inc. vs PKWARE Inc. and Phillip W. Katz lawsuit, SEA withdrew from the shareware market and developed ARC+Plus. This version included a full-screen user interface, with the last known version being 7.12. SEA was eventually sold to a Japanese company in 1992. The ARC format is no longer common on PC desktops, but most antivirus scanners can still uncompress any ARC archives found in order to detect viruses within the compressed files.  Lawsuits  In the late 1980s a dispute arose between SEA, maker of the ARC program, and PKWARE, Inc. (Phil Katz Software). SEA sued Katz for trademark and copyright infringement. An independent software expert, John Navas, was appointed by the court to compare the two programs, and stated that PKARC was a derivative work of ARC, pointing out that comments in both programs were often identical, including spelling errors. On August 2, 1988, the plaintiff and defendants announced a settlement of the lawsuit, which included a Confidential Cross- License Agreement under which SEA licensed PKWARE for all the ARC-compatible programs published by PKWARE during the period beginning with the first release of PKXARC in late 1985 through July 31, 1988, in return for an undisclosed payment. In the agreement, PKWARE paid SEA to obtain a license that allowed the distribution of PKWARE's ARC-compatible programs until January 31, 1989, after which PKWARE would not license, publish or distribute any ARC compatible programs or utilities that process ARC compatible files. In exchange, PKWARE licensed SEA to use its source code for PKWARE's ARC- compatible programs. PKWARE also agreed to cease any use of SEA's trademark \\"ARC\\" and to change the names or marks used with PKWARE's programs to non- confusing designations. The remaining details of the agreement were sealed. In reaching the settlement, the defendants did not admit any fault or wrongdoing. The Wisconsin court order showed defendants were ordered to pay damages to plaintiff for defendants' acts of infringing Plaintiff's copyrights, trademark, and acts of unfair trade practices and unfair competition.System Enhancement Associates, Inc. v. PKWare, Inc. and Phillip W. Katz, No. 88-C-447, Judgment for Plaintiff on Consent, E.D. Wisc. (Aug. 1., 1988) The leaked agreement document revealed under the settlement terms, the defendants had paid plaintiff $22,500 for past royalty payments, and $40,000 for expense reimbursements. In addition, defendants would pay plaintiff a royalty fee of 6.5% of all revenue received for ARC compatible programs on all orders received after the effective date of this Agreement, such revenue including any license fees or shareware registrations received after the expiration of the license, for ARC compatible programs. In exchange, plaintiff would also pay a commission in the amount of 6.5% of any license fees received by plaintiff from any licensee referred to plaintiff by defendants, whether before or after the license termination date. After the lawsuit, PKWARE released one last version of his PKARC and PKXARC utilities under the new names \\"PKPAK\\" and \\"PKUNPAK\\", and from then on concentrated on developing the separate programs PKZIP and PKUNZIP, which were based on new and different file compression techniques and archive file formats. However, following the renaming, SEA filed a lawsuit against PKWARE for contempt, for continually using plaintiff's protected mark ARC, by turning ARC from noun into verb in the PKPAK manual. The U.S. district court of the East District of Wisconsin ruled SEA's motion was denied, and the defendant was entitled to recover the legal cost of $500. The SEA vs. PKWARE dispute quickly expanded into one of the largest controversies the BBS world ever saw.BBS Documentary, Episode 8, , Accessed as of 13.07.2012 The suit by SEA angered many shareware users who perceived that SEA was a \\"large, faceless corporation\\" and Katz was \\"the little guy\\". In fact, at the time, both SEA and PKWARE were small home-based companies. However, the community largely sided with Katz, due to the fact that SEA was attempting to retroactively declare the ARC file format to be closed and proprietary. Katz received positive publicity by releasing the APPNOTE.TXT specification documenting the ZIP file format, and declaring that the ZIP file format would always be free for competing software to implement. The net result was that the ARC format quickly dropped out of common use as the predominant compression format that PC-BBSs used for their file archives, and after a brief period of competing formats, the ZIP format was adopted as the predominant standard. In an interview, Thom Henderson of SEA said that the main reason he dropped out of software development was because of his inability to emotionally cope with what he claimed was the hate-mail campaign launched against him by Katz.BBS: The Documentary, Episode 3.03 Compression.

He followed this with a number of other works where he attempted to complete his reconstruction of ancient history, collectively known as the Ages in Chaos series. Velikovsky's work has been harshly criticised, including even by some fellow chronological revisionists. Summary Velikovsky had put forward his ideas briefly in Theses for the Reconstruction of Ancient History in 1945, where he claimed that the history of the ancient Near East down to the time of Alexander the Great is garbled, but Ages in Chaos was his first full-length work on the subject. His starting point for the first volume of the series was that the Exodus took place not, as orthodoxy has it, at some point during the Egyptian New Kingdom, but at the fall of the Middle Kingdom.Velikovsky Ages in Chaos In this and later volumes, he made heavy use of the concept of \\"ghost doubles\\" or alter-egos: historical figures who were known by different names in two different sources (e.g. Egyptian and Greek) and were considered to be entirely different people living in different centuries, but who he proposed to be actually erroneously dated accounts of the same individuals and events. First he claimed that the Ipuwer Papyrus came from the beginning of Egypt's Second Intermediate Period, and that this was an Egyptian account of the Plagues of Egypt. He then identified Tutimaios as the Pharaoh of the Exodus (much earlier than any of the mainstream candidates), the Hyksos with the biblical Amalekites, the Egyptian Pharaoh Hatshepsut with the Biblical Queen of Sheba, the land of Punt with Solomon's kingdom, and Pharaoh Thutmose III with the Biblical King Shishak. He claimed that the Egyptian Amarna letters from the late 18th Dynasty describe events from the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, from roughly the time of King Ahab.  Later works on ancient history  Akhnaton A second volume was due for publication shortly after this but was postponed. Instead it was followed in 1960 by Oedipus and Akhnaton, where he claimed that the story of the Pharaoh Akhenaten was the origin of the Greek legend of Oedipus, and that Amenophis III was Laius, and Tutankhamun was Eteocles.Velikovsky Oedipus and Akhnaton In the last two years of his life Velikovsky published a further two volumes of the series. In Peoples of the Sea he dealt with the final period of his reconstruction, the Persian invasions of Egypt. Manetho's 20th dynasty here becomes identified with the dynasties which ruled a newly independent Egypt in the early 4th century BCE, and Nectanebo I is a ghost double of Rameses III.Velikovsky Peoples of the Sea Rameses III fought invasions by the Sea Peoples, including the \\"Peleset\\", conventionally identified with the Philistines. According to Velikovsky, the \\"Peleset\\" are actually the Persians and the other Sea Peoples are their Greek mercenaries. The 21st dynasty then becomes a line of priest-kings who ruled in the oases simultaneously with the Persians. Ramses II In Ramses II and His Time Velikovsky identified each of the major 19th dynasty pharaohs with a corresponding pharaoh of the 26th dynasty. Thus, Ramses I was an alter-ego of Necho I, Seti I of Psamtik I, Ramses II of Necho II, and Merneptah of Apries. In order to make these identifications work, Velikovsky claimed that the Hittite Empire was an invention of modern historians, and the supposedly Hittite archaeological remains in modern Turkey were actually Chaldean, i.e. Neo-Babylonian. The Hittite kings are held to be ghost doubles of the Neo- Babylonian kings, and Rameses II's battle with the Hittites at Kadesh is identical to Necho's fight against Nebuchadrezzar II at Carchemish, Nabopolassar is Mursili II, Neriglissar is Muwatalli, Labashi-Marduk is Urhi- Teshup, and Nebuchadrezzar II is Hattusili III.Velikovsky Ramses II and His Time At the time of his death he considered that completing his reconstruction of ancient history would require a further two volumes: The Assyrian Conquest and The Dark Age of Greece; these were never published in print in English, but online versions are available at the Velikovsky archive.The Immanuel Velikovsky Archive In the former work, Velikovsky separated the 18th and 19th dynasties, specifically arguing that over a century separated Ay and Horemheb, conventionally regarded as his successor. Instead, he had the 22nd through 25th dynasties follow upon the earlier part of the 18th, leading down to the Assyrian invasions of the early 7th century BCE. The \\"great king\\" who crowned Horemheb was the Assyrian king. The books have remained popular. The British publisher Sidgwick & Jackson reprinted Ages in Chaos ten times between 1953 and 1977, and Paradigma reprinted it as recently as 2009. Controversy and criticism The revised chronology proposed by Ages in Chaos has been rejected by nearly all mainstream historians and Egyptologists. It was claimed, starting with early reviewers, that Velikovsky's usage of material for proof is often very selective.Albright, William 1952. New York Herald Tribune Book Review April 20. Retelling the Near East's Ancient History. p. 6.Kaempffert, Waldemar 1952. New York Times Book Review April 20.

In 1965 the leading cuneiformist Abraham Sachs, in a forum at Brown University, discredited Velikovsky's use of Mesopotamian cuneiform sources.see transcript in Aeon 1992, Vol.3 No.1, pp.103-5, and also http://abob.libs.uga.edu/bobk/vsachs.html Velikovsky was never able to refute Sachs' attack.Ellenberger, Leroy 1992. Aeon 3 (1), section \\"Bonanza from Brown\\" in \\"Of Lessons, Legacies, and Litmus Tests: A Velikovsky Potpourri (Part One)\\", pp. 88-90. \\"Velikovsky confronted a panel of four professors [at Brown University on March 15, 1965]: Leon N. Cooper (physics), Bruno J Giletti (geology), Charles Smiley (astronomy) and Abraham J. Sachs (history of mathematics) [who was substituting for Otto Neugebauer ], moderated by Henry Kuƒçera (linguistics). In the event, Velikovsky debated the first three handily. He was stunned by Sachs whose address was both a rhetorical and substantive tour de force. Velikovsky's rebuttal began: 'Dr. Sachs threw so many accusations in that Philippic of his that I am at a difficulty to answer; but I invite Dr. Sachs to spend the hour and a half tomorrow at the meeting [at Diman House], and every one of you too, and point by point each of his statements will be proven wrong.' Unfortunately, Sachs did not show up the next day and Velikovsky did not even mention Sachs [according to the tape recording of the proceedings in the possession of Warner B. Sizemore who loaned it to Ellenberger March 31, 1979]. Curiously, Velikovsky's file for the Brown trip contains typed rebuttals to all the panelists except Sachs, for whom only partial, penciled notes exist--but later that year Velikovsky would reply to Kim J. Masters, a Princeton sophomore, within a week in The Daily Princetonian (Nov. 15, 1965) over a criticism of Oedipus and Akhnaton. Velikovsky's rebuttal to Masters was scathing, running the gamut from haggling over details to ad hominems.\\" In 1984 fringe science expert Henry H. Bauer wrote Beyond Velikovsky: The History of a Public Controversy, which Time described as \\"the definitive treatise debunking Immanuel Velikovsky\\". Bauer accused Velikovsky of dogmatically asserting his own point of view to be correct, where at best this is only one possible interpretation of the historical material in question, and gives several examples from Ages in Chaos. In 1984 Egyptologist David Lorton produced a detailed critique of chapter 3 of Ages in Chaos, which identifies Hatshepsut with the Queen of Sheba, e.g. accusing Velikovsky of mistakes that he would have avoided if he had a basic knowledge of the languages of the ancient near east. In 1978, following the much-postponed publication of further volumes in Velikovsky's Ages in Chaos series, the United Kingdom-based Society for Interdisciplinary Studies organised a conference in Glasgow specifically to debate the revised chronology.\\"Ages in Chaos?'-Proceedings of the Residential Weekend Conference, Glasgow, 7th-9th April 1978\\" Society for Interdisciplinary Studies Review Vol. VI, issue 1/2/3 84pp (1982) The ultimate conclusion of this work, by scholars including Peter James, John Bimson, Geoffrey Gammonn, and David Rohl, was that this particular revision of chronology was untenable,Bimson, \\"Finding the Limits of Chronological Revision\\" in \\"Proceedings of the SIS Conference: Ages Still in Chaos\\" Chronology & Catastrophism Review 2003 although they considered that the work had highlighted problems with the orthodox chronology. David Rohl, one of those involved in the 1978 Glasgow conference, has developed his own revised chronology. While he agrees that the Exodus should be dated to the collapse of the Middle Kingdom, and that Tutimaios is the Pharaoh of the Exodus, there are few points of contact between the Velikovsky and Rohl chronologies, largely because of the different methodologies used to resolve the later periods. James, another Glasgow delegate who went on to publish a work challenging the concept of a widespread dark age at the end of the Bronze Age, credited Velikovsky with \\"point[ing] the way to a solution by challenging Egyptian chronology\\", but criticised Velikovsky's chronology as \\"disastrously extreme\\", producing \\"a rash of new problems far more severe than those it hoped to solve\\" and noted that \\"Velikovsky understood little of archaeology and nothing of stratigraphy\\". One important disagreement is that Rohl and James consider that the chronology of the ancient Near East becomes fixed by the conquests of the Assyrians in the 7th century BCE. Velikovsky carried his revisionism into the Late Period of ancient Egypt, and considered that chronology only becomes fixed by the conquests of Alexander the Great in the 4th century BCE. They have also rejected some of Velikovsky's more extreme claims e.g. non-existence of Hittite Empire, changing the order of some Egyptian dynasties. Rohl and James's views remain controversial and are not accepted by most historians. Legacy In spite of the hostility of mainstream historians, Velikovsky's revisionism continues to attract adherents. Following his death in 1979 Velikovsky's theories were championed by Lynn E. Rose, Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at Buffalo. After Rose's death in 2013 the torch passed to a small group of disciples, among whom the most vocal and active are Charles Ginenthal and Emmet Sweeney. Ginenthal is the founder and principal contributor to an online journal The Velikovskian. He has also authored a series of revisionist works under the title Pillars of the Past. Emmet Sweeney has published his chronological revisions in a series of works entitled Ages in Alignment. These scholars believe that Velikovsky did not go far enough. Under the influence of Gunnar Heinsohn they have shortened Velikovsky's timeline of ancient history even more. The 12th Dynasty of ancient Egypt has been moved almost 1500 years closer to the present, ending with Alexander the Great's invasion in 331 BC. The Exodus has been redated to the 8th century, and the 18th Dynasty has been moved to the 8th‚Äì7th centuries. 274 years have been removed from the history of the Israelites. The Hittite Empire, which Velikovsky identified with the Neo-Babylonian Empire, has been identified with the Lydian Kingdom, while the Neo-Babylonians are now regarded as vassal kings of Babylon under the Macedonian Seleucids. The Neo-Assyrian Empire is now equated with the Persian Empire in northern Assyria and has been redated accordingly. In truth, very little of Velikovsky's chronology has been left untouched. Little if any of these authors' work has been endorsed by mainstream historians.

The party was the party which opposed the People's National Movement (PNM) at the time of Independence. After several splits brought about by leadership struggles, the party lost its hold on the Indo-Trinidadian community in the 1976 General Elections and was displaced in parliament by the United Labour Front under the leadership of Basdeo Panday. The party was the representative of the ethnic Indian community in the country; however Indian Muslims and Christians were said to be less loyal to the party than Indian Hindus.Horowitz, Donald L. \\"Ethnic Groups in Conflict. Chapter 7. The party symbol was a flaming torch. Federal period  The DLP was formed through the merger of three Opposition parties in the Legislative Council, the People's Democratic Party, the Trinidad Labour Party and the Party of Political Progress Groups. Also joining was Stephen Maharaj, a member of the Butler Party. The three parties aligned with the Democratic Labour Party of the West Indies Federation under the leadership of Sir Alexander Bustamante and merged to form a single national party. The DLP defeated the PNM in the 1958 Federal Elections, winning six of the ten seats in the Federal Parliament. Shortly thereafter the party began to disintegrate. Bhadase Sagan Maraj, the first leader of the party in the Legislative Council, became ill, bedridden and overly reliant on pethidine. Dr. Rudranath Capildeo was elected party leader in 1960; he was brought into the party to provide an \\"intellectual equal\\" to Eric Williams. When Capildeo left Trinidad to teach at the University of London, a faction of the party called a general meeting and elected Albert Gomes party leader. However, the rank and file of the party stood behind Capildeo, and the Gomes faction left the party. Independence era 1961 saw the introduction of the Representation of the People Act, which modernized the election process by instituting identification cards, voting machines, and altered the way in which constituencies were laid out. The DLP viewed this as an attempt to disenfranchise Indo-Trinidadian voters. Indo- Trinidadians were less educated and suspicious of authorities. The DLP claimed that Indo-Trinidadians would be less likely to register, and might be intimidated by \\"complicated\\" voting machines. They also accused the PNM of gerrymandering the constituencies to maximise the impact of PNM supporters and minimise the impact of DLP supporters. Consequently, the 1961 General Election campaign was extremely tense and racially polarised. The DLP alleged that voting machines were rigged. These allegations found support when initial returns showed PNM candidate A.N.R. Robinson receiving more votes than there were registered electors in his constituency. The PNM secured a two-thirds majority (20 of 30 seats) in Parliament.The DLP won the remaining 10 seats. When the Federation was dissolved in 1961 (following the withdrawal of Jamaica), this majority allowed the PNM to write the Independence Constitution without input from the DLP. In response to allegations of voting irregularities the DLP boycotted the opening of parliament and operated largely through boycotts and walk-outs. In 1963 Rudranath Capildeo accepted a permanent position at the University of London and attempted to run the DLP and serve as Leader of the Opposition while based in London. He was able to retain his seat in Parliament through special dispensation from the Speaker of the House, Arnold Thomasos. In March of that year Capildeo gave the party a new creed, Democratic Socialism. This action, coupled with Capildeo's absentee rulership, led to a revolt in the party executive, and this resulted in the appointment of Stephen Maharaj (a former Butler Party member) as Leader of the Opposition, while Capildeo retained the post of Party Leader. When the executive tried to replace Capildeo with Maharaj as Party leader, Capildeo dismissed the executive. In response to this on January 13, 1964 three MPs, Dr. Montgomery Forrester, Peter Farquahar and Tajmool Hosein resigned from the party and formed the Liberal Party. Unrest in country and party Independence left the two main industries, sugar and oil in the hands of foreign multi-national corporations (Tate & Lyle in sugar, Shell, British Petroleum and Texaco in oil). The labour unions interpreted this as evidence that the PNM and DLP leadership had sold out to foreign corporations. George Weekes, an anti-PNM Afro-Trinidadian trade unionist, gained control of the Oilfields Workers' Trade Union, while Krishna Gowandan challenged Bhadase Maraj's leadership of the All Trinidad Sugar Estates and Factory Workers Union. In March 1965 15,000 sugar workers went on strike. Williams responded by declaring a State of Emergency and suspending civil rights. This brought the Afro-Trinidadian-dominated Trade Union Congress into alliance with the (Indo-Trinidadian) sugar workers. In response to labour unrest in 1965, the PNM government introduced the Industrial Stabilisation Act (ISA), which banned strike action in the public service and restricted the use of strikes and lock-outs in private industry. In the spirit of democratic socialism Stephen Maharaj instructed his MPs to vote against the bill. However, two Members of the House (Ashford Sinanan and Lionel Seukeran), and all four Senators voted in favour of the bill. This led to a split in the party, with three separate wings vying for power. The centrist wing was led by Vernon Jamadar, the radical wing by Stephen Maharaj and the conservative wing by Lionel Seukaran and Ashford Sinanan. Maharaj, as Leader of the Opposition, attempted to remove the DLP Senators and replace them with leftists C.L.R. James, George Weekes (both Afro-Trinidadians), Adrian Cola Rienzi (an Indo-Trinidadian and former ally of T.U.B. Butler in the Labour riots of 1937), and Jack Kelshall (a white Trinidadian socialist and former advisor to Cheddi Jagan). As Leader of the Opposition, Maharaj had the ability to appoint and dismiss Opposition Senators. In June, in response to the failure of the DLP Senators to oppose the ISA, Maharaj wrote the Governor General Sir Solomon Hochoy and asked him to revoke the appointment of the Senators and replace them with James, Rienzi and Clive Phil. Instead, based on the advice of the conservative wing of the party (which had the support of four MPs), Hochoy revoked Maharaj's appointment and replaced him with Simbhoonath Capildeo (Rudranath Capildeo's older brother). Throughout all this Rudranath Capildeo remained party leader. He had selected Maharaj to be Leader of the Opposition and had opposed the ISA. However, rather than take a side in the dispute he remained vague, until he returned from England in July. Upon arrival he denounced Simbhoonath Capildeo as the main troublemaker in the party, and accused him of hiring a hit man to kill him. He met with Maharaj, James, Kelshall and Rienzi and promised to mobilise the DLP to oppose the ISA. The following day he denounced James, Maharaj and Rienzi of plotting against the interest of the party. He dismissed his brother as Leader of the Opposition and replaced him with Jamadar. In response to these actions, the DLP split again. Stephen Maharaj formed the Workers and Farmers Party (together with Weekes, James and a young Basdeo Panday), Simbhoonath Capildeo resigned from the DLP and joined the Liberal Party and Lionel Seukaran became an Independent. This left the DLP and the Liberals each holding four seats, the WFP holding one, and Seukaran holding the other as an Independent. Seukeran formed the Seukeran Independent Party (SIP) as a means of organizing his supporters. The 1966 General Elections allowed the DLP to return to its position as the sole opposition party. The DLP won 12 of 36 seats. The WFP, SIP and the Liberal Party failed to win any seats. Rudranath Capildeo's continued absences led to his seat being declared vacant in 1967. When the DLP chose to boycott the by-election in protest, Bhadase Sagan Maraj was able to return to Parliament by winning the seat as an Independent. \\"No-vote campaign\\" In 1969, Vernon Jamadar was able to capture the party leadership from Capildeo. Following the Black Power riots and army mutiny in 1970, the DLP allied itself with former PNM Deputy Leader, A.N.R. Robinson, and his new movement, the Action Committee of Democratic Citizens (ACDC). When Williams called elections 6 months early, Robinson declared that he would not contest the election and called upon supporters to boycott the election. Despite reservations, the DLP ended up supporting Robinson in his \\"no vote\\" campaign. Hoping to capitalize on the DLP's absence Bhadase Sagan Maraj formed the Democratic Liberation Party. Among the candidates fielded were Stephen Maharaj, Lional Seukeran and Satnarayan Maharaj. Nevertheless, this party failed to make headway against the DLP's \\"No-Vote\\" campaign and won no seats. Thanks to the boycott, the PNM won all seats in the 1971 General Elections. Many in the party felt betrayed by Robinson's actions, but the boycott resulted in a switch from voting machines to paper ballots. Demise of the party Alloy Lequay ousted Jamadar as party leader in 1972. This led to Vernon Jamadar breaking off and forming the Social Democratic Labour Party. The rump DLP then merged with the remnants of the Liberal Party and renamed itself the United Democratic Labour Party, now led by Simbhoonath Capildeo. Another faction led by Ashford Sinanan emerged and called itself the West Indian National Party (WINP). None of the successor parties won any seats in the 1976 General Elections. The new United Labour Front led by Basdeo Panday was able to totally displace the DLP from its core Indo-Trinidadian constituency. Jamadar and Lequay both contested the Siparia constituency (among eight candidates), but were soundly beaten by the ULF's Raffique Shah. That spelt the end of their political careers. Basdeo Panday later led the people who supported the party into the National Alliance for Reconstruction (which brought Indo-Trinidadians into power as part of a multi-racial coalition), then he finally led them into power as the dominant faction in the United National Congress government between 1995 and 2001, which won poewr again in 2010-2015 under Kamla Persad-Bissessar. None of the principles of the DLP played a significant role in party politics after the demise of the party. Simboonath Capildeo and Vernon Jamadar returned to their respective legal practices. Satnarayan Maharaj took over control of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha after the death of his father-in-law, Bhadase Sagan Maraj in 1971. Alloy Lequay went on to play a distinguished role as President and CEO of the Trinidad & Tobago Cricket Board, from which he retired in 2005. Political impact The DLP originated from the merger of the People's Democratic Party (PDP), the Trinidad Labour Party (TLP) and the Party of Political Progress Groups (POPPG). The PDP was a conservative party of the Indo-Trinidadian middle and upper-middle class with a primarily Brahmin Hindu leadership. The POPPG was a party of the white and near-white middle and upper-middle class, a small but economically powerful group. The Trinidad Labour Party was a working-class party, but had seen its support decline from 12% of the electorate in 1946 to 5% in 1956. Both the PDP and the POPPG had achieved electoral support by appealing to the Indo-Trinidadian and Afro- Trinidadian working classes, but the rise of the PNM split the Afro- Trinidadians away from the POPPG. By appealing to Sanatanist Hindus on religious and racial grounds, the DLP was able to entrench itself among Hindu Trinidadians, but the race-based appeal of the 1961 election campaign alienated the non-Indian middle class elements. Rudranath Capildeo's adoption of Democratic Socialism was an attempt to create a stronger link with the party's base, but it widened the rift with the middle class. By the early 1970s the party leadership was almost entirely Brahmin Hindu or Presbyterian Indian. The DLP never held political power, limiting its impact on the overall direction of Trinidad and Tobago. In addition, unlike the PNM, which had a strong central leadership (in the person of Eric Williams), the DLP lacked a united leadership. The loss of the Gomes faction in 1960 and Farquahar, Forrester and Hosein in 1964 resulted in the loss of a section of the population which would remain unrepresented politically until the formation of the Organisation for National Reconstruction in 1981. Eric Williams had managed to attract much of the Muslim and Presbyterian portions of the Indo- Trinidadian population to the PNM. Even though these groups later drifted away from the PNM, Muslims remained an important constituency within the PNM until 1986. Faced with the opportunity to expand the party through alliance with labour leaders, Rudranath Capildeo chose to steer the party away from this block. Rather than share power within the party with Afro-Trinidadians, Capildeo chose to remain permanently in Opposition. As the PNM moved away from racially threatening rhetoric, the DLP leadership was able to build a relationship with them. Many within the party accused the leadership of selling out the rank and file in exchange for political favours, but the purge of 1965 ensured that no-one remained in the party with enough personal support to be able to challenge the leadership. The labour unrest of the 1960s and the Black Power movement of the early 1970s created other blocks of opposition to the PNM, but the DLP leadership was not able to attract these groups to their orbit. Instead, the opposition remained fragmented and disunited until the rise of the National Alliance for Reconstruction in 1986.

However, the building later won plaudits for its modern design. Designed by John Gibb Morton, it is considered an example of the Perpendicular Gothic style.Heritage Trust A memorial organ was unveiled on Christmas 1946, in memory of the parishioners who gave their lives in World War II. As with Ottawa's other old churches, declining church attendance had caused problems for the church. For several years it served as home to Ottawa's Hungarian Catholic community, though they left in 1997. Church attendance began to increase dramatically when Ottawa Archbishop Marcel Gervais appointed the popular priest Fr. Joseph (Joe) LeClair as pastor. Fr Galen Bank was installed as pastor at Blessed Sacrament in July 2013. Father Galen, along with Associate Pastor Fr Francis Donnelly, have followed in the footsteps of Blessed Sacrament's founder Fr O'Gorman by reaching out to and working with the parish community. The church's parish retains its original form. It covers the area north and west of the Rideau Canal, south of the Queensway and east of Booth Street.

Released on May 13, 2003, Out of the Vein is the band's first album with guitarist Tony Fredianelli, who replaced longtime guitarist Kevin Cadogan in 2000. It would also be Third Eye Blind's final album with Elektra Records as well as their final album with bassist Arion Salazar. Out of the Vein was recorded at the group's own Mourning Wood Studios in downtown San Francisco and at Skywalker Sound.

Yahoo! News. May 9, 2003. According to Jenkins, some of the reasons for the delay stemmed from a self-imposed pressure to live up to Third Eye Blind's previous successes, leading him to rewrite lyrics. By the time the album was released, Elektra Records was in the midst of being absorbed into Atlantic Records, and Jenkins contends the group was not a priority: \\"Our record company ceased to exist the month the record was released,\\" \\"Elektra Records imploded.

Life He was born at Montagnac in Gascony. He received a military education and went to Paris in 1748 to study mathematics. He led a dissipated life and endeavoured to curry favor with the marquise de Pompadour by secretly sending her a box of poison and then informing her of the supposed plot against her life, hoping that he could earn a reward of cash for warning her. The ruse was discovered, and Mme de Pompadour, not appreciating the humor of the situation, had Latude put in the Bastille on 1 May 1749. He was later transferred to Vincennes, from which he escaped in 1750. Captured and reimprisoned in the Bastille, he made a second brief escape in 1756. He was again transferred to Vincennes in 1764, and the next year made a third escape and was a third time recaptured. He was put in a madhouse by Malesherbes in 1775, and discharged in 1777 on condition that he should retire to his native town. Cover of M√©moires authentiques de Latude He remained in Paris, however, and he was again imprisoned. A certain Madame Legros became interested in him through a chance reading of one of his memoirs, and, through vigorous agitation in his behalf, secured his release in 1784. His considerable ability for mimicry and intrigue were evidenced throughout his long captivity; he posed as a brave military officer, a son of the non-existent marquis de La Tude, and as a victim of Pompadour's nefarious intrigues. He was lauded and pensioned during the Revolution, and, in 1793, the Convention compelled the heirs of Madame de Pompadour to pay him 60,000 francs in damages. He died famous and wealthy in Paris in 1805.  Work  The principal work of Latude is the account of his imprisonment, written in collaboration with Jean-Yrieix de Beaupoil de Saint-Aulaire entitled Le Despotisme d√©voil√©, ou M√©moires de Henri Masers de la Tude, d√©tenu pendant trente-cinq ans dans les diverses prisons d'√©tat (Ostensibly Amsterdam, but actually published in Paris, 1787). An English translation of a portion of this work (Despotism Unveiled: or the Memoirs of Latude, Detained for Thirty-five Years in the Various Prisons of the State) was published in 1787. Latude himself denied both the authorship and the accuracy of the pamphlet, but it enjoyed a considerable popularity at the time of the French Revolution. Latude also wrote essays on a wide variety of subjects. * Britannica references * Claude Quetel, Escape from the Bastille: The Life and Legend of Latude (Palgrave Macmillan, 1990) * J. F.

He is best known as the drummer of the UK rock and roll group The Shadows. He is father of musician and Shadows band member Warren Bennett. Biography Educated at Hazlewood Lane School, Palmers Green, London and Winchmore Council School, he finished school at the age of sixteen to play drums in a Ramsgate skiffle group performing for holiday makers. After returning to London he became the in-house drummer at The 2i's Coffee Bar in Soho and was a regular performer on Jack Good's TV show Oh Boy! He then became a member of Marty Wilde's Wildcats in 1959. After a successful period with the Wildcats, during which he appeared on their instrumental record without Wilde (recorded as the Krew Kats), \\"Trambone\\", he backed Tommy Steele for some of his London stage performances, and then in October 1961 he joined Cliff Richard and the Shadows as the replacement for Tony Meehan. In 1967, Bennett released a solo album of jazz music, entitled Change of Direction, in mono and stereo (neither charted). This was the first solo album by a member of the Shadows. In the 1970s, music by Bennett was selected for several Radley Metzger films, including Barbara Broadcast and The Opening of Misty Beethoven. He stayed with the group throughout all of their subsequent line-ups, and in May 2005 took part in the Shadows' European tour. During a show in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland he sustained what was thought to be a minor injury to a finger. A splinter from a drumstick pierced under his fingernail on his right hand, he removed it with a pair of old pliers and applied a plaster. A few days later after arriving in Paris, France he was in so much pain he called a doctor. The doctor diagnosed a bad infection and recommended Bennett go to hospital immediately. Thinking it would be a short visit he attended only to find out that it would involve a minor, but very painful, operation to remove the poison. He was due to be playing on stage that evening and had already missed the soundcheck. He arrived at the theatre 15 minutes before the show with his right-hand bandaged and still numb from the anaesthetic. He managed to play for the whole show using an altered playing style. In addition to his work with the Shadows he has also appeared in Cliff Richard's backing band and plays piano and occasionally vibraphone. He has composed many popular TV theme tunes including BBC sports themes such as Rugby Special (\\"Holy Mackerel\\") and BBC Golf (\\"Chase Side Shoot Up\\"), Channel 9 Australia's cricket theme (\\"New Horizons\\"), the sitcoms Robin's Nest and Birds of a Feather, The Ruth Rendell Mysteries, Pulaski, Square Deal, Close to Home, Murder in Mind and, with his son Warren, composed and played the incidental music in New Tricks. Two of his most famous works were \\"The Journey\\" and \\"Just a Minute\\" written under the alias James Aldenham and used for the ITV Schools on 4 broadcasts between 1987‚Äì1993. He scored the British-German film The Harpist in 1999. He is also an orchestral conductor, having learned how to arrange and conduct music for orchestras from a correspondence course. His son Warren Bennett formerly played keyboards for the band Glass Ties, and is also a composer and producer. Honours  He was appointed OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in the 2004 Queen's Birthday Honours List for services to music. Bennett runs a home recording studio, Honeyhill studios, in Radlett, Hertfordshire. In November 2009, at the age of 69, Bennett completed a 50th Anniversary reunion world tour with Cliff Richard and the Shadows.

He was known for his extraordinary goal-scoring feats, in addition to earning three Olympic gold medals, in 1928, 1932 and 1936, during an era where India dominated field hockey. His influence extended beyond these victories, as India won the field hockey event in seven out of eight Olympics from 1928 to 1964. Known as The Wizard or The Magician of hockey for his superb ball control, Chand played internationally from 1926 to 1949; he scored 570 goals in 185 matches according to his autobiography, Goal.Chand, p. 255 The Government of India awarded Chand India's third highest civilian honour of Padma Bhushan in 1956. His birthday, 29 August, is celebrated as National Sports Day in India every year.  Early life  Dhyan Chand was born in Allahabad on 29 August 1905 in a Rajput family. He was the elder brother of another hockey player Roop Singh, and the son of Sharadha Singh and Sameshwar Singh. Dhyan Chand's father was enlisted in the British Indian Army, and he played hockey for the army. Dhyan Chand had two brothers ‚Äì Mool Singh and Roop Singh. Because of his father's numerous army transfers, the family had to move to different cities and as such Chand had to terminate his education after only six years of schooling. The family finally settled in Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, India. Chand graduated from Victoria College, Gwalior in 1932. Being in the military, his father got a small piece of land for a house. Young Chand had no serious inclination towards sports though he loved wrestling. He stated that he did not remember whether he played any hockey worth mentioning before he joined the Army, though he said that he occasionally indulged in casual games in Jhansi with his friends. The Hindi word Chand literally means the moon. Since Dhyan Singh used to practice a lot during the night after his duty hours, he used to wait for the moon to come out so that the visibility in the field (during his era there were no flood lights) improved. He was hence called \\"Chand\\", by his fellow players, as his practice sessions at night invariably coincided with the coming out of the moon.  Early career  On 29 August 1922 - his 17th birthday - Chand enlisted in the 1st Brahmans of the British Indian Army as a sepoy (private). A reorganisation of the army that year resulted in the 1st Brahmans becoming the 1/1st Punjab Regiment. Between 1922 and 1926, Chand exclusively played army hockey tournaments and regimental games. Chand was ultimately selected for the Indian Army team which was to tour New Zealand. The team won 18 matches, drew 2 and lost only 1, receiving praise from all spectators. Following this, in the two Test matches against the New Zealand squad, the team won the first and narrowly lost the second. Returning to India, Chand was promoted to Lance Naik in 1927. After successfully lobbying for reintroducing field hockey in the Olympics, the newly formed Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) made preparations to send its best possible team for the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics. In 1925, an Inter-Provincial Tournament was held to select the team members. Five teams participated in the inaugural nationals ‚Äì United Provinces (UP), Punjab, Bengal, Rajputana and Central Provinces. Chand got permission from the Army to play for the United Provinces team. In its first game in the tournament, Dhyan Chand as the centre-forward, and Marthins, their inside-right, performed very well together. Chand attracted much attention by his clever stick-work. His penetrating runs and judicious passes seemed to assure for him a position in the team that is to take part in the Olympic Games. Early in the game, it became evident that Chand was at his best. In combination with Marthins he took the ball away to the right and Marthins did well to give him a good pass. Quick as lightning, Dhyan Chand shot a goal. The ball struck one of the defenders' stick and went into the net, giving goalkeeper Collie no chance. A goal within 3 minutes of the start was more than what the most optimistic of the UP supporters could expect. At the interval, UP led by three goals to nil. On their part, Rajputana put every ounce of their efforts to score. The UP goal had more than one narrow escape, but were the winners of a fine exhibition match (3‚Äì1). Buoyed by the success of the Tournament, it was decided that it would be held every two years. After two more trial matches between various hopefuls, the Olympic team (including Chand as center-forward) was announced and assembled in Bombay. Center-half Broome Eric Pinniger was selected as the captain. The IHF was initially low on funds since the provinces of Bombay, Madras and Burma had turned a deaf ear to their financial appeal, but they managed to scrape enough money. The Olympic team then played a match against the Bombay XI, and amazingly lost 3‚Äì2, even though Singh scored both his team's goals. With a quiet send-off, the team left for England on 10 March, to play 11 matches against local sides as well in the London Folkestone Festival in 1927, winning all. It was also said that Great Britain did not send a team in 1928 to the Amsterdam Olympics after their national team was defeated by the Indian team at Folkestone. This is best cited in Kapur's book Romance of Hockey where a despatch of H. Sutherland Stark, London representative of \\"Sports\\", a magazine of Lahore, tells the story better than any other comment : \\"For reasons it is difficult to understand the English Hockey Association have taken up a very stiff attitude towards Indian Hockey in recent years and have repeatedly been twitted about it by even their own supporters. The Editor of a leading sports newspaper described them to me as an intensely conservative body, but there seems to be something more than conservative behind their unwillingness apparently ever to meet India in a full international encounter\\". Finally, on 24 April, the team arrived in Amsterdam to embark on a tour of the Low Countries. In all the pre-Olympic matches against local Dutch, German and Belgian teams, the Indian team won by large margins. In the 1928 Amsterdam Summer Olympics, the Indian team was put in the division A table, with Austria, Belgium, Denmark and Switzerland . On 17 May the Indian national hockey team made its Olympic debut against Austria, winning 6‚Äì0, with Chand scoring 3 goals. The next day India defeated Belgium 9‚Äì0; however Chand only scored once. On 20 May, Denmark lost to India 5‚Äì0, with Chand netting 3. Two days later, he scored 4 goals when India defeated Switzerland 6‚Äì0. The final match took place on 26 May, with India facing the home team of the Netherlands. The Indian team's better players Feroze Khan, Ali Shaukat and Kher Singh were on the sick list and Chand himself was ill. However, even with a skeletal side, India managed to defeat the hosts 3‚Äì0 (with Singh scoring 2), and the Indian team won its country's first Olympic gold medal. Chand was the top scorer of the tournament, with 14 goals in 5 matches. A newspaper report about India's triumph said,National Sports Day 2017: Remembering 'The Wizard' Major Dhyan Chand on his birthday. Daily Hunt, India (29 August 2017). Retrieved on 12 December 2018. On returning to India, the team was received by thousands of people at the Bombay harbour, compared to the three people who had seen them off. Posted in Waziristan in the North- West Frontier Province (now in Pakistan) with his new 2/14 Punjab Regiment, Chand, by now a naik (corporal) was cut off from the IHF, which was by now controlled by civilians. The Inter-Provincial Tournament was being held to select the new Olympic team; the IHF wrote to the Army Sports Control Board to grant Singh leaves to participate in the nationals. His platoon refused. Chand received news that he had been selected by the IHF for the Olympic team without any formalities. The rest of his teammates however, had to prove their skills in the Inter-Provincial Tournament, which was won by Punjab. As such, seven players from Punjab were selected for the Olympic team. Apart from Chand, Broome Eric Pinnigar, Leslie Hammond and Richard Allen were the other 1928 Olympians retained in the team. Chand's brother Roop Singh was also included in the squad as a left-in. Lal Shah Bokhari was selected as captain. The Olympic team then played practice matches in India before heading for Colombo. In two matches in Ceylon, the Olympic team beat the All Ceylon XI 20‚Äì0 and 10‚Äì0. Wrote one newspaper on the first match,Dhyan Chand Captain of the Indian Olympic Field hockey Team 1936. HockeyGods. Retrieved on 12 December 2018. \\"Perfection is perilous, for it tempts the gods. For once, this was proved wrong for even the god of weather paid tribute to the genius of the Indian players. Rain clouds, which had threatened to ruin the game, vanished into the blue, and thousands of spectators spent a happy hour marveling at the incomparable artistry of the Indian team.\\" The India team set sail for San Francisco on 30 May, and arrived on 6 July. They reached Los Angeles three weeks before the opening ceremony of the Olympics, which took place on 30 July. On 4 August 1932, India played its first match against Japan and won 11‚Äì1. Chand, Roop Singh, Gurmit Singh each scored thrice, and Dickie Carr once. In the final on 11 August, India played against hosts USA. India won 24‚Äì1, a world record at that time (until it was broken in 2003), and once again clinched the gold medal. Chand scored 8 times, Roop Singh 10, Gurmit Singh 5 and Pinniger once. In fact, Chand along with his brother Roop, scored 25 out of the 35 goals scored by India. This led to them being dubbed the 'hockey twins'. One Los Angeles newspaper wrote,Typhoon from the East. Bharatiyahockey.org. \\"The All-India field hockey team which G. D. Sondhi brought to Los Angeles to defend their 1928 Olympic title, was like a typhoon out of the east. They trampled under their feet and all but shoved out of the Olympic stadium the eleven players representing the United States.\\" The team then embarked on a tour of the United States. They played a match on 20 August against a United States XI, almost the same team that they had faced in Los Angeles. Even after loaning its second keeper Arthur Hind, for a half, the team won 24‚Äì1. After setting sail from New York, the team arrived at England. The then embarked on a hectic tour, playing nine matches in various countries in a fortnight, commencing on 2 September. They played four internationals- against the Netherlands, Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. The team then reached Sri Lanka and India, playing a number of matches to pay for their expenses. At the end of the tour, India had played 37 matches, winning 34, drawing 2, with one abandoned. Chand scored 133 of the 338 Indian goals. In India he is often referred to as Hockey ka Jaadugar which translates to \\"Magician of the game of Hockey\\". Captaincy and 1936 Berlin Summer Olympics Indian hockey captain Dhyan Chand at 1936 Berlin Olympics In 1933, Chand's home team, the Jhansi Heroes, he participated in and won the Beighton Cup, which he considered the most prestigious of Indian hockey tournaments. Later, he would state,Major Dhyan Chand. Slideshare.net. Retrieved on 12 December 2018. Dhyan Chand with the ball vs. France in the 1936 Olympic semi- finals In Kolkata, the Heroes also won the Lakshmibilas Cup tournament, which was open only to Indian teams. In 1935, they successfully defended their Beighton Cup title, though lost the subsequent year. In December 1934, the IHF decided to send a team to New Zealand in the new year. Chand and his brother were immediately selected. When the Nawab of Manavadar declined to play, Chand was appointed captain. In the subsequent tour, the team played a total of 48 matches on this tour, with 28 in New Zealand and the remainder in India, Ceylon and Australia. India won every match, scoring 584 goals and conceding only 40. Of these 48 matches, Chand played 23 and scored a total of 201 goals. Upon returning to India, Chand resumed his duties in the barracks. In December 1935, the IHF decided to stage the Inter-Provincial tournament to select the Olympic team. Chand was again denied permission to leave his platoon, though once again he was selected without formalities. The final team assembled in Delhi on 16 June and played against the Delhi Hockey XI. Incredibly, they lost 4‚Äì1. After this inauspicious start, the team went on a successful tour of the subcontinent, finally departing for Marseilles on 27 June. They arrived on 10 July, and after an uncomfortable journey in third-class compartments, reached Berlin on 13 July. On 17 July, the Indian team played a practice match against Germany and lost 4‚Äì1. As such, manager Pankaj Gupta informed the IHF that Ali Dara had to be sent immediately to replace the out of form Mirza Masood. On 5 August, India won its first match against Hungary 4‚Äì0. India won the rest of the group matches against USA (7‚Äì0, with Chand scoring 2 goals) and Japan (9‚Äì0, with Chand scoring 4). On 10 August, Ali Dara arrived. Their fourth match was the semi-final against France, whom they defeated 10‚Äì0, with Chand scoring 4 goals. Meanwhile, Germany had beaten Denmark 6‚Äì0, beaten Afghanistan 4‚Äì1 and in the play-offs, had defeated the Netherlands 3‚Äì0. Thus, India and Germany were to clash in the 1936 Berlin Olympics field hockey final on 19 August. Dhyan Chand scoring a goal against Germany in the 1936 Olympics hockey final On the morning of the final, the entire team was nervous since they had been defeated the last time they had faced Germany. In the locker room, Pankaj Gupta produced a Congress tricolour. Reverently the team saluted it, prayed and marched onto the field. The German team was successful in restricting the India side to a single goal until the first interval. After the interval, the Indian team launched an all-out attack, easily defeating Germany 8‚Äì1, incidentally the only goal scored against India in that Olympic tournament. Newspaper reports for the match stated that Dhyan Chand scored four goals, while he claimed he scored three, in his autobiography Goal, with Ali Dara scoring two, and Roop Singh, Carlyle Tapsell and Sayed Jaffar with one goal each. Describing the game, the Special Correspondent of The Hindu wrote, There have been many erroneous media reports over the years claiming that Dhyan Chand scored 6 goals in India's 8‚Äì1 victory over Germany in the 1936 Olympic final. In his autobiography Goal! Chand wrote: ‚ÄúWhen Germany was four goals down, a ball hit Allen's pad and rebounded. The Germans took full advantage of this and made a rush, netting the ball before we could stop it. That was the only goal Germany would score in the match against our eight, and incidentally the only goal scored against India in the entire Olympic tournament. India's goal-getters were Roop Singh, Tapsell and Jaffar with one each, Dara two and myself three.‚Äù The International Hockey Federation records also attribute only three of the eight goals to Chand in the final. The final was included in the Leni Riefenstahl film on the 1936 Olympics, Olympia. Overall, in three Olympic tournaments, Chand had scored 33 goals in 12 matches. It is reported that the German Leader Adolf Hitler was so impressed with Chand's skills that he offered him German citizenship and a position of Colonel in the German Army, which Dhyan Chand refused. East African tour and final tournaments After returning from Berlin, Chand joined his regiment. Between 1936 and the commencement of the War in 1939, he largely confined himself to army hockey, with one visit to Kolkata to take part in the Beighton Cup tournament in 1937. Before the beighton Cup, Chand spent four months in a military camp in Pachmarhi to attend military classes. On 16 March 1938, he was made a Viceroy's Commissioned Officer (VCO; the equivalent of the present-day junior commissioned officer) with the rank of jemadar (now termed naib subedar). With the increasing need for qualified officers during wartime, he was promoted to acting subedar by July 1942 and to the war-substantive rank by early 1943. On 9 April 1943, Chand received an emergency commission as a second lieutenant in the 14th Punjab Regiment, with the war-substantive rank of lieutenant from the same date. Towards the closing phases of the war, Chand led an army hockey team which toured around the battlefields in Manipur, Burma, the Far East and Ceylon. When the war ended in 1945, Chand decided that the Indian hockey team needed new young players. In 1947, the IHF was requested by the Asian Sports Association (ASA) of East Africa to send a team to play a series of matches. The ASA made a condition that Chand should be included in the team. Once again, Chand was chosen as captain. The team assembled in Bombay on 23 November 1947, and reached Mombasa on 15 December and played 9 matches in British East Africa winning all. Chand, though now in his forties, still managed to score 61 goals in 22 matches. After returning from the East African tour in early 1948, Chand decided to gradually phase out his involvement in 'serious hockey'. He played exhibition matches, leading a Rest of India side against state teams and the 1948 Olympic team which defeated Chand's side 2‚Äì1, even though an aging Chand scored his side's lone goal. Chand's last match was leading the Rest of India team against the Bengal side. The match ended in a draw after which the Bengal Hockey Association organized a public function to honor Chand's services to Indian hockey. Final years Chand continued to hold his emergency commission in the Indian Army post-Independence, with the service number IEC 3526, but was apparently not granted a regular commission. In 1951 he was honored at India's National Stadium with the inaugural Dhyan Chand Tournament, which he attended to the admiration of the spectators. After 34 years of service, Chand retired from the Indian Army on 29 August 1956 as a lieutenant (acting captain). The Government of India honoured him the same year by conferring him the Padma Bhushan, India's third highest civilian honour. After retirement, he taught at coaching camps at Mount Abu, Rajasthan. Later, he accepted the position of Chief Hockey Coach at the National Institute of Sports, Patiala, a post he held for several years. Chand spent his last days in his hometown of Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, India. Chand died on 3 December 1979 from liver cancer at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi. He was cremated at the Jhansi Heroes ground in his hometown, after some initial problems in getting clearance. His regiment, the Punjab Regiment, accorded him full military honours. Legacy Dhyan Chand on a 1980 stamp of India Dhyan Chand statue at Sipri hill, Jhansi Dhyan Chand remains a legendary figure in Indian and world hockey. His skills have been glorified in various apocryphal stories and anecdotes. A number of such these revolve around the fact that Singh had an extraordinary control over dribbling the ball. Chand's birthday, 29 August, is celebrated as National Sports Day in India. The President gives away sport-related awards such as the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna, Arjuna Award and Dronacharya Award on this day at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, India. The 20th National Award 2012, the Gem of India, awarded by the Union Minister of India, was given to Dhyan Chand. The award was received by Dhyan Chand‚Äôs son, Ashok Dhyan Chand (a hockey Olympian in his own right) on behalf of his deceased father. The award was given by Journalist Association of India under the flagship of Journalists Federation of India, Sirifort Auditorium, New Delhi, India, on 22 September 2012. India's highest award for lifetime achievement in sports is the Dhyan Chand Award which has been awarded annually from 2002 to sporting figures who not only contribute through their performance but also contribute to the sport after their retirement. The National Stadium, Delhi was renamed Dhyan Chand National Stadium in 2002 in his honour. A hostel at Aligarh Muslim University, of which he was an alumnus, has been named after him. He scored over 400 goals in his career, from 1926 to 1948. An Astroturf hockey pitch, at the Indian Gymkhana Club in London, has been named after Indian hockey legend Dhyan Chand. Government of India has issued a commemorative postage stamp and a First Day Cover in honour of Dhyan Chand. He remains the only Indian hockey player to have a stamp in his honour. Dhyan Chand was among the nominees considered for India's highest civilian award, Bharat Ratna, for 2014 and there was support for it. The award was then given to Sachin Tendulkar and C. N. R. Rao. The family members of Dhyan Chand were disappointed with government decision. The RTI was filed which suggested that the Prime Minister's Office had ignored the recommendation from sports ministry on giving the award over Sachin Tendulkar.

He served as Prime Minister between 1 and 16 November 1918 and as President between 16 November 1918 and 21 March 1919. Early life and career Mih√°ly K√°rolyi in Franzensbad around 1887. Early life The K√°rolyi family were an illustrious, extremely wealthy, Roman Catholic aristocratic family who had played an important role in Hungarian life since the 17th century. Mih√°ly K√°rolyi was born on March 4, 1875, in the K√°rolyi Palace in the aristocratic palace district of Pest. K√°rolyi, born of a cousin's marriage, thus born with a severe malformation: Cleft lip and cleft palate, and his illness deeply determined his entire childhood and personality development. Her mother died early in Tuberculosis and her father soon remarried. Mih√°ly was considered unsuitable for a more serious career by his father, because he was incapable of normal speech training. He was teased and humiliated during his childhood, despite the power and wealth of his family, which influenced his subsequent vanity, ambition and desire for power. Mih√°ly was raised with great devotion by his maternal grandmother. He was raised with overcare with his older sister in the Castle of his grandmother at F√≥t, because Count Julius K√°rolyi, the politician father had not enough time for Mih√°ly. At the age of 14, his grandmother sent him to a Viennese clinic and he underwent a special surgery to restore his palate and mouth. [7] The surgery proved to be a sharp turning point: After some weeks Mih√°ly started to speak quickly, fluently and very elaborately, despite the family and relatives formerly thought that he is too dumb to speak. By this time, he was a relatively superficial aristocrat, but his knowledge and awareness was lower in a comparison with other members of the higher aristocracy. His thinking and character were shaped by extracurricular influences: the hatred towards the Habsburg dynasty, the traditional anti-German sentiment of his family, his foster father, the world-view of S√°ndor K√°rolyi, his adoration of the 1848 revolution in Hungary, his idea of organizing peasants into farming cooperatives. Based on his reading experiences, including the French Encyclop√©die and Jules Verne novels, he developed an idealistic devotion to the cause of social justice, unbroken optimistic faith in the fast development of science and technology, which will solve all problems of humankind. He was not interested in university lectures, he managed to pass his exams with the help of a tutor. Nevertheless, he obtained his law degree and, at the age of 24, became a rampant adult. He wanted to make up for what he had missed as a teenager, throwing himself into the nightlife, with striking vehemence; he spent his time ruthlessly, playing cards, having fun in hunting, living in French spa towns, attended many international horse races and early automobile racings in various European countries. Francophone as was traditional in the family, he spent several years in Paris; he also traveled across the United Kingdom and the United States. Mih√°ly became a passionate collector of racecars and yachts. As a gambling addict, he was known for his card battles, his lone card losses and his \\"dandy\\" lifestyle in famous casinos across Western Europe. The young tycoon begins to get serious and turn to politics and public life.

In 1909, he became the President of the OMGE (National Agricultural Society), the main rural organization of the nobility. Initially a supporter of the existing political and social system in Hungary, K√°rolyi gradually became more progressive and left-wing during his career. In 1910, K√°rolyi was elected to Parliament as a member of the opposition Party of Independence. Istv√°n Tisza and Mih√°ly K√°rolyi became implacable political enemies since the 1905 elections. Their debates in the parliament further increased their personal mutual antagonism by time. In January 1913, he was challenged to a duel by prime minister Istv√°n Tisza, after refusing to shake Tisza's hand following a political disagreement. The 34-bout duel with cavalry sabres lasted an hour until Tisza cut K√°rolyi's arm and the seconds ended the duel.  World War I, political campaign for the Allied Powers  On August 5, when the war broke out, his ship has arrived to Le Havre, he has come back from his long trip from the United States. He was shortly arrested, as a citizen of an enemy country, despite Austria-Hungary was not at war with the French Republic yet, thus he was released from the prison. Later, he was arrested again for several weeks in Bordeaux for being a citizen of an enemy country. After K√°rolyi promised that he won't fight against the French during the war, the French authorities allowed him to return to Hungary via Switzerland. During the First World War, the pro-Entente K√°rolyi led a small but very active pacifist anti-war maverick fraction in the Hungarian parliament. K√°rolyi made contact with British and French Entente diplomats behind the scenes in Switzerland during the war. The K√°rolyi Party was always a weak group with no mass organization and only 20 members in Parliament, most of whom had little commitment to the party. K√°rolyi argued for peace with the Allies, looser ties between Austria and Hungary, abolishing the property-based franchise requirements that allowed only 5.8% of the population to vote and run for office before the war, and giving women the right to vote and hold office. In particular, K√°rolyi's demand in 1915 that veterans should be granted the right to vote won so much popular support that enraged the Prime Minister, Count Istv√°n Tisza. In 1916 K√°rolyi broke off with his party, which had found his openly pro-Entente attitude to be too radical and dangerous for a war-time pacifist fraction in the parliament. Therefore K√°rolyi formed a new party, called the United Party of Independence and of 1848, and generally known as the K√°rolyi Party. In January 1918, K√°rolyi proclaimed himself a follower of Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points.  Marriage and family  On 7 November 1914 in Budapest, K√°rolyi married Countess Katalin Andr√°ssy de Cs√≠kszentkir√°ly et Krasznahorka, with whom he had three children. K√°rolyi's wife was a member of one of Hungary's most powerful families, and this marriage won K√°rolyi the protection of his influential father-in-law. Leading the Democratic Republic President Mihaly Karolyi's speech after the proclamation of the First Hungarian Republic on 16 november, 1918 B√©la Linder's pacifist speech for military officers, and declaration of Hungarian self-disarmament on 2 November, 1918. Following the Aster Revolution of October 1918, K√°rolyi became leader of the nation. On 25 October 1918 K√°rolyi had formed an opposition National Council. His reputation as an opponent of the much-hated war had thrust him into a role for which he was not suited. King-Emperor Charles IV designated him as prime minister as a part of a desperate attempt to hold Hungary on to the Habsburgs. K√°rolyi would have preferred to keep the monarchy and some link to Austria if possible. Only after Charles's withdrawal from government on 16 November 1918 made K√°rolyi proclaim the Hungarian Democratic Republic, with himself as provisional president. On 11 January 1919 the National Council formally recognized him as president. The Hungarian Royal Honv√©d army still had more than 1,400,000 soldiers when Mih√°ly K√°rolyi was announced as prime minister of Hungary. K√°rolyi yielded to U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's demand for pacifism by ordering the disarmament of the Hungarian army. This happened under the direction of B√©la Linder, (minister of war) on 2 November, 1918.Dixon J. C. Defeat and Disarmament, Allied Diplomacy and Politics of Military Affairs in Austria, 1918‚Äì1922. Associated University Presses 1986. p. 34.Sharp A. The Versailles Settlement: Peacemaking after the First World War, 1919‚Äì1923. Palgrave Macmillan 2008. p. 156\\\\. . Due to the full disarmament of its army, Hungary was to remain without a national defence at a time of particular vulnerability. The Hungarian self-disarmament made the occupation of Hungary directly possible for the relatively small armies of Romania, the Franco- Serbian army and the armed forces of the newly established Czechoslovakia. During the rule of K√°rolyi's pacifist cabinet, Hungary lost control over approx. 75% of its former pre-WW1 territories (325 411 km¬≤) without armed resistance and was subject to foreign occupation. Military and political events changed rapidly and drastically after the Hungarian disarmament. On 5 November 1918, the Serbian army, with the help of the French army, crossed southern borders. On 8 November, the Czechoslovak Army crossed the northern borders, and on 13 November, the Romanian army crossed the eastern borders of the Kingdom of Hungary. On 13 November, K√°rolyi signed the Armistice of Belgrade with the Allied nations. It limited the size of the Hungarian army to six infantry and two cavalry divisions.Krizman B. The Belgrade Armistice of 13 November 1918 in The Slavonic and East European Review January 1970, 48:110. Demarcation lines defining the territory to remain under Hungarian control were made. The lines would apply until definitive borders could be established. Under the terms of the armistice, Serbian and French troops advanced from the south, taking control of the Banat and Croatia. Czechoslovakia took control of Upper Hungary and Carpathian Ruthenia. Romanian forces were permitted to advance to the River Maros (Mure»ô) . However, on 14 November, Serbia occupied P√©cs.Breit J. Hungarian Revolutionary Movements of 1918‚Äì19 and the History of the Red War in Main Events of the K√°rolyi Era Budapest 1929. pp. 115‚Äì116. Many citizens thought that K√°rolyi could negotiate soft peace terms with the Allies for Hungary. K√°rolyi headed the Provisional Government from 1 November 1918 until 16 November, when the Hungarian Democratic Republic was proclaimed. K√°rolyi ruled Hungary through a National Council, transformed into the government that consisted of his party in alliance with the large Hungarian Social Democratic Party and the small Civic Radical Party led by Oszk√°r J√°szi. At the same time, there existed various revolutionary councils, which were dominated by the Social Democrats, which were not unlike the Soviets (Councils) that existed in Russia in 1917. This situation of Dual Power gave K√°rolyi responsibility without much power while giving the Social Democrats power without much responsibility. Mih√°ly K√°rolyi in a speech During their brief periods in power, K√°rolyi and J√°szi, who served as Nationalities Minister, tried to create an \\"Eastern Switzerland\\" by persuading the non-Magyar peoples of Hungary to stay as part of the new Hungarian Democratic Republic. Additional trouble for the new government occurred over the question of the armistice. Austria-Hungary had signed the lenient Armistice of villa Giusti (close to Padua, Italy) with the Allies on 3 November 1918. Since Hungary was now independent, some in the Cabinet argued that Hungary needed to sign a new armistice. Against his better judgement, K√°rolyi agreed to this idea, and had Hungary sign in November 1918, a new armistice with the Allies in Belgrade with the Allied Commander in the Balkans, the French General Louis Franchet d'Esperey. General Franchet d'Esperey treated the Hungarians with open contempt and imposed a much harsher armistice on the defeated nation than the Padua Armistice had. This was the source of much criticism of K√°rolyi, who had been expected ‚Äì and who himself expected ‚Äì the Allies to treat Hungary as a friend, not an enemy. Moreover, K√°rolyi's opponents argued that by needlessly seeking a second armistice, K√°rolyi had worsened Hungary's situation. Furthermore, the Social Democrats who were Hungary's largest party by far, frequently undercut K√°rolyi and imposed their decisions on him without taking responsibility for their actions. K√°rolyi wished to transfer almost all of the rural lands to the peasants. To set an example, he gave all of his own vast family estates to his tenants. But this was the only land transfer that took place; the Social Democrats blocked any measures that might give the control of those lands to the peasantry on the grounds that it was promoting capitalism. K√°rolyi distributing his lands among the peasants in K√°polna on 23 february, 1919 In another equally unfortunate move, the pacific-minded K√°rolyi had abolished almost all the Hungarian armed forces in November 1918. All through the winter of 1918‚Äì19, the Romanians, the Yugoslavs and the Czechoslovaks often broke the armistice in order to seize more territory for themselves. After January 1919, K√°rolyi ordered the build-up of a Hungarian army and started to consider the idea of an alliance with Soviet Russia, through K√°rolyi was opposed to the idea of Communism in Hungary itself. In addition, as Hungary had signed an armistice, not a peace treaty, the Allied blockade continued until such time as a peace treaty was signed. Hungary had suffered from food shortages throughout the war and deaths from starvation had become common from 1917 onwards. Furthermore, the country had been overwhelmed with refugees from Transylvania and Galicia. Making things worse was the creation of Czechoslovakia which had cut Hungary off from supplies of German coal. Hungary which possessed little coal depended upon German coal imports. Without coal, most had to live without heat in the winter of 1918‚Äì19, and the railroad network had gradually ceased to function. The collapse of railroads in their turn caused the collapse of industry and hence mass unemployment. Making things even worse was the economic incompetence of the government which printed more and more money, leading to massive inflation and even more impoverishment. K√°rolyi's failure to improve living conditions or persuade the Allies to lift the blockade led to public criticism of K√°rolyi. Baron Lajos Hatvany described K√°rolyi's leadership well when he noted \\"From the discussions no decisions arose, and from the decisions ‚Äì no actions. A cabinet? No, it was a debating club\\".Vermes, Gabor \\"The October Revolution In Hungary\\" from Hungary in Revolution edited by Ivan Volgyes Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1971 page 49. In the same vein, the British writer Harold Nicolson, who had known K√°rolyi during his exile in Britain, when reviewing K√°rolyi's memoirs in 1957 noted that: \\"he had many qualities, but unfortunately lacked those for which a man is taken seriously by serious people\\".Menczer, Bela \\"Bela Kun and the Hungarian Revolution of 1919\\" pages 299‚Äì309 Volume XIX, Issue #5, May 1969, History Today Inc: London page 301. Sigmund Freud, the Austrian psychologist--who had known the two politicians personally--wrote about the assassination of Istv√°n Tisza and the appointment of Mih√°ly K√°rolyi as new prime minister of Hungary: On 20 March 1919 the French presented the Vix Note ordering Hungarian troops further back into Hungary; it was widely assumed that the military lines would be the new frontiers. K√°rolyi and Prime Minister D√©nes Berinkey were now in an untenable position. Although they did not want to accept this French demand, they were in no position to reject it either. On 21 March, Berinkey resigned. K√°rolyi then announced that only the Social Democrats could form a new government. Unknown to K√°rolyi, however, the Social Democrats had merged their party with the Communists led by B√©la Kun. Hours after Berinkey resigned, the newly merged Hungarian Socialist Party announced K√°rolyi's resignation and the formation of the Hungarian Soviet Republic. At that point, K√°rolyi accepted the fait accompli and retired from active politics.

A provisional government was set up by Count Julius Karolyi (brother of Michael), Count Istv√°n Bethlen, Admiral Horthy, and Archduke Joseph at Szeged (under French occupation).\\"Penfield Roberts, \\"Hungary\\", in William L. Langer (1948), ed., An Encyclopedia of History, Rev. Edition, Boston: Houghton Mifflin, p. 1014. In July 1919, K√°rolyi went into exile in France and during World War Two, in Britain. Throughout the Horthy era, K√°rolyi was in a state of official disgrace in his homeland. In 1924, while K√°rolyi's wife was in the United States she came down with typhoid fever. K√°rolyi applied for a visa to come to the United States to visit her, but the State Department imposed a gag order, preventing him from giving any political speeches, as the State Department believed him to be a Communist. A year later, Countess K√°rolyi was denied a visa to visit the United States, but Secretary Kellogg of the State Department refused to explain on what grounds her visa denial was made. THE CABINET: Law and Discretion, Time, Monday, Nov. 02, 1925 Morris Ernst acted as K√°rolyi's lawyer for these issues. In 1946, K√°rolyi, who by that time had become a socialist, returned to Hungary and from 1947‚Äì49 served as the Hungarian Ambassador to France. In 1949, he resigned in protest over the show trial and execution of L√°szl√≥ Rajk. He wrote two volumes of memoirs in exile; Egy eg√©sz vil√°g ellen (\\"Against the Entire World\\") in 1925 and Memoirs: Faith without Illusion in 1954. He died in Vence, France, on 19 March 1955 at the age of 80. Legacy K√°rolyi's statue where it stood on Lajos Kossuth Square, Budapest In 1975, a memorial to K√°rolyi, sculpted by Imre Varga, was installed in Budapest's Kossuth Lajos t√©r. In 2012, the government began renovation to the square to the way it looked before World War II, and K√°rolyi's statue was moved to Si√≥fok.Taking a stand on Kossuth square , Budapest Times At the same time, throughout Hungary, many cities changed the name of their own streets named after Mih√°ly K√°rolyi. In Budapest for example the name of the prominent street in downtown, was changed from \\"K√°rolyi Mih√°ly utca\\" to simply \\"K√°rolyi utca\\", removing the association with him.

Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 16 Feb. 2016. Man√° is considered one of the best-selling Latin music artists with over 25 million records sold worldwide. The group's current line-up consists of vocalist/guitarist Fher Olvera, drummer Alex Gonz√°lez, guitarist Sergio Vall√≠n and bassist Juan Calleros. Man√° has earned four Grammy Awards, eight Latin Grammy Awards, five MTV Video Music Awards Latin America, six Premios Juventud awards, nineteen Billboard Latin Music Awards and fifteen Premios Lo Nuestro awards.:es:Rock de Mexico Man√° has topped the all-time lists in much of Latin America and in their native Mexico, where they set landmarks in record sales and concert attendances. The band formed in 1986 and released its first album, Falta Amor, in 1990. In 1992, the group released ¬øD√≥nde Jugar√°n Los Ni√±os?, which sold more than 10 million copies worldwide, (over 700,000 copies in the US alone) becoming the best selling Spanish-language rock album of all time. After several lineup changes, the group released Cuando los √Ångeles Lloran (1995), which is noted for its stylistic departure from the band's previous work. Man√° followed with Sue√±os L√≠quidos (1997), Revoluci√≥n de Amor (2002), and Amar es Combatir (2006), which continued the group's success. The band followed up with Drama y Luz in April 2011. Their most recent album is Cama Incendiada, which was released in early 2015. The band's sound draws from pop rock, progressive rock, Latin pop, calypso, reggae and ska music genres. They initially received international commercial success in Latin America and Spain and have since gained popularity and exposure in the US and around the world. History=1986‚Äì89: Formation and early releases Fher, lead singer Man√° was formed in 1986 by Jos√© Fernando \\"Fher\\" Olvera (vocals), Ulises (guitars) and Juan Calleros (bass guitar), who had been performing together in a band called Sombrero Verde since the mid-1970s and disbanded in 1983. The three placed an advertisement in the local Guadalajara newspaper looking for a drummer to complete a new band, to which fifteen-year-old Alex Gonz√°lez applied and soon joined the group. Man√°'s first album was titled \\"Man√° released on May 12, 1987 on A& M Records. Man√° signed to PolyGram, but became unhappy with the direction the label was taking the band and switched to Warner Music shortly before the release of the group's 2nd album, Falta Amor. A year passed before the album garnered its first hit single, \\"Rayando el Sol\\". The group toured heavily in support of the album performing more than 250 times throughout Latin America, including shows in Mexico, Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia. 1990‚Äì96: Commercial success Rock in Rio Madrid 2012. In 1991, they added two new members to the group, Iv√°n Gonz√°lez on keyboards and C√©sar \\"Vampiro\\" L√≥pez on guitar. Ulises Calleros no longer performed with the group, but became one of their managers. On 27 October 1992, the band released ¬øD√≥nde Jugar√°n Los Ni√±os?, an album that spawned several hits (including \\"Vivir Sin Aire,\\" \\"Oye Mi Amor,\\" and \\"De Pies a Cabeza\\"). The record sold over 3 million copies worldwide and became the best selling Spanish-language rock album of all time. The band undertook an international tour with 268 concerts in 17 countries. In 1994, L√≥pez and Iv√°n Gonz√°lez left the group due to musical and personal disputes. Fher Olvera and Alex Gonz√°lez felt that their departure offered an opportunity to reinvent the group's sound, and searched throughout Mexico, Spain and Argentina to find a new guitarist. In the meantime, Man√° released the live album Man√° en Vivo before choosing Mexican guitarist Sergio Vall√≠n to replace Calleros and L√≥pez. In 1995, the band recorded a Spanish version of Led Zeppelin's \\"Fool in the Rain\\" for the tribute album Encomium. Lead singer Fher Olvera and Juan Calleros in the background performing at Rock in Rio Madrid 2012. On 25 April 1995, the group released Cuando los √Ångeles Lloran. The album was noted for its stylistic departure from the band's previous work, which saw the group experimenting with funk and soul music genres. Olvera explained shortly after the release of the album, \\"Basically, we're still the same Man√°, but we're going through a funky, soulish stage. We want to have some fun and be a little louder.\\" The initial reaction to Cuando los √Ångeles Lloran was mixed and the first single, the funk-influenced \\"D√©jame Entrar\\", failed to reach the top ten on the Mexican Singles Chart. However, the album later caught on and sold 500,000 copies in the United States alone within five months of release. 1997‚Äì2007: Sue√±os L√≠quidos, Revoluci√≥n de Amor, and Amar es Combatir In 1997, the group released Sue√±os L√≠quidos, an album about the highs and lows of love, with songs like \\"Clavado en un bar\\" and \\"En el Muelle de San Bl√°s,\\" recorded in Puerto Vallarta and released simultaneously in 36 countries. The recording received a Grammy Award as Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album. The group performed acoustically in Miami for Latin America's MTV Unplugged program. A final version of the performance was mixed at Conway Recording Studios in Hollywood, and the band released Man√° MTV Unplugged on 22 June 1999. In the summer of 1999, the band co-headlined an 18-city tour of the United States with Carlos Santana. Man√° also appeared on Santana's 1999 album Supernatural on the song \\"Coraz√≥n Espinado\\". In 2002, in an effort to blend their sound with that of rock and roll from the sixties and seventies, the band recorded Revoluci√≥n de Amor. They won their fourth Grammy for the album. The band released a new version of \\"Eres mi Religi√≥n\\" for the Italian market in 2003, as a duet with Italian musician Zucchero, and also performed with Zucchero in a new recording of his \\"Baila Morena\\". This same year they participated in the annual Pavarotti & Friends concert, along with Queen, Deep Purple, Ricky Martin, Andrea Bocelli, Zucchero and Bono. Fher Olvera in the background performing at Rock in Rio Madrid 2012. In 2006, after a four-year hiatus, they released their seventh studio album, Amar es Combatir. It reached #4 on the Billboard Top 200 in its first week, selling over 60,000 copies in the first week. Their first single off the album, \\"Labios Compartidos\\", rose to the top of the music charts upon its debut in July, when the group played the song live at the Premios Juventud. Amar es Combatir has sold over 644,000 copies, and the Amar es Combatir Tour in promotion of the album grossed more than $35 million. In 2008, Man√° released a live album entitled Arde El Cielo, in both a CD and CD/DVD package. This release shows the band performing during the Amar es Combatir Tour in support of Amar es Combatir. 2008‚Äì2012: Drama y Luz On 12 April 2011, the band released its eighth studio album, Drama y Luz. The record's release was delayed several times, initially scheduled for a Fall 2010 release, which was later changed to December 2010, and finally changed to April 2011. The band explained that Drama y Luz was not ready for fans and spent time during the delays putting the finishing touches on the record. Themes addressed on the album include love, hope, addiction, and racism. The first single from the album, \\"Lluvia al Coraz√≥n\\", became the band's sixth song to reach number one on the Billboard Latin Songs chart, as well as its eighth song to top the magazine's Latin Pop Songs chart.  2013‚Äìpresent: Cama Incendiada / Rayando el sol Tour  In 2016, Man√° was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2018, Mana received the Billboard Latin Music Lifetime Achievement Award and performed live on Telemundo from the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas. Mana was honored as the Latin Recording Academy Person of the Year on November 14, 2018. In 2019 , Mana announced on February 2019 their new tour \\"Rayando el sol tour\\" that will start in the USA on September 2019. On April 12th Man√° released a new version of their classic hit Rayando el sol featuring Spanish singer Pablo Albor√°n as the first song from their upcoming project. Selva Negra Foundation Selva Negra Foundation (\\"Black Jungle Foundation\\") is a foundation formed by Man√° in 1995. Under the direction of Mari Gonz√°lez and Augusto Benavides, they finance and support important projects aimed at protecting the environment. With the support of Mexico's government, they also have efforts to save the sea turtle by raising 140,000 turtle eggs for release on the country's Pacific coast. On April 7, 2008, Man√° and the Selva Negra Foundation were named \\"Champions of Health\\" by the Pan American Health Organization during an observance of World Health Day 2008 at PAHO headquarters in Washington, D.C. Politics Man√° in concert in Rock in Rio in Madrid in 2012. Man√° supported U.S. President Barack Obama's 2012 reelection bid. On 29 March 2007, Puerto Rico's Channel 4, WAPA's News program, reported that Man√° publicly supported Puerto Rico's prospective independence from the United States. In an interview that followed the aforementioned news announcement, the members of Man√° were interviewed by Channel 4 (WAPA) journalist, Rafael Len√≠n L√≥pez, who asked them what they thought about Puerto Rico. Man√° members confirmed that they support the Puerto Rican Independence Movement and favor greater sovereignty for the Latin American and Caribbean island-nation. Various of their songs have political inspirations. The liner notes for \\"Me Voy a Convertir en Un Ave,\\" on the album Sue√±os L√≠quidos, for example, notes that the song is \\"inspired by the book Pedro y el capit√°n by Mario Benedetti and dedicated to all those who, for defending an ideal of justice, are persecuted or find themselves imprisoned. To the Zapatista Army of National Liberation communities for peace and dignity.\\"Liner notes, Sue√±os L√≠quidos, 1997.

Newspaper records in 1888 uniformly spell it without the final \\"e\\", but in 1889 the modern spelling began to be used (perhaps because the post office was registered with that spelling on Dec 3, 1888).

The virus was released in the most recent version in early March 2002. It was written by the virus writer \\"Mental Driller\\". Some of his previous viruses, such as Win95/Drill (which used the TUAREG polymorphic engine), have proved very challenging to detect. When the virus is first executed, it checks the current date. If the host file (the file that is infected with the virus) imports the file User32.dll, then on the 17th of March, June, September, or December, a message is displayed. Depending on the version of the virus, the case of each letter in the text is altered randomly. On May 14 (the anniversary of Israeli independence day), a message saying \\"Free Palestine!\\" will be displayed if the system locale is set to Hebrew. The virus then rebuilds itself. This metamorphic process is very complex and accounts for around 90% of the virus' code. After the rebuild, the virus searches for executable files in folders on all fixed and remote drives. Files will not be infected if they are located in a subfolder more than three levels deep, or if the folder name begins with the letter W. For each file that is found, there is a 50 percent chance that it will be ignored.

About 400 undergraduate and graduate students are enrolled at the school which also includes a Pre-College Division for young musicians. History The San Francisco Conservatory of Music was founded in 1917 by Ada Clement and Lillian Hodghead as the Ada Clement Piano School. Its first location was the home of Lillian's parents, at 3435 Sacramento Street. The school opened with three pianos, four studios, two blackboards and 40 students. The Ada Clement Piano School quickly expanded. Several years after its founding, the name changed to the Ada Clement Music School, and then in 1923 to the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. In 1956 the Conservatory moved from Sacramento Street to 1201 Ortega Street, the home of a former infant shelter. It resided there for fifty years, before moving to its current location at 50 Oak Street in 2006.

Open pit quarries in the area extract marble, slate and andalusite, with prospects of large-scale nickel mining on the banks of the Groot Marico river as well as the majority of the farms surrounding the hamlet having sparked a successful regional petition against such development.

The town was formed by the Voortrekkers in the 1850s and was only proclaimed in 1948. The word \\"Marico\\" was made famous in South Africa by Herman Charles Bosman's writings of this area and later re-enactments of these tales by actor Patrick Mynhardt. Bosman described the area thus: At least part of Bosman's musings may have been inspired by sips of the mampoer for which Groot Marico is infamous. In 2010, the farms surrounding Groot Marico were among the last in South Africa to still be connected through party lines to a manual telephone exchange, which require callers to ask an operator to connect them to other telephone lines by pushing jacks into slots.

In March 1935 the family returned to Cittadella, Padua, Italy, where a sister, Natalina, was born shortly after. Three years later the family, which also included a brother, Flavio, arrived back in Australia to take up permanent residency in North Melbourne, Victoria.National Archives of Australia, Department of Immigration and Border Protection; A12508, 31/2551 Personal Statement and Declaration by alien passengers entering Australia (Forms A42) Gobbo, then aged seven, spoke no English at the time of his return, and his father, who had started a caf√©, felt the time was right for him to receive a Catholic education. Gobbo's early schooling included St Mary's Primary School, West Melbourne and later St Joseph's CBC, North Melbourne. In 1944 he was accepted into Xavier College, where he won the 1948 Associated Public Schools Head of the River before studying law at the University of Melbourne during which time he lived at Newman College. In 1951 he was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship, with which he attained a Master of Arts degree at Magdalen College, University of Oxford. In 1957 Gobbo married former librarian Shirley Lewis, and has five children. His son, James Gobbo, Jr., was the Liberal candidate for the district of Bentleigh in the 2006 Victorian state election. Judicial career After many years as a barrister and later as a Queen's Counsel, Gobbo was appointed as a judge of the Supreme Court of Victoria. He served from 18 July 1978 until he retired from the bench on 14 February 1994. Vice-regal career Gobbo served as Lieutenant-Governor of Victoria from 1995 until he was appointed Governor of Victoria in 1997 by Queen Elizabeth II on the advice of the Victorian premier, Jeff Kennett. He was the first Australian state governor of Italian descent. Gobbo's term of office was to be shorter than the usual five years, due to the uncertain outcome of the looming 1999 Australian republic referendum. If a republic had come into effect, then the governorship of Victoria would have been abolished from 1 January 2001. In August 2000 the new premier, Steve Bracks, announced that Gobbo's successor would be John Landy, who would take up his post in January 2001. Gobbo immediately made it known that he had had an understanding with Kennett for an extension of his term beyond 2000, and expressed deep disappointment that this was not now to occur.ABC: The World Today Archive ‚Äì Victoria's new governor However, this understanding must have been private, since Kennett's letter of appointment stated that any extension beyond 31 December 2000 would be a matter for the premier of the day.

In effect, such an economy does not grow in the course of time. The term usually refers to the national economy of a particular country, but it is also applicable to the economic system of a city, a region, or the entire world. Early in the history of economic thought, classical economist Adam Smith of the 18th century developed the concept of a stationary state of an economy: Smith believed that any national economy in the world would sooner or later settle in a final state of stationarity. Since the 1970s, the concept of a steady-state economy has been associated mainly with the work of leading ecological economist Herman Daly. As Daly's concept of a steady-state includes the ecological analysis of natural resource flows through the economy, his concept differs from the original classical concept of a stationary state. One other difference is that Daly recommends immediate political action to establish the steady-state economy by imposing permanent government restrictions on all resource use, whereas economists of the classical period believed that the final stationary state of any economy would evolve by itself without any government intervention. The world's mounting ecological problems have brought about a widening interest in the concept of a steady-state economy. Critics of the steady-state economy usually object to it by arguing that resource decoupling, technological development, and the unrestrained operation of market mechanisms are capable of overcoming any resource scarcity, any rampant pollution, or population overshoot. Proponents of the steady-state economy, on the other hand, maintain that these objections remain insubstantial and mistaken ‚Äî and that the need for a steady-state economy is becoming more compelling every day. A steady-state economy is not to be confused with economic stagnation: Whereas a steady-state economy is established as the result of deliberate political action, economic stagnation is the unexpected and unwelcome failure of a growth economy. An ideological contrast to the steady-state economy is formed by the concept of a post-scarcity economy.  Definition and vision  Since the 1970s, the concept of a steady-state economy has been associated mainly with the work of leading ecological economist Herman Daly ‚Äî to such an extent that even his boldest critics recognize the prominence of his work. Herman Daly defines his concept of a steady-state economy as an economic system made up of a constant stock of physical wealth (capital) and a constant stock of people (population), both stocks to be maintained by a flow of natural resources through the system. The first component, the constant stocks, is similar to the concept of the stationary state, originally used in classical economics; the second component, the flow of natural resources, is a new ecological feature, presently also used in the academic discipline of ecological economics. The durability of both of the constant stocks is to be maximized: The more durable the stock of capital is, the smaller the flow of natural resources is needed to maintain the stock; likewise, a 'durable' population means a population enjoying a high life expectancy ‚Äî something desirable by itself ‚Äî maintained by a low birth rate and an equally low death rate. Taken together, higher durability translates into better ecology in the system as a whole. Daly's concept of a steady-state economy is based on the vision that man's economy is an open subsystem embedded in a finite natural environment of scarce resources and fragile ecosystems. The economy is maintained by importing valuable natural resources from the input end and exporting valueless waste and pollution at the output end in a constant and irreversible flow. Any subsystem of a finite nongrowing system must itself at some point also become nongrowing and start maintaining itself in a steady- state as far as possible. This vision is opposed to mainstream neoclassical economics, where the economy is represented by an isolated and circular model with goods and services exchanging endlessly between companies and households, without exhibiting any physical contact to the natural environment. In the early 2010s, reviewers sympathetic towards Daly's concept of a steady-state economy have passed the concurrent judgement that although his concept remains beyond what is politically feasible at present, there is room for mainstream thinking and collective action to approach the concept in the future.  Historical background  For centuries, economists and other scholars have considered matters of natural resource scarcity and limits to growth, from the early classical economists in the 18th and 19th centuries down to the ecological concerns that emerged in the second half of the 20th century and developed into the formation of ecological economics as an independent academic subdiscipline in economics.  Concept of the stationary state in classical economics  From Adam Smith and onwards, economists in the classical period of economic theorising described the general development of society in terms of a contrast between the scarcity of arable agricultural land on the one hand, and the growth of population and capital on the other hand. The incomes from gross production were distributed as rents, profits and wages among landowners, capitalists and labourers respectively, and these three classes were incessantly engaged in the struggle for increasing their own share. The accumulation of capital (net investments) would sooner or later come to an end as the rate of profit fell to a minimum or to nil. At that point, the economy would settle in a final stationary state with a constant population size and a constant stock of capital.  Adam Smith's concept  Smith examined the economic states of various nations in the world Adam Smith's magnum opus on The Wealth of Nations, published in 1776, laid the foundation of classical economics in Britain. Smith thereby disseminated and established a concept that has since been a cornerstone in economics throughout most of the world: In a liberal capitalist society, provided with a stable institutional and legal framework, an 'invisible hand' will ensure that the enlightened self-interest of all members of society will contribute to the growth and prosperity of society as a whole, thereby leading to an 'obvious and simple system of natural liberty'. Smith was convinced of the beneficial effect of the enlightened self-interest on the wealth of nations; but he was less certain this wealth would grow forever. Smith observed that any country in the world found itself in either a 'progressive', a 'stationary', or a 'declining' state: Although England was wealthier than its North American colonies, wages were higher in the latter place as wealth in North America was growing faster than in England; hence, North America was in the 'cheerful and hearty' progressive state. In China, on the other hand, wages were low, the condition of poor people was scantier than in any nation in Europe, and more marriages were contracted here because the 'horrid' killing of newborn babies was permitted and even widely practised; hence, China was in the 'dull' stationary state, although it did not yet seem to be declining. In nations situated in the 'melancholic' declining state, the higher ranks of society would fall down and settle for occupation amid the lower ranks, while the lowest ranks would either subsist on a miserable and insufficient wage, resort to begging or crime, or slide into starvation and early death. Bengal and some other English settlements in the East Indies possibly found themselves in this state, Smith reckoned. Smith pointed out that as wealth was growing in any nation, the rate of profit would tend to fall and investment opportunities would diminish. In a nation that had thereby reached this 'full complement of riches', society would finally settle in a stationary state with a constant stock of people and capital. In an 18th-century anticipation of The Limits to Growth (see below), Smith described the state as follows: According to Smith, Holland seemed to be approaching this stationary state, although at a much higher level than in China. Smith believed the laws and institutions of China prevented this country from achieving the potential wealth its soil, climate and situation might have admitted of. Smith was unable to provide any contemporary examples of a nation in the world that had in fact reached the full complement of riches and thus had settled in stationarity, because, as he conjectured, \\"... perhaps no country has ever yet arrived at this degree of opulence.\\"  David Ricardo's concept  Ricardo was opposed to the interests of the landowning class In the early 19th century, David Ricardo was the leading economist of the day and the champion of British laissez-faire liberalism. He is known today for his free trade principle of comparative advantage, and for his formulation of the controversial labor theory of value. Ricardo replaced Adam Smith's empirical reasoning with abstract principles and deductive argument. This new methodology would later become the norm in economics as a science. In Ricardo's times, Britain's trade with the European continent was somewhat disrupted during the Napoleonic Wars that had raged since 1803. The Continental System brought into effect a large-scale embargo against British trade, whereby the nation's food supply came to rely heavily on domestic agriculture to the benefit of the landowning classes. When the wars ended with Napoleon's final defeat in 1815, the landowning classes dominating the British parliament had managed to tighten the existing Corn Laws in order to retain their monopoly status on the home market during peacetime. The controversial Corn Laws were a protectionist two-sided measure of subsidies on corn exports and tariffs on corn imports. The tightening was opposed by both the capitalist and the labouring classes, as the high price of bread effectively reduced real profits and real wages in the economy. So was the political setting when Ricardo published his treatise On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation in 1817. According to Ricardo, the limits to growth were ever present due to scarcity of arable agricultural land in the country. In the wake of the wartime period, the British economy seemed to be approaching the stationary state as population was growing, plots of land with lower fertility were put into agricultural use, and the rising rents of the rural landowning class were crowding out the profits of the urban capitalists. This was the broad outline of Ricardo's controversial land rent theory. Ricardo believed that the only way for Britain to avoid the stationary state was to increase her volume of international trade: The country should export more industrial products and start importing cheap agricultural products from abroad in turn. However, this course of development was impeded by the Corn Laws that seemed to be hampering both the industrialisation and the internationalization of the British economy. In the 1820s, Ricardo and his followers ‚Äì Ricardo himself died in 1823 ‚Äì directed much of their fire at the Corn Laws in order to have them repealed, and various other free trade campaigners borrowed indiscriminately from Ricardo's doctrines to suit their agenda. The Corn Laws were not repealed before 1846. In the meantime, the British economy kept growing, a fact that effectively undermined the credibility and thrust of Ricardian economics in Britain; but Ricardo had by now established himself as the first stationary state theorist in the history of economic thought. Ricardo's preoccupation with class conflict anticipated the work of Karl Marx (see below).  John Stuart Mill's concept  Mill believed the future stationary state was both inevitable, necessary and desirable John Stuart Mill was the leading economist, philosopher and social reformer in mid-19th century Britain. His economics treatise on the Principles of Political Economy, published in 1848, attained status as the standard textbook in economics throughout the English-speaking world until the turn of the century. A champion of classical liberalism, Mill believed that an ideal society should allow all individuals to pursue their own good without any interference from others or from government. Also a utilitarian philosopher, Mill regarded the 'Greatest Happiness Principle' as the ultimate ideal for a harmonious society: Mill's concept of the stationary state was strongly coloured by these ideals. Mill conjectured that the stationary state of society was not too far away in the future: Contrary to both Smith and Ricardo before him, Mill took an optimistic view on the future stationary state. Mill could not \\"... regard the stationary state of capital and wealth with the unaffected aversion so generally manifested toward it by political economists of the old school.\\" Instead, Mill attributed many important qualities to this future state, he even believed the state would bring about \\"... a very considerable improvement on our present condition.\\" According to Mill, the stationary state was at one and the same time inevitable, necessary and desirable: It was inevitable, because the accumulation of capital would bring about a falling rate of profit that would diminish investment opportunities and hamper further accumulation; it was also necessary, because mankind had to learn how to reduce its size and its level of consumption within the boundaries set by nature and by employment opportunities; finally, the stationary state was desirable, as it would ease the introduction of public income redistibution schemes, create more equality and put an end to man's ruthless struggle to get by ‚Äî instead, the human spirit would be liberated to the benefit of more elevated social and cultural activities, 'the graces of life'. Hence, Mill was able to express all of his liberal ideals for mankind through his concept of the stationary state. It has been argued that Mill essentially made a quality-of-life argument for the stationary state.  Main developments in economics since Mill  When the influence of John Stuart Mill and his Principles declined, the classical-liberalist period of economic theorising came to an end. By the turn of the 19th century, Marxism and neoclassical economics had emerged to dominate economics. This development led to the exclusion of any concern with natural resource scarcity in economic modelling and analysis: Marx replaced the concept of a stationary state with his vision of a communist society that would bring about abundance for everybody * Although a classical economist in his own right, Karl Marx abandoned the earlier concept of a stationary state and replaced it with his own unique vision of historical materialism, according to which human societies pass through several 'modes of production', eventually leading to communism. In each mode of production, man's increasing mastery over nature and the 'productive forces' of society develop to a point where the class conflict bursts into revolutions, followed by the establishment of a new mode of production. In opposition to his liberalist predecessors in the field, Marx did not regard natural resource scarcity as a factor constraining future economic growth; instead, the capitalist mode of production was to be overturned before the productive forces of society could fully develop, bringing about an abundance of goods in a new society based on the principle of \\"from each according to ability, to each according to need\\" ‚Äî that is, communism. The assumption, based on technological optimism, was that communism would overcome any resource scarcity ever to be encountered. For ideological reasons, then, orthodox Marxism has mostly been opposed to any concern with natural resource scarcity ever since Marx's own day. However, the march of history has been hard on this ideology: By 1991, German sociologist Reiner Grundmann was able to make the rather sweeping observation that \\"Orthodox Marxism has vanished from the scene, leftism has turned green, and Marxists have become ecologists.\\" * In neoclassical economics, on the other hand, the preoccupation with society's long term growth and development inherent in classical economics was abandoned altogether; instead, economic analysis came to focus on the study of the relationship between given ends and given scarce means, forming the concept of general equilibrium theory within an essentially static framework. Hence, neoclassical economics achieved greater generality, but only by asking easier questions; and any concern with natural resource scarcity was neglected. For this reason, modern ecological economists have deplored the simplified and ecologically harmful features of neoclassical economics: It has been argued that neoclassical economics has become a pseudoscience of choice between anything in general and nothing in particular, while neglecting the preferences of future generations; that the very terminology of neoclassical economics is so ecologically illiterate as to rarely even refer to natural resources or ecological limits; and that neoclassical economics has developed to become a dominant free market ideology legitimizing an ideal of society resembling a perpetual motion machine of economic growth at intolerable environmental and human costs. Taken together, it has been argued that \\"... if Judeo-Christian monotheism took nature out of religion, Anglo-American economists (after about 1880) took nature out of economics.\\" Almost one century later, Herman Daly has reintegrated nature into economics in his concept of a steady-state economy (see below).  John Maynard Keynes's concept of reaching saturation  Keynes predicted that capital accumulation would soon reach saturation and bring about a quasi- stationary community John Maynard Keynes was the paradigm founder of modern macroeconomics, and is widely considered today to be the most influential economist of the 20th century. Keynes rejected the basic tenet of classical economics that free markets would lead to full employment by themselves. Consequently, he recommended government intervention to stimulate aggregate demand in the economy, a macroeconomic policy now known as Keynesian economics. Keynes also believed that capital accumulation would reach saturation at some point in the future. In his essay from 1930 on The Economic Possibilities of Our Grandchildren, Keynes ventured to look one hundred years ahead into the future and predict the standard of living in the 21st century. Writing at the beginning of the Great Depression, Keynes rejected the prevailing \\"bad attack of economic pessimism\\" of his own time and foresaw that by 2030, the grandchildren of his generation would live in a state of abundance, where saturation would have been reached. People would find themselves liberated from such economic activities as saving and capital accumulation, and be able to get rid of 'pseudo-moral principles' ‚Äî avarice, exaction of interest, love of money ‚Äî that had characterized capitalistic societies so far. Instead, people would devote themselves to the true art of life, to live \\"wisely and agreeably and well.\\" Mankind would finally have solved \\"the economic problem,\\" that is, the struggle for existence. The similarity between John Stuart Mill's concept of the stationary state (see above) and Keynes's predictions in this essay has been noted. It has been argued that although Keynes was right about future growth rates, he underestimated the inequalities prevailing today, both within and across countries. He was also wrong in predicting that greater wealth would induce more leisure spent; in fact, the reverse trend seems to be true. In his magnum opus on The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, Keynes looked only one generation ahead into the future and predicted that state intervention balancing aggregate demand would by then have caused capital accumulation to reach the point of saturation. The marginal efficiency of capital as well as the rate of interest would both be brought down to zero, and ‚Äî if population was not increasing rapidly ‚Äî society would finally \\"... attain the conditions of a quasi-stationary community where change and progress would result only from changes in technique, taste, population and institutions ...\\" Keynes believed this development would bring about the disappearance of the rentier class, something he welcomed: Keynes argued that rentiers incurred no sacrifice for their earnings, and their savings did not lead to productive investments unless aggregate demand in the economy was sufficiently high. \\"I see, therefore, the rentier aspect of capitalism as a transitional phase which will disappear when it has done its work.\\"  Post- war economic expansion and emerging ecological concerns  The economic expansion following World War II took place while mainstream economics largely neglected the importance of natural resources and environmental constraints in the development. Addressing this discrepancy, ecological concerns emerged in academia around 1970. Later on, these concerns developed into the formation of ecological economics as an academic subdiscipline in economics.  Post-war economic expansion and the neglect of mainstream economics  After the ravages of World War II, the industrialised part of the world experienced almost three decades of unprecedented and prolonged economic expansion. This expansion ‚Äî known today as the Post‚ÄìWorld War II economic expansion ‚Äî was brought about by international financial stability, low oil prices and ever increasing labour productivity in manufacturing. During the era, all the advanced countries who founded ‚Äî or later joined ‚Äî the OECD enjoyed robust and sustained growth rates as well as full employment. In the 1970s, the expansion ended with the 1973 oil crisis, resulting in the 1973‚Äì75 recession and the collapse of the Bretton Woods monetary system. Throughout this era, mainstream economics ‚Äî dominated by both neoclassical economics and Keynesian economics ‚Äî developed theories and models where natural resources and environmental constraints were neglected. Conservation issues related specifically to agriculture and forestry were left to specialists in the subdiscipline of environmental economics at the margins of the mainstream. As the theoretical framework of neoclassical economics ‚Äî namely general equilibrium theory ‚Äî was uncritically adopted and maintained by even environmental economics, this subdiscipline was rendered largely unable to consider important issues of concern to environmental policy. In the years around 1970, the widening discrepancy between an ever-growing world economy on the one hand, and a mainstream economics discipline not taking into account the importance of natural resources and environmental constraints on the other hand, was finally addressed ‚Äî indeed, challenged ‚Äî in academia by a few unorthodox economists and researchers.  Emerging ecological concerns  During the short period of time from 1966 to 1972, four works were published addressing the importance of natural resources and the environment to human society: * In his 1966 philosophical-minded essay on The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth, economist and systems scientist Kenneth E. Boulding argued that mankind would soon have to adapt to economic principles much different than the past 'open earth' of illimitable plains and exploitative behaviour. On the basis of the thermodynamic principle of the conservation of matter and energy, Boulding developed the view that the flow of natural resources through the economy is a rough measure of the Gross national product (GNP); and, consequently, that society should start regarding the GNP as a cost to be minimized rather than a benefit to be maximized. Therefore, mankind would have to find its place in a cyclical ecological system without unlimited reservoirs of anything, either for extraction or for pollution ‚Äî like a spaceman on board a spaceship. Boulding was not the first to make use of the 'Spaceship Earth' metaphor, but he was the one who combined this metaphor with the analysis of natural resource flows through the economy. * In his 1971 magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process, Romanian American economist Nicholas Georgescu- Roegen integrated the thermodynamic concept of entropy with economic analysis, and argued that all natural resources are irreversibly degraded when put to use in economic activity. What happens in the economy is that all matter and energy is transformed from states available for human purposes (valuable natural resources) to states unavailable for human purposes (valueless waste and pollution). In the history of economic thought, Georgescu-Roegen was also the first economist of some standing to theorise on the premise that all of earth's mineral resources will eventually be exhausted at some point (see below). * Also in 1971, pioneering ecologist and general systems analyst Howard T. Odum published his book on Environment, Power and Society, where he described human society in terms of ecology. He formulated the maximum power principle, according to which all organisms, ecosystems and human societies organise themselves in order to maximize their use of available energy for survival. Odum pointed out that those human societies with access to the higher quality of energy sources enjoyed an advantage over other societies in the Darwinian evolutionary struggle. Odum later co-developed the concept of emergy (i.e., embodied energy) and made other valuable contributions to ecology and systems analysis. His work provided the biological term 'ecology' with its broader societal meaning used today. * In 1972, scientist and systems analyst Dennis Meadows and his team of researchers had their study on The Limits to Growth published by the Club of Rome. The Meadows team modelled aggregate trends in the world economy and made the projection ‚Äî not prediction ‚Äî that by the mid to latter part of the 21st century, industrial production per capita, food supply per capita and world population would all reach a peak, and then rapidly decline in a vicious overshoot-and-collapse trajectory. Due to its dire pessimism, the study was scorned and dismissed by most mainstream economists at the time of its publication. However, well into the 21st century, several independent researchers have confirmed that world economic trends so far do indeed match up to the original 'standard run' projections made by the Meadows team, indicating that a global collapse may still loom large in the not too distant future. Taken together, these four works were seminal in bringing about the formation of ecological economics later on.  Formation of ecological economics as an academic subdiscipline  Although most of the theoretical and foundational work behind ecological economics was in place by the early 1970s, a long gestation period elapsed before this new academic subdiscipline in economics was properly named and institutionalized. Ecological economics was formally founded in 1988 as the culmination of a series of conferences and meetings through the 1980s, where key scholars interested in the ecology-economy interdependency were interacting with each other. The most important people involved in the establishment were Herman Daly and Robert Costanza from the US; AnnMari Jansson from Sweden; and Juan Mart√≠nez-Alier from Spain (Catalonia). Since 1989, the discipline has been organised in the International Society for Ecological Economics that publishes the journal of Ecological Economics. When the ecological economics subdiscipline was established, Herman Daly's 'preanalytic vision' of the economy was widely shared among the members who joined in: The human economy is an open subsystem of a finite and non-growing ecosystem (earth's natural environment), and any subsystem of a fixed nongrowing system must itself at some point also become nongrowing. Indeed, it has been argued that the subdiscipline itself was born out of frustration with the unwillingness of the established disciplines to accept this vision. However, ecological economics has since been overwhelmed by the influence and domination of neoclassical economics and its everlasting free market orthodoxy. This development has been deplored by activistic ecological economists as an 'incoherent', 'shallow' and overly 'pragmatic' slide.  Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy  Since the 1970s, Herman Daly has been the world's leading proponent of a steady-state economy. Throughout his career, Daly has published several books and articles on the subject. He has also helped founding the Center for the Advancement of the Steady-State Economy (CASSE). He has received several prizes and awards in recognition of his work. According to two independent comparative studies of American Daly's steady-state economics versus the later, competing school of degrowth from continental Europe, no differences of analytical substance exist between the two schools; only, Daly's bureaucratic ‚Äî or even technocratic ‚Äî top-down management of the economy fares badly with the more radical grassroots appeal of degrowth, as championed by French political scientist Serge Latouche (see below). Natural resources flow through the economy only to end up as waste and pollution in the environment The premise underlying Daly's concept of a steady-state economy is that the economy is an open subsystem of a finite and non-growing ecosystem (earth's natural environment). The economy is maintained by importing low-entropy matter-energy (resources) from nature; these resources are put through the economy, being transformed and manufactured into goods along the way; eventually, the throughput of matter- energy is exported to the environment as high-entropy waste and pollution. Recycling of material resources is possible, but only by using up some energy resources as well as an additional amount of other material resources; and energy resources, in turn, cannot be recycled at all, but are dissipated as waste heat. Out of necessity, then, any subsystem of a fixed nongrowing system must itself at some point also become nongrowing. Daly argues that nature has provided basically two sources of wealth at man's disposal, namely a stock of terrestrial mineral resources and a flow of solar energy. An 'asymmetry' between these two sources of wealth exist in that we may ‚Äî within some practical limits ‚Äî extract the mineral stock at a rate of our own choosing (that is, rapidly), whereas the flow of solar energy is reaching earth at a rate beyond human control. Since the Sun will continue to shine on earth at a fixed rate for billions of years to come, it is the terrestrial mineral stock ‚Äî and not the Sun ‚Äî that constitutes the crucial scarcity factor regarding man's economic future. Unintentionally, the Industrial Revolution has thrown modern man out of equilibrium with the rest of the biosphere Daly points out that today's global ecological problems are rooted in man's historical record: Until the Industrial Revolution that took place in Britain in the second half of the 18th century, man lived within the limits imposed by what Daly terms a 'solar-income budget': The Palaeolithic tribes of hunter-gatherers and the later agricultural societies of the Neolithic and onwards subsisted primarily ‚Äî though not exclusively ‚Äî on earth's biosphere, powered by an ample supply of renewable energy, received from the Sun. The Industrial Revolution changed this situation completely, as man began extracting the terrestrial mineral stock at a rapidly increasing rate. The original solar-income budget was thereby broken and supplemented by the new, but much scarcer source of wealth. Mankind still lives in the after-effect of this revolution. Daly cautions that more than two hundred years of worldwide industrialisation is now confronting mankind with a range of problems pertaining to the future existence and survival of our species: Following the work of Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, Daly argues that the laws of thermodynamics restrict all human technologies and apply to all economic systems: This view on the role of technology in the economy was later termed 'entropy pessimism' (see below). In Daly's view, mainstream economists tend to regard natural resource scarcity as only a relative phenomenon, while human needs and wants are granted absolute status: It is believed that the price mechanism and technological development (however defined) is capable of overcoming any scarcity ever to be faced on earth; it is also believed that all human wants could and should be treated alike as absolutes, from the most basic necessities of life to the extravagant and insatiable craving for luxuries. Daly terms this belief 'growthmania', which he finds pervasive in modern society. In opposition to the dogma of growthmania, Daly submits that \\"... there is such a thing as absolute scarcity, and there is such a thing as purely relative and trivial wants\\". Once it is recognised that scarcity is imposed by nature in an absolute form by the laws of thermodynamics and the finitude of earth; and that some human wants are only relative and not worthy of satisfying; then we are all well on the way to the paradigm of a steady-state economy, Daly concludes. The inevitable exhaustion of mined resources could be postponed by imposing permanent quantitative restrictions on the economy Consequently, Daly recommends that a system of permanent government restrictions on the economy is established as soon as possible, a steady-state economy. Whereas the classical economists believed that the final stationary state would settle by itself as the rate of profit fell and capital accumulation came to an end (see above), Daly wants to create the steady-state politically by establishing three institutions of the state as a superstructure on top of the present market economy: * The first institution is to correct inequality to some extent by putting minimum and maximum limits on incomes, maximum limits on wealth, and then redistribute accordingly. * The second institution is to stabilise the population by issuing transferable reproduction licenses to all fertile women at a level corresponding with the general replacement fertility in society. * The third institution is to stabilise the level of capital by issuing and selling depletion quotas that impose quantitative restrictions on the flow of resources through the economy. Quotas effectively minimise the throughput of resources necessary to maintain any given level of capital (as opposed to taxes, that merely alter the prevailing price structure). The purpose of these three institutions is to stop and prevent further growth by combining what Daly calls \\"a nice reconciliation of efficiency and equity\\" and providing \\"the ecologically necessary macrocontrol of growth with the least sacrifice in terms of microlevel freedom and variability.\\" Among the generation of his teachers, Daly ranks Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen and Kenneth E. Boulding as the two economists he has learned the most from. However, both Georgescu-Roegen and Boulding have assessed that a steady-state economy may serve only as a temporary societal arrangement for mankind when facing the long-term issue of global mineral resource exhaustion: Even with a constant stock of people and capital, and a minimised (yet constant) flow of resources put through the world economy, earth's mineral stock will still be exhausted, although at a slower rate than is presently the situation (see below). Responding specifically to the criticism levelled at him by Georgescu-Roegen, Daly concedes that a steady-state economy will serve only to postpone, and not to prevent, the inevitable mineral resource exhaustion: \\"A steady-state economy cannot last forever, but neither can a growing economy, nor a declining economy\\". A frank and committed Protestant, Daly further argues that... Later, several other economists in the field have agreed that not even a steady-state economy can last forever on earth.  Ecological reasons for a steady-state economy = Present situation: Exceeding global limits to growth  Like any other planet, earth is finite The world's mounting ecological problems have stimulated interest in the concept of a steady-state economy. Since the 1990s, most metrics have provided evidence that the volume of the world economy far exceeds critical global limits to economic growth already. According to the ecological footprint measure, earth's carrying capacity ‚Äî that is, earth's long-term capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels ‚Äî was exceeded by some 30 percent in 1995. By 2018, this figure had increased to some 70 percent. In 2020 multinational team of scientists published a study, saying that overconsumption is the biggest threat to sustainability. According to the study a drastic change in lifestyle is necessary for solving the ecological crisis. According to one of the authors Julia Steinberger: ‚ÄúTo protect ourselves from the worsening climate crisis, we must reduce inequality and challenge the notion that riches, and those who possess them, are inherently good.‚Äù The research was published on the site of the World Economic Forum. The leader of the forum professor Klaus Schwab, calls to a \\"great reset of capitalism\\". In effect, mankind is confronted with planetary overshoot-and-collapse in our time. The significant impact of human activities on earth's ecosystems has motivated some geologists to propose the present epoch be named the anthropocene. The following issues have raised much concern worldwide: ;Overpopulation World population is expected to reach 9.8 billion by 2050, and continue growing thereafter. This unprecedented number of people is already stressing natural environments and wildlife habitats everywhere, increasing pollution levels, and worsening human living conditions. Uncontrolled urbanisation forces millions to live in congested shanty towns, and large cities swell to become megacities with high crime slum areas. Overpopulation may even lead to social conflict and violence, when too many people, especially young males, compete for too few employment opportunities in stagnating economies. ;Pollution and global warming Air pollution emanating from motor vehicles and industrial plants is damaging public health and increasing mortality rates. The concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is the apparent source of global warming and climate changes. Extreme regional weather patterns and rising sea levels caused by warming degrade living conditions in many ‚Äî if not all ‚Äî parts of the world. The warming already poses a security threat to many nations and works as a so-called 'threat multiplier' to geo- political stability. Even worse, the loss of Arctic permafrost may be triggering a massive release of methane and other greenhouse gases from thawing soils in the region, thereby overwhelming political action to counter climate change. If critical temperature thresholds are crossed, Earth's climate may transit from an 'icehouse' to a 'greenhouse' state for the first time in 34 million years. One of the most common solutions to the climate crisis is transitioning to renewable energy, but it also has some environmental impacts. They are presented by the proponents of theories like degrowth steady-state economy and circular economy as one of the proofs that for achieving sustainability technological methods are not enough and there is a need to limit consumption In 2019 a new report \\"Plastic and Climate\\" was published. According to the report, in 2019, plastic will contribute greenhouse gases in the equivalent of 850 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere. In current trend, annual emissions will grow to 1.34 billion tons by 2030. By 2050 plastic could emit 56 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions, as much as 14 percent of the earth's remaining carbon budget, except the harm to Phytoplankton. The report says that only solutions which involve a reduction in consumption can solve the problem, while others like biodegradable plastic, ocean cleanup, using renewable energy in plastic industry can do little, and in some cases may even worsen it. Another report referring to all the environmental and health effects of plastic says the same. ;Depletion of non-renewable minerals Non-renewable mineral reserves are currently extracted at high and unsustainable rates from earth's crust. Remaining reserves are likely to become ever more costly to extract in the near future, and will reach depletion at some point. The era of relatively peaceful economic expansion that has prevailed globally since World War II may be interrupted by unexpected supply shocks or simply be succeeded by the peaking depletion paths of oil and other valuable minerals. In 2020 in the first time the rate of use of natural resources arrived to more than 110 billion tons per year Economist Jason Hickel has written critically about the ideology of green-growth, the idea that as capitalism and systems expand, natural resources will also expand naturally, as it is compatible with our planet‚Äôs ecology. This contradicts with the idea of no-growth economics, or degrowth economics, where the sustainability and stability of the economy is prioritized over the uncontrolled profit of those in power. Models around creating development in communities have found that failing to account for sustainability in early stages leads to failure in the long term. These models contradict green growth theory and do not support ideas about expansion of natural resources. Additionally, those living in poorer areas tend to be exposed to higher levels of toxins and pollutants as a result of systematic environmental racism. Increasing natural resources and increasing local involvement in their distribution are potential solutions to alleviate pollution and address poverty in these areas. ;Net depletion of renewable resources Use of renewable resources in excess of their replenishment rates is undermining ecological stability worldwide. Between 2000 and 2012, deforestation resulted in some 14 percent of the equivalent of earth's original forest cover to be cut down. Tropical rainforests have been subject to deforestation at a rapid pace for decades ‚Äî especially in west and central Africa and in Brazil ‚Äî mostly due to subsistence farming, population pressure, and urbanization. Population pressures also strain the world's soil systems, leading to land degradation, mostly in developing countries. Global erosion rates on conventional cropland are estimated to exceed soil creation rates by more than ten times. Widespread overuse of groundwater results in water deficits in many countries. By 2025, water scarcity could impact the living conditions of two-thirds of the world's population. ;Loss of biodiversity The destructive impact of human activity on wildlife habitats worldwide is accelerating the extinction of rare species, thereby substantially reducing earth's biodiversity. The natural nitrogen cycle is heavily overloaded by industrial nitrogen fixation and use, thereby disrupting most known types of ecosystems. The accumulating plastic debris in the oceans decimates aquatic life. Ocean acidification due to the excess concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is resulting in coral bleaching and impedes shell-bearing organisms. Arctic sea ice decline caused by global warming is endangering the polar bear. In 2019, a summary for policymakers of the largest, most comprehensive study to date of biodiversity and ecosystem services was published by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. The report was finalised in Paris. The main conclusions: 1\\\\. Over the last 50 years, the state of nature has deteriorated at an unprecedented and accelerating rate. 2\\\\. The main drivers of this deterioration have been changes in land and sea use, exploitation of living beings, climate change, pollution and invasive species. These five drivers, in turn, are caused by societal behaviors, from consumption to governance. 3\\\\. Damage to ecosystems undermines 35 of 44 selected UN targets, including the UN General Assembly's Sustainable Development Goals for poverty, hunger, health, water, cities' climate, oceans and land. It can cause problems with food, water and humanity's air supply. 4\\\\. To fix the problem, humanity will need a transformative change, including sustainable agriculture, reductions in consumption and waste, fishing quotas and collaborative water management. On page 8 of the summary the authors state that one of the main measures is: \\" enabling visions of a good quality of life that do not entail ever-increasing material consumption; These mounting concerns have prompted an increasing number of academics and other writers ‚Äî beside Herman Daly ‚Äî to point to limits to economic growth, and to question ‚Äî and even oppose ‚Äî the prevailing ideology of infinite economic growth. In September 2019, 1 day before the Global Climate Strike on 20 September 2019 in the Guardian was published an article that summarizes many research and say that limit consumption is necessary for saving the biosphere.  Steady-state economy and Well-being Except the reasons linked to resource depletion and the carrying capacity of the ecological system, there are other reasons to limit consumption - overconsumption hurts the well-being of those who consume too much. In the same time when the ecological footprint of humanity exceeded the sustainable level, while GDP more than tripled from 1950, one of the well-being measures genuine progress indicator has fallen from 1978. This is one of the reasons for pursuing the steady state economy. In some cases reducing consumption can increase the life level. In Costa Rica the GDP is 4 times smaller than in many countries in Western Europe and North America, but people live longer and better. An American study shows that when the income is higher than 75,000$, an increase in profits does not increase well being. For better measuring the well being, the New Economics Foundation‚Äôs has launched the Happy Planet Index. The food industry is large sector of consumption responsible for 37% of global greenhouse-gas emissions and studies show that people waste a fifth of food products just through disposal or overconsumption. By the time food reaches the consumer, 9% (160 million tons) goes uneaten and 10% is lost to overconsumption - meaning consumers ate more than the calorie intake requirement. When the consumer takes in too much, this not only explains losses at the beginning of the stage at production (and overproduction) but also lends itself to overconsumption of energy and protein, having harmful effects on the body like ObesityBeer, E. (27 February 2017). Consumer waste and livestock biggest inefficiencies in food production: Study. Retrieved 5 November 2017, from https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2017/02/27/Consumer- waste-and-livestock-biggest-inefficiencies-in-food-production-Study A report from the Lancet commission says the same. The experts write: \\"Until now, undernutrition and obesity have been seen as polar opposites of either too few or too many calories,\\" \\"In reality, they are both driven by the same unhealthy, inequitable food systems, underpinned by the same political economy that is single-focused on economic growth, and ignores the negative health and equity outcomes. Climate change has the same story of profits and power,\\". Obesity was a medical problem for people who overconsumed food and worked too little already in ancient Rome, and its impact slowly grew through history. As to 2012, mortality from Obesity was 3 times larger than from hunger, reaching 2.8 million people per year by 2017 Cycling reduces greenhouse gas emissions while reducing the effects of a sedentary lifestyle at the same time. As of 2002 sedentary lifestyle claimed 2 million lives per year. The World Health Organization stated that: \\"60 to 85% of people in the world‚Äîfrom both developed and developing countries‚Äîlead sedentary lifestyles, making it one of the more serious yet insufficiently addressed public health problems of our time. \\". By 2012 according to a study published in 'The Lancet\\" the number reached 5.3 million Reducing the use of screens can help fight many diseases, among others depression, the leading cause of disability globally. It also can lower greenhouse gas emission. As of 2018, 3.7% of global emissions were from digital technologies more than from aviation, the number is expected to achieve 8% by 2025, equal to the emissions from cars. Reducing Light pollution can reduce GHG emissions and improve health In September 2019, 1 day before the Global Climate Strike on 20 September 2019 in \\"The Guardian\\" was published an article that summarizes many research and say that limit consumption is necessary for the health of big consumers: it can increase empathy improve the contacts with other people, and more.  Connection with other ideologies, movements  The concept of steady state economy is connected to other concepts that can be generally defined as Ecological economics and Anti- consumerism, because it serve as the final target of those concepts: Those ideologies are not calling for poverty but wants to reach a level of consumption that is the best for people and the environment.  Degrowth  The Center for the Advancement of the Steady State Economy (CASSE) define steady state economy, not only as an economy with some constant level of consumption, but as an economy with the best possible level of consumption maintained constantly. To define what is this level, it consider not only ecology, but also life level. It writes: \\"In cases where the benefits of growth outweigh the costs (for example, where people are not consuming enough to meet their needs), growth or redistribution of resources may be required. In cases where the size of the economy has surpassed the carrying capacity of the ecosystems that contain it (a condition known as overshoot), degrowth may be required before establishing a steady state economy that can be maintained over the long term\\". In February 2020, the same organization proposed a slogan of \\"Degrowth Toward a Steady State Economy\\" because it can unify degrowthers and steady staters. In the statement is mentioned, that: \\"In 2018 the nascent DegrowUS adopted the mission statement, \\"Our mission is a democratic and just transition to a smaller, steady state economy in harmony with nature, family, and community.\\". In his article on Economic de-growth vs. steady-state economy, Christian Kerschner has integrated the strategy of declining-state, or degrowth, with Herman Daly's concept of the steady-state economy to the effect that degrowth should be considered a path taken by the rich industrialized countries leading towards a globally equitable steady-state economy. This ultra-egalitarian path will then make ecological room for poorer countries to catch up and combine into a final world steady-state, maintained at some internationally agreed upon intermediate and 'optimum' level of activity for some period of time ‚Äî although not forever. Kerschner admits that this goal of a world steady-state may remain unattainable in the foreseeable future, but such seemingly unattainable goals could stimulate visions about how to better approach them.  The concept of Overdevelopment by Leopold Cohr  In 1977 Leopold Kohr published a book named The Overdeveloped Nations: The Diseconomies Of Scale, talking primarily about overconsumption. This book is the basis for the theory of overdevelopment, saying that the global north, the rich countries are too much developed what increases the Ecological footprint of humanity and create many problems both in overdeveloped and underdeveloped countries.Barkin, Samuel J. \\"Trade, Sustainable Development and the Environment\\", Global Environmental Politics 3:4, November 2003  Conceptual and ideological disagreements  Several conceptual and ideological disagreements presently exist concerning the steady-state economy in particular and the dilemma of growth in general. The following issues are considered below: The role of technology; resource decoupling and the rebound effect; a declining-state economy; the possibility of having capitalism without growth; and the possibility of pushing some of the terrestrial limits into outer space. In 2019 a research, presenting an overview of the attempts to achieve constant economic growth without environmental destruction and their results, was published. It shows that by the year 2019 the attempts were not successful. It does not give a clear answer about future attempts. Herman Daly's approach to these issues are presented throughout the text.  Role of technology  Technology is usually defined as the application of scientific method in the production of goods or in other social achievements. Historically, technology has mostly been developed and implemented in order to improve labour productivity and increase living standards. In economics, disagreement presently exists regarding the role of technology when considering its dependency on natural resources: * In neoclassical economics, on the one hand, the role of 'technology' is usually represented as yet another factor of production contributing to economic growth, like land, labour and capital contribute. However, in neoclassical production functions, where the output of produced goods are related to the inputs provided by the factors of production, no mention is made of the contribution of natural resources to the production process. Hence, 'technology' is reified as a separate, self-contained device, capable of contributing to production without receiving any natural resource inputs beforehand. This representation of 'technology' also prevails in standard mainstream economics textbooks on the subject. Technology is usually dependent on fuel or electricity for its operation * In ecological economics, on the other hand, 'technology' is represented as the way natural resources are transformed in the production process. Hence, Herman Daly argues that the role of technology in the economy cannot be properly conceptualized without taking into account the flow of natural resources necessary to support the technology itself: An internal combustion engine runs on fuels; machinery and electric devices run on electricity; all capital equipment is made out of material resources to begin with. In physical terms, any technology ‚Äî useful though it is ‚Äî works largely as a medium for transforming valuable natural resources into material goods that eventually end up as valueless waste and pollution, thereby increasing the entropy ‚Äî or disorder ‚Äî of the world as a whole. This view of the role of technology in the economy has been termed 'entropy pessimism'. From the ecological point of view, it has been suggested that the disagreement boils down to a matter of teaching some elementary physics to the uninitiated neoclassical economists and other technological optimists. From the neoclassical point of view, leading growth theorist and Nobel Prize laureate Robert Solow has defended his much criticised position by replying in 1997 that 'elementary physics' has not by itself prevented growth in the industrialized countries so far.  Resource decoupling and the rebound effect  Resource decoupling occurs when economic activity becomes less intensive ecologically: A declining input of natural resources is needed to produce one unit of output on average, measured by the ratio of total natural resource consumption to gross domestic product (GDP). Relative resource decoupling occurs when natural resource consumption declines on a ceteris paribus assumption ‚Äî that is, all other things being equal. Absolute resource decoupling occurs when natural resource consumption declines, even while GDP is growing. Jevons analysed the effect of increasing energy efficiency In the history of economic thought, William Stanley Jevons was the first economist of some standing to analyse the occurrence of resource decoupling, although he did not use this term. In his 1865 book on The Coal Question, Jevons argued that an increase in energy efficiency would by itself lead to more, not less, consumption of energy: Due to the income effect of the lowered energy expenditures, people would be rendered better off and demand even more energy, thereby outweighing the initial gain in efficiency. This mechanism is known today as the Jevons paradox or the rebound effect. Jevons's analysis of this seeming paradox formed part of his general concern that Britain's industrial supremacy in the 19th century would soon be set back by the inevitable exhaustion of the country's coal mines, whereupon the geopolitical balance of power would tip in favour of countries abroad possessing more abundant mines. In 2009, two separate studies were published that ‚Äî among other things ‚Äî addressed the issues of resource decoupling and the rebound effect: German scientist and politician Ernst Ulrich von Weizs√§cker published Factor Five: Transforming the Global Economy through 80% Improvements in Resource Productivity, co-authored with a team of researchers from The Natural Edge Project. British ecological economist Tim Jackson published Prosperity Without Growth, drawing extensively from an earlier report authored by him for the UK Sustainable Development Commission. Consider each in turn: * Ernst Ulrich von Weizs√§cker argues that a new economic wave of innovation and investment ‚Äî based on increasing resource productivity, renewable energy, industrial ecology and other green technology ‚Äî will soon kick off a 'Green Kondratiev' cycle, named after the Russian economist Nikolai Kondratiev. This new long-term cycle is expected to bring about as much as an 80 percent increase in resource productivity, or what amounts to a 'Factor Five' improvement of the gross input per output ratio in the economy, and reduce environmental impact accordingly, von Weizs√§cker promises. Regarding the adverse rebound effect, von Weizs√§cker notes that \\"... efforts to improve efficiency have been fraught with increasing overall levels of consumption.\\" As remedies, von Weizs√§cker recommends three separate approaches: Recycling of and imposing restrictions on the use of materials; establishing capital funds from natural resource proceeds for reinvestments in order to compensate for the future bust caused by depletion; and finally, taxing resource consumption so as to balance it with the available supplies. * Tim Jackson points out that according to empirical evidence, the world economy has indeed experienced some relative resource decoupling: In the period from 1970 to 2009, the 'energy intensity' ‚Äî that is, the energy content embodied in world GDP‚Äîdecreased by 33 percent; but as the world economy also kept growing, carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels have increased by 80 percent during the same period of time. Hence, no absolute energy resource decoupling materialized. Regarding key metal resources, the development was even worse in that not even relative resource decoupling have materialized in the period from 1990 to 2007: The extraction of iron ore, bauxite, copper and nickel was rising faster than world GDP to the effect that \\"resource efficiency is going in the wrong direction,\\" mostly due to emerging economies ‚Äî notably China ‚Äî building up their infrastructure. Jackson concludes his survey by noting that the 'dilemma of growth' is evident when any resource efficiency squeezed out of the economy will sooner or later be pushed back up again by a growing GDP. Jackson further cautions that \\"simplistic assumptions that capitalism's propensity for efficiency will stabilize the climate and solve the problem of resource scarcity are almost literally bankrupt.\\" Herman Daly has argued that the best way to increase natural resource efficiency (decouple) and to prevent the occurrence of any rebound effects is to impose quantitative restrictions on resource use by establishing a cap and trade system of quotas, managed by a government agency. Daly believes this system features a unique triple advantage: * Absolute and permanent limits are set on the extraction rate of, use of and pollution with the resources flowing through the economy; as opposed to taxes that merely alter the prevailing price structure without stopping growth; and as opposed to pollution standards and control which are both costly and difficult to enact and enforce. * More efficiency and recycling efforts are induced by the higher resource prices resulting from the restrictions (quota prices plus regular extraction costs). * No rebound effects are able to appear, as any temporary excess demand will result only in inflation or shortages, or both ‚Äî and not in increased supply, which is to remain constant and limited on a permanent basis. For all its merits, Daly himself points to the existence of physical, technological and practical limitations to how much efficiency and recycling can be achieved by this proposed system. The idea of absolute decoupling ridding the economy as a whole of any dependence on natural resources is ridiculed polemically by Daly as 'angelizing GDP': It would work only if we ascended to become angels ourselves.  Declining-state economy  A declining-state economy is an economy made up of a declining stock of physical wealth (capital) or a declining population size, or both. A declining-state economy is not to be confused with a recession: Whereas a declining-state economy is established as the result of deliberate political action, a recession is the unexpected and unwelcome failure of a growing or a steady economy. Proponents of a declining- state economy generally believe that a steady-state economy is not far- reaching enough for the future of mankind. Some proponents may even reject modern civilization as such, either partly or completely, whereby the concept of a declining-state economy begins bordering on the ideology of anarcho- primitivism, on radical ecological doomsaying or on some variants of survivalism. Romanian American economist Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen was the teacher and mentor of Herman Daly and is presently considered the main intellectual figure influencing the degrowth movement that formed in France and Italy in the early 2000s. In his paradigmatic magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process, Georgescu-Roegen argues that the carrying capacity of earth ‚Äî that is, earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels ‚Äî is bound to decrease sometime in the future as earth's finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and put to use; and consequently, that the world economy as a whole is heading towards an inevitable future collapse. In effect, Georgescu-Roegen points out that the arguments advanced by Herman Daly in support of his steady-state economy apply with even greater force in support of a declining-state economy: When the overall purpose is to ration and stretch mineral resource use for as long time into the future as possible, zero economic growth is more desirable than growth is, true; but negative growth is better still! Instead of Daly's steady-state economics, Georgescu-Roegen proposed his own so-called 'minimal bioeconomic program', featuring restrictions even more severe than those propounded by his former student Daly (see above). American political advisor Jeremy Rifkin, French champion of the degrowth movement Serge Latouche and Austrian degrowth theorist Christian Kerschner ‚Äî who all take their cue from Georgescu-Roegen's work ‚Äî have argued in favour of declining-state strategies. Consider each in turn: * In his book on Entropy: A New World View, Jeremy Rifkin argues that the impending exhaustion of earth's mineral resources will mark the decline of the industrial age, followed by the advent of a new solar age, based on renewable solar power. Due to the diffuse, low-intensity property of solar radiation, this source of energy is incapable of sustaining industrialism, whether capitalist or socialist. Consequently, Rifkin advocates an anarcho-primitivist future solar economy ‚Äî or what he terms an 'entropic society' ‚Äî based on anti-consumerism, deindustrialization, counterurbanization, organic farming and prudential restraints on childbirths. Rifkin cautions that the transition to the solar age is likely to become a troublesome phase in the history of mankind, as the present world economy is so dependent on the non-renewable mineral resources. * In his manifesto on Farewell to Growth, Serge Latouche develops a strategy of so-called 'ecomunicipalism' to initiate a 'virtuous cycle of quiet contraction' or degrowth of economic activity at the local level of society: Consumption patterns and addiction to work should be reduced; systems of fair taxation and consumption permits should redistribute the gains from economic activity within and among countries; obsolescence and waste should be reduced, products designed so as to make recycling easier. This bottom-up strategy opposes overconsumption in rich countries as well as emerging, poor countries to aspire this overconsumption of the rich. Instead, the purpose of degrowth is to establish the convivial and sustainable society where people can live better lives whilst working and consuming less. Latouche further cautions that \\"the very survival of humanity ... means that ecological concerns must be a central part of our social, political, cultural and spiritual preoccupation with human life.\\" Herman Daly on his part is not opposed to the concept of a declining-state economy; but he does point out that the steady-state economy should serve as a preliminary first step on a declining path, once the optimal levels of population and capital have been properly defined. However, this first step is an important one: Daly concedes that it is 'difficult, probably impossible' to define such optimum levels; even more, in his final analysis Daly agrees with his teacher and mentor Georgescu-Roegen that no defined optimum will be able to last forever (see above).  Capitalism without growth  Several radical critics of capitalism have questioned the possibility of ever imposing a steady-state or a declining-state (degrowth) system as a superstructure on top of capitalism. Taken together, these critics point to the following growth dynamics inherent in capitalism: Could capitalism ever stop growing? * Economic activity is generally guided by the profit motive, a competitive work ethos and the drive to accumulate capital and wealth for its own sake to gratify personal ambition, provide social prestige ‚Äî or simply to get rich in a hurry. Psychologically, these drives in the work sphere repress and distort biological and social homeostasis in most people. * Employments and incomes depend directly on sales revenues, that is, on people spending money on the consumption of goods and services for sale on the market. This dependency creates a pecuniary incentive to increase sales as much as possible. To this end, much cunning advertising is devised to manipulate human wants and prop up consumption patterns, often resulting in lavish and wasteful consumerism. * The financial system is based on fractional-reserve banking, enabling commercial banks to hold reserves in amounts that are less than their deposit liabilities. This credit creation is multiplying the monetary base supplied by the central bank in order to assist private corporations expanding their activities. * Technological development exhibits a strong labour-saving bias, creating the need to provide new employment elsewhere in the economy for workers displaced by the introduction of new technology. * Private corporations generally resist government regulations and restrictions that impede profits and deter investment opportunities. Attempts to downscale the economy would rapidly degenerate into economic crisis and political instability on this count alone. * Governments need tax revenues to service their debt obligations, run their institutions and finance their welfare programmes for the benefit of the public. Tax revenues are collected from general economic activity. * In the capitalist world economy, globalisation intensifies competition everywhere, both within and between countries. National governments are compelled to compete and struggle with each other to provide employment, investments, tax revenues and wealth for their own populations. ‚Äî In short: There is no end to the systemic and ecologically harmful growth dynamics in modern capitalism, radical critics assert. Fully aware of the massive growth dynamics of capitalism, Herman Daly on his part poses the rhetorical question whether his concept of a steady- state economy is essentially capitalistic or socialistic. He provides the following answer (written in 1980): Daly concludes by inviting all (most) people ‚Äî both liberal supporters of and radical critics of capitalism ‚Äî to join him in his effort to develop a steady-state economy.  Pushing some of the terrestrial limits into outer space  Ever since the beginning of the modern Space Age in the 1950s, space advocates have developed plans for colonising space in order to counter human overpopulation and mitigate ecological pressures on earth (if not for other reasons). specially designed cylinders in outer space In the 1970s, physicist and space activist Gerard K. O'Neill developed a large plan to build human settlements in outer space to solve the problems of overpopulation and limits to growth on earth without recourse to political repression. According to O'Neill's vision, mankind could ‚Äî and indeed should ‚Äî expand on this man-made frontier to many times the current world population and generate large amounts of new wealth in space. Herman Daly countered O'Neill's vision by arguing that a space colony would become subject to much harsher limits to growth ‚Äî and hence, would have to be secured and managed with much more care and discipline ‚Äî than a steady-state economy on large and resilient earth. Although the number of individual colonies supposedly could be increased without end, living conditions in any one particular colony would become very restricted nonetheless. Therefore, Daly concluded: \\"The alleged impossibility of a steady-state on earth provides a poor intellectual launching pad for space colonies.\\" By the 2010s, O'Neill's old vision of space colonisation had long since been turned upside down in many places: Instead of dispatching colonists from earth to live in remote space settlements, some ecology-minded space advocates conjecture that resources could be mined from asteroids in space and transported back to earth for use here. This new vision has the same double advantage of (partly) mitigating ecological pressures on earth's limited mineral reserves while also boosting exploration and colonisation of space. The building up of industrial infrastructure in space would be required for the purpose, as well as the establishment of a complete supply chain up to the level of self-sufficiency and then beyond, eventually developing into a permanent extraterrestrial source of wealth to provide an adequate return on investment for stakeholders. In the future, such an 'exo-economy' (off-planet economy) could possibly even serve as the first step towards mankind's cosmic ascension to a 'Type II' civilisation on the hypothetical Kardashev scale, in case such an ascension will ever be accomplished. Astronomically long distances and time scales are ever present in space However, it is yet uncertain whether an off-planet economy of the type specified will develop in due time to match both the volume and the output mix needed to fully replace earth's dwindling mineral reserves. Sceptics like Herman Daly and others point to exorbitant earth-to- orbit launch costs of any space mission, inaccurate identification of target asteroids suitable for mining, and remote in situ ore extraction difficulties as obvious barriers to success: Investing a lot of terrestrial resources in order to recover only a few resources from space in return is not worthwhile in any case, regardless of the scarcities, technologies and other mission parameters involved in the venture. In addition, even if an off-planet economy could somehow be established at some future point, one long-term predicament would then loom large regarding the continuous mining and transportation of massive volumes of materials from space back to earth: How to keep up that volume flowing on a steady and permanent basis in the face of the astronomically long distances and time scales ever present in space. In the worst of cases, all of these obstacles could forever prevent any substantial pushing of limits into outer space ‚Äî and then limits to growth on earth will remain the only limits of concern throughout mankind's entire span of existence.  Economic growth as a condition of military capability  The Center for the Advancement of the Steady State Economy (CASSE) mention on his site that the cold war was measured in GDP, and because of it was unsustainable referring to the book of Robert Collins, named: \\"More: The Politics of Economic Growth in Postwar America\\". The book is dealing with economic growth in the US in the time of the cold war and claim that it was due to the will of \\"pay for the arms build-up and proof of the superiority of the United States' market economy\\" In his book Guns, Germs, and Steel, Jared Diamond argue that surplus product, while linked with the creation of a ruling class and social stratification, create the possibility to labour division, what means that people could be specialized on warfare, making weapons, and this enabled the countries with more surplus product to conquest countries with less.  Implementation  Today, steady state economy is not implemented officially by any state, but there are some measures that limit growth and means a steady level of consumption of some products per capita: * Phase-out of lightweight plastic bags that reduce consumption of bags and limit the number of bags per capita. * Reducing the consumption of energy is a very popular measure implemented by many, called generally Energy Efficiency and Energy Saving. Coalition named \\"3% Club for Energy Efficiency\\" was formed with a target of increase energy efficiency by 3% per year. According to the International Energy Agency, Energy Efficiency can deliver more than 40% of the reduction in Greenhouse-gas emissions needed to reach the target of Paris Agreement. * In the 2019 UN Climate Action Summit was created a coalition named \\"Action Towards Climate Friendly Transport\\", its main targets include city planning that will reduce the need for transport and shifting to a non - motorized transport Such measures reduce the consumption of fuel. * A method with growing popularity is Reduce, reuse and recycle. For example, reuse clothes, through the second hand market and renting clothes. The second hand market worth 24 billion$ as of 2018 and is expected to achieve bigger profit than the fast fashion market in the next years. The H&M; company tries to implement it. Some countries accepted measurements, alternatives to Gross domestic product to measure success: * Bhutan measure success in Gross National Happiness. This measurement was implemented partly in other countries. * Other popular measurements include Gross National Well-being, Better Life Index and Social Progress Index (see pages). As of 2014, the Happy Planet Index is used in 153 countries, the OECD Better Life Index in 36 countries, members of OECD. * Ecuador and Bolivia included in their constitutions the ideology of Sumac Kawsay (Buen Vivir) that \\"incorporates ideas of de-growth\\", e.g. contain some principles of the steady state economy  See also  *History of economic thought *Classical economics *Ecological economics *Degrowth *Post-growth *The Limits to Growth *Prosperity Without Growth *Market failure: Ecological market failure *Environmentalism *Ecological footprint *Planetary boundaries *Sustainability: Carrying capacity *Human overpopulation *Jevons paradox *Peak minerals *Kenneth E.
